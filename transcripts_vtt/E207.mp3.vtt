00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Religion is about a lot more than God, and that is more visible in India than anywhere

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.080
[Amit Varma]: else.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.040
[Amit Varma]: I am a non-believer, and if belief in God was all there was to religion, then I could

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.280
[Amit Varma]: just ignore it.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.360
[Amit Varma]: But there's much more to it than that.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.360
[Amit Varma]: Religion can give people a sense of community, often even unity, and shapes, cultures and

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.160
[Amit Varma]: cuisines and art.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.200
[Amit Varma]: On the flip side, it can play to our worst tribalistic instincts and divide people, just

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.560
[Amit Varma]: as it can unite them.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.040
[Amit Varma]: I often say on the show that people contain multitudes, or India contains multitudes,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.280
[Amit Varma]: and when it comes to religion, this is actually more true of India than perhaps any other

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.640
[Amit Varma]: place in the world.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.080
[Amit Varma]: All the religions in the world exist here, even thrive here, and we have more gods and

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.080
[Amit Varma]: goddesses in India than even spices, and indeed, the one area that most reflects this incredible

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.140
[Amit Varma]: melting pot of a nation is our food.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.760
[Amit Varma]: And whether or not you believe in God, I think we can both agree that Indian food can be

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.560
[Amit Varma]: divine, and religion has played a part in that.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.760
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.760
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.760
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.040
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.440
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a prolific columnist and author, Shobha Narayan.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.960
[Amit Varma]: Shobha has just come out with a fascinating book called Food and Faith, A Pilgrim's Journey

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.060
[Amit Varma]: Through India.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.880
[Amit Varma]: In Food and Faith, Shobha travels to 15 places of worship in the subcontinent and writes

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.200
[Amit Varma]: about the food you get there.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is not just a book about travel or food, it's also about our history and our

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240
[Amit Varma]: society.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.920
[Amit Varma]: And it worked for me at multiple levels, mainly because the author's own explorations, her

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.480
[Amit Varma]: intellectual and emotional journey was so much a part of the writing.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.480
[Amit Varma]: I was delighted to have Shobha on the show, and we had a freewheeling conversation that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.840
[Amit Varma]: is as much about religion and Indian society as about food.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.000
[Amit Varma]: I found it in more ways than one to be a mouthwatering discussion.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.540
[Amit Varma]: Before we begin, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.680
[Amit Varma]: As many of you know, I'll soon be coming out with a four volume anthology of The Seen and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.320
[Amit Varma]: the Unseen books organized around the themes of politics, history, economics, and society

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.320
[Amit Varma]: and culture.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.640
[Amit Varma]: These days, I'm wading through over 3 million words of conversation from all my episodes

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.160
[Amit Varma]: so far to curate the best bits.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.080
[Amit Varma]: And for this to happen, I needed transcripts.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.560
[Amit Varma]: And that was made possible by a remarkable young startup called Tapchief.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.120
[Amit Varma]: Tapchief at tapchief.com is a digital platform that allows companies to outsource work to

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.840
[Amit Varma]: their network of freelancers.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.560
[Amit Varma]: And Tapchief's network includes more than 125,000 people as of now.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.240
[Amit Varma]: You want people to make you a webpage or design a logo or compose a jingle or do some digital

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.760
[Amit Varma]: marketing for you, Tapchief gives you an easy way to reach out to freelancers competing

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.840
[Amit Varma]: for your work.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.960
[Amit Varma]: I can say from firsthand experience how valuable this has been for me and solve the problem

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.040
[Amit Varma]: I was actually a bit worried about.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.300
[Amit Varma]: So do go over to tapchief.com and check out all that Tapchief has to offer.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.680
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they could solve your problem too.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.960
[Amit Varma]: Shobha, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.680
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for having me, Amit.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Shobha, I loved reading your superb book.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.040
[Amit Varma]: But before we kind of get to the book, I'm also sort of fascinated by your journey in

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.620
[Amit Varma]: the sense that I've read your column for many years in Mint and so on.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.800
[Amit Varma]: And whenever I read anything by you, I mean, the three things I would typically associate

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.680
[Amit Varma]: you with are food, travel and writing.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.400
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you write a lot about food and travel.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.640
[Amit Varma]: But you've also, you know, done journalism in Colombia and so on.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.960
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about your background and your sort of journey of, you know, living

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.680
[Amit Varma]: in different places in the world and how that affected what you do.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.120
[Guest]: I grew up in Chennai.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.560
[Guest]: And I was one of those kids who knew early on that I wanted to be a writer.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.960
[Guest]: Even while I was in college in Women's Christian College in Chennai, I used to write for the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.560
[Guest]: Indian Express and Aside.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.200
[Guest]: There was this wonderful magazine called Aside in Chennai, which was run by Janaki Venkatraman.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.360
[Guest]: Those days, there were no emails, so I walked up to her and said, Can I write for you?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.840
[Guest]: And she agreed.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.840
[Guest]: And I used to write columns occasionally for the Indian Express, which at that time was

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.360
[Guest]: edited by Rajmohan Gandhi.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.960
[Guest]: So very illustrious man, as you know.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.560
[Guest]: So as a college student, I wrote, as a school student, I wrote poetry.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.320
[Guest]: So I was one of those kids who just has written all her life.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.200
[Guest]: I took a detour in college, when I went abroad to complete my undergraduate, I studied art

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.880
[Guest]: and sculpture.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.080
[Guest]: And I have since developed an interest in that.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.660
[Guest]: I went to a women's college there, too, called Mount Holyoke, where I did art.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.720
[Guest]: And then after a master's in finance, I finally returned to journalism at the Columbia J School.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.040
[Guest]: It was a one year program.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.880
[Guest]: It was a boot camp in many words.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.300
[Guest]: You had to ride in the back of a police car to do police reporting.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.560
[Guest]: You had to go to the criminal courts to write about law and trials and things like that.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.160
[Guest]: But I have always been drawn to memoirs.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.280
[Guest]: And my first break in food writing came when the New York Times announced a competition.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.120
[Guest]: They took a half page ad and said, write 150 words about food.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.880
[Guest]: And if your essay is chosen by Ruth Reisel, who was then the restaurant critic of the

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.880
[Guest]: New York Times, we will give you a $1,000 coupon to use as you wish.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.640
[Guest]: So as an impoverished student, the appeal of getting $1,000 to dine in New York was

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.040
[Guest]: very irresistible.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.560
[Guest]: So I discovered, you know, writing 150 words and making an essay in that, in some ways

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.960
[Guest]: harder than writing 850 words, which is what you and I do for our letters and blogs and

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960
[Guest]: columns.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.120
[Guest]: So condensing a narrative in 150 words was difficult.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.120
[Guest]: I did it and I won the prize.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.760
[Guest]: I should have dug up the essay, which I could have read to you.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.600
[Guest]: But it was about India, 1986.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.000
[Guest]: I want to study in America, but my grandparents will not allow me.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.640
[Guest]: Finally, the elders decide that they will ask me to prepare a feast, one that they are

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.000
[Guest]: sure I will fail because I don't know cooking.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.400
[Guest]: And so I take up the challenge and then I describe the feast.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.360
[Guest]: And each line had, so there was the bindi roasted in oil with fennel seeds.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.040
[Guest]: And then there was the rasam piping hot with a sprinkling of coriander leaves on top.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:48.040
[Guest]: There was rice served with streams of mist on top and ghee, golden ghee.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.440
[Guest]: So essentially it was a practice in food writing, so the practice in describing food in a very

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.440
[Guest]: condensed way.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.520
[Guest]: So when I won the award, I got this $1,000 coupon, which I dined away.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.760
[Guest]: And Ruth Reichel, who went on from The Times to edit Gourmet, which is the late great gourmet,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.040
[Guest]: as I call it, she said, why don't you expand this 150 word essay and make it into 1,500

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.040
[Guest]: words?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.560
[Guest]: And that was how the food writing began.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.880
[Guest]: They called it The God of Small Feasts and it was published in Gourmet.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:26.400
[Guest]: And beginner's luck, it won this James Beard Award for the MFK Fisher Award for Distinguished

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.320
[Guest]: Food Writing was big.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.800
[Guest]: And that was how I first learned about MFK Fisher and I went on to read her book.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.760
[Guest]: And then just kept writing about food and wine, Bon Appetit, Gourmet while I was in

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.360
[Guest]: Manhattan and then moved to India and wrote about food as well for Mint.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.600
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's quite a mind blowing story and to do it in 150 words seems to me almost impossible.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.440
[Amit Varma]: Like when I teach my writing course, I often quote Blaise Pascal's famous quote about when

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.320
[Amit Varma]: he wrote a letter to someone and he said, you know, quote, apologies for sending you

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.320
[Amit Varma]: a long letter.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.080
[Amit Varma]: I did not have time to write you a short one, stop quote.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.960
[Amit Varma]: I think anyone who's ever written to a word count or a deadline knows exactly how hard

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960
[Amit Varma]: it is.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.640
[Amit Varma]: So and while you were describing it to me just now, you know, even though I just had

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.480
[Amit Varma]: my brunch, my mouth was kind of watering right away.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.680
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what is it that drew you to food writing in particular?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Like was it that this challenge came up and you liked food and you liked writing and you

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.760
[Amit Varma]: said that, okay, I'll, you know, combine these two and try it out?

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.600
[Amit Varma]: Or were you already reading food writers?

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.840
[Amit Varma]: If so, who were the writers, food writers and otherwise, who you really enjoyed and

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.320
[Amit Varma]: thought that they might, you know, shine a light on the kind of writing that you want

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.480
[Amit Varma]: to do?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.760
[Amit Varma]: So what was that process of evolving as a writer and, and then as a food writer, because

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.840
[Amit Varma]: it strikes me that, you know, when one starts writing about food, you will sort of begin

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.120
[Amit Varma]: by writing about the sensory experience of the food, the smells, the taste, the look

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.540
[Amit Varma]: of it, all of that.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.720
[Amit Varma]: But then you move on as indeed you have in this book, you move on to the wider cultural

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.560
[Amit Varma]: and social significances and the resonances that food carries.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.480
[Amit Varma]: So you know, was that there from the start or is that something that you kind of, that

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.480
[Amit Varma]: evolved within your writing as well?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.080
[Guest]: So Amit, as you know, there are two types of food writing.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.200
[Guest]: One is the writing of recipes and cookbooks and the other is the kind of work that I do.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.040
[Guest]: I'm not a good cook in my kitchen.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.440
[Guest]: And I stumbled on food writing, unlike writing in general, where I was one of those kids

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.440
[Guest]: who wrote.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.640
[Guest]: Food writing didn't come naturally to me.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.360
[Guest]: While in Chennai, I wrote about sabas and music and, you know, whatever the editor assigned

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360
[Guest]: me to do.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:48.240
[Guest]: Food writing literally was a break, a fortunate happenstance, a discovery of a skill that

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.880
[Guest]: I didn't know existed because all in pursuit of $1,000 of a food coupon.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.760
[Guest]: And since then, I have worked at it.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.360
[Guest]: I think food writing is different from cooking.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.260
[Guest]: I don't think the two are together.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.720
[Guest]: In order to write about food, you don't need to be a good cook.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.720
[Guest]: You need to have a good palate.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720
[Guest]: And as M.S.K.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.000
[Guest]: Fisher said, you need to have the capacity to eat prodigious amounts of food.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.240
[Guest]: And as you are eating it, to think about it, you need to have taste and you need to have

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240
[Guest]: good eye to observe.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:24.680
[Guest]: So Meenakshi Amal's classic book, Samaythi Paar, which every Tamilian has and carries

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.480
[Guest]: this three volumes, is a precision.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.600
[Guest]: It is about use of this particular type of rice cooked to this particular amount.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.920
[Guest]: And she even describes how you, the Tamil word is aathardhu, which means to make cool.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.680
[Guest]: There are ways in which you make cool before.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.920
[Guest]: For example, in Tamil cooking, there is a dish called beans paruppuursali, which is

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.320
[Guest]: beans in which you put the channaikkadal and you grind it and then you put it in.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.320
[Guest]: And then you steam it.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.680
[Guest]: And then she describes how you cool it.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.840
[Guest]: You put, I mean, in the olden days, my grandmother would put it out on a rice cloth, an old stone

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.920
[Guest]: dhoti and cool it.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.080
[Guest]: So that is a very precise type of Kubuk kind of observation, how you cool, how you cook,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.120
[Guest]: how long you cook and what is the smell that emanates when the idli is done.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:20.080
[Guest]: The kind of writing I do involves being, to quote Isaiah Berlin, the fox and the hedgehog,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.960
[Guest]: you need to have a wide spectrum, the surface area has to be quite large and you need to

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:32.840
[Guest]: be able to connect history and philosophy and feminism for me and sensuality and India.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.960
[Guest]: So that's what my kind of writing does.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:41.200
[Guest]: And how did I cultivate that skill is I think that reading a lot, as you say, I was introduced

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:49.480
[Guest]: after writing to all the big American writers and Katie Achaya is a must read if you are

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.840
[Guest]: an Indian food writer.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:57.600
[Guest]: I read Bikram Doctor's columns religiously, I read Harold McGee who wrote an encyclopedia

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.880
[Guest]: about food.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.920
[Guest]: And then, I mean, I have a long list.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.000
[Guest]: While in gourmet, one of the pleasures was to be exposed to food writers.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.720
[Guest]: So Fuchsia Dunlap's books on Chinese cooking is one that I read.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.360
[Guest]: Michael Pollan, of course, although now he's overused, everybody reads him.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:21.680
[Guest]: There's a wonderful book called The Man Who Ate Everything, written by Jeffrey Steingarten.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.980
[Guest]: He was the food columnist for Vogue.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.880
[Guest]: And he wrote this fantastic book of essays called The Man Who Ate Everything.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.680
[Guest]: And then in it, for example, he will take French fries, and he will conduct experiment

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.000
[Guest]: to see which is the best kind of French fry and how you make it.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.240
[Guest]: So those are that.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.640
[Guest]: I loved a book called Feast, the Food of the Islamic World by a woman called Anisa Helou.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.360
[Guest]: And if I'm pronouncing it right, and what was fantastic about that is as a vegetarian,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.160
[Guest]: you tend to basically keep away, I mean, you think that books that focus on non-vegetarian

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.840
[Guest]: food are not useful to you.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.480
[Guest]: But this book, for example, even though I don't eat meat kebab, she places them side

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.840
[Guest]: by side by side and then describes how a Turkish kebab is different from a Iranian kebab, from

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.880
[Guest]: an Iraqi, Iraq kebab in Iraq.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.880
[Guest]: And it was an experience of description of the kind that is very useful to me and of

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:23.040
[Guest]: history and milieu and stories and community and family and cooking.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.920
[Guest]: Cooking comes last in a way.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.360
[Guest]: So that was good.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.360
[Guest]: Then once you get into it, again, Vikram's columns will introduce me to Manasol Lhasa.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.520
[Guest]: These are Sanskrit texts from the old, K.P. Acharya talks about it a lot.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.560
[Guest]: So these are the things I read.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.760
[Guest]: And then there's an Indian book by Colleen Taylor Senner called Feasts and Fasts.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:51.440
[Guest]: That's a wonderful book because it anchors food history in India in a very scholarly

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.440
[Guest]: way.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:58.560
[Guest]: So for example, there are recipes for barbecued rat and there are recipes that basically convince

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.800
[Guest]: you that we were not the prudes that we have become in terms of our attitude towards animals,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:11.640
[Guest]: certainly the cow and our attitudes towards meat and our attitudes towards cooking and

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.520
[Guest]: this whole purity and non-purity that has invaded the Brahminical kitchen since.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.960
[Guest]: So that was good.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.560
[Guest]: So then I can give you a longer list if you like, but that's a start.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you've actually, you know, with this answer, you actually you said you can't

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.560
[Amit Varma]: cook, but you've provided a feast of reading for my listeners and for me, because I'm sure

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.480
[Amit Varma]: many of these books are now going to get gobbled up by us.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.760
[Amit Varma]: And of course, we share our admiration of Vikram Docter.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.760
[Amit Varma]: He's a good friend.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.440
[Amit Varma]: He's been on the show, in fact, talking about the Indianness of Indian food was the name

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.440
[Amit Varma]: of the episode.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.720
[Amit Varma]: And it was all about almost how everything that we consider Indian is from somewhere

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720
[Amit Varma]: else.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.680
[Amit Varma]: So I kind of have a question also about how writing about something can shape a person

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.720
[Amit Varma]: like at the obvious level, like this is again a sort of a two part question.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's really the same question, but two different directions.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.080
[Amit Varma]: And one is obviously that one would expect that when you begin writing about food, obviously

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.240
[Amit Varma]: your palate will get more refined because you will pay more attention and be more mindful

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.800
[Amit Varma]: about all the individual things that go into what you're eating and the processes and so

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800
[Amit Varma]: on.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.800
[Amit Varma]: So did that happen with you?

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.840
[Amit Varma]: And the second part is the kind of food writing that you have done would also then mean that

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.040
[Amit Varma]: you're not only expanding your palate, but you're also expanding your mind because you

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.280
[Amit Varma]: want to make these cultural connections, these social connections, historical connections,

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:38.920
[Amit Varma]: I would imagine that it then, you know, incentivizes you to read much more widely and almost in

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.800
[Amit Varma]: that sense and become a different person than who you would have been if you weren't a food

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.800
[Amit Varma]: writer.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.800
[Amit Varma]: Is there something to that?

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.280
[Guest]: The short answer, Amit, is that yes, it changed my palate.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.520
[Guest]: It changed my palate in a very specific way, it forced me to pay attention to what I was

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520
[Guest]: eating.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.520
[Guest]: You're just gobbling it up.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:01.480
[Guest]: So it also defined in sharp focus that I was losing a whole spectrum of taste because I

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.320
[Guest]: happened to be a vegetarian and I have not been able to eat meat or fish or chicken.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.360
[Guest]: A friend of mine said this best.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.800
[Guest]: He said, eat meat if you want to, just before you die, because then the amount of time that

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.880
[Guest]: you'll spend regretting will be the least.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.760
[Guest]: So that said, I realized that a spectrum is lost to me.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.080
[Guest]: But what I think what being vegetarian does is that it forces you to pay attention to

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.240
[Guest]: all the other flavors because you're losing out on something.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.600
[Guest]: So how do you eat is the question.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.840
[Guest]: How do you eat if you want to write about food?

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.400
[Guest]: And how do you take notes?

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.120
[Guest]: How do you keep mental notes?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.540
[Guest]: Very slowly, start by eating very slowly, start by savoring the food.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:46.840
[Guest]: And I think that restaurant menus, for example, I always read them because they give me a

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:53.280
[Guest]: way of, in India less so, but certainly in other countries, you can tell the chef's influence

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.920
[Guest]: on the menu in the way they have written it.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.520
[Guest]: So for example, braised, does he use the word boiled or braised potatoes?

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.160
[Guest]: Does he use the word sautéed, beans, or does he use stir fried?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.800
[Guest]: What is the taste difference between, I mean, just like computer technology has very specific

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.480
[Guest]: words, cooking has specific words.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.800
[Guest]: And the question I always face is that, is it reflected in the taste of the food?

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.360
[Guest]: Chinese food, for example, is entirely about braised, sautéed, vegetables, cabbage, but

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.800
[Guest]: take the fourth cabbage and do it four different ways and see how it tastes differently.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.200
[Guest]: The other thing I always pay attention to is the environment and restaurants are a great

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200
[Guest]: place for that.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:41.800
[Guest]: For example, in India, there is a notion that the chef or the cook's temperament matters,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.680
[Guest]: which is why if you go to Hare Krishna kitchens, or if you go to temple kitchens, they will

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:52.160
[Guest]: chant the Lord's name, for example, or there will be peaceful music playing in the background.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.720
[Guest]: Some of my grandparents' friends, they would not eat outside food because they said that,

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.160
[Guest]: in Tamil, we call it Yenna Padilgal, Yenna Padilgal means the thought stamp of the chef

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.160
[Guest]: matters and it will influence how you eat and it will influence your body.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.720
[Guest]: I have interviewed chefs in New York, you go into restaurant kitchens of Daniel Boulud

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.600
[Guest]: or John George, or it is a hellhole.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.320
[Guest]: People are screaming, people are cursing, the food that comes out is sublime.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.120
[Guest]: So that's the other thing is that the milieu matters.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.040
[Guest]: How does the chef's temperament get translated to the waiter who describes the food to us?

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.880
[Guest]: There's that whole chain and I pay attention to that and how does it, and the way what

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.200
[Guest]: people choose, I studied psychology in Women's Cuisine College as an undergraduate, there

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.680
[Guest]: was this very cool study where people would look at the menu and the first person, if

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.960
[Guest]: they call out what you want, you will sort of be forced to call out something else, even

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.080
[Guest]: if you actually wanted that dish to be different.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.800
[Guest]: So the psychology of ordering of food in restaurants or the psychology of eating is what I pay

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.800
[Guest]: attention to.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.160
[Guest]: History is a very obvious one, but that doesn't come in the act of eating.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.320
[Guest]: When the act of eating, it is about using the fork or the spoon, using the hand, the

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.400
[Guest]: tactility of the fingers, which is how we eat, the culture that invented chopsticks

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.920
[Guest]: and why did China invent chopsticks as opposed to the spoon?

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.360
[Guest]: So those are the kinds of questions you ponder while you are at the table.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.800
[Guest]: And I love eating at restaurants and because of all these things.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.240
[Guest]: The history comes afterwards.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:34.080
[Guest]: The history is not linked to a dish in my view, the history is linked to a cuisine.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.200
[Guest]: So the Middle East is fascinating to me because I think some of the best writers of Middle

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.600
[Guest]: Eastern cuisine are women, but it's such a male-centric culture.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.240
[Guest]: So how did that happen?

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.960
[Guest]: And then learning about, for example, there was a wonderful cookbook called the Syriana

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.200
[Guest]: Cookbook and by Latika George, I believe it was.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.600
[Guest]: And the Syrian Christian food is heavily fish-centric.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.640
[Guest]: I don't eat fish, but what you got out of that cookbook was the milieu of Syrian Christians

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.800
[Guest]: and as somebody who spent a lot of time in Kerala, it was a wonderful read for that reason.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:16.840
[Guest]: So to answer your question about palate cultivation, I think slowing down and paying attention,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.040
[Guest]: making connections as disparate as you can would be the three things I do in terms of

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:29.960
[Guest]: how it has expanded me is that the slowing down, paying attention, savoring, making disparate

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.520
[Guest]: connections force you to each of those has like a four-factor output, which forces you

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.960
[Guest]: to read four different types of books or come back and research for different types of things.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.960
[Amit Varma]: So that's what it is.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.960
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.880
[Amit Varma]: My other sort of observation about a lot of your writing is that in one sense, even when

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.240
[Amit Varma]: you're writing about food, it is like in this book, I got this sense and more senses and

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.680
[Amit Varma]: the fact that you just went to all these different sites, but that it's a travel book and it's

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.280
[Amit Varma]: not just a travel book in the sense that it is about travel.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.760
[Amit Varma]: It is your travel book in the sense that it is about your journey, not just your sort

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.760
[Amit Varma]: of physical journey through space, but also how you are evolving and changing.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, before I kind of get to the book, what I was wondering about was that you've lived

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.820
[Amit Varma]: in different countries at different parts of your life.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.840
[Amit Varma]: You have also written extensively about, you know, first settling into America, then, you

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.120
[Amit Varma]: know, coming back to India and settling in here.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.240
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that someone who travels like that, who is sort of, in a sense, I wouldn't

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.360
[Amit Varma]: say uprooted because these are all choices that you made, but someone who chooses to

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.720
[Amit Varma]: live somewhere else and then come back somewhere else is forced to do something that others

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.880
[Amit Varma]: who stay in one place are not, which is to constantly re-examine themselves, re-examine

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.760
[Amit Varma]: their sense of self, their self of identity, and all of that, which in the context of religion,

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.320
[Amit Varma]: obviously, there's a lot of in this book, which I'll ask you later.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.700
[Amit Varma]: But in a general sense, you know, what has that kind of exploration been like?

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.640
[Amit Varma]: Because it always strikes me that, you know, we always assume that individuals are what

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.600
[Amit Varma]: individuals are, right?

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.600
[Amit Varma]: As if it's, you know, you are a fixed person at a given point in time.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.240
[Amit Varma]: But the point is that, you know, if you had a different set of experiences, you would

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.180
[Amit Varma]: be a fundamentally different person.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.080
[Amit Varma]: How do you think all of this shaped you?

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, was it easy to settle into another culture?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.960
[Amit Varma]: How did it make you look at your own identity as an immigrant and as someone born a Hindu?

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, did it make you more open?

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:31.280
[Amit Varma]: Did it, you know, like some immigrants to the US, for example, become more assertive

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.360
[Amit Varma]: about their cultural roots and all of that?

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.280
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about how that journey happened for you.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.360
[Guest]: So the gift of being an immigrant is that you straddle two cultures or three cultures

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.920
[Guest]: all the time.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.680
[Guest]: And it forces you to compare which is a gift for a writer, because really writing is about

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.440
[Guest]: the best way to illustrate what you want to say to your reader, as you just did with Blaise

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.840
[Guest]: Pascal, is to compare or show the other.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:02.920
[Guest]: The cost of being an immigrant is that you are always a Trishanku, you don't have roots.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.440
[Guest]: So that is broadly been my life.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:13.000
[Guest]: And I think it's helpful for me, because I grew up, till I moved to America at age 20,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.800
[Guest]: I was a Chennai girl.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.800
[Guest]: And as I know, from your previous podcast, but the Krisha show, for example, Chennai

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.600
[Guest]: is a very rooted city, it is conservative, it used to be when I was growing up, but that

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.400
[Guest]: was a gift, because it forced it gave you a certain set of parameters that were unchanging

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.280
[Guest]: and that you thought was true for the rest of the world.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:38.320
[Guest]: So you go from that to America, where I lived for the next 18 years, or 18 years, Chennai,

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.120
[Guest]: 18 years America, where I was moving all around.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:48.680
[Guest]: So I sometimes wonder, Amit, I went as a fresh off the board person and landed in Massachusetts

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.480
[Guest]: in a very liberal college.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.000
[Guest]: And as a result, I became a Democrat by philosophy.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.760
[Guest]: And I was just thinking, had I landed in Memphis or Georgia, would my philosophy and politics

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.960
[Guest]: have become Republican?

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.480
[Guest]: I have no answer to that.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.360
[Guest]: But I think those are the kinds of questions that I asked is that, am I a democratic?

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.360
[Guest]: Am I liberal?

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.360
[Guest]: Because of where I landed.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.840
[Guest]: And I think what happens when you are hungry to leave your hometown as I was, Chennai,

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.840
[Guest]: it was stifling to me, because I grew up in a fairly large family where everybody had

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.920
[Guest]: an opinion about how much oil I should put in my hair and how long the hair should be,

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:34.240
[Guest]: what I should eat, how I should dress, so I was ready to just flee.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:44.200
[Guest]: And when you go and land as a tabula rasa, which I was, and so open, the influences,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.320
[Guest]: you're like a child, you're like an infant, and the influences, they shape you and as

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.240
[Guest]: they shaped me.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:25:01.360
[Guest]: I think my deep-rooted, sort of reflexive, taking up for the underdog, whoever the underdog

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.200
[Guest]: is of the moment, comes from my time in Massachusetts, which is very liberal and democratic and has

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.360
[Guest]: a strong social conscience.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:17.640
[Guest]: My liberal politics, feminism, Mount Holyoke is one of the Seven Sisters.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:23.760
[Guest]: So I went from a mother who said a woman is like a creeper, and you have to sort of creep

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:30.040
[Guest]: and bind yourself to your new family, to this place where feminism was argued, and I am

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.040
[Guest]: a feminist.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:38.600
[Guest]: So I think for anyone who leaves home, whether within a country, like a lot of my friends

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:45.360
[Guest]: in Bangalore have come from the north or a different country, it forces you to take your

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.200
[Guest]: parents and your family and your community off that pedestal and see them for the people

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.120
[Guest]: with clay feet, people you love, but people with clay feet that they are, and it forces

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:01.520
[Guest]: you to question everything, and I think that is the point of going away from home.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.080
[Guest]: And some of us take advantage of it, as I did, and some of us don't, and I think we

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.080
[Guest]: fear it.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.080
[Guest]: We fear the change.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.000
[Guest]: So a lot of Indians who went to America in the 60s and 70s became more Indian and became

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.120
[Guest]: more encapsulated within their culture, and I wasn't like that.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.840
[Guest]: I didn't see the point of living abroad if you were not.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:29.040
[Guest]: And being an artist helped, so my friends were gay people.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:35.680
[Guest]: My closest friend was a lesbian who colored her hair purple, so okay, so if you don't

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:41.720
[Guest]: take the art, then it's no matter, but I think once you have a family, then there's a tendency

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:47.280
[Guest]: to go inward and kind of freeze yourself when you left India.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.000
[Guest]: That's what happens to a lot of Americans.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.960
[Guest]: After that, I moved to Singapore, which is a different sort of experience.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.200
[Guest]: Singapore was a bubble.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.440
[Guest]: It had the gift of three fantastic cooking cultures, which was the Arab cooking, the

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.120
[Guest]: Chinese cooking, and the Indian cooking.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.680
[Guest]: So it had that, but other than that, living in Singapore as an immigrant was a bubble

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.440
[Guest]: life, and then I had a choice of moving to Chennai or Bangalore, but my husband could

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.440
[Guest]: not stand Chennai summers or the heat, so we ended up in Bangalore, which is a very

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:28.000
[Guest]: gentle, welcoming city, which is a city of immigrants, so I'm happy that I landed here.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.160
[Guest]: So I think that being an immigrant forces you to examine and question constantly, which

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:41.240
[Guest]: is a state of dissatisfaction, really, most of your time, and for a person to live with

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.520
[Guest]: that angst is not a happy thing, but it helps with the writing.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.800
[Amit Varma]: I'll take a detour here and point out something that I loved about your book, which is that

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.880
[Amit Varma]: it's full of so many light touches, it's got a conversational tone, and I was just reminded

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.700
[Amit Varma]: of that when you mentioned having gay friends and a lesbian friend, and there's a delightful

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:05.600
[Amit Varma]: anecdote in your book about how your lesbian friend was once accosted by another girl who

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.000
[Amit Varma]: wanted to convert her to Christianity and said, why don't you come out and talk with

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.280
[Amit Varma]: me for a couple of minutes, and your friend told that girl that I'll come out with you,

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.280
[Amit Varma]: but here's the thing, you know, either you'll save my soul or I'll seduce you.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:22.640
[Amit Varma]: So I found that so kind of delightful, and your book is full of these light, charming

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.880
[Amit Varma]: moments that, you know, make a person LOL, so despite, you know, if any of my listeners

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.040
[Amit Varma]: are not interested in either food or faith, you can still have fun.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.720
[Amit Varma]: So that's sort of your third F there for you.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.480
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of now go closer to the book, like, you know, you've described this book as a

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.080
[Amit Varma]: book about Hinduism written by a skeptical Hindu.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.960
[Amit Varma]: Now before we talk about the book and about Hinduism, I want to talk about the skeptical

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.240
[Amit Varma]: Hindu, you know, in your afterward, you write about how quote, religion is an inheritance

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.520
[Amit Varma]: and a choice, stop quote.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.920
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting how it shifts from one to the other for you, like you've written

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.600
[Amit Varma]: about how as a teenager, you were an atheist, then agnostic in your 20s and 30s.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.120
[Amit Varma]: And you turn to religion again, you know, later in life, so much so that in the introduction

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.840
[Amit Varma]: of this book, you wrote, quote, it defines who I am, perhaps not as much as feminism,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.600
[Amit Varma]: and certainly not as much as being a writer or a mother, stop quote.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.200
[Amit Varma]: And this turns to unpack here.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.560
[Amit Varma]: But I'll just ask you about religion and per se that, you know, what has been the role

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.520
[Amit Varma]: of religion in your life?

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.480
[Amit Varma]: And what's kind of, you know, just as you've made a physical homecoming by, you know, settling

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.360
[Amit Varma]: in India, it seems that your journey with regards to religion is also, you know, gradually

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.280
[Amit Varma]: come that kind of circle do not fully.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.040
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about the role religion has played in your life and the different

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.600
[Amit Varma]: ways in which you think about it.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:46.320
[Guest]: So my mother is what is called a Sri Vidya Upasaka, by which I mean she was, it's a feminine

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.320
[Guest]: goddess cult.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:54.640
[Guest]: So I grew up with this, Amit, I grew up in a home, which was, she became this after my

00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:00.080
[Guest]: brother and I left home, she said she caught hold of religion when her children left home.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.800
[Guest]: Actually, that is a trajectory that many people will follow, because most people take to religion

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.200
[Guest]: when they get older.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.840
[Guest]: I am similar in that.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.960
[Guest]: So I'm not and the bell-shaped curve, I'm sort of in the middle.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.320
[Guest]: In terms of the usefulness of religion, a long time ago, maybe two decades ago, there

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:23.240
[Guest]: was a cover story in Time magazine about religion and it made this case about how people who

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.080
[Guest]: had faith and it was largely Christian faith, because Time magazine was for the Western

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.080
[Guest]: world.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.760
[Guest]: And there was a whole slew of benefits that were listed out, you will have better marriages,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.720
[Guest]: you will have better health, you will have better relationships within the community,

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.720
[Guest]: your immunity will be higher.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.040
[Guest]: And again, these are narratives that keep coming up now, they say, if you keep a gratitude

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.560
[Guest]: journal, you will have this, this and this and this.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.640
[Guest]: But I remember I was not part of the self-help genre, I was not paying attention to that.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.400
[Guest]: So this really sort of caught me out of the blue and said, my God, if Time magazine says

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.200
[Guest]: religion is so great, I better start looking at it.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.640
[Guest]: And I shelved it away and I just didn't pay attention.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.120
[Guest]: But so you have two strands.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.560
[Guest]: One is because perhaps because my mother was so deeply spiritual, I sort of rebelled against

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.760
[Guest]: it.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.920
[Guest]: And then intellectually seeing the benefit of faith.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.840
[Guest]: But then faith, as I have come to learn, is a self-experience.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.760
[Guest]: It's not a cerebral experience, it is a visceral experience.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.400
[Guest]: And I don't, I'm not there yet.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.600
[Guest]: I think it would be wonderful to have that visceral experience where monks in the Kumbh

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:37.560
[Guest]: Mela have experienced transcendence, when they see the Ganga, they just, I mean, and

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:45.320
[Guest]: here we are saying, you know, in California, drugs have become legal.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.400
[Guest]: Imagine if you can achieve that without drugs.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.760
[Guest]: So that's what religion did for you.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.280
[Guest]: And I've seen it time and time again in India.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:59.280
[Guest]: Now, okay, so let's say I've come to a point where I admit faith as a, as an idea into

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.280
[Guest]: my life.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.280
[Guest]: Which faith?

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:07.760
[Guest]: Buddhism and Hinduism are both seductive to me, monotheistic faiths don't attract me as

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760
[Guest]: much.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.920
[Guest]: Hinduism is a marvelous faith because of, it is a faith that still has not given up

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:20.280
[Guest]: its very ancient animistic roots, where rocks are worshipped, where trees, we have sacred,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.760
[Guest]: Nandita Krishna has written this wonderful book on sacred trees and sacred groves.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:31.600
[Guest]: You know, we are original tree huggers, we are the original rock worshippers and river

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.600
[Guest]: worshippers.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:39.920
[Guest]: And that connects us not just to our own Vedic past, but to past in Egypt, where, you know,

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.200
[Guest]: the pyramids were built.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.200
[Guest]: My father passed away recently and the death ceremonies that surround an Indian death are

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.800
[Guest]: very similar to sending off a pharaoh to the next life.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:58.920
[Guest]: So we sent my father off with a cow image, with an umbrella, with slippers, with clothes,

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.680
[Guest]: with his favorite food.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.680
[Guest]: I think that's so wonderful.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:09.020
[Guest]: The rituals that I disdained as a child are so meaningful to me now that we are living

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:14.040
[Guest]: more and more in a world where we are, our life is shorn of meaning.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:20.480
[Guest]: Life has been the vestiges of the rituals that connected us to milestones.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:27.080
[Guest]: You know, African cultures, when a man reached a certain age would send them off to the hunt

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.800
[Guest]: and they would have these markings and tattoos on it.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.560
[Guest]: We still have that, but we have forgotten them.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:40.680
[Guest]: So if you admit faith as essential to your well-being, as I have come to believe, then

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.360
[Guest]: you have to choose your faith.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.140
[Guest]: And as an adult, you can.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.480
[Guest]: And I chose the faith that I was born into.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.200
[Guest]: I haven't found enough to give it up.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.280
[Guest]: And I like the fact that there are women goddesses, there aren't too many faiths in which there

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.280
[Guest]: are women goddesses.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.240
[Guest]: I think that was a key element, which makes me like Hinduism.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.560
[Guest]: And I specifically like the Hinduism of the left-handed path, as my mother would call

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.880
[Guest]: it, which is there in Bengal, which is there in Kerala, which is there in Nepal, when I

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.880
[Guest]: went to see the goddess.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.760
[Guest]: The left-handed goddess tantric, it embraces what Carl Jung calls the shadow, which is

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.840
[Guest]: the quote-unquote, the so-called bad parts of yourself, the things that you suppress.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:28.320
[Guest]: It embraces sacrifice, animal sacrifice, it embraces blood, wine, madhu, the goddess drinks

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.640
[Guest]: blood and wine.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:36.080
[Guest]: It embraces all the things that have been sanitized out of, you know, the, how should

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.280
[Guest]: we call it, the middle path Hinduism.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.600
[Guest]: So I like the left-handed path.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.840
[Guest]: I like Chinnamasta, the tantric goddess who cut off her head and dances on corpses.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.480
[Guest]: So the reason to embrace faith is intellectual for me.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:56.280
[Guest]: The reason to embrace Hinduism is the marvelous variety and the fact that I am interested

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:03.440
[Guest]: in Carl Jung and dreams and transcendence and how to end the whole, you know, marijuana,

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.880
[Guest]: if you have to say it, and effects of it thereof.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.560
[Guest]: And the fact that people in Bangalore are missing.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.760
[Guest]: One of the most interesting things that I've attended recently is a firewalking ceremony.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.040
[Guest]: And if you like, we can talk about that.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we'll come back to it.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.200
[Amit Varma]: There's so much to unpack here and this is what kind of fascinates me about everything

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.600
[Amit Varma]: that you've just said and which you've written about in your book is this notion of faith

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.880
[Amit Varma]: of the instrumental qualities of faith, where you point out that, you know, like you point

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.840
[Amit Varma]: to the Time magazine article that it can help us lead more fulfilled lives and we are happier

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:45.240
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth, thereby pointing out how, you know, faith is useful.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, faith is important because it is useful.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.600
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't matter if it's true or not, as long as it's useful.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.280
[Amit Varma]: And this brings me to a very interesting thought because I often get semantic about, you know,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.480
[Amit Varma]: atheism and agnostic people think of them as separate points on a continuum.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.680
[Amit Varma]: But you can actually be atheist and agnostic at the same time because atheism has to do

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.280
[Amit Varma]: with belief and an atheist is someone who has an absence of belief.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.080
[Amit Varma]: He doesn't believe that there's no God.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.880
[Amit Varma]: There's simply an absence of belief, you know, much as, you know, not collecting stamps is

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880
[Amit Varma]: not a hobby.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.920
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, it's not a belief itself.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.920
[Amit Varma]: It's an absence.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.640
[Amit Varma]: And while atheism deals with belief, agnosticism deals with knowledge.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:26.040
[Amit Varma]: And what it means is an agnostic holds a position that you cannot know whether there is a God

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040
[Amit Varma]: or not.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.120
[Amit Varma]: There is epistemic humility.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.840
[Amit Varma]: So it is possible to be both an atheist and an agnostic if you look at it technically

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:37.000
[Amit Varma]: because you can both not believe and at the same time accept that there are some things

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.280
[Amit Varma]: you cannot know.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.400
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting addition to that is that besides being an atheist and an agnostic,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.080
[Amit Varma]: you can now be a person of faith also because without believing and accepting that you cannot

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.760
[Amit Varma]: know, you can still embrace faith because of the utility it has in your life.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that sense that you're part of a community, the comfort that you get from

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.560
[Amit Varma]: these rituals and traditions, I mean, in fact, it again, just thinking aloud, it reminds

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:08.520
[Amit Varma]: me of a book by Steven Landsberg called The Big Questions, in which he says that most

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.680
[Amit Varma]: people who profess to believe in God actually don't believe in God.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, they say they believe, but if it comes to the crunch, you know, so again, I

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.720
[Amit Varma]: mean, it seems to be coming from the way of thinking that, hey, religion is useful even

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.480
[Amit Varma]: if it isn't true.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.160
[Amit Varma]: So what's your sense of, you know, you've been to all these places, you mingled with

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:32.000
[Amit Varma]: all these religious people in the sense of this kind of balance between usefulness and

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.200
[Amit Varma]: belief.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.800
[Guest]: What are your observations?

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.280
[Guest]: So I both agree and disagree with Karl Marx's statement about religion being the opiate

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.240
[Guest]: of the masses or the opium of the masses.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.240
[Guest]: He was right.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:51.160
[Guest]: It is actually, it has the benefit that of comfort and other worldliness that a drug

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.160
[Guest]: gives.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:58.920
[Guest]: But what touched me was the way a devotee, the truly faithful, deals with God has nothing

00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.920
[Guest]: to do with mass.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.440
[Guest]: It's a very particular thing.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.040
[Guest]: You know, I saw women in Palani doing Anga Pradashnam, where you roll around the temple

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:12.600
[Guest]: and saying Muruga, Muruga, and it was her, from her face, from her demeanor, from the

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:18.520
[Guest]: supplicancy with which she rolled, and from the eyes, which were tuned in with God, she

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.920
[Guest]: was not paying attention to the surroundings.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:26.600
[Guest]: You could tell the fervor with which she believed that if she did this particular thing, that

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.680
[Guest]: her problem, whatever that specific problem was, whether it was son or a daughter being

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.240
[Guest]: sick would be solved.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:39.720
[Guest]: So it is a connection, this sort of connection, I envy, you know, and I saw this countless

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720
[Guest]: times.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.400
[Guest]: I mean, mostly in South Indian temples, because I could tune in very quickly to the nuances

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.400
[Guest]: of it.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:52.280
[Guest]: So you go to Ambalapura, the palpaisam was made for the God, and the priest would go

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:58.000
[Guest]: out every day and call out Vasudeva, Vasudeva three times.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.160
[Guest]: And you're calling as if you're calling your son who is playing in the cricket field, and

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.080
[Guest]: I know you're writing a book on cricket to come back.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:13.240
[Guest]: So it is a, it is a feat of imagination, and the word that is used by my mother is bhavna,

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.120
[Guest]: bhavana in Tamil.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:21.000
[Guest]: So okay, so assume you're a skeptic like I am, why not cultivate faith just to improve

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.360
[Guest]: your imagination is the question I have.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.520
[Guest]: I mean, I think there are many ways to do it, the art of drawing, there are books about

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:34.720
[Guest]: it, how to, and there are lots of people in the West who've made a fortune by teaching

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:40.040
[Guest]: you how to cultivate your creativity, but rituals are a great way where you can look

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:45.840
[Guest]: at a grain of rice and see a universe, you look at a stone and see the Shiva, the destroyer

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.720
[Guest]: of the universe, you hold the Nataraja pose in your Bharatanatyam, and then you become

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.320
[Guest]: that goddess as so many Bharatanatyam dances in Chennai demonstrate.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.840
[Guest]: And the best Kathak, as my friend Madhu Nataraj in Bangalore tells me, some of the finest

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.200
[Guest]: Kathak choreographies or the creations were done by a Muslim Nawab, who pretended he was

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.160
[Guest]: Krishna and or Radha.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:13.840
[Guest]: So these are feats, flights of fancy that will help you no matter what area of life

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.120
[Guest]: that you would like to be part of.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:21.920
[Guest]: So there are two things I find that religion is about, you take it all down, so one is

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:27.480
[Guest]: bhavna or imagination, the other is sharanagati or self-surrender, self-surrender has to do

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:33.280
[Guest]: with, it's not about giving up on free will, it is about applying for a job at Apple or

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.000
[Guest]: Microsoft doing the best you can, and then you know having this faith which Ramanujan

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.320
[Guest]: the mathematical genius had is that something is beyond my spectrum that will help me, and

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:51.360
[Guest]: devotees have that, and usually they are down and out, usually somebody is sick, it is visiting

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:58.200
[Guest]: a temple is, if you see, if you go beyond the praying and everything, it is about being

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:04.320
[Guest]: caught in a quagmire of hopes and dreams, you stand in the temple, in any temple and

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:10.760
[Guest]: you're surrounded by murmuring people, and it's as if you are in a cloud of dream, fear

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.920
[Guest]: and hope, and they've all come to this one place to solve it, to solve their problems,

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.640
[Guest]: and if you are a feeling person like me, you will feel that, and then that's the transition

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:27.200
[Guest]: from cerebral to visceral, when and I truly believe what Diana said in all her books about

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:35.320
[Guest]: the sea of the yatra, yatra is a crossing, and the more you go, more you subjugate yourself,

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:42.280
[Guest]: the more you get rid of this ego mind, and get into the feeling mind, you will be touched,

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.360
[Guest]: and as I was, and it is a privilege to be touched in that way.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.080
[Amit Varma]: And I'm very sort of intrigued by the role of both rituals and food in that, I mean food

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.920
[Amit Varma]: of course is a part of some rituals also, but you know, deep associations with each

00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.560
[Amit Varma]: of these places, and we'll kind of talk about some of them, but what it kind of again strikes

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.520
[Amit Varma]: me is that, you know, again when I teach my writing course to go back to that, I'll often

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:10.180
[Amit Varma]: tell the people who participate that if you want to, you know, one useful hack in terms

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.920
[Amit Varma]: of building a routine is build a ritual around your writing.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, in the sense that you get up at the same time, you make a cup of coffee,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.960
[Amit Varma]: you sit at the same place, you listen to the same playlist, and you're more likely to get

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.480
[Amit Varma]: into the writing groove.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And the reason for that is actually a scientific one, you know, neurologists would say neurons

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.100
[Amit Varma]: that fire together wire together.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.200
[Amit Varma]: So when these things kind of come together, they can work together.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.160
[Amit Varma]: And it seems that there is a deep truth there, which religion hit upon, because you have

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.760
[Amit Varma]: all of these things coming together, you have ritual coming together, you have food coming

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.720
[Amit Varma]: together, you have, you know, certain ways of doing things, different customs in different

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:50.240
[Amit Varma]: places like the Sufis in Ajmer may, you know, whirl and do all of those things, you have

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.000
[Amit Varma]: these separate, distinct rituals.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.800
[Amit Varma]: And it therefore strikes me that it doesn't really matter whether there is a God or not,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.280
[Amit Varma]: or whether you know what the religion holds out as facts are true or not.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.640
[Amit Varma]: What is true is that all of these, they can come together and they can kind of put you

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:10.040
[Amit Varma]: in a particular state of mind, which can, as you so eloquently put it, make the whole

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.040
[Amit Varma]: experience visceral.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.600
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I was going to ask you earlier when you were talking about how food can be affected

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.600
[Amit Varma]: by how it's presented and everything around it.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've mentioned at one point in your book that if you were asked, you know,

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:26.200
[Amit Varma]: if you had one meal to have before you left the planet, what would you have?

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.240
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned breakfast in Haridwar, especially their samosas.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.640
[Amit Varma]: Do you think part of the reason that food tasted so good to you is everything that was

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.280
[Amit Varma]: around it as well?

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:43.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, so are all these things also part of religion, that religion is not just about

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:49.120
[Amit Varma]: the bland fact of there being a God and everything associated with that, but all of these local

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.920
[Amit Varma]: things also play a part in that?

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.160
[Guest]: 100% Amit.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:58.720
[Guest]: I think that this is why they say when we offer it to the God, we call it Naivedyam

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.760
[Guest]: and it becomes Prasadam or Prasad after the God has blessed it.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:08.120
[Guest]: And 100% I believe the taste of the food, the divinity associated with it, the feeling

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:14.160
[Guest]: that what you are having is the God's blessing contributes to your well-being.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:20.200
[Guest]: So I actually, after these trips of mine, I'm a little, I have started looking at this

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:25.080
[Guest]: notion of the energy around the food, energy around the cook a little bit more carefully,

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.480
[Guest]: haven't come to a conclusion yet, but I actually think there is something to the fact what

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:34.280
[Guest]: we Hindus have discovered in India and what the faithful have discovered in every state

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:41.440
[Guest]: is that the milieu surrounding the food and its preparation matter and it makes a difference.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:47.080
[Guest]: And it is a subtle difference, perhaps we have lost the art of recognizing it, but I

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:52.440
[Guest]: have come to believe there is a difference and I am trying in small ways to figure out

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.640
[Guest]: experiments to figure out that difference.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.080
[Guest]: But I wanted to add, I'm sure if you haven't done this already for your students, the Paris

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.800
[Guest]: Review interviews, which are available online for free, I'm sure you know them, but they

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.560
[Guest]: are great examples of the routines and superstitions that writers develop.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:17.000
[Guest]: And one that stuck to my mind was of Ernest Hemingway, of course, is the great one who

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.640
[Guest]: wrote and when the writing was good, he would stop and then go out drinking and come back

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640
[Guest]: the next day and work.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.880
[Guest]: But the other one was, I think Dan Brown got these shoes that were anti-gravity shoes and

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:33.480
[Guest]: would sort of hang on the ceiling upside down as a writing ritual routine.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.440
[Guest]: But that was for your students.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.720
[Guest]: And yeah, and I think I've answered your other question about that.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I know.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.720
[Amit Varma]: That's fantastic.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I do cite the Writers at Work series, as you know, the Paris Review interviews were

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.720
[Amit Varma]: called to my students, I talk about the Hemingway interview also, because he said some really

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.640
[Amit Varma]: interesting things in that I haven't read the Dan Brown interview, but I now will.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.080
[Amit Varma]: And this is probably a good time then to, you know, before we get down to the book,

00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:02.160
[Amit Varma]: to talk about the craft of writing, like you are someone who's been a prolific columnist,

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.160
[Amit Varma]: you've kind of written all these years, you've also written a bunch of books.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.520
[Amit Varma]: So what is kind of the process like?

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.640
[Amit Varma]: What is the column process like?

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.840
[Amit Varma]: Do you face writer's block?

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.440
[Amit Varma]: Do you have hacks to deal with it?

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, how has you know, looking back over the years, how has sort of your craft

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.520
[Amit Varma]: evolved and the way you approach?

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, let's talk about columns first, you know, can you can you give me some insight

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.360
[Amit Varma]: on that?

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.600
[Guest]: So I'll go from the details to the broader one.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.960
[Guest]: I actually believe in Hemingway's words, kill your darlings.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:40.160
[Guest]: So then if you write a paragraph that you're very proud of, you need to look at it again.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.420
[Guest]: And you need to kill your darling, by which he meant that when you fall in love with your

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.920
[Guest]: own writing, examine it with a little bit more critical eyes.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:53.280
[Guest]: I also small things like don't use the same word in the same paragraph or within two or

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.280
[Guest]: three sentences.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:59.760
[Guest]: The thesaurus should be your best friend, because you it will actually force you to

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.760
[Guest]: look at.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.120
[Guest]: So if you're struggling for a word, look at it in thesaurus, it would it may enlighten

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.240
[Guest]: you on how to actually present it.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:11.520
[Guest]: The beginning and the end are the most important aspects of a column, especially the end because

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.760
[Guest]: ideally, in this age of soundbite, think about coming up with a soundbite or one line soundbite

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.400
[Guest]: which encapsulates your column, that will be probably the most important sentence, right?

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.240
[Guest]: Like a poker player, don't reveal your hand all at once.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.840
[Guest]: So a New York Times editor once told me that in the first paragraph, you're pretty much

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.960
[Guest]: written the whole essay, don't reveal your hand so much.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.000
[Guest]: So do it gradually to do a little bit of zigzag to maintain the tension.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.160
[Guest]: These are the things that all of us learn once you do it enough.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:46.000
[Guest]: As far as my column, Raju Narasetty, who is known to both of us, described my column.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.720
[Guest]: He was my first editor and he said it is being using the small everyday act to come up with

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:53.720
[Guest]: a big picture.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:58.400
[Guest]: So that has been sort of how I approach column writing where you use simple things to come

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.080
[Guest]: up with a bigger philosophical, whether it's philosophical or a larger picture.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.140
[Guest]: And that's how that's how I think and that's how I look view the column.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.560
[Guest]: What do I do for that?

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.720
[Guest]: So there are many kinds of columnists.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.760
[Guest]: You are one who links events to philosophy.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:21.200
[Guest]: I am not an event to philosophy person, partially because I'm not a politics junkie like so

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.560
[Guest]: many columnists are in this country.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:29.320
[Guest]: I am much more of a everyday thing, small things, linking it to bigger truth.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.020
[Guest]: So that in that itself, there are two types of columnists.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:37.080
[Guest]: If you would like to be Amit Verma type of columnist, I have no words for you.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:43.480
[Guest]: If you would like to be a sort of a humorous, a little bit playful, again, what I said about

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:49.400
[Guest]: seeing the universe in a grain of sand type of columnist, I would say, first of all, when

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:54.880
[Guest]: you stand in a line, don't look at your smartphone, talk to people around you, whether when you're

00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:02.360
[Guest]: going to buy fruit, try your best not to use after COVID, stop ordering on Amazon, actually

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:08.400
[Guest]: go out to your Monday and find people, because in order to write about life, as I do, you

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.080
[Guest]: have to engage with life.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:14.040
[Guest]: And more and more these days, it's become very easy to sit at home and look at the computer

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.160
[Guest]: all day.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.760
[Guest]: And the problem with that is that you won't get flashes of insight, which only come when

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.720
[Guest]: you're bored, when your mind is idle.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.320
[Guest]: And you have to force yourself to give yourself that moment of idleness when you're not checking

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.320
[Guest]: your smartphone.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.600
[Guest]: So I don't, I, for example, some, a few things I have done, I removed Facebook, Twitter,

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:39.920
[Guest]: all from my phone, I go through last phases of the month, when I disengage email, which

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.560
[Guest]: is easy to do if you have a smartphone, I mute WhatsApp messages.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.880
[Guest]: So notifications, muting is a very important thing.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:48.880
[Guest]: I love my phone.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.960
[Guest]: So if you're addicted to checking your phone, as I am, at least mute the notifications,

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.480
[Guest]: whenever possible, forget your phone at home when you go out.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.400
[Guest]: So these are ways in which you engage with the present when you engage with people, talking

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.960
[Guest]: to people is a good one.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.560
[Guest]: Try to compartmentalize your life, so that you're writing time, do the Pomodoro, I use

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.360
[Guest]: the Pomodoro technique, which is 20 minutes without surfing the internet and stuff like

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.360
[Guest]: that.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:18.840
[Guest]: I used to have an app called Freedom, which is installed, where you basically shuts off

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.440
[Guest]: your computer and you can't open Chrome and nothing will happen.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.880
[Guest]: So I have been known to do that.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.280
[Guest]: Essentially the way I write a column and I did a weekly column for Mint was that be on

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.120
[Guest]: the lookout for an idea that is somewhat topical, because nobody cares about so essentially,

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.320
[Guest]: have attention for festivals that come up, have some notion of what's going on in the

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.320
[Guest]: world.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.840
[Guest]: And tangentially be on the lookout for that idea.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:49.720
[Guest]: And usually the idea would percolate, I would make notes longhand on A4 paper.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:53.120
[Guest]: And because you're on deadline, I would sit down to write the column and pretty much finish

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.800
[Guest]: it in the span of a day, 800 words is easy to do in a span of a day, if you have enough

00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.800
[Guest]: notes.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:05.040
[Guest]: Sometimes there were times when there would be writer's block, but one study actually

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.040
[Guest]: helped me.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:12.680
[Guest]: Study was examining the words of people who were forced to write and the words of people

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.200
[Guest]: who wrote when the muse was sitting on their shoulder.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.720
[Guest]: So basically it got the control group of say 50 people and said, okay, right.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.880
[Guest]: And then control the experimental group of 50 people who were told, okay, write when

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.720
[Guest]: you have the urge to write.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.400
[Guest]: And the output was, there was no difference.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:32.960
[Guest]: So I said, you know, I don't feel like writing, this is bad writing, all the negative narratives

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.520
[Guest]: that come into your head.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.800
[Guest]: You just, I used to think of that study and said, you know what?

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:42.960
[Guest]: I may think this is stupid and bad, but the output when people look at it, guess what?

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.480
[Guest]: The study said there'll be no difference.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.120
[Guest]: So that's how I forced myself to write.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:52.900
[Guest]: So I think attention is the most important thing a writer has.

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:58.400
[Guest]: What you train your attention to focus on is priceless for a writer.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:03.080
[Guest]: And to make it count, you know, focus attention on things that matter.

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.600
[Guest]: I mean, go to kacheris or go to concerts because guess what?

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.640
[Guest]: There are a few places when insight will strike.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.640
[Guest]: Everybody says shower.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.160
[Guest]: I get insight when I listen to Hindustani music or Carnatic music.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:21.480
[Guest]: And I think the sitting back and letting your mind wander is a very special thing.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.800
[Guest]: And you have to figure out ways to do that.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.800
[Guest]: Whether you end up being a birdwatcher like me and standing in the balcony and looking

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:34.760
[Guest]: out or you're a runner, running, I mean, runners are a great way to figure out a way for you

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.960
[Amit Varma]: to be bored.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.800
[Amit Varma]: This is all fantastic and very wise advice, you know, especially that bit about how, you

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.720
[Amit Varma]: know, if you're forced to write a lot, that will actually help you.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.800
[Amit Varma]: Because the one thing that I keep saying is that what leads to excellence, iterations

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.800
[Amit Varma]: lead to excellence.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.800
[Amit Varma]: You keep doing something again and again and again and again.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's much more likely to happen if you force yourself to do it, rather than if you

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.640
[Amit Varma]: just sit around and wait for the muse to strike you, as you said.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And you know, since you sort of now created this framework of Amit Verma kind of columnist

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.480
[Amit Varma]: and Shobhana Rai kind of columnist, I would just tell my readers that please don't be

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.140
[Amit Varma]: an Amit Verma kind of columnist because people who write about politics and economics do

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.880
[Amit Varma]: nothing to change the world.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.560
[Amit Varma]: But being a Shobhana Rai kind of columnist gives you a shot at changing the way people

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.760
[Amit Varma]: live their lives in, you know, all the small pleasures, like some of the things you pointed

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.840
[Amit Varma]: out and indeed about eating food.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.360
[Amit Varma]: And now it's time to talk about your book.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.600
[Amit Varma]: But let's take a quick commercial break and come back after that.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.200
[Amit Varma]: On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive sum games.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:41.160
[Amit Varma]: Well, if you want to be surrounded by beauty, and you love fine art, I have a win win proposition

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.440
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Shobha Narayan about her delightful book Food and Faith.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Shobha, we've spoken a lot about your personal journey before the break.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.640
[Amit Varma]: And now as we come to the book, I'd like to sort of begin by asking you, how did you conceive

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.640
[Amit Varma]: of this book?

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.200
[Amit Varma]: Like you've written about food before in the past throughout your career.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've spoken about your sort of relationship with religion and how it gradually

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.680
[Amit Varma]: changed.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.920
[Amit Varma]: But how did the idea for this particular book actually come about?

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.240
[Amit Varma]: And how did you decide to approach it?

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:20.640
[Guest]: So the food writing angel was Ruth Reichel, who sparked my career in food writing.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.880
[Guest]: As far as the faith goes, about right after my first book, Monsoon Diary, which is called

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:32.320
[Guest]: a memoir with recipes had come out, an editor from India, Kamini Mahadevan, who used to

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.440
[Guest]: be with Penguin at that time, took me out for a coffee.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.640
[Guest]: I was living in New York then.

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.480
[Guest]: And she said, you've written this book on food.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.720
[Guest]: And Penguin has published it in India.

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.240
[Guest]: Why don't you write a book called Sacred Food?

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.000
[Guest]: And we'll come up with a list of temples and you will visit the temples and write about

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000
[Guest]: the sacred food.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.080
[Guest]: So this was 2003.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:56.040
[Guest]: And it's taken me this long to come for the book to actually be finished because I was

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.120
[Guest]: moving continents and countries at that time.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:06.040
[Guest]: So Kamini's vision of the book was largely Hindu and with Ajmer Dargah and a few others.

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.280
[Guest]: I pretty much stuck to her vision.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:14.000
[Guest]: And the way that the logistics of it coming out was me pitching Sukumar at Mint and Siddhan

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.760
[Guest]: at Mint, saying I will write essays about this for Mint on Sunday, which was at that

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.240
[Guest]: time taking off.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.360
[Guest]: So some of the chapters were published in Mint.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:29.160
[Guest]: And then a lot of the other stuff was added on by me, the research and the Kumbh Mela,

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.720
[Guest]: for example, all that, the Nepal chapter.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.120
[Guest]: So there were many chapters that were not written about for Mint before.

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.160
[Guest]: So that was how it came about.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.680
[Guest]: And it was choosing the temples became a big dilemma.

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.240
[Guest]: For example, Tirupati Balaji temple's laddus are very, very famous.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:51.480
[Guest]: And I chose not to include them because a lot had been written about them.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.600
[Guest]: There's a Jain temple which serves Sukri Prasad.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:59.520
[Guest]: So that was an obvious miss that was partly because for whatever reason, I couldn't visit

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.520
[Guest]: that temple.

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.640
[Guest]: And I believe that everybody says the God has to call you when I wasn't called.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.200
[Guest]: So that was an obvious miss.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:12.680
[Guest]: Parsi Prasad was, there was no way for it to be without seeming forced.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.240
[Guest]: So that was a miss.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.840
[Guest]: So that was how it happened.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.840
[Guest]: So thanks to an editor.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And what was your experience like of going to all of these temples, like some of them,

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.800
[Amit Varma]: like you pointed out when you were young and you were actually growing up in Chennai, you

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.900
[Amit Varma]: had visited some of these in the past because your family was fairly religious.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.120
[Amit Varma]: But now you're visiting them again and looking at them in a different way.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:38.600
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, you know, one could, if there's a throng of people at the Kumbh Mela or at,

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, the Jagannath temple in Puri or wherever you are, one could actually shine

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:47.200
[Amit Varma]: a spotlight from on high on you and say that here's someone who's looking at all of this

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.680
[Amit Varma]: very differently from everybody else, that you're taking a step back, you're getting

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.080
[Amit Varma]: meta, you're trying to be descriptive, you know, you're focusing your attention, as it

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.080
[Amit Varma]: were.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:01.320
[Amit Varma]: So what was that process like, like as a writer who's writing about all of this, do you think

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.280
[Amit Varma]: about possible narratives in mind?

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.800
[Amit Varma]: Do you do pre-research and kind of go there?

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.800
[Amit Varma]: What are you looking at?

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.120
[Amit Varma]: What are you looking for?

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.120
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:16.340
[Guest]: So that, yes, definitely a lot of pre-research in the choice of the temples and also how

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.160
[Guest]: to approach each temple, which was different.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:23.760
[Guest]: India has this wonderful thing called Talapurana, which is the regional story of that particular

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.760
[Guest]: temple.

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.200
[Guest]: The problem with that is most of those books are available in situ.

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.600
[Guest]: You have to go there and most of them are in the regional language.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:37.480
[Guest]: So I quickly discovered that it was hard to do that, the kind of internet research that

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:40.160
[Guest]: we do, because they are simply not available.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:45.560
[Guest]: So when you go to Jagannath, there is a 10 volume set on the Jagannath Puri temple, not

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.760
[Guest]: available elsewhere.

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.120
[Guest]: You can't find it online.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:52.000
[Guest]: Talapuranas of temples are written in Tamil in very slim volume.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.120
[Guest]: So you have to end up.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:58.160
[Guest]: So I started by saying a lot of pre-research will be done, but the research would be done

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.560
[Guest]: in the choice of the temple and in the planning of the trip, whether to plan it during a festival

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.200
[Guest]: or not, trying to find a contact in the temple, because we're going there for two, three days,

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.440
[Guest]: you'd want to speak to the priest, you would want to speak to the local scholar.

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:16.320
[Guest]: So the research was mostly logistical in finding experts in the place and then going there,

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:21.120
[Guest]: talking as much as possible to 10 different priests, 10 different scholars, usually somebody

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.560
[Guest]: from the board of trustees who happened to be a historian of that temple and then buying

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:30.320
[Guest]: as many books locally as was possible and then coming back and actually doing the research

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:36.080
[Guest]: and sifting through the mounds of the beauty is in religion is there is so much material

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:41.440
[Guest]: available in India because even the humblest of temples will have the Talapurana.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.200
[Guest]: So then the question becomes, it's a curating job really, it's reading up on everything

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:50.280
[Guest]: and figuring out what is it that I want to say about all this, so that it doesn't end

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.600
[Guest]: up becoming another descriptive book on a Talapurana.

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:57.720
[Guest]: So the point of view became really important and so, but here's something I'll tell you,

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:04.200
[Guest]: if anyone in your listeners in your, I know you have a ton of listeners, if anyone in

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:09.920
[Guest]: your listenership is wondering about faith and they're saying, you know what, I'm 35

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920
[Guest]: years old.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:15.200
[Guest]: I've had a, I mean, I got laid off, I start up, whatever it is that I'm trying to figure

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:22.000
[Guest]: out if I have it in me to be become one of the faithful, I would say, give yourself an

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.640
[Guest]: experiment of visiting 10 temples in 2021 and doesn't matter which, choose a large temple,

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.200
[Guest]: ideally an ancient temple.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.560
[Guest]: I will guarantee that it will raise questions in you.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.740
[Guest]: I will guarantee that it will change you.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.160
[Guest]: You may not end up faithful.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.560
[Guest]: I am not as devout as I would like to be.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:47.600
[Guest]: I think so, the experiment of visiting temples in sequence in a consistent way with discipline

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.400
[Guest]: will change you and I think it's a good experiment to do because places of faith are very special

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:59.280
[Guest]: because they have had imprints from hundreds of thousands of people who have come there

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:05.360
[Guest]: carrying fears, hopes and dreams, and you can say what you like, but that makes the

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:12.240
[Guest]: place sacred, that gives the place its gravitas, that is why it is a place of worship where

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.040
[Guest]: you speak with your soul and not with your head.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.440
[Amit Varma]: So I'm kind of both atheist and agnostic and not that open to faith, but I would say this

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.400
[Amit Varma]: is terrific advice anyway, because I think, you know, and one gets sort of a rich feeling

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.960
[Amit Varma]: of this through your book that and I imagine anyone who does visit any of these temples,

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.200
[Amit Varma]: especially at a time when there are lots of pilgrims and so on, will, you know, get a

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.240
[Amit Varma]: better sense of the necessity and the impact of religion and maybe a deeper understanding

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.400
[Amit Varma]: into our culture and so on.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And I don't think faith needs to necessarily be a part of that experience in terms of becoming

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800
[Amit Varma]: faithful yourself.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.560
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, as an experience, I think it would be incredible.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.200
[Amit Varma]: Another thing that I loved about your book, like when I first got your book, I have to

01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.280
[Amit Varma]: be honest, I looked at all these chapters and they all have the names of these places.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.840
[Amit Varma]: And I thought, okay, she's gone to each of these places, she's going to describe the

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.840
[Amit Varma]: food.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.840
[Amit Varma]: That's great.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to enjoy that.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.140
[Amit Varma]: I didn't expect more, but I got much more.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:13.480
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things I got is that through the book, you are sort of meditating on these

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: deeper questions, which have often, you know, cropped up in my own thinking and some that

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
[Amit Varma]: haven't.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.960
[Amit Varma]: So how I'd like to kind of structure the rest of this episode is examine some of these deeper

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.160
[Amit Varma]: questions first, and then we'll talk about these specific places and the mouthwatering

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.960
[Amit Varma]: food described there.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Because if we talk about the food first, people might just go off to eat and who's going to

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.240
[Amit Varma]: listen to the rest of the episode.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.120
[Amit Varma]: So my first big question, again, comes from, you know, something that you said right at

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.560
[Amit Varma]: the start, that you are becoming more of a Hindu in terms of, you know, Hinduism playing

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.820
[Amit Varma]: a part in your life, but you're also a feminist and that's a big part of who you are.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And it's inescapable that so much of Hinduism, and of course, Hinduism contains multitudes,

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.280
[Amit Varma]: which also we'll discuss, it's, there are so many things that are so beautiful and deep

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.400
[Amit Varma]: and inspiring, but there are also so many mythogenistic elements to it.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.880
[Amit Varma]: I recently reread Yuganta by Aravati Karve, which is a fabulous book about, you know,

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.720
[Amit Varma]: her feminist take of our epics.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And you've also mentioned during this time that you've been traveling, that there are

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.240
[Amit Varma]: no women priests, and at various places, there are restrictions on what women can or cannot

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.240
[Amit Varma]: do.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.920
[Amit Varma]: How did you reconcile all of this for yourself?

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:34.040
[Guest]: Frankly, I haven't, I mean, the hypocrisies and the misogyny and the male predominance

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:40.760
[Guest]: in all Hinduism for sure, but every faith, you can't escape it.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.480
[Guest]: I told you, my father passed on recently, and the priest, in an attempt to explain the

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.960
[Guest]: rituals to us, he said, our Vedas say, Kashiya Maranam Mukthihi, which I knew, you die in

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.000
[Guest]: Kashi, you will attain Mukthi.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.280
[Guest]: And now, if you don't die in Kashi, what is the antidote to that?

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.640
[Guest]: Die in a place where your son is.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:06.360
[Guest]: And I have two girls, and I'm a daughter, and I'm thinking, what about the daughter?

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:12.920
[Guest]: So it is, at every stage, and for example, the daughter is not supposed to do all the

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.920
[Guest]: cremation rites.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.640
[Guest]: I have two girls, I hope they will do it for me.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:22.320
[Guest]: And the certain mantra is called the Rudram, there is a japa, Rudram is a mantra, a very

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320
[Guest]: famous Shaivite mantra.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:28.440
[Guest]: I asked the priest, why do you say only males should chant the mantra?

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.640
[Guest]: Why can't a woman chant?

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.440
[Guest]: And he flips, he sort of said, he said it in Tamil, he said, Ningle Parvati Madri, you

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.080
[Guest]: yourself are like Parvati, why do you need to chant?

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.080
[Guest]: I didn't buy that.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.480
[Guest]: So I am very attuned to the hypocrisy of faith.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:50.160
[Guest]: I think religion is important, but the religious, the way, the closest, the people who have

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.840
[Guest]: high levels of religion, the pious, are full of pettiness and hypocrisy.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.880
[Guest]: And it's hard to turn away from that.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.560
[Guest]: And I really don't know how to wrap my head around it, Amit.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.760
[Guest]: I think the only way to do it is that with everything that is great comes pettiness.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.880
[Guest]: Picasso was a great painter, misogynist to the core.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:20.520
[Guest]: Paul Gauguin is an impressionist giant, left his family in France, ran away to Tahiti.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.960
[Guest]: Vincent van Gogh had madness in him.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:29.720
[Guest]: So the only way to resolve it is to have this holistic view that life is this way and you

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.800
[Guest]: take the good and leave out the bad.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:38.000
[Guest]: But that doesn't mean that I have been able to look away from the hypocrisy.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:45.680
[Amit Varma]: And also what sort of you've pointed out at various points in time is through this book

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.920
[Amit Varma]: is the presence of caste.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.740
[Amit Varma]: For example, you write about one temple where the Brahmins are eating separately.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:57.040
[Amit Varma]: You talk about at one point the five great sins of Hinduism, which include killing a

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Brahmin.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:02.240
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you point out that like almost everything that has come about in the religion

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.520
[Amit Varma]: is kind of contextual.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:08.240
[Amit Varma]: It was meant to be five rules for people who are living with their guru in the guru-shishya

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.240
[Amit Varma]: parampara.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.360
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, there was, you know, one of the other rules was you shall not covet your

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:17.240
[Amit Varma]: guru's wife and extremely specific.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.680
[Amit Varma]: And throughout the temples, as you described, you do see this, that there is sort of, you

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.400
[Amit Varma]: know, Brahmins are elevated in this kind of a way.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:30.280
[Amit Varma]: And again, this is one sort of, you know, ugly aspect that one can't help noticing.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:34.200
[Amit Varma]: And I, you know, if any of my listeners are sort of wondering why I'm stressing on the

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:38.080
[Amit Varma]: negative aspects, these are just the two which struck me because they lead to cognitive dissonance

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.800
[Amit Varma]: and there are many other good things which we'll also talk about, including the food.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:46.240
[Amit Varma]: Again, would your approach to this be the same as to the misogyny that, you know, you

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.240
[Amit Varma]: don't have to accept the whole, you know, there are some things which are wrong with

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.240
[Guest]: it?

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.240
[Guest]: Sure.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:55.720
[Guest]: So caste is a big topic in India, and I try to stay away from it in my book, but it's

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.560
[Guest]: hard to omit.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:02.880
[Guest]: I think that the gift of being an immigrant, you know what, underneath, at the DNA level,

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.960
[Guest]: we are all the same.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.960
[Guest]: I have a barbelled approach to this whole topic.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.640
[Guest]: One is that I don't believe in, even in all this national identity and boundaries, at

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.640
[Guest]: the DNA level, we are all the same.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:19.400
[Guest]: But I do believe now in what I have come to call the tribal identity, which is something

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.640
[Guest]: that is linked to rituals, it's linked to milestones of your life, it is linked to community,

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.480
[Guest]: and it can be your building community, it is not about, or your village, which is, so

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.400
[Guest]: it comes from this whole village notion of this is my community, but currently it's my

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.800
[Guest]: housing community.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:39.920
[Guest]: So I believe that there is a place for community, but I also believe that we are one, I mean,

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.080
[Guest]: at the DNA level.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.800
[Guest]: So then how does one reconcile with caste?

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:50.200
[Guest]: The way I actually was able to reconcile with the caste notions that predominates faith

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.960
[Guest]: and religion, what helped me was dealing with craftspeople in India.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.720
[Guest]: I have a love of textiles, and I was going around for a website that I created called

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.240
[Guest]: Project Loom, where we documented handloom clusters.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:09.120
[Guest]: And when you go to Kutch, and you talk to the weavers and the dyers, or when you go

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.440
[Guest]: to Kanchipuram and talk to the weavers and dyers, it is entirely caste-based, I mean,

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:19.280
[Guest]: they say it without any shade of judgment, there is none of the political overtones that

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.840
[Guest]: we associate with it.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.080
[Guest]: It is, they do this type of embroidery in Kutch, they do this caste does this type of

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:29.720
[Guest]: embroidery, this caste is a dyer, this caste is, and I know Tamil words for it, but I forgot

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.440
[Guest]: the Gujarati words for it.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.680
[Guest]: But I said, wow, their identity is linked to caste, and it is not about, I can sit in

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.360
[Guest]: an ivory tower in Bombay or Bangalore and say this is all wrong.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:47.480
[Guest]: But we are a far, we are a long way off from destroying these segregations that have come

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.840
[Guest]: about so naturally for these craftspeople, and that, and they still live in that way.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:58.480
[Guest]: So actually working with craftspeople is a way to wrap your head, as Laila Taibji has

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.160
[Guest]: done, as Archana Shah, who founded Bandej has done.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:08.240
[Guest]: So they understand in a very intuitive, very easy way that this is how it is in India.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.800
[Guest]: And the overtones that we give about the hierarchy that we give is absent there, it is kind of

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800
[Guest]: a lateral thing.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:20.920
[Guest]: So that is one way to resolve it in your head, if you are this really against this varnashrama,

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.120
[Guest]: as they call it, as I am.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120
[Guest]: So that's a good way.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.320
[Amit Varma]: I had a great episode on this with TM Krishna, which I'll link from the show notes for all

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.760
[Amit Varma]: my listeners.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.680
[Amit Varma]: Coming on to something, you know, that I do sort of deeply admire about the culture of

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:39.040
[Amit Varma]: this country, which I guess, in a sense, you can call Hinduism also, because it can just

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.240
[Amit Varma]: mean so many other things, which is the incredible diversity.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.320
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things you point out is not just diversity in the traditional sense that

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.720
[Amit Varma]: we have, you know, so many thousands of gods, just like the biggest buffet ever, you choose

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.000
[Amit Varma]: your God, depending on what your proclivity is.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.320
[Amit Varma]: But also, this is not just a diversity across space, it's also a diversity across time.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.800
[Amit Varma]: Like you point out that, you know, we have these animistic traditions which survive these

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.360
[Amit Varma]: paganistic traditions that survive.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:13.040
[Amit Varma]: It's like, you know, the last 30 centuries of, you know, this subcontinent's evolution

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.080
[Amit Varma]: and religious terms all exist till today in religion.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.980
[Amit Varma]: And you've also seen, you know, different aspects of this in the same place.

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:24.280
[Amit Varma]: It's not that Puri is just one kind of thing.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.520
[Amit Varma]: You point out about Puri that the origin myths of Puri go to Jainism, Buddhism, to different

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.440
[Amit Varma]: sects of Hinduism, everyone's got a different origin story.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.120
[Amit Varma]: That's so incredibly fascinating.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.200
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about your experience, because at an intellectual level, we of course know

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.720
[Amit Varma]: that the diversity is out there.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.880
[Amit Varma]: But you experienced it at a visceral level as well.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.120
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about that.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:52.680
[Guest]: So the incredible thing about India, but if you look at it through my lens, is that gods

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.260
[Guest]: still roam the earth.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.000
[Guest]: And I mean that quite literally.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.880
[Guest]: I mean, men and women dressing themselves as gods and taking part in a procession.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.240
[Guest]: If you go to the other great hotbeds of civilization, which came up with philosophies and ideas

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.720
[Guest]: and invented faiths, Egypt, for example, Greece, for example, if you go to Greece, nobody prays

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.080
[Guest]: to Zeus.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:19.200
[Guest]: Nobody prays to Athena or Apollo or Aphrodite.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.440
[Guest]: They have all but disappeared.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.560
[Guest]: Greece has cut itself off from its past that was so powerful.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.400
[Guest]: I mean, it shaped Western civilization.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.560
[Guest]: But you go there now and that country has just cut itself off from that past.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.200
[Guest]: You go to Egypt, which was the sort of the fertile crescent where Egypt, the rivers Nile

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.080
[Guest]: and Euphrates were the seat of where it all began.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.320
[Guest]: But you go there, Ra or Horus or any of those gods absent.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:52.120
[Guest]: And the way Egypt, if you go to Cairo, they have shorn themselves of their past.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:56.840
[Guest]: India happily, we still wear the clothes that our forefathers wear, that you now only see

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.920
[Guest]: in the Museum of Metropolitan Art, all the robes.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:08.240
[Guest]: We still have traditions which continue and rituals and superstitions and links to seasons

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:14.160
[Guest]: that so in that sense, the long arc of civilization has not ended in India.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.160
[Guest]: The narrative continues.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:21.960
[Guest]: We are not at the last chapter, whereas Greece, what happened was they had their chapters

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.900
[Guest]: as views, everything cut.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.160
[Guest]: And now you have Harry Potter, this, that, and the other.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.800
[Guest]: It is a chasm in the middle, whereas in India, it is a gentle arc.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:39.400
[Guest]: And to quote Martin Luther, the arc is long and I think it will bend towards justice even

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.240
[Guest]: in our current political cauldron.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:49.400
[Guest]: So I am very proud of India that all our faiths together have figured out a way not to cut

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.920
[Guest]: ourselves from the past.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.960
[Guest]: The sacred and the profane live concomitantly in India.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.680
[Guest]: We have not cut ourselves from that.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.280
[Guest]: So that's wonderful.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.160
[Guest]: And you see that everywhere.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.640
[Guest]: I was talking about this firewalking ceremony, which touched me so deeply.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:11.280
[Guest]: It happens in Shivaji Nagar, which has one of the most powerful churches in Bangalore

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.520
[Guest]: is there and the feast happens there.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.760
[Guest]: It is largely occupied by Muslim merchants.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:26.120
[Guest]: And the Hindu group, what happens was the goddess comes into a man on a new moon night.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.240
[Guest]: He dresses himself in a fabulous Kanchipuram saree.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.360
[Guest]: He believes he is the goddess.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.920
[Guest]: He wears lipstick, he wears makeup and turmeric on the face.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.000
[Guest]: And he walks around the neighborhood collecting money.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.960
[Guest]: And there is a group that follows him, he included, religious fervor builds up.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:48.720
[Guest]: And then we all end it with him walking over fire and a lot of dancing and shaking and

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.640
[Guest]: ecstatic devotees walking behind him.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.680
[Guest]: And then inside the house where he enters, there is a mound of meat.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.080
[Guest]: And this goddess, he calls himself Angala Parameswari, which is a very old tribal goddess

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.760
[Guest]: before Saraswati Lakshmi, all that came about.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:10.040
[Guest]: And he takes arms full of the meat and puts it into his mouth and distributes it to his

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.040
[Guest]: devotees.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:18.720
[Guest]: So, this is like, I don't know, a Tolkien book or some sort of a Steven Spielberg fantasy

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720
[Guest]: thing.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:25.760
[Guest]: Man dressing as a woman, you have the cross dressing and all the things that my daughter

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:32.240
[Guest]: talks about now as being politically relevant, the him, his, the gender, everything is contained

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240
[Guest]: in this.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:39.320
[Guest]: So, how can you tell me that this religion as it is practiced in India is not relevant

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.040
[Guest]: to the questions of our time?

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.080
[Guest]: If a man can become a woman for one night, if a human can become a god for one night,

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.320
[Guest]: if you can convince yourself to walk over fire and then nothing happens to you.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:56.880
[Guest]: If you can serve meat as an offering, as a prasadam in this whole vegetarian mafia country

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.480
[Guest]: that we've sometimes become, it's all there, you just need to know where to find it.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, I'm non-vegetarian, so armfuls of meat sounds really nice to me.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.680
[Amit Varma]: Talking about a different kind of diversity, which is food diversity and which is another

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:17.640
[Amit Varma]: sort of a positive impact of all these different sort of temples and the cultures that they

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.640
[Amit Varma]: preserve.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.880
[Amit Varma]: And at one point in your wonderful chapter on Puri, which was one of my favorite chapters

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:27.760
[Amit Varma]: from your book, you write, quote, it is easy to be flippant or cynical about temple food,

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.400
[Amit Varma]: the same list of dishes cooked in the same way over centuries, feeding masses of people

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.520
[Amit Varma]: via the Lord.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.840
[Amit Varma]: What other virtue does it have?

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:38.920
[Amit Varma]: An important one has to do with the preservation of indigenous seed varieties.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.400
[Amit Varma]: At the Jagannath temple, for instance, one of the offerings is made with green paddy.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.760
[Amit Varma]: For green paddy to be available throughout the year, specific seed varieties that ripen

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.340
[Amit Varma]: at different times must be grown around the temple.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:53.600
[Amit Varma]: At the very least, this promotes biodiversity.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.240
[Amit Varma]: India used to have one lakh varieties of rice.

01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.160
[Amit Varma]: Today, most of us eat basmati and in the south, sona masuri rice.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:05.360
[Amit Varma]: Temple kitchens specifically choose local and indigenous varieties of rice, such as

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:11.040
[Amit Varma]: matta and jawara, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, red rice and parboiled, stop quote.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.680
[Amit Varma]: And this reminds me of something that, you know, the Vikram doctor, when he was did an

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.280
[Amit Varma]: episode with me a couple of years back, spoke about Cavendish bananas, very, you know, spoke

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:24.320
[Amit Varma]: about how we imported bananas out to the US and then they sent us back this homogenized

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.880
[Amit Varma]: version of the banana called Cavendish bananas, which is spread everywhere because of reasons

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.400
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, economies of scale and marketing and so on.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.720
[Amit Varma]: And all the local varieties are drying up.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.400
[Amit Varma]: But then it strikes me that when one speaks of all these temple cultures and the food

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:44.200
[Amit Varma]: that is around them, you know, one, they evolved to make use of local produce, because back

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.200
[Amit Varma]: when you could not travel so much, that's all that you had.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:52.360
[Amit Varma]: And two, therefore, by becoming ossified and ossification is generally a bad thing and

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.400
[Amit Varma]: I'll come to that as well.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.960
[Amit Varma]: But by becoming ossified, we are actually preserving the sort of food diversity of our

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:00.960
[Amit Varma]: country.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.960
[Amit Varma]: Is there something to this?

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.480
[Amit Varma]: Do you think religion also plays a part in a sense of keeping something alive, something

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.160
[Amit Varma]: good like food diversity, which would not otherwise have been the case?

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.400
[Guest]: Not just food, Amit, cultural traditions, the clothes we wear to temples are mostly

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.400
[Guest]: sarees.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.160
[Guest]: I mean, nowadays, where does somebody who loves handloom sarees, where do young women

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.440
[Guest]: wear sarees to the temple and for weddings?

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.560
[Guest]: So Yakshagana is preserved in temple festivals in Uttarakhand Nataka.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.080
[Guest]: David Shulman wrote this wonderful essay for the New York Review of Books on the Kudiyattam,

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:39.360
[Guest]: which happened in temple premises where you create the universe and destroy it in 31 days.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:44.640
[Guest]: So this is a play that goes over 31 nights and it happens in temples.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.600
[Guest]: So temples are cauldrons of culture and tradition.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:55.200
[Guest]: And I think we who have become sanitized and removed from our faith have forgotten that

01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.800
[Guest]: along with the hypocrisy and along with this preaching and becoming religious, they are

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.560
[Guest]: the ones who are preserving, as you say, the food.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.520
[Guest]: The Parni Panchamritam uses a particular type of banana called Malavarapram, which is, as

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520
[Guest]: you said, not found.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.360
[Guest]: You have elaki bananas in Bangalore.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.360
[Guest]: You don't get that.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.800
[Guest]: But thanks to that temple, if you visit Parni, you will still get bananas that are indigenous

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.800
[Guest]: and local.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:23.520
[Guest]: And the Ambalapura Palpaisam uses the parboiled rice.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:33.520
[Guest]: And so temples, I think, or places of faith, preserve music, preserve dance, preserve textiles

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.560
[Guest]: and rituals and food.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:43.000
[Guest]: So yes, I think that we should not throw the baby out of the bathwater in our attempt to

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.680
[Guest]: become agnostic.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.080
[Guest]: We forget all the good things they've done as well.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.080
[Amit Varma]: My next question is really about a cultural difference between countries like, you know,

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.720
[Amit Varma]: religion can play the same role in all our lives.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, back in the day, it probably originated as a God of the gaps, whatever you don't understand,

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.880
[Amit Varma]: you use religion to explain it.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:05.320
[Amit Varma]: And over time, you understand more and more it, you know, all over the world, you know,

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:11.040
[Amit Varma]: religion plays the role of sort of, you know, forming communities where people find comfort

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.080
[Amit Varma]: and you know, the good aspects of being part of a tribe.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.680
[Amit Varma]: But there's something about India that's different now, I'll, for a moment, I'll take you back

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.680
[Amit Varma]: and this is a diversion.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.160
[Amit Varma]: So I used to be a professional poker player once.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:25.160
[Amit Varma]: And I would spend a fair bit of time in Macau where I would go to play tournaments.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.080
[Amit Varma]: And Macau, by the way, I think about 15 years ago, overtook Las Vegas as the biggest gambling

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.480
[Amit Varma]: destination in the world, partly because the Chinese love to gamble.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.880
[Amit Varma]: So I remember on a weekday afternoon, I went to the Venetian there.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:41.480
[Amit Varma]: And the Venetian in Macau is not only built to be a replica of the one in Vegas, but it

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.680
[Amit Varma]: is the largest gaming floor in the world, right, there are rows and rows and rows of

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.880
[Amit Varma]: slot machines and all of that happening.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.380
[Amit Varma]: And I went there on a weekday afternoon, and the place was packed.

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:55.160
[Amit Varma]: And it was old Chinese pensioners who are standing at the slot machines, and they're

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.360
[Amit Varma]: sitting there for hours and hours and hours, and they're gambling, gambling, gambling,

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.360
[Amit Varma]: gambling.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.880
[Amit Varma]: And it's a big part of the culture there.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if anyone from China is listening to this, I hope I'm not simplifying I'm just

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:10.180
[Amit Varma]: sharing an experience and not saying that all the Chinese are necessarily like this.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:14.720
[Amit Varma]: But I got reminded of this when I read this passage in your book, where in your chapter

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:20.060
[Amit Varma]: on Udupi, you write, quote, the elderly in China play mahjong, American senior citizens

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:25.240
[Amit Varma]: go on cruises and play golf, Europeans visit museums, tour wineries and dine at Michelin

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.920
[Amit Varma]: star restaurants, Indian elders visit temples, stop code and elsewhere in your book, you've

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.480
[Amit Varma]: spoken about how people often have this urge towards the end of their lives that they want

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:40.640
[Amit Varma]: to die in Kashi, you know, tell me a little bit about this, because this does to an extent

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:46.400
[Amit Varma]: seem something that is much more an Indian thing than, you know, is it because we have

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.440
[Amit Varma]: less sources of comfort and solace and so on, because not many of our elders can go

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:55.840
[Amit Varma]: around on luxury cruises and dining in Michelin star restaurants like European elders may

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.840
[Amit Varma]: be able to do, you know, it seems that in this sense, the role of religion is so

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.800
[Amit Varma]: much deeper here than elsewhere.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.400
[Amit Varma]: Do you think that's true?

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.400
[Guest]: So I have a theory, and I don't know if it's true, Amit.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:12.800
[Guest]: I have a theory that it is because of the trajectory of our economy that we are in,

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.220
[Guest]: that religion still holds sway.

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:22.240
[Guest]: And I wonder if we become richer, like, say, China or Taiwan or Japan, whether wealth

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:28.440
[Guest]: will engender us to forget the God, because I think you have to be in some senses a developing

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.440
[Guest]: country for religion to take hold.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:38.400
[Guest]: So that is my macro theory is that the reason religion holds sway in India in the way it

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:43.140
[Guest]: does has to do with the economic trajectory that or the point in the economic trajectory

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.140
[Guest]: that we are in.

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:50.440
[Guest]: Once our GDP goes up, and once we become, like, say, Japan, perhaps we will forget faith

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:56.000
[Guest]: as many rich countries have forgotten, and we will find other inventions that seek to

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
[Guest]: soothe us.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.640
[Guest]: So that's my answer to that, yeah.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:04.200
[Guest]: And I think it has more to do with economics than to do with geography.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:08.320
[Guest]: It has to do with the time on the graph, where we are at that point in the graph.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.280
[Guest]: And I think Europe used to be like that.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:15.000
[Guest]: Every country in the, that had, if you follow the economic trajectory of every country,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.520
[Guest]: I feel, and again, this is my theory, that there were points in that economic trajectory

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.160
[Guest]: where the countries were deeply devout and religious.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:27.360
[Guest]: As they became wealthier, they lost, they gave up their faith, and they became more

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:34.040
[Guest]: scientific, they became more rational, and they found money served as well as a God as

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.320
[Guest]: religion did in their past.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.080
[Guest]: So India is still not there yet.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:45.400
[Amit Varma]: No, I have spent far more time in casinos and in temples, but I sincerely hope that

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:50.280
[Amit Varma]: our elderly don't go from temples to slot machines, you know, that would just be horrifying,

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, which might have kind of happened elsewhere.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.800
[Amit Varma]: My next question is about the commercialization of religion, which you've written at in separate

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:05.040
[Amit Varma]: parts of your book, like at one point in your chapter on Palani, you know, you write about

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:10.600
[Amit Varma]: how the way, you know, devotees are treated, and it's such an organized setup and all of

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:11.600
[Amit Varma]: that.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.680
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, you write, quote, I have tried long and hard to make my peace with

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:19.160
[Amit Varma]: the hierarchical structure of Hinduism and indeed all religions, perhaps I should just

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:23.600
[Amit Varma]: bring them down from the pedestal, bring them down from the realm of the divine to the realm

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.360
[Amit Varma]: of the commercial, view them as a spectacle, stop quote.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:31.360
[Amit Varma]: And much later in your chapter on Jaipur, you write, quote, I haven't figured out my

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:36.040
[Amit Varma]: stance with respect to offerings for God, flowers will get crushed, sweets will aid

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.880
[Amit Varma]: and abet India's rising number of diabetics.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:43.200
[Amit Varma]: And really does the God partake of all this stuff, the offerings of money, clothes, food

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:46.520
[Amit Varma]: or flowers end up in the pockets of the priest or the temple.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.880
[Amit Varma]: So why do we persist carrying these objects as an offering to God when he doesn't need

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.520
[Amit Varma]: a thing and only wants us to be pure of heart, stop quote.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:59.560
[Amit Varma]: And I'll point out to all my listeners that it is Shobha who use the pronoun he for God.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.560
[Amit Varma]: I didn't do that.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:05.320
[Guest]: I always reflexively say she just to be on the safe side.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.840
[Guest]: Good one, Amit.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.240
[Amit Varma]: So it's just something that like, I realized that there was a lot about this experience,

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:17.400
[Amit Varma]: especially the food and the sort of, you know, the other almost mystical experiences, which

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.400
[Amit Varma]: were amazing.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.200
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, you are viewing and writing about and commenting on all this crash

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.760
[Amit Varma]: commercialization that's happening in a separate part of the book you write about.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, I think during the Kumbh Mela chapter, you write about how everything in Haridwar

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.280
[Amit Varma]: is.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.280
[Amit Varma]: So it's a set up for the tourists.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.200
[Amit Varma]: So you'll have an, you know, an American and a Swiss and whatever, and there'll be people

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.400
[Amit Varma]: giving them Gyan and all of that.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:45.320
[Amit Varma]: Does this commercial aspect of this whole religion thing disturb you a bit?

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.680
[Amit Varma]: Because you have true believers flocking to places which may, for all you know, not be

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.680
[Guest]: manned by true believers at all.

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.680
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.260
[Guest]: Very good question.

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:58.360
[Guest]: But does Subodh Gupta deserve to be India's millionaire artist?

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:04.440
[Guest]: There are countless, does Vasudev Gaitonde deserve to sell for how much he sell for much

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.900
[Guest]: after his death?

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:13.440
[Guest]: So if you are an artist, as I was trained to be, commercialism is always a very, a stepmother,

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.860
[Guest]: and you always view it with suspicion, stepfather, view it with suspicion.

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:21.680
[Guest]: So that said, so I will answer it in two ways.

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.280
[Guest]: One is that anything that we consider pure and otherworldly comes with commercialization

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.360
[Guest]: that we will always have trouble dealing with.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.040
[Guest]: And I use that as a very specific example to point that out.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:38.640
[Guest]: There are countless deserving artists who don't achieve the stature that all these so-called

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.720
[Guest]: name-brand artists do.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:42.000
[Guest]: So how do you make your peace with that?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.880
[Guest]: The great thing, and this is true with art, and this is true with temples, is that even

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.800
[Guest]: today you can go to Bhubaneswar in Orissa, you can go near a river and you will find

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.760
[Guest]: a small Yogini shrine with nobody there, not even a priest.

01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.400
[Guest]: And I have visited the shrine which was destroyed.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.960
[Guest]: And you can commune with the divine in silence and solitude.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.500
[Guest]: That is available to you.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:11.200
[Guest]: Even today in Kerala, you can go to temples where there is a priest, there is no hierarchy,

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.680
[Guest]: there is no money grabbing.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.880
[Guest]: And so then the question becomes, do you visit the rock star temples of Tirupati, Haridwar,

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:24.560
[Guest]: Badrinath, Dwaraka, the name-brand temples, or do you forget them?

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:30.480
[Guest]: I would say if you are likely uncomfortable with the commercialization of temples, just

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.000
[Guest]: don't go to those temples.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.200
[Guest]: Don't put your rupees as part of their coffers.

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.840
[Guest]: Don't visit the big temples that have countless tourists anyway.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:47.000
[Guest]: So then the next level becomes, if you also believe like Diana Ek wrote about in her book

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.680
[Guest]: that pirthas or places of worship carry energy and part of the pilgrimage is to experience

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.800
[Guest]: this energy and perhaps get healed by it, that's the purpose of going to that big temple,

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.480
[Guest]: the Guruvayur, the Kumbh Mela, and everything is to get your energy and your healing from

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.440
[Guest]: your energy that's found.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:12.280
[Guest]: So like with art, you choose your battles and you do, you choose what you, if you are

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:21.040
[Guest]: sick, if you want to be healed by, from God forbid, a cancer, and by all means go follow

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.960
[Guest]: your faith, if your mom tells you go visit Guruvayur, go and get the healing energy from

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.960
[Guest]: it.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:33.200
[Guest]: But if you just want to commune with the divine, I mean, as lovers of podcasts, Amit, including

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:39.920
[Guest]: yours, I'm sure you have listened to Sam Harris's podcast, and how can you explain meditation?

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.360
[Guest]: It is a felt experience, it's not hard to articulate.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.320
[Guest]: So if you want to just have the felt experience, go to Bhuvaneshwar, see the Yogini temple,

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:55.400
[Guest]: go to Maharashtra, every village outside the Bombay, small shrines where nobody will bother

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.400
[Guest]: you.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:00.560
[Guest]: So you can experience the non-commercial aspect of faith, if you want to.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:06.120
[Guest]: And in fact, you may experience faith in those non-commercial shrines, the roadside in Nashik,

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:11.840
[Guest]: where there is a shivling and a beautiful banyan tree, you go sit there and experience

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:17.000
[Guest]: the wind, and you may be touched in a way that you can't articulate.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.640
[Guest]: And that, to me, is an experience of the divine.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:23.360
[Guest]: And the beauty is that wherever you are, you can access it.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:30.200
[Guest]: Even in Italy, where Christianity played such a huge role, and all the Baroque images of

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.380
[Guest]: Christ are now in the museums.

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:36.680
[Guest]: You go to Florence, you can go to the museum, or you can go to those giant cathedrals in

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:42.360
[Guest]: the Vatican, or you can go to a small church, listen to the West First singing and be touched

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360
[Guest]: by it.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.440
[Amit Varma]: So there's such wisdom in that, you know, being able to relate to religion in all our

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.440
[Amit Varma]: personal ways.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned Sam Harris.

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:52.920
[Amit Varma]: I should point out to my listeners that I'm, by the way, a big fan of his podcast.

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:58.920
[Amit Varma]: I think I, you know, he's again a master of the craft of the interview, whatever one might

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.840
[Amit Varma]: think of his views otherwise.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.040
[Amit Varma]: But I actually downloaded his meditation app, I think it's called the Waking Up app, and

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.040
[Amit Varma]: it's a subscription thing.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.480
[Amit Varma]: And I've been paying for it for the last five months, but haven't actually sat down for

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.560
[Amit Varma]: a single session.

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:14.240
[Amit Varma]: So it's like you take a gym membership for a year, and then you never go.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.120
[Amit Varma]: Just as his writer's block, I guess as meditators block.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:22.120
[Amit Varma]: So sort of my last big question before we get to the food, though, I'll obviously keep

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.260
[Amit Varma]: throwing up tangential questions, even when we talk about the food.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:30.200
[Amit Varma]: But this last big question is about, you've spoken throughout your book, and it's a truism,

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:34.520
[Amit Varma]: almost a cliche that Hinduism contains so much, there is so much within it.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.860
[Amit Varma]: But what we have seen in the last few years and building up over the last few decades

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:45.280
[Amit Varma]: is political Hinduism, or what is called Hindutva today, which is a very strident version of

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:52.120
[Amit Varma]: Hinduism, which almost tries to mimic sort of the Abrahamic one book approach.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.100
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and it's strident, it's full of certainties.

01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:59.360
[Amit Varma]: It's also built on negatives instead of a positive view of what the world should be

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.360
[Amit Varma]: like.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.840
[Amit Varma]: It's built on negatives like, you know, no love jihad, don't slaughter cows, and so on

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:05.840
[Amit Varma]: and so forth.

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:11.560
[Amit Varma]: And some of their political grievances might well be legitimate, but a lot of what they

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:16.000
[Amit Varma]: stand for is having a toxic effect on our society.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.920
[Amit Varma]: So what are your sort of feelings on what's happening out there?

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:25.240
[Amit Varma]: And should Hindus be outraged at what is being done in the name of Hinduism?

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.240
[Guest]: I think you should.

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.560
[Guest]: I am certainly.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:33.000
[Guest]: And the problem in India now, and I have a friend who's the resident editor of Times

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:39.680
[Guest]: of India in Bangalore, and she was saying that families in India are being thrown apart

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:40.680
[Guest]: because of what is happening.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:47.080
[Guest]: So you have the mother who says Jai Shri Ram and the Babri Masjid, the judgment was passed,

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.880
[Guest]: and you have the daughter who's horrified by the same judgment.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.080
[Guest]: It didn't used to be like that.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:31:00.080
[Guest]: I think what is happening currently is that when you promote faith over national identity,

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:05.120
[Guest]: it is a very slippery slope, and I personally think it is a very dangerous thing what we

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.120
[Guest]: are doing.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:12.840
[Guest]: I think what I say in the book is a question, and if I can read it out, I would, Amit, is

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:17.880
[Guest]: what that parliamentarian in Goa said, that he's a devout Hindu, but inside his house,

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.960
[Guest]: but outside he's an Indian first and a Hindu last.

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:21.960
[Guest]: That's how it is.

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.480
[Guest]: I feel that's a good way to view religion.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.680
[Guest]: Faith is private.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.840
[Guest]: Faith may happen in temples and churches and mosques and public, but in a sense, what are

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.960
[Guest]: you after at the end of the day?

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.480
[Guest]: You want to connect with the divine.

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:42.360
[Guest]: You want to connect with your God, Jesus, Allah or Ram, and why are you making, why

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:49.040
[Guest]: are you drawing your community and warrior craft and spacecraft into this?

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:52.360
[Guest]: What should be a very private, solemn, sacred act?

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:58.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you said, you know, Jesus, Allah, Ram, and that immediately reminded me of another

01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.560
[Amit Varma]: sort of question that I had for you.

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:03.600
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask it now, which is that, you know, the thing in Hinduism is that there are so

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.160
[Amit Varma]: many deities to choose from, and indeed, there are deities spread across this book.

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:11.240
[Amit Varma]: At one point, you speak about your experiences in the US, where, you know, there was this

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:15.200
[Amit Varma]: fight between South Indians and North Indians about which deity to have for the temple,

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:19.560
[Amit Varma]: and the only one they could actually agree on was Ganapati.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:23.680
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking about all the different choices open to you, there's Ram, Vishnu,

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:29.200
[Amit Varma]: Shiva, Ganesha, Ganapati, Lakshmi, Durga, and so on.

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.400
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that the way that you choose a favorite deity, like apart from it coming

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:38.160
[Amit Varma]: down to you, like a football club, loyalty often comes down to some people.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:41.540
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that, if you actually choose it, it sort of strikes me that it reveals

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:45.580
[Amit Varma]: something about the chooser much in the same way that we choose who is our cricketing hero.

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.920
[Amit Varma]: So you know, my cricketing hero being Rahul Dravid, for example, will no doubt reveal

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:51.760
[Amit Varma]: something about me, and so on and so forth.

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.660
[Amit Varma]: So which deity do you feel most drawn to?

01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And why do you think that is?

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:57.160
[Guest]: Kali.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.160
[Guest]: Very easy.

01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.160
[Guest]: Kali.

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:04.520
[Guest]: Kali Ma, because I think she's dark in a country that worships fairness.

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:10.160
[Guest]: She embraces her shadow in a way that Lakshmi and Saraswati and all the goody-goody gods

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.160
[Guest]: don't.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:15.240
[Guest]: She's more tribal and links to the fertility goddesses of yore.

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:19.160
[Guest]: So she connects us to who we were as a civilization.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.000
[Guest]: And she's a fierce warrior goddess.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.040
[Guest]: So I love that.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.900
[Guest]: I love the female warrior goddesses.

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:28.440
[Guest]: And so I have to go to the Northeast, which I have not done.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.800
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.800
[Amit Varma]: Maybe a separate book on that.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Let's now talk about some of the places that you visit through the book, not all of them,

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:38.480
[Amit Varma]: because we do want people to kind of buy the book, which they should anyway, because I

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.960
[Amit Varma]: don't think a podcast episode, however long, can capture more than a sliver of it.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:47.280
[Amit Varma]: But your first chapter is on Udupi, and of course, we all associate Udupi with the cuisine

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.400
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.760
[Amit Varma]: And I was struck by your beautiful description of the classic iconic masala dosa as, quote,

01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:00.040
[Amit Varma]: having a, quote, sly feeling to stymie orthodox Brahmin priests, stop quote.

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:05.120
[Amit Varma]: So can you elaborate on what the feeling of the masala dosa has to do with fighting Brahmanism?

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.680
[Guest]: Yeah, sure.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:13.480
[Guest]: So this I got from a book by Geeta Rao, it is on Udupi cuisine.

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:17.880
[Guest]: Basically, what happens was orthodox Brahmins are not allowed to eat onion.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.200
[Guest]: So they wanted, so the plain potato filling was kept outside.

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.600
[Guest]: And they would eat their dosa and almost dip in the potato filling like a chutney.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:27.600
[Guest]: But they wanted onions.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:32.640
[Guest]: So these priests, they figured out a way to slyly have their cake and eat it too, or have

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.240
[Guest]: their onion and eat it too.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.360
[Guest]: So they made this masala filling with onions, and then they would fold it into the dosa

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:42.760
[Guest]: so that they could piously eat this, thinking that nobody knows that they are eating onions.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.520
[Guest]: So that was how that was invented, according to the research I did.

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.880
[Guest]: And I love the idea of it.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.680
[Guest]: And now, of course, Udupi masala dosa has become a global commodity.

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.520
[Guest]: It's a GI tag, I'm sure.

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so all casteist people listening to this will now be forced to stop eating masala

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:04.000
[Amit Varma]: dosas, if you are true to whatever your ideals are.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.960
[Amit Varma]: And I was fascinated by, you know, the description of how basically, you know, there are eight

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:13.800
[Amit Varma]: spiritual centers in Udupi who run the temple two years at a time.

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:18.400
[Amit Varma]: And during the transition, they do what is called Anna Brahma, where they feed, you know,

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.480
[Amit Varma]: 15,000 people, which is quite mad.

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And you've described their delicacy as being brinjal cooked in coconut oil, which is one

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.520
[Amit Varma]: of their specialties.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:30.640
[Amit Varma]: And I was kind of amused by this, because on the one hand, you point out how they don't

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.880
[Amit Varma]: want to use foreign ingredients.

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.720
[Amit Varma]: So everything has to be local and sanskari, as it were.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.560
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, they're cooking this with red chilies, which come from Mexico,

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.920
[Amit Varma]: and sesame seeds, which, you know, went from Indonesia to China, and then to India.

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:50.120
[Amit Varma]: And that irony sort of amused me of how, you know, it is impossible to be a purely Indian

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.160
[Amit Varma]: in that sense in any way.

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:58.800
[Guest]: Except in shraddh cooking, Amit, I think that if you look at the death rituals around what

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:05.240
[Guest]: they call the shraddham, or the shraddh, I think, even today, the funerary rites, and

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:11.160
[Guest]: I discussed this with a scholar, actually, the funerary rites in Hinduism are better

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:17.000
[Guest]: preserved than the marriage rites, for example, or the other life stages, right?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000
[Guest]: Because people are afraid of the booths and the pisachas that we become.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.480
[Guest]: And so this element of fear forced them, the priests and the Brahmins who were in charge

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:31.640
[Guest]: of passing it from generation to generation to preserve the cooking associated with all

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:37.880
[Guest]: these death rituals, not so much with the, as you say, the temple cooking even was diluted.

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:42.880
[Guest]: And certainly marriage food, at one point had certain prescriptions, which are no longer

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:48.800
[Guest]: valid in this day where we have stalls with pav bhaji in Indian and South Indian temples.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.440
[Guest]: But funerary cooking is still preserved in the original form.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:57.520
[Amit Varma]: And another thing to strike me, and this is sort of a profound observation, you make a

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.560
[Amit Varma]: different points in the book, and it seems to me to be true of religion, fundamentally

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:07.880
[Amit Varma]: that all rituals that evolve for specific local reasons, but then are given a veneer

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:12.960
[Amit Varma]: of morality or myth, for example, at one point, you point out how, again, I'll quote from

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:18.120
[Amit Varma]: your chapter, quote, traditional Hindus in Udupi don't eat certain foods during the four

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:23.160
[Amit Varma]: monsoon months, a tradition of abstinence that seems at odds in this age when New Zealand

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:27.320
[Amit Varma]: apples and Malta oranges are airlifted to every region of India.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:30.040
[Amit Varma]: They call this chaturmasya vrat.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:34.160
[Amit Varma]: The phrase means four month austerity, and perhaps began out of necessity.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:38.120
[Amit Varma]: You have to hunker down in one place during the monsoon, and certain foods would simply

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.400
[Amit Varma]: not have been available.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:44.200
[Amit Varma]: The protocol itself seems rather strict and forbidding, but intuitive once you get used

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.480
[Amit Varma]: to it, stop quote.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.200
[Amit Varma]: And later on, you talk about the myth that built around it, where you say, quote, Narada

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:55.080
[Amit Varma]: asked Brahma, the creator, about the importance of the chaturmasya vrat.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.360
[Amit Varma]: Brahma said, and now this is these are Brahma's words.

01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:01.760
[Amit Varma]: So quote, chaturmasya is a period of four months during which Lord Vishnu is believed

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:04.640
[Amit Varma]: to take rest in the Sheet Sagar or Milky Ocean.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:09.240
[Amit Varma]: So quite naturally, all the oceans, rivers and ponds are believed to attain divinity

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:14.000
[Amit Varma]: due to the presence of Lord Vishnu during this period.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.040
[Amit Varma]: And this is something that seems to crop up in different parts of your book, where different

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:24.080
[Amit Varma]: things evolve in the religion because of what are local factors, but then almost as if to

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.800
[Amit Varma]: rationalize them and why they are part of the religion, all these myths and all kind

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.200
[Amit Varma]: of get built around.

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:33.240
[Amit Varma]: So is this a pattern you started noticing more and more while writing the book and you

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.240
[Guest]: know?

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.240
[Guest]: Yeah, 100%.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:40.520
[Guest]: And the biggest example of that, of course, Amit is the gods that were originally worshipped,

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.880
[Guest]: which was Indra, the god of thunder.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:48.160
[Guest]: So every faith, even the choice of gods to worship is a pattern.

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.320
[Guest]: Every faith was invented, I believe, in the face of natural danger by roaming nomads.

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.200
[Guest]: So if you look at Zeus, for example, was the lord of thunder and lightning.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:01.320
[Guest]: And here you had Indra, who's now dropped once.

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:05.440
[Guest]: I think electricity was invented and houses were invented and we were not so worried about

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.440
[Guest]: thunders and rain.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.920
[Guest]: Indra lost his mojo, as it were.

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:16.480
[Guest]: And then, so now the gods of the moment, Murugan, though, Muruga is an old god who went, has

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.480
[Guest]: tribal roots.

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:22.440
[Guest]: Shiva is a newcomer and Vishnu in the long span of time.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:29.640
[Guest]: So I think this invention that happened around faith fascinates me because they made sense.

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.680
[Guest]: For example, again, there is one tradition where after a child is born for a certain

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:38.320
[Guest]: number of days, the family should not, we should quarantine essentially.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:44.440
[Guest]: And even today, I know Hindus in my building complex who follow that without realizing

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:49.440
[Guest]: that tradition, probably that rule probably came about because of infection and that doesn't

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.440
[Guest]: exist anymore.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:56.280
[Guest]: Even today, my mother, after going to visit, to pay a condolence visit to her friend, will

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.880
[Guest]: come back and take a bath.

01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:03.440
[Guest]: Again, invented because if you go in a village to a place where there were dead bodies, the

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.800
[Guest]: danger of infection.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.480
[Guest]: But we have these mindless things that we follow that don't make sense anymore.

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:13.760
[Guest]: And once you get into this religion, you will see, as you just pointed out, that said the

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:19.480
[Guest]: chaturmasya vrata, I kind of defend it now because it's a way no different from the value

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.840
[Guest]: and the keto diet that we follow.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.200
[Guest]: I think doing eating certain foods for a month will tell you what your body is capable of

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:28.200
[Guest]: digesting.

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.000
[Guest]: So I have no quarrel with that.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.680
[Guest]: But you're right in that the macro point you make of inventions becoming irrelevant and

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.680
[Guest]: still being followed exists in all all over India.

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:44.440
[Amit Varma]: No, and in fact, I followed both the keto and the intermittent fasting at different

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.440
[Amit Varma]: points in time.

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:49.520
[Amit Varma]: And the thing with intermittent fasting is that all religions have some form of fasting

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:53.840
[Amit Varma]: or the other built in that is actually good for the body in different ways.

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.280
[Amit Varma]: And religions figured this out and they may have built other mythologies and stories around

01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.680
[Amit Varma]: But it's the right thing to do.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:04.360
[Amit Varma]: And I'll leave my listeners with an interesting exercise before we move on to the next point,

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:09.240
[Amit Varma]: which is that think about it and make a list of traditions which you know of for which

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.200
[Amit Varma]: the original reason no longer exists for why it might have evolved.

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.620
[Amit Varma]: But they sort of continue to the present day.

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:21.200
[Amit Varma]: And I'll move on to my next question, which is from your Kashi chapter, where I loved

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.200
[Amit Varma]: your first paragraph.

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:27.040
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to take a tangent as we get there, where you write, quote, a dead cow is floating

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.440
[Amit Varma]: down the river Ganga.

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:33.200
[Amit Varma]: She is a black and white Holstein Friesian cow like the one I own in Bengaluru.

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.880
[Amit Varma]: She floats sideways, legs spread eagled, half of her face is visible even though it is dark.

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:38.880
[Amit Varma]: 7pm.

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:44.520
[Amit Varma]: I wish I could say that she looks peaceful, but her teeth are bad as if hurt, stop quote.

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And this is a delightful para by itself and partly because of, you know, that half sentence

01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:50.960
[Amit Varma]: like the one I own in Bangalore.

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's, of course, something that you've written an entire book about.

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:58.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, so that our listeners can get familiar with a little more of your work and

01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.440
[Amit Varma]: not just this book.

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.360
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a brief tangent while you tell me about your fascination with cows and how

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.620
[Amit Varma]: you came to own one.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:09.200
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit, for plugging my previous book, which is called The Cows of Bangalore

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.560
[Guest]: in India and Milk Lady of Bangalore in Foreign Countries.

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:19.160
[Guest]: The book is about how a woman who sells milk in Bangalore to the army cantonment opposite

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:23.120
[Guest]: my house, she would bring a milk can and sell it, approached me one day and said, do you

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.960
[Guest]: want to buy fresh milk?

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:26.920
[Guest]: And I was used to Nandini milk packets.

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.420
[Guest]: And I decided I would buy fresh milk from her and we became friends.

01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:36.160
[Guest]: And later she approached me and said, I want a loan for 60,000 rupees to buy a cow.

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:41.080
[Guest]: And she does the hard sell and says, you know, you should be lucky that I approached you

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.480
[Guest]: because the Jain family below who live below you would have killed to get a cow.

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:46.480
[Guest]: But I'm asking you instead.

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.120
[Guest]: So there was all the hard selling happening.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.720
[Guest]: And then here is where the long arm of tradition touches me.

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.800
[Guest]: My father and father in law at that time were both turning 81.

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:01.520
[Guest]: And everybody in my extended household was, all my aunts were saying, you should do Godan,

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:05.800
[Guest]: which is very, very important for this particular life stage.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.240
[Guest]: So I said, maybe God is handing this Godan thing in my hand.

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:15.400
[Guest]: And of course, all these prescriptions say the Godan has to be the Desi cow to a Brahmin.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:20.200
[Guest]: Sarla was not a Brahmin, she was a woman and Parthai from a Desi cow.

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.200
[Guest]: But I did it anyway.

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.600
[Guest]: So what I did was I gave her a loan, which ended up becoming a gift of 75,000 rupees

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:30.920
[Guest]: to buy the cow and then continue her business.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:38.280
[Guest]: And I gave her the advance that was paid for the book as a kind of a thank you as well.

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:40.600
[Guest]: And it was a wonderful exercise in writing the book.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.440
[Guest]: And it also began as a series of columns.

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:49.000
[Guest]: I think it really touched people because I had readers who came in from Delhi, and who

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.520
[Guest]: said, I want to donate 30,000 rupees to this woman.

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.640
[Guest]: And I suddenly thought, oh, God, they shouldn't think I'm doing this commission business.

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:02.160
[Guest]: So I've had people who met Sarla, who are from my readers and donated to her.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.160
[Guest]: So this book is about Sarla.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:09.280
[Guest]: But it's also about why cows are so important in Hinduism to the point where the common

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:14.080
[Guest]: word in which priests begin an invocation by asking for your Ghotra.

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.480
[Guest]: Ghotra means cowshed, which cowshed do you belong to?

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.200
[Guest]: That's the root of the word.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:26.880
[Guest]: And of course, all the rivers, Godavari, Govardhan, Gokul, any word that begins with go, has a

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:28.800
[Guest]: link to a cow.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.600
[Guest]: And that's why cows, if once you start looking, are steeped in India.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:37.960
[Guest]: And again, the fascinating thing is, why are we obsessed with cows and not that the boas

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:43.040
[Guest]: tortoise is a species that originated in Turkey, you go to Turkey, nobody cares about cows.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:48.920
[Guest]: So again, why have we preserved this, the Vedas begin with a verse about the cow and

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:54.440
[Guest]: the sun rises, portrayed as the sun rose like the cows walk out of cowshed.

01:44:54.440 --> 01:45:01.120
[Guest]: So in poetry, in scriptures, in colloquial language, cows are everywhere.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.520
[Guest]: And we have somehow managed to preserve it.

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.720
[Guest]: And now cows are part of politics, which is the sad part.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.360
[Amit Varma]: But you know, the rhetorical question that you just asked, is there an answer to it that

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.920
[Amit Varma]: you've, you know, why are cows so sacred for us?

01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:17.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, why do cows play such a, you know, a big role in our society so much so that

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:22.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, even Mahatma Gandhi wrote about it in, in Swaraj and so on.

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:27.800
[Amit Varma]: So it was a political issue for a lot longer than recently, in fact, all of the pet issues

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:31.720
[Amit Varma]: of modern political Hindutva, whether they are love jihad, or cow slaughter, or whatever

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:35.080
[Amit Varma]: have been issues for like more than a century now.

01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:40.120
[Amit Varma]: But what's the big deal, but like, I'm trying to think of the proximate local cause for

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:43.880
[Amit Varma]: it, like, was it the one domestic animal from which they got milk, and they played a lot

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.680
[Amit Varma]: of placed a lot of value on that.

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.400
[Amit Varma]: And there was all those factors fed into it.

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:49.400
[Amit Varma]: And why us?

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.400
[Amit Varma]: Why only us?

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.360
[Guest]: So the nomads worship the horses, because when the horses eat grass, and they pull it

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.920
[Guest]: by the root, so you have to move on.

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:04.120
[Guest]: Every civilization, whether it is Indus Valley or Mesopotamia had animals that were part

01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.120
[Guest]: of their milieu.

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.920
[Guest]: So ostensibly, you could have the goat as the primary animal instead of the cow, because

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.680
[Guest]: the goat gives milk as well.

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.640
[Guest]: I think in India, the reason we worship cows is that we figured out ways to use cow dung

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:24.400
[Guest]: to use the we figured out ways to make every aspect of the cow count of fermentation, I

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:30.120
[Guest]: think, using the dahi, not just the root, but the dahi and the buttermilk.

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:31.920
[Guest]: I think the killer app was the ghee.

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:35.160
[Guest]: I think Indians invented ghee and enshrined the cow.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:36.160
[Guest]: And that was it.

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:37.760
[Guest]: That was the fork in the road.

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:43.520
[Guest]: We created ghee and that forever then since then the cow was holy and sacred.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:47.040
[Guest]: So again, it comes back to food.

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.360
[Amit Varma]: As someone who's just gotten back on the keto diet and was on it for a long time, a couple

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.860
[Amit Varma]: of years ago, I'm happy to say that I'm quite happy to consider ghee as something holy.

01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:05.360
[Amit Varma]: But I'm not sure that, you know, my reverence would extend to the source of the ghee.

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:10.280
[Amit Varma]: My next question is about the Ganga now you've kind of pointed out about how, you know, in

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:15.480
[Amit Varma]: your chapter on Kashi about how the state of the Ganga, which we don't need to elaborate

01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.840
[Amit Varma]: upon you start the chapter with the cow floating later.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:20.960
[Amit Varma]: I think there's a dead buffalo somewhere and people are dipping themselves with a dead

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.480
[Amit Varma]: buffalo right next to them and so on.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:29.440
[Amit Varma]: And you talk about the different myths and origin stories like the Bhagavata Purana myth

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:30.720
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:37.080
[Amit Varma]: And again, I was kind of wondering about this deification of the Ganga as a holy river.

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:43.040
[Amit Varma]: Would it possibly come about because the people whose narrative version of Hinduism quote

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:47.600
[Amit Varma]: unquote Hinduism won out over the centuries were the people who lived in the Gangetic

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Plain?

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:53.840
[Amit Varma]: Like I did an episode with Tony Joseph who wrote that wonderful book on the Indians.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:59.760
[Amit Varma]: And in that he points out how that, you know, basically till 2000 years ago till about,

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, 0 BC or 0 AD, I don't even know what to call it.

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.400
[Amit Varma]: But till that year, there was actually there were centuries of intermingling between all

01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:09.280
[Amit Varma]: the people in the subcontinent.

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.760
[Amit Varma]: But then a particular school of thinking about religion wins out and that's a school of thought

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:19.120
[Amit Varma]: which is strong in the Gangetic Plain, which is why when you look at the DNA records from

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.960
[Amit Varma]: back then, you see there's a lot of endogamy, which is why, you know, David Reich once said

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:27.920
[Amit Varma]: that the Han Chinese are one big population, but Indians aren't one big population.

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.120
[Amit Varma]: They are a collection of many, many small populations because of the endogamy brought

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:38.320
[Amit Varma]: about by the caste system, which was a profound and mind-blowing insight for me when I heard

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.880
[Amit Varma]: about it from Tony and it's scientific fact.

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.800
[Amit Varma]: So could part of the reason for why the Ganga, you know, got this holy status is because

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:51.960
[Amit Varma]: of that, because of people who were living there, their narrative was a winning narrative

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.760
[Amit Varma]: for, you know, all these centuries.

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:58.960
[Guest]: Yeah, history is written by the winners is what you are saying and you're saying, I hadn't

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.000
[Guest]: quite thought of it in that way because once, when you live in South India, the Ganga does

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.320
[Guest]: not loom as large in your imagination as it does if you lived in the Gangetic Plain.

01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.560
[Guest]: But it totally makes sense, Amit.

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.040
[Guest]: And as you know, in the book, I've also asked, if you venerate the river so much, how can

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.160
[Guest]: you handle this pollution?

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:18.360
[Guest]: How can you pollute?

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:23.320
[Guest]: And I think the thing I came up with was the idea of pavitrata and gandhagi, the river

01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:26.280
[Guest]: can be dirty, but she's still pure.

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:32.520
[Guest]: And in India, as with many cultures, including Russia, we have this iconic image of a bird

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:35.000
[Guest]: with two heads facing in opposite directions.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.520
[Guest]: We call it gandaberunda in the South.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:46.560
[Guest]: And I think that idea of pavitrata and gandhagi is an excellent example of a two-headed bird

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.380
[Guest]: who is able to hold two contradictory ideas in your head.

01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:54.640
[Guest]: And I also ask in the book, I said, would the Ganga have been better served if she had

01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:55.640
[Guest]: been a he?

01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:59.080
[Guest]: If he had, if it had been a son instead of a daughter?

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:04.480
[Guest]: Because again, with this whole focus on the boy child in India, would we have taken better

01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:08.200
[Guest]: care of this river had it been a male?

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.980
[Guest]: But these are speculations, all our rivers are women.

01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:15.960
[Guest]: And all, we call her Mother Ganga, and a mother is somebody you take for granted.

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.640
[Guest]: You don't fear a mother.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:22.600
[Guest]: So had it been a father or a son, would we have taken better care of this river that

01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:24.600
[Guest]: we all so love?

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.660
[Guest]: And so again, I don't know the answer, but I raised the question in that chapter.

01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:33.480
[Amit Varma]: And that image that you painted in that chapter about, you know, all these people taking a

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:38.100
[Amit Varma]: holy dip in the Ganges as there's a dead buffalo floating just besides them.

01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:43.640
[Amit Varma]: It also struck me as a powerful metaphor for how we normalize all that is ugly about our

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:44.640
[Amit Varma]: society.

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:48.040
[Amit Varma]: For some people, the buffalo is invisible to them because they're in the holy Ganges.

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:53.000
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, in our society, we are surrounded by so much that is ugly and toxic, and it

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
[Amit Varma]: doesn't exist.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.400
[Amit Varma]: It's the unseen as it were.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, do you think that it makes sense at that level?

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:02.120
[Guest]: I've thought about this a lot, Amit.

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:09.000
[Guest]: I think, why are we so outraged by Catholic priests becoming, being pedophiles?

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:15.680
[Guest]: I think anything that religion does, we tend to think of it as the purveyors of faith to

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:19.160
[Guest]: be more pure, more holy, more good.

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:24.680
[Guest]: We ascribe a morality to the people who are surrounding faith that perhaps it doesn't

01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:28.680
[Guest]: exist as we have discovered time and time again in every faith.

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.500
[Guest]: It is the mullahs who are issuing the fatwas.

01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:35.440
[Guest]: It is the holiest of men who are raping children.

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:41.080
[Guest]: And here it is the, you know, the, what was the Hinduism correlation to exist at multiple

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.080
[Guest]: levels.

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:44.600
[Guest]: So is it a fallacy is what I'm asking.

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.600
[Guest]: Maybe we shouldn't.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:51.520
[Guest]: Maybe we should say that humans who practice faith and are devout are just as bad as the

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.520
[Guest]: rest of us.

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:58.720
[Guest]: Maybe that's the argument itself is flawed or what we ascribe to them.

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:02.200
[Guest]: We expect them to be holier than thou when they are not.

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.200
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:07.200
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to the slightly more cheerful subject of food now, where in this chapter

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.120
[Amit Varma]: on Kashi at one point, you write one among many delightful sentences in the book.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:16.440
[Amit Varma]: You write, quote, Chopin's nocturnes have nothing on the twin sounds of a jalebi and

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:20.040
[Amit Varma]: a kachori sizzling in oil right next to each other.

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:21.040
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:26.320
[Amit Varma]: And a little later you write, quote, an impassive man ladles aloo sabzi into one leaf bowl and

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.880
[Amit Varma]: the kachori in another.

01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:28.880
[Amit Varma]: Now comes a dilemma.

01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.040
[Amit Varma]: How to stand balance these two bowls in one hand and eat with the other.

01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:36.400
[Amit Varma]: The others around me are doing just fine, having years of practice.

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:41.600
[Amit Varma]: And obviously mouth is already watering, even though I'm on keto and I can't have all of

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:42.600
[Amit Varma]: this.

01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:48.600
[Amit Varma]: But this is, you know, tell me your experience, you know, eating this food and you know how

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.360
[Amit Varma]: all of that was.

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.040
[Guest]: I wish I could be a Kashi Vasi.

01:52:53.040 --> 01:53:00.120
[Guest]: I would move to Haridwar or Allahabad or any of I think I could live there and just for

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:01.120
[Guest]: the food.

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:06.520
[Guest]: And Kashi especially, you go to the Sankatamochan Hanuman temple, you have the Vedas and every

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:12.520
[Guest]: morning you have these beautifully dressed male priests who wear just a dhoti as it should

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:18.160
[Guest]: be worn with the kache in between your legs and little Ls on top, which is again, makes

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.760
[Guest]: sense for a tropical country like India.

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:24.880
[Guest]: And on a tangent, you go to Tamil Nadu, which is the hottest state, and you have these men,

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.720
[Guest]: young boys with tight jeans and full sleeve shirt and you're thinking, what are you thinking?

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:33.120
[Guest]: Why don't you wear a dhoti like all your ancestors did?

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.080
[Guest]: But that's my pet peeve with respect to textiles.

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:40.840
[Guest]: The food at North Indian temples to me was amazing, perhaps because I grew up here in

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:45.560
[Guest]: the south and I used to the payasam and the neyappam and everything.

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.640
[Guest]: I found Jaipur to be a fantastic food town.

01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:52.080
[Guest]: I found Kashi, definitely Haridwar.

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.000
[Guest]: They would be my top three picks.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.120
[Guest]: Puri, the bhog is what is most famous about it.

01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:02.680
[Guest]: But again, because they make an attempt to hold on to the root vegetables and tubers

01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:06.960
[Guest]: that are indigenous of India, and also the spices that are indigenous.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:11.000
[Guest]: I would say it is simple food and not the spicy food that I like.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:18.120
[Guest]: Puri was a food town, as a food temple, it fell a little below Kashi, but Kashi was a

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:19.120
[Guest]: gastronomic paradise.

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:20.120
[Guest]: I mean, Haridwar too.

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:21.120
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:27.680
[Amit Varma]: And you've also spoken about how, you know, peras can be considered by some as a fertility

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:28.680
[Amit Varma]: tonic.

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:32.880
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, someone told you, quote, a good pera should make your tongue clap.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:33.880
[Guest]: Stop.

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:34.880
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:35.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:39.040
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not, I'm not one who likes sweets.

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:44.560
[Guest]: I think if I, like you said earlier, my desert island food or last meal food would be a samosa

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.560
[Guest]: or a kachori.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:49.040
[Guest]: But yeah, I would make an exception to this pera.

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.040
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.040
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:52.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm not a desert person either.

01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:54.720
[Amit Varma]: But if I ever go to Kashi, I promise to try the pera.

01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:00.080
[Amit Varma]: You also talk about the sesame rice, besan ka sheera and thandai with bhang.

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.200
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, there was a time and, you know, I'll take this tangent to ask you a question

01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:09.080
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, thandai with bhang gives the impression and bhang, of course, is from the

01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:13.920
[Amit Varma]: cannabis plant and gives the impression of Hindus and the religion as being really chilled

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:14.920
[Amit Varma]: out having fun.

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:20.680
[Amit Varma]: And you go back and you've spoken about how there is so much erotica, not just in Khajuraho

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:26.920
[Amit Varma]: and Ajanta Ellora and wherever, but even in our myths and you've quoted some stuff about,

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:32.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, very raunchy action between gods that is happening, which I won't read out

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:35.560
[Amit Varma]: now because who knows, we might have a family audience, are their children listening to

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:36.880
[Amit Varma]: this?

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:39.360
[Amit Varma]: And so what kind of happened?

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:45.280
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, you get the sense that there is sort of one way of interpreting Hinduism

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:50.280
[Amit Varma]: or living Hinduism or living the culture of our land, which is full of fun, which is joyful,

01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:55.560
[Amit Varma]: which is, you know, embracing the sensual pleasures as they often still do with regard

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:56.680
[Amit Varma]: to food.

01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:01.520
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, there's also a clash between a certain kind of almost a new Puritanism

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.880
[Amit Varma]: that has kind of come up, which frowns upon all these pleasures.

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:08.200
[Amit Varma]: What's your sense of this evolution?

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:13.920
[Amit Varma]: Are the two coexisting or is there actually a kind of a clash between them with one losing

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:14.920
[Guest]: out?

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:19.600
[Guest]: So I think it was a clash, my answer and my theory would be it was a clash of the civilizations

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:25.720
[Guest]: and I would blame to a large extent being colonized on it for the reason for the Puritanism.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:31.600
[Guest]: I think that when you had colonial masters whose gaze was very distant and who ascribed

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:37.880
[Guest]: value judgments to the way we dress and the way we live, even today, the white man as

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:43.160
[Guest]: an immigrant, I can tell you when you live around white men, you develop a complex that

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.760
[Guest]: somehow you have to live up to them and there's a certain sense of inferiority.

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:52.600
[Guest]: So I think colonizing India, you could say the British gave up the railways and tea culture

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:55.160
[Guest]: and everything, but they just took away a lot.

01:56:55.160 --> 01:57:00.840
[Guest]: And one of the things they took away was our sense of unselfconsciousness about our body

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:06.800
[Guest]: and the clothes we wear, the, you know, this prudishness about the breasts and the body

01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:09.080
[Guest]: and the saris and everything.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:14.920
[Guest]: And as you point out in the book, the sensuousness of faith was lost, was shorn, was cut off

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:19.360
[Guest]: completely because our colonial masters would not have any of it.

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.280
[Guest]: The Victorian norms that they were used to where if the body was bound and corseted and

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:30.800
[Guest]: sort of, you know, we say in India today that the girls are asked to, you know, cover their

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:32.280
[Guest]: bodies and everything.

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:37.360
[Guest]: I think that the Victorians, they handed it down to us before that, and you see some of

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:43.360
[Guest]: the old photographs of tribal women, it's very self-confident, it's very accepting of

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.360
[Guest]: their own body.

01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:51.600
[Guest]: So I would blame the clash of the civilizations when the colonial colonization of India happened

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:55.960
[Guest]: that led to this, as you say, call it puritanism and prudishness.

01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.240
[Amit Varma]: No, absolutely.

01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:00.400
[Amit Varma]: And this is something many people don't realize, the thing that this prudishness is somehow

01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:02.480
[Amit Varma]: sanskari as it were part of our culture.

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:07.720
[Amit Varma]: I did a great episode on Kerala with Manu Pillai, where he spoke about this as well,

01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:13.040
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, till we were colonized, the women used to walk around bare breasted and,

01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:16.540
[Amit Varma]: you know, it wasn't thought about as something erotic or something that will make the men

01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:20.640
[Amit Varma]: lose control or something that should involve any kind of shame.

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And all of that changed with the Victorian values of the British, which somehow magically

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:29.460
[Amit Varma]: then became part of our sanskar.

01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:34.160
[Amit Varma]: So I'll kind of not look at the next couple of chapters in detail, though I love them,

01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:38.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, in Ajmer, you talk about kesariya bhaat, which is all vegetarian, but there's

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:43.440
[Amit Varma]: also the story about how Shah Jahan mixed, you know, the blood of a nilgai or a blue

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:45.440
[Amit Varma]: bull in there.

01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And you also talk about how Akbar started this tradition of the bari deg, a cauldron

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:56.040
[Amit Varma]: so big that you could feed 15,000 people from that one cauldron, which was delightful.

01:58:56.040 --> 01:59:01.680
[Amit Varma]: In Palani, you write about the panchamritham or the five nectars and again, how they are

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:07.480
[Amit Varma]: composed is all local circumstances and it's all automated production now, which is, you

01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:11.200
[Amit Varma]: know, with the changing times or once upon a time, you know, people used to prepare it

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.200
[Amit Varma]: by stamping on it.

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:16.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, I was interested by something that I read in the chapter after that, which is about

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:20.160
[Amit Varma]: Mumbai and which is about the Benes Israelis.

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And there, right at the start, you speak about how you were talking to an aunt of yours about

01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:30.940
[Amit Varma]: Jewish people, and she wasn't so familiar with them.

01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:34.320
[Amit Varma]: And then you had to tell her that you remember in Kochi, there was a place called Jew town

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:40.000
[Amit Varma]: where the Jews were from, and she remarked, quote, Jew town, where good cardamom was available,

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.640
[Amit Varma]: And that association of a people with the food, you know, how strong is that in different

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:47.880
[Amit Varma]: parts of the country?

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:51.960
[Amit Varma]: And I don't just mean a religion with a food, but different peoples in different places

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:53.640
[Amit Varma]: with certain kinds of food.

01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:57.760
[Amit Varma]: And the other danger that then comes about is the danger of essentialism.

01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:02.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, when we are describing something, it is natural to try to get to the essence of

02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:03.800
[Amit Varma]: it.

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you write about the Sikhs, that one of the beautiful things about the Sikhs, which

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.360
[Amit Varma]: we think of and which fills even me with emotion when I think of all that they have done is

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:19.600
[Amit Varma]: their langars, their, you know, that whole tradition of service of feeding people and

02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:20.700
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:25.760
[Amit Varma]: And you've pointed out different things about each of the religions, which are native to

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:26.760
[Amit Varma]: that.

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:31.440
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, you can look at these sort of these attributes that you associate

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.900
[Amit Varma]: with a religion or particular foods that you associate with a religion.

02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:40.640
[Amit Varma]: But where do you cross the line into essentialism, where you're simplifying too much and perhaps

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:44.440
[Amit Varma]: do a disservice to the complexity of a tradition?

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.760
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you've thought about?

02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:54.360
[Guest]: Yeah, I think the essentialism comes about when you have to explain the faith to a mass

02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:59.600
[Guest]: audience, not a follower or a group that is local and standing in front of you.

02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:06.560
[Guest]: I think what happens with television, the media, or now with YouTube, where people are

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:10.840
[Guest]: looking for takeaways, and I do that too in my book, I end each chapter with the takeaway.

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:15.920
[Guest]: So once you get into this takeaway culture or life hacks or anything, you are forced

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:20.080
[Guest]: to explain, you're forced to leave out the nuances for the soundbite.

02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:27.080
[Guest]: So I think that when you get into that culture, what you say becomes the norm, Amit.

02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:30.000
[Guest]: And the question is, is that good or bad?

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.960
[Guest]: And I don't think you've raised it, but I haven't made up my mind about it.

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:39.520
[Guest]: Because on the one hand, it would be great for me to understand the Parsi faith in one

02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.520
[Guest]: paragraph.

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:45.120
[Guest]: But that is what that would be essentialism, it would leave out all of the nuances out

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:46.120
[Guest]: of it.

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:49.160
[Guest]: But at least I would have a semblance of some knowledge on it.

02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.480
[Guest]: I think unfortunately, or fortunately, we are moving towards a time when this will become

02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:59.240
[Guest]: more and more Amit, because as you know, there are apps that say, oh, don't have the time

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:03.440
[Guest]: to read a book, here, read the paragraph and we'll condense it for you.

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:06.800
[Guest]: Don't have the time to scan magazines, we will give it to you.

02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:10.560
[Guest]: And there's one called Blinkist, where you blink and you'll get some knowledge.

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:17.320
[Guest]: So essentialism is a feature of our time, I think it is hard to escape it.

02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, perhaps both a feature and a bug in different ways.

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:25.560
[Amit Varma]: And in that chapter on Jews, you talk about how they share halva with us, you know, and

02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.320
[Amit Varma]: a delightful little throwaway line about how chicken soup is sometimes known as Jewish

02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:37.000
[Amit Varma]: penicillin, which speaks to the medical properties and how a particular ritual that they have

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.440
[Amit Varma]: involves what might well be poha.

02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:41.880
[Amit Varma]: So that's interesting to me.

02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And also how, you know, Chitravan Brahmans might actually be Bene Israelis, you know,

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:53.080
[Amit Varma]: similarities such as, you know, Aptekar and Apte, and Aptekar is, by the way, a name from

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.560
[Amit Varma]: there and we might have adapted it to Apte.

02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.520
[Amit Varma]: So that's a very interesting speculation, which listeners might enjoy.

02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:02.440
[Guest]: Let me move on to now talking about...

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:08.960
[Guest]: If I can interject, so to your point about chicken soup and penicillin, in Tamil households,

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:11.520
[Guest]: when a child falls sick, we give them rasam.

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:17.760
[Guest]: And one of my pet projects is to find out what different states or regions have as their

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.760
[Guest]: chicken soup, quote-unquote, the proverb.

02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:25.520
[Guest]: I mean, what would a sick child in Maharashtra get, for example, or in not even Maharashtra,

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:32.800
[Guest]: say Kolhapur or Nashik or different parts, for example, what would a child in Kerala

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:33.800
[Guest]: get?

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:35.040
[Guest]: Probably a fish gruel, some thought.

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:40.440
[Guest]: So that would be a fun exercise to go to different parts and find out what is the equivalent

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:44.720
[Guest]: food that you give when a child is sick, the gruel or the rasam.

02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:45.720
[Amit Varma]: That's so fascinating.

02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:46.720
[Amit Varma]: What did you get, Amit?

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:47.720
[Guest]: As a kid?

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:48.720
[Guest]: When you were sick?

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:49.720
[Guest]: Hmm.

02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:50.720
[Amit Varma]: Specifically to when you were sick?

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Shobha, I'll confess to you that I got chicken soup.

02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:01.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, that's the privilege of growing up in a certain kind of family, I guess.

02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:04.920
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I love rasam and I'm interested in finding this out.

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:09.560
[Amit Varma]: And can I ask our listeners if they have answers to these questions to maybe write to you on

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:10.560
[Guest]: Twitter or something?

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:11.560
[Guest]: Tag you on Twitter?

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:12.560
[Guest]: That would be fantastic.

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.360
[Guest]: What did you eat as a kid when you were sick?

02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:15.400
[Guest]: What did your mom give you?

02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:16.760
[Guest]: Not even what you ate.

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:18.720
[Amit Varma]: What did your mother give you?

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:19.720
[Amit Varma]: What a wonderful question.

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:22.000
[Amit Varma]: So please, guys, you heard it here.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.760
[Amit Varma]: Please tag Shobha and let her know.

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:26.200
[Amit Varma]: Maybe we'll just start a thread with it.

02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:28.640
[Amit Varma]: So it's all in one place.

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:32.760
[Amit Varma]: I'll now move on to, you know, another of my favorite dishes, which is again now just

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:36.240
[Amit Varma]: talking about it and reading your description of it is tempting me to come out of keto,

02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:41.560
[Amit Varma]: which is when you talk about Madurai and you're talking about the prasadam there.

02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:47.040
[Amit Varma]: You talk at length about dosa, why the dosa there is so incredibly unique and all of that.

02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.920
[Guest]: Tell me a little bit about that.

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:53.800
[Guest]: In Madurai, it was one of the few temples where it was a savory prasadam.

02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:58.680
[Guest]: And I, as I've told you before, I prefer savories to sweets.

02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:00.200
[Guest]: So that's what blew me away.

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:02.360
[Guest]: But also that it was unusual.

02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:06.400
[Guest]: And this I asked the priest there, why have you chosen this dosa?

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:12.120
[Guest]: This dosa is the one that's offered to God is about the size of a tire, a car tire.

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:19.040
[Guest]: The one that is sold as prasadam is about the size of a personal pan pizza or maybe

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:20.480
[Guest]: slightly smaller.

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:26.320
[Guest]: But the one that is offered is huge and it is deep fried in ghee and contains all good

02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:27.320
[Guest]: things.

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:28.880
[Guest]: It was my favorite prasadam to eat.

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:32.360
[Guest]: So I asked the priest there, why did you choose this dosa?

02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:36.680
[Guest]: And he said, it is a larger version of the Tirumal Vadai that is given to Lord Balaji

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:37.680
[Guest]: in Tirupati.

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:43.080
[Guest]: So this was a kind of a borrowing of a tradition and making it your own.

02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:48.160
[Guest]: And the other thing that I loved about this Madurai Azhagar Kovil is that it is not a

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:53.160
[Guest]: rock star temple, but it is a hoary, it has a hoary history.

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:59.080
[Guest]: So I went with all good intentions to write about Meenakshi, the warrior goddess who rode

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:02.360
[Guest]: a horse and conquered armies.

02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:06.280
[Guest]: But then somebody told me about this other temple with a more interesting prasadam and

02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:08.240
[Guest]: that's what made it to the book.

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.680
[Amit Varma]: And what's your favorite kind of dosa?

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:13.280
[Amit Varma]: Because my friends in Bangalore and Chennai will often argue about what is the best kind

02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:15.720
[Amit Varma]: of dosa and so on and so forth.

02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:19.480
[Amit Varma]: And I love having dosa in Bangalore whenever I go there, especially MTR and all because

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:23.760
[Amit Varma]: and actually any place out there, Adigarh, MTR, I just love the dosa there.

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:27.520
[Guest]: You don't get stuff like that in Bombay, where do you stand?

02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:30.080
[Guest]: You should go to CTR or Central Tiffin Room.

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:32.400
[Guest]: They have a very good benne dosa.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:36.640
[Guest]: You should have idli and Brahmin coffee in Shamrajpet, but the dosa you should go to

02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:38.720
[Amit Varma]: Vidyarthi Bhavan or CTR.

02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:39.720
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful.

02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:43.880
[Amit Varma]: And I'll again take another tangent from sort of the subject of food and, you know, quote

02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:48.360
[Amit Varma]: a paragraph that you've written in that chapter on Madurai, which I found fascinating because

02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:52.920
[Amit Varma]: it underscored a point I kind of keep making that the kind of work that you do shapes you.

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:57.080
[Amit Varma]: For example, I wrote a post about this in my newsletter about how the form that you

02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:59.400
[Amit Varma]: choose to work in will shape your work.

02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:01.940
[Amit Varma]: And therefore the work that you choose to do will shape you.

02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:06.240
[Amit Varma]: So a simple decision about what form you take can change the person that you are.

02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:10.120
[Amit Varma]: For example, I have to think differently when I'm doing a three hour long form conversation

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:15.000
[Amit Varma]: podcast than if I was doing like 15 minute things, I think, you know, my thinking on

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.600
[Amit Varma]: any subject would be far shallower than.

02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And I was reminded of that by this fascinating paragraph from that chapter, I'll read it

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:22.800
[Amit Varma]: out.

02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:27.600
[Amit Varma]: Quote, in a 2015 paper published in the journal Neuroimage, a team of scientists from the

02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:32.960
[Amit Varma]: Center for Mind-Brain Sciences at the University of Trento, Italy studied the brains of professional

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:39.760
[Amit Varma]: Vedic Sanskrit pundits in India who were used to memorizing and reciting 40,000 to 100,000

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:45.240
[Amit Varma]: word oral texts and discovered, and now this is a quote from the study, massive gray matter

02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:50.120
[Amit Varma]: density and cortical thickness increase, you know, that quote stops in the brains of the

02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:55.080
[Amit Varma]: Vedic priests, somewhat similar to what was seen in London taxi drivers in previous studies.

02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:59.640
[Amit Varma]: The paper, which is available online is fascinating not only because it describes how the Vedic

02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:05.720
[Amit Varma]: priest brains changed, but also because it talks about the subjects and their training.

02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:06.720
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:09.720
[Amit Varma]: And I don't really have a question here, but I absolutely loved your observation after

02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:14.840
[Amit Varma]: this that these are not people who could have gotten that gray matter because they got it

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:19.080
[Amit Varma]: in their genes and they descended from some particular family or whatever.

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:22.480
[Amit Varma]: The boys were more or less picked in a kind of a random way.

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:26.680
[Amit Varma]: They could just come from anywhere and obviously these are boys only, and they could really

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:31.840
[Amit Varma]: come from anywhere and their brains changed because of the kind of study and the work

02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:36.720
[Amit Varma]: that they did, which is so fascinating to me and something that I just wanted to point

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:42.600
[Amit Varma]: out to listeners that the things that you do shapes who you are in, you know, fundamental

02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:46.800
[Amit Varma]: ways that can even be physiological.

02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:50.480
[Amit Varma]: So this was quite a sort of a TIL moment for me.

02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:52.720
[Amit Varma]: You have any, you know, further thoughts on this?

02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:53.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:58.880
[Guest]: So this is something Wendy Doniger points out in one of her books, I mean, is that she

02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:05.200
[Guest]: says India as a civilization has Shruti literature, she differentiates between Shruti and Smriti.

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:10.720
[Guest]: Shruti literature is just third literature and that's how it was transmitted for hundreds

02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:15.520
[Guest]: of thousands of years and Smriti is when it started being written down.

02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:21.320
[Guest]: And her point was that the Shruti literature was preserved unchanged with the meter and

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:27.320
[Guest]: the way of intonation for hundreds of thousands of years, contradicting the point of view

02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.520
[Guest]: that says if you want to remember something and if you want to preserve it, write it down.

02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:38.480
[Guest]: So India was a living example of how a culture preserved many texts, all the Brahmanas, all

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:42.400
[Guest]: the Vedas, for hundreds of thousands of years just by listening.

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:49.520
[Guest]: So we as a culture have a propensity for remembering things and we should not squander it.

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:53.880
[Guest]: Even the epic of Gilgamesh, which is one of the oldest books in the world, it was preserved

02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:55.440
[Guest]: as writing on stone tablets.

02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:02.080
[Guest]: There was no oral passing on, whereas here in India, we passed on orally our music.

02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:03.080
[Guest]: It was all oral.

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:08.520
[Guest]: So as a culture, if you believe that there are traits that belong to a culture, oral

02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:12.760
[Guest]: listening and remembering is one of ours and we should seize it and embrace it and make

02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.760
[Amit Varma]: it our own.

02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:16.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and maybe we should kind of make a conscious effort to do it.

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, like my writing students will often tell me that there are so many good apps,

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:22.840
[Amit Varma]: I can use Grammarly or the Hemingway app and should I do that?

02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.840
[Amit Varma]: And my answer always is that if it helps you, please use it.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:27.280
[Amit Varma]: If it brings value, please use it.

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:31.380
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, you have to learn to think for yourself about what is good writing

02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:37.740
[Amit Varma]: and what isn't and how you want to write and you know, you can't lose the ability to sort

02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:43.080
[Amit Varma]: of think for yourself as you know, you and I have been forced to do for so many years

02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:46.680
[Amit Varma]: and writing hundreds and hundreds of columns.

02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:50.880
[Amit Varma]: So after your Madurai chapter, you had a great chapter on Jaipur, an interesting brief chapter

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:56.080
[Amit Varma]: on Goa where I was struck by this quote, which I'm going to ask you to elaborate upon, where

02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:02.400
[Amit Varma]: you quoted Gerard de Kuna once telling you, quote, Portugal did Goa a great favor.

02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:05.080
[Amit Varma]: We were cut off from the shackles of Indian tradition.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.560
[Amit Varma]: We were forced to look outside, stop quote, tell me a little bit about this.

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:13.140
[Amit Varma]: And I presume at least part of this is in the context of food.

02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:16.800
[Amit Varma]: And just another aside, I remember when I would spend time in Macau, Macau was also

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:18.920
[Amit Varma]: once colonized by the Portuguese.

02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:23.760
[Amit Varma]: And I'd actually noticed some similarities in certain items of theirs and what you could

02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:25.720
[Amit Varma]: get in Goa.

02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:30.880
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, but, you know, just elaborate on his point for me, because again, I found

02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:31.880
[Amit Varma]: this quite fascinating.

02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:32.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:36.440
[Guest]: So, I mean, Goa is a place that all of India loves.

02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:42.040
[Guest]: I think my view into Goa was shaped largely by the late great Wendell Rodericks, the designer

02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:49.640
[Guest]: who showed me how in his own village in Golwale, the ancient tribal traditions coexisted with

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:54.600
[Guest]: the Hindu past and a Christian present and what Gerard de Kuna said about Portugal.

02:11:54.600 --> 02:12:02.400
[Guest]: I think what my takeaway was from his quote is that any time you have Portugal in a sense

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:07.200
[Guest]: made Goans immigrants in their own land, because you come in as a conqueror and you enforce

02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:09.040
[Guest]: certain norms on the people.

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:13.280
[Guest]: And then what happens is as citizens, you're forced to choose between your master and your

02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:14.280
[Guest]: tradition.

02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:16.840
[Guest]: And a lot of Goans chose Portugal as their mother tongue.

02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:20.240
[Guest]: I quote Mario Miranda saying Portuguese is my mother tongue.

02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:25.640
[Guest]: So, what ends up happening to differentiate it from, say, Kerala, where the colonizing

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:32.840
[Guest]: was more religious with St. Thomas and everything was that Goans felt very adept and easy about

02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:41.120
[Guest]: adopting music from Portugal, clothes, the language, and it cuts off the shackles of

02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:42.720
[Guest]: the past and what he was saying.

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:47.320
[Guest]: And I could, and anyone who goes to Goa today can even today see it, because you see they're

02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:53.040
[Guest]: very avant-garde in their thinking, in the fashions they follow, restaurants they open,

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:54.040
[Guest]: the life they lead.

02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:59.200
[Guest]: It's a very symbiotic culture, which has a little bit of the Portugal influence, a little

02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.400
[Guest]: bit of the Hindus, a little bit of the Christian.

02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:03.800
[Guest]: So, it's a very Jowadi weave.

02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:05.120
[Guest]: So, I loved it.

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:08.720
[Guest]: And I think that's why most Indians love Goa and go there often.

02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Yes, it's a fascinating example of being exposed to the world without actually having to go

02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:15.320
[Amit Varma]: anywhere.

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.600
[Amit Varma]: It's almost kind of right here.

02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.600
[Amit Varma]: You said it better than me.

02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:22.240
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I can't say it better than you.

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:24.600
[Amit Varma]: Your book has so many wonderful moments.

02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:28.880
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote another bit about food to get back to food, because who can resist it?

02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:33.400
[Amit Varma]: And this is from your chapter about Thiruvanthapuram, which has a subtitle of the Elephant God's

02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Fried Dumplings.

02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And you write here about Uniappam and you say, quote, you know, before I embark upon

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.760
[Amit Varma]: this quote, all my South Indian listeners, please forgive my pronunciations.

02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:47.480
[Amit Varma]: Do remember that I am, after all, an Amit.

02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:48.480
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:54.400
[Amit Varma]: Quote, Kottarakara Temple is known for its Uniappam, or fried dumplings made with rice

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.400
[Amit Varma]: flour, coconut, jaggery, ghee, dry ginger, cardamom and quiche banana, a local variety

02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.520
[Amit Varma]: known as Palayam Thodan.

02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.960
[Amit Varma]: They are loosely mixed in giant vats and fried in ghee or oil on a slow day.

02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:13.560
[Amit Varma]: The temple makes 50,000 such dumplings, a number that can rise to 170,000 during festivals,

02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:15.320
[Amit Varma]: according to Mohan Thirumeni.

02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:20.920
[Amit Varma]: Unusual for temples, these Uniappams are cooked in front of the deity in an alcove rather

02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:24.180
[Amit Varma]: than in a separate secret chamber.

02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And in another part in your chapter on Puri, you know, you've written about the sort of

02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:34.640
[Amit Varma]: elaborate work that goes into making their Chappan Bhog.

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:40.160
[Amit Varma]: The Chappan Bhog, by the way, has 56 ingredients, which is why it's called Chappan Bhog.

02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:43.560
[Amit Varma]: The Amitanmi is useful now, Chappan is 56 in Hindi.

02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:49.160
[Amit Varma]: And you speak about how, quote, no outsider is allowed inside the temple kitchen except

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:54.000
[Amit Varma]: the 1,000 male cooks who make 56 different kinds of offerings called Chappan Bhog to

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.640
[Amit Varma]: serve to the gods six times a day.

02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:00.040
[Amit Varma]: The list of dishes isn't just 56, it runs to the hundreds.

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:02.560
[Amit Varma]: The lord along with his family likes variety.

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:07.360
[Amit Varma]: The sweet dishes alone are of over 50 types, including several types of laddus, malpua,

02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:10.360
[Amit Varma]: kheer and roshagulla, making this a diabetics nightmare.

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.760
[Amit Varma]: Thankfully, there are also boiled rice dishes, lentil based ones, vegetable curries and their

02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:17.000
[Amit Varma]: permutations and combinations.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.240
[Amit Varma]: Food is central to worship in this temple because you see Lord Vishnu dines here, stop

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:23.240
[Amit Varma]: quote.

02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:25.520
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just fascinated by the scale of this.

02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:31.520
[Amit Varma]: Like we often read about how, you know, churches in Europe were built to be so grand because

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:37.280
[Amit Varma]: they wanted that to give, you know, devotees a sense of how grand religion is so that they

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:41.640
[Amit Varma]: would feel that sense of awe towards their God, you know, and just reading about the

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:45.800
[Amit Varma]: kind of scale at which this kind of cooking is being done.

02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.720
[Amit Varma]: And it's not just these 1,000 cooks later on, you point out about how the kitchens are

02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:56.480
[Amit Varma]: spread out over an acre and you have 200 junior cooks who are not allowed to enter the kitchens

02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:02.280
[Amit Varma]: who are doing the prep work and they're grating hundreds of coconuts while chanting the name

02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.120
[Amit Varma]: of the Lord.

02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.940
[Amit Varma]: And they're also chopping vegetables.

02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:07.200
[Amit Varma]: This is crazy.

02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:08.200
[Amit Varma]: This scale is mind-blowing.

02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:13.640
[Amit Varma]: Although you didn't go into the kitchen in Puri, you did enter many of the other kitchens.

02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:17.800
[Amit Varma]: What was and you also, of course, in the West entered the commercial kitchens of some of

02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:19.640
[Amit Varma]: the best restaurants in the world.

02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:24.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, give me a sense of how that feeling was about entering these kitchens, seeing

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:25.200
[Amit Varma]: this work.

02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:29.480
[Guest]: So remember that experiment I said go to a temple during the course of this year if you

02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:33.680
[Guest]: just want to see if you have it in you to become faithful or devout.

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:39.160
[Guest]: I would say start with Puri because it is a majestic, marvelous temple in every sense

02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:40.160
[Guest]: of the word.

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:45.600
[Guest]: It is a temple with a history and an amalgamation that is so fantastic.

02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:51.120
[Guest]: It is has every faith that was prominent in India of the time being part of this temple.

02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:54.120
[Guest]: And as far as the cooking goes, it was very, it is very tantric.

02:16:54.120 --> 02:17:00.120
[Guest]: You couldn't enter, but they have 752 chulas or wood-fired stoves.

02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:05.680
[Guest]: Each of the chulas I'm told is a tantric design with many triangles.

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.080
[Guest]: And the cook, one of the most poignant things during that trip was one of the priest cook.

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:17.120
[Guest]: I mean, the Suaras told me that if I think even for a moment that I am the one cooking,

02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:23.480
[Guest]: the nine pots will shatter because actually it is goddess Vimala who is cooking the food.

02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:27.640
[Guest]: And he, you know, it's hard to convey that in a book, but he actually believed that.

02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:31.200
[Guest]: He wasn't, his stance, his eyes told me.

02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:34.360
[Guest]: So to me, that is a sublimation of ego.

02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.280
[Guest]: You know, in many temples, the priests become holier than thou.

02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:41.280
[Guest]: They think I'm doing Lord's work and therefore I am holy.

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:47.240
[Guest]: But whereas in the, I think when you are cooking temple food, you don't have the grandiosity

02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:52.160
[Guest]: of coming that comes with a priest who stands and does the chanting and throwing of flowers

02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:53.160
[Guest]: in front of God.

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.920
[Guest]: So in a sense, I found, remember we talked about being holier than thou, not having the

02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:01.640
[Guest]: hypocrisies and the petty egos.

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:03.200
[Guest]: Temple cooks have that.

02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:09.240
[Guest]: That you want to experience divine sublimation of the ego through humility in the presence

02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:10.240
[Guest]: of the divine.

02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:11.240
[Guest]: Talk to the temple cook.

02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:17.200
[Guest]: And in Jagannath Puri, especially because it's a very, they believe really deeply in

02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:18.200
[Guest]: the tantric notion.

02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:19.200
[Guest]: There are nine pots.

02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.240
[Guest]: Nine is a very prominent number in Hinduism.

02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:28.240
[Guest]: You have Navaratna, Navarasa, Navagraha, the planets, and they have nine pots stacked on

02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:33.480
[Guest]: top of each other on these wood fires and they each cook and each of the families are

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:35.760
[Guest]: able to sell it and make money off of it.

02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:41.040
[Guest]: These temple cooks, I found what I was looking for and what we talked about earlier, which

02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:46.480
[Guest]: is where you're truly humble, authentically humble and not kind of showing off and saying

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:49.720
[Guest]: I'm a messenger of God and therefore I'm better than you.

02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:54.040
[Guest]: These guys actually had a taste of the divine, literally and figuratively.

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:55.040
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:58.880
[Amit Varma]: I guess just cooking, just chopping endless vegetables or whatever the processes are,

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:03.040
[Amit Varma]: is a kind of sadhana in itself, I guess, you know, if you're just, there you go, like a

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:07.720
[Amit Varma]: physical meditation almost, you're just, you know, doing the same thing again and again.

02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:10.000
[Amit Varma]: I also love the chapter on the Kumbh Mela.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:13.920
[Amit Varma]: And I have a question based on that, where at one point you quote this gentleman called

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:18.760
[Amit Varma]: Swami Avdeshanand, where he's talking about diversity, which is spoken about before.

02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:24.080
[Amit Varma]: And he says, quote, Hinduism is a very diverse religion with many parts to God, puja, meditation,

02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:27.840
[Amit Varma]: yoga, pranayama, pilgrimages, fast, chanting and satsangh.

02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:30.400
[Amit Varma]: The Kumbh is where all this diversity comes together.

02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:36.480
[Amit Varma]: But more than this, I was struck by something that again, the same Swami Avdeshanandji said

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:42.660
[Amit Varma]: a little before that, where he says, quote, the Kumbh Mela is a symbol of a secular democracy

02:19:42.660 --> 02:19:43.660
[Amit Varma]: in action.

02:19:43.660 --> 02:19:48.720
[Amit Varma]: For example, most of the Hindu religious offerings used in the Kumbh are packaged by Muslim

02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:54.280
[Amit Varma]: craftsmen and the music bands have Muslim and Christian performers, stop quote.

02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:58.840
[Amit Varma]: And elsewhere, you speak about how, you know, at Ajmer Sharif, when you go or in the churches

02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:04.680
[Amit Varma]: of Goa, Hindus are taking part everywhere and they are kind of sort of involved.

02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:10.880
[Amit Varma]: And so it seems to me that whereas in politics, we have developed almost an exclusionary view

02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:17.280
[Amit Varma]: of religion in our culture, there is an embrace of, you know, of everything.

02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:20.600
[Amit Varma]: And this seems to me to be a strange kind of contradiction.

02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:26.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I remember I once had politician and thinker JP Narayan on my show, episode 149.

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:30.520
[Amit Varma]: And I said something about India being an illiberal society because of the misogyny

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:31.800
[Amit Varma]: and caste and whatever.

02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:36.400
[Amit Varma]: And he said, no, it's also if you look at it another way, it's also a very liberal society.

02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:40.600
[Amit Varma]: Because in our lived experience, the way we assimilate everything from everywhere, in

02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:42.840
[Amit Varma]: that there's also a lot of tolerance there.

02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:44.680
[Amit Varma]: And both of these are, of course, true.

02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:50.120
[Amit Varma]: But what is your sense of going to all of these places that, you know, is the only view

02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:57.560
[Amit Varma]: of religion you see this open, warm embrace that takes everybody in or do you also sort

02:20:57.560 --> 02:20:59.560
[Amit Varma]: of see the other side of it?

02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:01.200
[Guest]: Yeah, I'll go back.

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:05.880
[Guest]: First of all, I'm blown away that you remember that JP Narayan was episode 149.

02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:12.960
[Guest]: So you clearly have a phenomenal memory for things, compliments on that.

02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:17.720
[Guest]: But to answer your question, I'm going back to the Gandha Berunda, which is the eagle

02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:21.360
[Guest]: who's with two heads looking on either direction.

02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:27.640
[Guest]: And I think that we are, I would agree with Mr. JP Narayan that intrinsically, if you

02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:34.000
[Guest]: are born in this earth, in India, you are raised, it's part of the water we drink and

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.000
[Guest]: this tolerance.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.140
[Guest]: And I'll give you specific examples, I think revealed preference, they call it in economics.

02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:46.600
[Guest]: My mother, for example, when the Babri judgment was passed, said Jai Shri Ram and you see

02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:50.040
[Guest]: her, she is a devout Hindu.

02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:56.440
[Guest]: But because my brother had many Muslim friends, she visited their homes and became friendly

02:21:56.440 --> 02:21:57.440
[Guest]: with them.

02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:02.520
[Guest]: So I think that if you look at the way these festivals are done, I wish I could attend

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:07.480
[Guest]: Bombay's Ganesh Chaturthi, but I'm told it's the same there where the craftsmen of all

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:10.720
[Guest]: states make different parts of the giant idols.

02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:12.960
[Guest]: And for example, the chariots are made by.

02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:18.240
[Guest]: So I think that on the one hand, we have the politics of religion that is being used to

02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:19.700
[Guest]: win elections.

02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:26.240
[Guest]: But in Bangalore, where I live, Hindus attend infant Jesus and pray to the mother when they

02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:27.240
[Guest]: want children.

02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:34.080
[Guest]: The Ajmer Darga is the Ganga Jamuna Sanskriti, as they call it.

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.680
[Guest]: I love Sufi music.

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:41.600
[Guest]: If you live, if you see our lived experience, it's hard not to be tolerant and embracing

02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:43.840
[Guest]: of all faiths, because guess what?

02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:45.880
[Guest]: They have so much to offer.

02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:50.200
[Guest]: How can you not partake when it's available to you on offer?

02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:54.960
[Guest]: And in India, we have the glory of multiple faiths and their invention.

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:56.880
[Guest]: You'd be stupid to not absorb.

02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:58.360
[Guest]: And I think Indians do.

02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:05.720
[Guest]: It is and I think the Indians who live in communities where all the major faiths are

02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:11.280
[Guest]: jostling side by side, their experience of India is very different from ours who read,

02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:16.120
[Guest]: who watch the news and therefore form opinions about the politics of religion and without

02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:17.360
[Guest]: much of a lived experience.

02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:23.320
[Guest]: So I think, yes, I agree with Mr. Narayan that as a nation, we are deeply tolerant and

02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:25.760
[Guest]: that will eventually be our salvation.

02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:29.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I did an episode with Anshul Malhotra recently.

02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:32.560
[Amit Varma]: She's written that remarkable book on partition.

02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the sort of points that came up there was that, you know, when we hate each

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:44.200
[Amit Varma]: other, what we are hating is abstractions, you know, an abstract notion of the other.

02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:47.920
[Amit Varma]: But what we embrace of the other are all the concrete little things.

02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:53.760
[Amit Varma]: And to me, a lot of these concrete things are, you know, they're in the food where,

02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:59.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, what we eat is actually the most assimilative melting pot that you can possibly

02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:00.120
[Amit Varma]: imagine.

02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one would hope that one day Indian politics can become a little bit more

02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:06.960
[Amit Varma]: like Indian food.

02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:09.800
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I've taken enough of your time and I'll let you go soon.

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:16.160
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, just direct all the listeners to please partake in the feast that is in

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:18.000
[Amit Varma]: your writing in this wonderful book.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:23.080
[Amit Varma]: Did writing this book sort of, you know, what were your big learning moments during this

02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:24.080
[Amit Varma]: book?

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:28.480
[Amit Varma]: You went in obviously already knowing a lot about food, having a deep sense of the history,

02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:29.880
[Amit Varma]: having a sense of the nation as well.

02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:36.520
[Amit Varma]: You've been to many of these temples before, but, you know, are there any big sort of learnings

02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:41.600
[Amit Varma]: for you or revelations for you or insights for you or anything that deepened your understanding

02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:45.920
[Amit Varma]: in the process of going to all of these places and immersing yourself in these experiences?

02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:54.000
[Guest]: For me, it was that the importance of ritual and I saw it in temples, I saw it in the church,

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.360
[Guest]: I saw it in the one Islamic shrine that I visited.

02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:03.360
[Guest]: And I think that if there was one thing that I have changed my attitude towards, it is

02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:11.040
[Guest]: that I believe that humans invented rituals to mark milestones in life, to mark transition

02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.400
[Guest]: from one stage of life to another, to mark a celebration or a sorrow.

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:22.360
[Guest]: And in urban India, certainly, and if you are of a certain rational, I would humbly

02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:27.560
[Guest]: say, amidst much of your audience, much of your listenership, such as myself, where you

02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:34.200
[Guest]: live in the mind of the, in the cerebral world, we are in danger of giving up rituals.

02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:37.560
[Guest]: And again, you are throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:38.560
[Guest]: Yes, sure.

02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:39.560
[Guest]: Rituals have superstitions.

02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:42.960
[Guest]: That may seem nonsensical to you.

02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:47.200
[Guest]: But when you are this dreaming ritual, as I once said, and when you are saying they

02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:54.520
[Guest]: are superstitions and intolerant, and, you know, are based on planetary transmutations

02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:59.680
[Guest]: and things like that, you also give up rituals that are linked to when a daughter leaves

02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:07.360
[Guest]: home or when a son goes to college, something to mark that we, it is so much a part of us.

02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:13.680
[Guest]: If you go to Chennai airport, people welcome somebody with a garland, that is a ritual.

02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:17.640
[Guest]: And we don't do that, so-called educated people, we've stopped that.

02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:23.120
[Guest]: When a woman is pregnant, the neighbors bring her favorite food.

02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:24.120
[Guest]: That is a ritual.

02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:31.000
[Guest]: So I would say if I had a plea or an entreaty to your listeners, I would say, find your

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.120
[Guest]: rituals and, you know, figure it out and make it up if you must.

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:39.800
[Guest]: But we have such a rich vein of rituals in our culture.

02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:40.800
[Guest]: Find one that you like.

02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:41.800
[Guest]: Okay.

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.920
[Guest]: If you are not a Shiva worshipper, find a rock, collect a few rocks, everyday pour some

02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:48.800
[Guest]: water over it and then pour it on your Tulsi plant.

02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:49.800
[Guest]: That's the ritual.

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:50.800
[Guest]: It will give you calm.

02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:55.480
[Guest]: It will give you the meditative state that Sam Harris so applauds.

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:56.760
[Guest]: And we have it.

02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:57.760
[Guest]: Why not use it?

02:26:57.760 --> 02:26:58.760
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:01.560

02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:03.440
[Amit Varma]: me so much to think about and process.
