00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
[Amit Varma]: How did Donald Trump win America?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.800
[Amit Varma]: There are many explanations for this, all of which have some amount of truth to them,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.580
[Amit Varma]: but cannot account for the entire truth on their own.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.840
[Amit Varma]: One explanation is that America has many bigots and misogynists who were empowered by social

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.440
[Amit Varma]: media and exhilarated to find a candidate who validated their deepest instincts.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.840
[Amit Varma]: Another explanation is that a vote for Trump was really a negative vote against the other

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.600
[Amit Varma]: side, against the ghastly Hillary Clinton and all those smug elite liberals.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.000
[Amit Varma]: A third explanation, one that I wrote a column about, which is linked on this podcast page,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.400
[Amit Varma]: is that Trump happened across a simple formula.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.880
[Amit Varma]: Explain the complex problems of the people of America with simplistic solutions that

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.920
[Amit Varma]: sound intuitive and appeal to their instincts.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.200
[Amit Varma]: In other words, he told simple, attractive stories.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.600
[Amit Varma]: That Donald Trump is a bullshitter is true, but what you should keep in mind is that he

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.320
[Amit Varma]: did not win in spite of his bullshit, but because of it.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.800
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.800
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.200
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.720
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, I want to tackle one of the simple stories that Donald Trump told

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.640
[Amit Varma]: about jobs in America.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.480
[Amit Varma]: Middle America had allegedly stagnated for decades and there was great worry about jobs.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.480
[Amit Varma]: Now the reasons for these are complex, as are the solutions, but Trump chose to ignore

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.680
[Amit Varma]: what the truth might be and tell a simple story with two parts to it.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Part one, your jobs are going because immigrants are coming and taking them.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Part two, your jobs are being shipped overseas.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.760
[Amit Varma]: With these two stories, he made immigration and outsourcing the villains.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.800
[Amit Varma]: And these stories appeal to his audiences because, hey, it's a natural human tendency

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.160
[Amit Varma]: to find someone else to blame, some easy target, the other.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.200
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, I want to talk about these two villains of his, immigration and outsourcing.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.840
[Amit Varma]: My guest for this episode is a very dear friend of mine, Gaurav Sabnis.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.920
[Amit Varma]: Gaurav and I have been friends since the early 2000s when we were both early bloggers.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.040
[Amit Varma]: I wrote a blog called India Uncut and Gaurav wrote a blog called Vantage Point.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.840
[Amit Varma]: He was based in Mumbai then, but he now lives in New York, where he teaches marketing at

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.880
[Amit Varma]: the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.160
[Amit Varma]: I've always found Gaurav incredibly insightful on economics and politics.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.360
[Amit Varma]: In fact, he outgeeks me on both those subjects, and I'm delighted that he's finally a guest

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360
[Amit Varma]: on my show.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.600
[Guest]: Gaurav, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.320
[Amit Varma]: Great to be on the show finally.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.120
[Amit Varma]: Gaurav, before we get to talking about the specifics of immigration and outsourcing,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.000
[Amit Varma]: I want to start off by asking you, was there really a jobs crisis in America?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.520
[Guest]: Yeah, right.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.440
[Guest]: And it's, it's one of these things that you can view from one side or the other side.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.640
[Guest]: So if you look at it in terms of unemployment rates, right after the 2008 crash, the unemployment

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.240
[Guest]: rate did go up, but it never really crossed into like the Great Depression days or it

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.360
[Guest]: never crossed beyond I think something like 10 or 11%.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.760
[Guest]: And by the time Trump became a candidate, it was down to about 5%.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.960
[Guest]: So it was down to historic lows.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.560
[Guest]: So there wasn't really a job crisis.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.940
[Guest]: The perception about job crisis is more about underemployment and unemployment.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.720
[Guest]: So people think that they should have a better job or people think that they should be getting

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.520
[Guest]: paid more.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.520
[Guest]: But just objectively speaking, the rhetoric didn't gel with the reality, in my opinion.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.680
[Amit Varma]: So essentially, it's not that there weren't jobs to go around, but that the jobs that

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.000
[Amit Varma]: were there, people weren't happy with their salaries or the scope or whatever.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.120
[Amit Varma]: And especially you hear about small town America, where people felt that, you know, salaries

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.480
[Amit Varma]: hadn't gone up, relatively speaking for generations, and they didn't necessarily have better lives

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.480
[Amit Varma]: than their parents.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And I remember David Remnick on his New Yorker podcast asked Bruce Springsteen about this.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.160
[Amit Varma]: He asked Springsteen that, hey, all the small towns in America that you wrote all your great

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.360
[Amit Varma]: songs about voted for Trump.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360
[Amit Varma]: So what happened there?

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Why did that happen?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And his answer was that, no, I mean, the problems were real and no one was paying attention

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.040
[Amit Varma]: to that.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.760
[Amit Varma]: And Trump might have had the wrong answers, but he was the only guy who actually spoke

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760
[Guest]: to them.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.760
[Guest]: Yeah, that's true.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.400
[Guest]: And I think we were talking about this earlier about how a lot of this is a function of the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.600
[Guest]: 1950s, which were an aberration in American history, because the rest of the world had

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.040
[Guest]: been devastated by World War II.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.360
[Guest]: America was the only one that had the resources and was untouched.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.480
[Guest]: So they just dominated all kinds of industries, including manufacturing.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.240
[Guest]: So back then in the 50s, you could just finish high school, finish class 12, and then get

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.160
[Guest]: a job, which would give you a very comfortable upper middle class, upper middle class kind

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.920
[Guest]: of a lifestyle.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.680
[Guest]: But what happened was in the late 60s and 70s, as the rest of the world started catching

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.320
[Guest]: up, it just made more economic sense to manufacture stuff overseas.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.720
[Guest]: So these jobs started disappearing.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.640
[Guest]: And there's the book by JD Vance called The Hillbilly Elegy, which also goes into this,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.360
[Guest]: that it was more a function of that unusual period of prosperity in the 50s.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.080
[Guest]: So it's because of that unusual period in the 50s that people are now assuming there's

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.280
[Guest]: a decline in small town America, and that's why they want to make America great again.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.520
[Guest]: But it doesn't gel with the reality of economics and just how you get the most return on investment

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.640
[Guest]: on your capital.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.240
[Guest]: And America, having won the Cold War for capitalism, is now seeing how capitalism works and a lot

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.520
[Guest]: of people are not liking it.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.960
[Amit Varma]: So this disaffection, what is it a consequence of really?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I think we both agree, and you're going to describe in detail why Trump's simplistic

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.520
[Amit Varma]: answers of immigration and outsourcing appear to have some sense to them and aren't exactly

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.840
[Amit Varma]: the truth.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.840
[Amit Varma]: So what is this?

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.400
[Amit Varma]: And was this sort of decline of their dominance?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400
[Amit Varma]: Was it inevitable?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you spoke about the 50s, but the generation that voted for Trump today, probably wasn't

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.000
[Amit Varma]: alive then or doesn't remember the 50s.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.200
[Amit Varma]: And the nostalgia for a period when America was great, when they talk about make America

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.840
[Amit Varma]: great again, was not the 50s, but I'd imagine the 70s or 80s.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.960
[Amit Varma]: And what has changed since then is there's been a lot of globalization.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.960
[Amit Varma]: And there's been a lot of, you know, America has become more and more a country of immigrants.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.960
[Amit Varma]: And these are natural targets.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.920
[Amit Varma]: But given that there is some decline, if it is a decline that has led to underemployment

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.680
[Amit Varma]: and not unemployment per se, what would you say are the causes of that decline?

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I think part of the reason is that the rest of the world is catching up.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.840
[Guest]: So with India and China, you have like almost 3 billion people with a growing middle class,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.840
[Guest]: growing infrastructure.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:07.360
[Guest]: Similarly, you had Japan in the 70s, 80s, if you remember the original bugbear was Japan

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360
[Guest]: in the 70s and 80s.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.600
[Guest]: In fact, Trump in the 80s, when he was flirting with running for president was an extremely

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.360
[Guest]: anti-Japan guy, even though now he pals around with Shinzo Abe.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.120
[Guest]: So I think part of it was inevitable.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:27.400
[Guest]: I think it's just a natural progression of the global economy, and how capital or resources

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.800
[Guest]: get most efficiently allocated.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.360
[Guest]: I think part of it was that.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.560
[Amit Varma]: So let's go on to these two stories one by one.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.400
[Amit Varma]: And the first story is immigration, where the story is, hey, Mexicans are coming over

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.040
[Amit Varma]: the border and taking away your jobs, and we really have to stop them.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.360
[Amit Varma]: And we really need to send them back as many as we can.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.480
[Amit Varma]: And then your jobs will be fine, which was, of course, an appealing narrative.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.480
[Amit Varma]: What's your take on this?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.040
[Guest]: So I like to say that the anti-immigrant sentiment or the desire to pull up the ladder after

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.560
[Guest]: immigrating here is as American as apple pie and baseball.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560
[Guest]: In fact, it's even older.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.000
[Guest]: So, for example, in the early days of the American Republic, Benjamin Franklin and others

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.160
[Guest]: wanted to control immigration from Germany.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.040
[Guest]: They said that Germans are uneducated, uncouth people, and they will destroy our country,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.040
[Guest]: take our jobs.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.040
[Guest]: After that, it was the Catholics, the Irish, the Italians, the East Europeans.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.280
[Guest]: So in the mid-1800s, there was actually a party called the Know Nothing Party, whose

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.760
[Guest]: entire platform was exactly what Trump and Bannon and all these guys are talking about

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.440
[Guest]: today, except today they're talking about Muslims and Asians and Mexicans.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.320
[Guest]: And at that time, it was about the Irish and the Italians and Catholics, etc.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:50.760
[Guest]: So part of it, I think Bill Bryson wrote in one of his books, that there has been this

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.880
[Guest]: continuous feeling that immigration until my generation and my parent generation was

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:01.160
[Guest]: amazing for America, and immigration after my generation is bad, and it's just destroying

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
[Guest]: the country.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.960
[Guest]: So I think part of it was just a revival of that old trope.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.600
[Guest]: What I find disheartening is that that trope had gone away for about three or four decades.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:19.400
[Guest]: So if you remember, Ronald Reagan gave amnesty to a bunch of undocumented immigrants in the

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.200
[Guest]: 80s, working with Democrats and Republicans together.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.880
[Guest]: John McCain, when he ran for president, was very honest about these jobs that we just

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.880
[Guest]: talked about.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.840
[Guest]: He said, I'll tell you very honestly, these jobs are never coming back.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.120
[Guest]: We just need to figure out what else to do, how to still keep our economy growing.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.200
[Guest]: And the thing is, we as in America, were not ready for an adult telling us the simple truth

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.280
[Guest]: that those jobs aren't coming back.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:52.360
[Guest]: So it's easy to then blame it on immigrants and NAFTA and trade deals and so on.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.520
[Guest]: So you always want to find a scapegoat when you don't want to accept the truth.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.920
[Amit Varma]: And this is almost a scapegoat that appeals to our instincts in the sense that I think

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.480
[Amit Varma]: this distrust of the other is something that is in a sense hardwired into us, which is

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.800
[Amit Varma]: why this narrative keeps popping up through the generations.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.920
[Amit Varma]: So at some periods of time, like the last few decades, like you pointed out, it might

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.760
[Amit Varma]: be subdued in the political discourse, but it's always waiting to break out.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, the easiest thing to when things are not going well for you is always to blame

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.640
[Amit Varma]: somebody else, and if they are not your own people, quote unquote, then that kind of becomes

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.640
[Amit Varma]: easy.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:36.520
[Amit Varma]: So would you say at some level, the anti-immigration rhetoric at its heart was driven more by this

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.000
[Amit Varma]: distrust of the other, rather than pure economic reasons, which were only a rationale for it?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.600
[Guest]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.400
[Guest]: And like you said, it's very basic human nature, this distrust of the other.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.600
[Guest]: You see it in India as well.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.400
[Guest]: So in Bombay, you have Shiv Sena that over the years has picked different others to bash

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.440
[Guest]: and then build their brand, and they keep going from stent to stent.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.800
[Guest]: So I think a lot of it was that it's okay if immigrants come from Norway, for example,

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800
[Guest]: that's what Trump said.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.920
[Guest]: If somebody's ever been to Norway, I don't know why you would want to come to the US

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.920
[Guest]: from Norway.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.240
[Guest]: But yeah, he's like, it's okay if we get somebody from Norway or Finland or Europe, but he doesn't

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.960
[Guest]: want people from what he calls the quote unquote, shithole countries, which ignores the very

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.200
[Guest]: basic fact of immigration, that any immigration is always going to be from a poorer place

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200
[Guest]: to a richer place.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.680
[Guest]: There is no reason why it should go in the opposite direction.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.720
[Guest]: Somebody from UP comes to Mumbai because UP is not doing as well, and Mumbai is doing

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.440
[Guest]: a lot better.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.400
[Guest]: So that's just how immigration works.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.960
[Guest]: And when you start fearing the other, you forget these basic facts about this is how

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.800
[Amit Varma]: things have been happening for years.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.360
[Amit Varma]: And one of the points always made against immigration, what seems on the surface, what

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.800
[Amit Varma]: is sort of the seen effect and not the unseen effect is that, hey, immigrants come away

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.560
[Amit Varma]: and take jobs, and therefore locals don't have jobs.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.520
[Guest]: What's the unseen part of this?

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:09.320
[Guest]: And so the unseen side of it is sort of the opposite of what they are saying when these

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.440
[Guest]: anti-immigrant people say that they are taking away our jobs.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.480
[Guest]: The unseen side is immigrants usually do jobs that nobody else wants to do.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.080
[Guest]: So there is the immigration crisis in America today, in my opinion, is the opposite of what

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.520
[Guest]: Trump and these guys are saying, because I think there is a labor shortfall, and people

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:31.480
[Guest]: who work in the high tech industry, as well as the lower end jobs like collecting fruit

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.880
[Guest]: and cleaning crabs, etc., there's a huge shortfall there.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.600
[Guest]: So that's why the industry is worried about how the anti-immigration rhetoric is going

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.640
[Guest]: to affect the economy.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.320
[Guest]: So the unseen side is that immigrants do jobs that nobody else wants to do, and they keep

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.400
[Guest]: the engine of the economy running.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.360
[Guest]: If you stop them from coming, then you will push yourself into a different kind of recession

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.400
[Guest]: without realizing why that happened.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, just to use a Bombay analogy, since we've both lived here for a while, and

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.400
[Amit Varma]: we first met here, in fact, is that if you think, you know, among a certain class of

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.000
[Amit Varma]: people is fashionable to talk against immigration or talk against slums for that matter.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.880
[Amit Varma]: That's where immigrants first come when they enter the city, that's their entry point.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.960
[Amit Varma]: And but the truth is, most of the middle class who might have buys at home or watchman for

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.440
[Amit Varma]: the building or drivers or whatever, where do you think they come from?

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.080
[Amit Varma]: Because the local supply cannot fulfill that demand.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.400
[Amit Varma]: That is why there are people coming from poorer places like UP, as you pointed out, or Bihar,

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.560
[Amit Varma]: to take up those jobs.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And because it's a positive sum game, that's a damn good thing, because everybody benefits

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.360
[Amit Varma]: and the extra value that their employers get are also ploughed back into the economy.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:50.440
[Guest]: I mean, if you did not have these immigrants coming in and doing these jobs, you would

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.640
[Guest]: essentially have to be paying more for the same stuff that you're paying for now.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.840
[Guest]: So on the one hand, you want immigration to stop, but on the other hand, you still want

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.880
[Guest]: to pay, let's say $1 for an avocado in the US, which if the guest workers or immigrants

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.840
[Guest]: don't pick those avocados or transport them, then you'll have to pay $5 for an avocado

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840
[Amit Varma]: instead of $1.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.840
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.800
[Amit Varma]: So, give me a sense of how the immigration debate is sort of playing out in the US.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:23.800
[Guest]: Yeah, so, like I said, until Trump came along, immigration was one of those rare issues on

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.960
[Guest]: which there was, broadly speaking, bipartisan consensus, as in the moderate Republicans

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.280
[Guest]: and the Democrats, both saw immigration overall as a good thing.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.760
[Guest]: The only disagreement was about what to do with what they call illegal immigrants or

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.520
[Guest]: undocumented immigrants.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.960
[Guest]: So what exactly to do about them?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:48.080
[Guest]: So for example, in the final days of the George W. Bush administration, there was this bipartisan

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:57.000
[Guest]: effort by Ted Kennedy and John McCain to push through immigration reform so that these people

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.600
[Guest]: who are undocumented can be taken care of and the number of high tech visas can be increased,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600
[Guest]: etc.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.400
[Guest]: It seemed like everything was going fine until Trump came and just upended the whole thing.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.520
[Guest]: So in the last couple of years, I've seen much more anti-immigrant rhetoric.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:16.760
[Guest]: In fact, just yesterday, a video went viral of this lawyer in midtown Manhattan, ranting

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:22.000
[Guest]: at women for speaking in Spanish saying that my taxes are paying for your welfare, which

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.280
[Guest]: by the way is factually incorrect.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:30.440
[Guest]: But it's in that place where it's that age old anti-immigration sentiment is back.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:36.000
[Guest]: Nobody's really talking about facts or nobody's talking about the real world consequences.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.760
[Guest]: For example, I sent you a link about this story from Maryland where a huge part of the

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.280
[Guest]: economy depends on seafood like crabs and lobsters, oysters, etc.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:54.160
[Guest]: And the labor force that cleans these crabs and makes them ready for consumption are all

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.880
[Guest]: guest workers from Mexico.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.320
[Guest]: So for about two decades, they come during the season, they work on the docks cleaning

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.520
[Guest]: seafood, and then they go back very legally.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:11.640
[Guest]: The Trump administration came and just changed that policy so that now the crab industry

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.480
[Guest]: in Maryland is suffering because there isn't enough immigrant labor.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.120
[Guest]: So crab prices this summer will be through the roof.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.320
[Unknown]: And what I found ironic in that story was one of the guys who's suffering was like,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.000
[Guest]: oh, I'm still a Trump supporter.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.440
[Guest]: I just hope he does something about my situation.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.840
[Guest]: I think otherwise, he's right on immigration.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.200
[Guest]: He just needs to take care of my crab business.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.680
[Guest]: But I still support it.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.560
[Guest]: It's kind of a not in my backyard kind of mentality right now when it comes to the anti-immigrant

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.560
[Amit Varma]: sentiment.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.640
[Amit Varma]: Until it does come to your backyard, I mean, that's a great story.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.080
[Amit Varma]: And it shows exactly the unseen effects of getting immigrants out of there.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.760
[Amit Varma]: You've got the immigrants out of there.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.880
[Amit Varma]: This means there'll be fewer crabs.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.400
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, crabs will be more expensive.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.320
[Amit Varma]: Fewer people will get those crabs and the value that is not saved would have gone into

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.320
[Amit Varma]: something else.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.840
[Amit Varma]: And you won't see that non-spending not happening because, hey, that's the unseen.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.240
[Amit Varma]: And you know what was earlier a positive sum game where everybody benefited has suddenly

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.240
[Amit Varma]: changed and become something else.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.400
[Amit Varma]: And the essential truth about civilization that most people don't note is that immigrants

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.720
[Amit Varma]: build everything.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.400
[Amit Varma]: All great cities have been built by immigrants in one fashion or the other.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.400
[Amit Varma]: Later, you say, oh, they're not immigrants, they were always here.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.240
[Amit Varma]: But at the start, everyone's an immigrant, great cities, great countries are all built

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.240
[Amit Varma]: by immigrants.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.240
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.320
[Guest]: And if you look at the data, the funny thing is that the best local economies in the US,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:42.000
[Guest]: the states and towns that are doing the best, economically speaking, have the lowest unemployment,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
[Guest]: have the lowest crime, are all cities and states that have the maximum number of immigrants.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.160
[Guest]: And the poorest socioeconomic indicators are all in states where there are hardly any immigrants.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.360
[Guest]: It's all primarily a Caucasian population.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:04.600
[Guest]: So that's the irony that if you look at the facts, the facts say that if you let in immigrants,

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.000
[Guest]: it will create more jobs, it will create more wealth, it will make everyone happy.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.120
[Guest]: But somehow that sentiment just keeps coming back of blaming everything on them.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.320
[Amit Varma]: And now that Trump has actually been in charge for a decent amount of time, is that sense

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:28.360
[Amit Varma]: changing or are people wedded to that narrative now, those who were when they elected him?

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I think those who were wedded to that narrative are still wedded to it.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.400
[Guest]: Those who are opposed to it are even more opposed.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.760
[Guest]: Like those who are pro-immigration people like me are even more convinced that these

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.680
[Guest]: policies are not great.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.200
[Guest]: And one thing about Trump is that he's doing exactly what he said.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.120
[Guest]: A lot of people thought, oh, this guy doesn't know anything.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120
[Guest]: He's a novice.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120
[Guest]: He's just a showman.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.080
[Guest]: He'll go to the White House and then just chill.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.200
[Guest]: He won't do anything.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.920
[Guest]: But maybe because of its special interest groups and people who have influence over

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.840
[Guest]: him, he's actually carrying through on all the things he said, like the ban against immigration

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:10.040
[Guest]: from some Muslim countries, shutting down intake of refugees.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:15.800
[Guest]: He actually put forth a plan in which he wanted to cut down legal immigration by about half.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.320
[Guest]: So we're not even talking about the illegal hordes supposedly pouring over the border,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:26.040
[Guest]: but legal immigrants like qualified engineers and doctors and all that, they want to cut

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.080
[Guest]: that down as well.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:33.480
[Guest]: So something that has kept the American economy going, even after the decline of manufacturing,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.360
[Guest]: they want to shut that down.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.160
[Guest]: I think it's early enough that its broader impact has not been felt.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.080
[Guest]: I think that's why people are still on board with him.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.560
[Guest]: But I think as it starts having an impact on the economy, hopefully people will learn.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and as with things with the economy, sometimes it's hard to even prove causation.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.400
[Amit Varma]: For example, there might be various things going wrong in any case.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.600
[Amit Varma]: And people will say, hey, this wasn't because of Trump's policies.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.880
[Amit Varma]: But I'm intrigued by something you said a little earlier.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.760
[Amit Varma]: And I want to follow up on that, where you said that people assume that Trump would not

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.040
[Amit Varma]: carry out these kinds of policies, but maybe because there are interest groups and whatever,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.000
[Amit Varma]: he has more or less gone down that path.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.440
[Amit Varma]: What did you mean by the interest groups?

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Because I thought his anti-immigration rhetoric fits in with the rhetoric of a demagogue who's

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.560
[Amit Varma]: telling a simple story and appealing to people's worst instincts.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.840
[Amit Varma]: But what are the interest groups that would want immigration to not happen?

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.800
[Guest]: Oh, so yeah, when I say interest groups, I'm not talking about like lobbying or businesses.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.880
[Guest]: Saying there is this, you know, son of soil nativist movement that has managed to corner

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.120
[Guest]: the primaries markets, you know, like if you want to win the nomination of the Republican

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:51.360
[Guest]: Party, you essentially need to only convince, let's say about 10% of the electorate, which

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.400
[Guest]: is very passionate to come out and vote for you, because most people don't vote in primaries.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.400
[Guest]: Most people don't vote in general.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.880
[Guest]: So that interest group, which is focused on this particular policy of being against immigration,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:13.080
[Guest]: being against foreign trade, pushing through this idea of white ethno-nationalistic state.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.360
[Guest]: So all these things, those are the interest groups I'm talking about.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.920
[Guest]: So not lobbying or business interest groups.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.920
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.920
[Amit Varma]: I got it.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's a little scary because then it means that these radical fringes have a disproportionate

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.200
[Amit Varma]: influence on the party because they may be small in number, but one, because they are

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.280
[Amit Varma]: much louder, they've got Trump's attention and they seem to be more of them than they

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280
[Amit Varma]: are.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.320
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, because they influence the primaries in the way that you mentioned that, you know,

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.840
[Amit Varma]: they just have to get the passionate people and people on the fringes are always more

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.040
[Amit Varma]: passionate to come out and vote.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.880
[Amit Varma]: And therefore they are reshaping the whole Republican Party, despite being just a fraction

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.880
[Amit Varma]: of the party.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.720
[Guest]: And that changes the entire political landscape.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.880
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.080
[Guest]: And that's what has been happening for the last couple of years.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:05.960
[Guest]: You know, that election in Alabama, where there was this guy who was accused of being

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.960
[Amit Varma]: a pedophile.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.960
[Amit Varma]: Roy Moore.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.960
[Unknown]: Roy Moore, right.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.360
[Guest]: And first the party said, okay, we are not going to support him.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.200
[Guest]: Trump also said that, no, you should step down and let somebody else run instead.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.720
[Guest]: But once these, again, what I call interest groups or the alt-right or whatever you would

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.320
[Guest]: like to call it, they still kept hammering that, no, he's our guy.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.160
[Guest]: And then the Republican Party came back and rallied around him.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.080
[Guest]: He's still lost, fortunately.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.480
[Guest]: But that was very telling that they first ran away from him and then they ran back towards

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.680
[Guest]: him despite all these horrible things that he said and done.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:46.600
[Amit Varma]: Gaurav, before we move on, let me just go back to one of the objections which various

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.680
[Amit Varma]: people raise against immigration and which you alluded to.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.200
[Amit Varma]: And I think Milton Friedman also raised it, though I disagree with it, which is a welfare

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.880
[Amit Varma]: argument where they say that, look, a free immigration and open borders are all okay

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.840
[Amit Varma]: in a country which is a completely free society and with free markets and all that.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.880
[Amit Varma]: But if you are a welfare state, which the U.S. is to some extent, then you have tax

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.860
[Amit Varma]: dollars going in to support immigrants who are there illegally.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.360
[Amit Varma]: What would you say about this?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.080
[Guest]: And it's a sentiment or idea that I also agree with.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:26.880
[Guest]: So I would not like it if my tax dollars were going to fund some immigrants' welfare.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.920
[Guest]: The only problem with that, at least in the U.S. context, is the U.S. welfare state is

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.800
[Guest]: much more carefully crafted than, let's say, Western European welfare states.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.080
[Guest]: So according to the law, you cannot get welfare if you are an immigrant.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.400
[Guest]: Forget being an illegal immigrant, even if you're a legal immigrant.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:51.480
[Guest]: So for example, my wife's parents came here about 30 years ago.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.280
[Guest]: And for the first 10 years or so, by law, they did not really qualify for Medicare or

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.280
[Guest]: Social Security.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.800
[Guest]: In fact, anybody who's working even today in the U.S. as an immigrant on, let's say,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.880
[Guest]: H-1B is paying for Social Security taxes, but they won't get the benefits from them

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:15.200
[Guest]: because the laws and regulations and control mechanisms in place stop that from happening.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.560
[Guest]: And most people don't realize that.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.280
[Guest]: Most people just buy into this simplistic narrative that immigrants come and get welfare.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.240
[Guest]: It's controlled a lot.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.200
[Guest]: And then the second part of it is they do pay taxes.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.880
[Guest]: I think we've talked about this in the past on other forums, that even illegal immigrants

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880
[Guest]: are paying taxes.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.440
[Guest]: Even if they're not paying income taxes, they're paying sales taxes.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:43.720
[Guest]: So if they get some basic services, like for example, public schooling, it's not exactly

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.880
[Guest]: welfare that they are getting, they're just getting the services that they are indirectly

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880
[Amit Varma]: paying for.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.240
[Amit Varma]: And on the whole, people are putting in much more than they get, which I think is inevitable

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.720
[Amit Varma]: in anyone's relationship with the state.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, people who make this argument, I think, make the same fallacy as those people who

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.280
[Amit Varma]: say that overpopulation is a bad thing, where they look at people as a burden and not as

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.120
[Amit Varma]: a resource, you know, and I would just cite Julian Simon here and say that people are

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.800
[Amit Varma]: quote, the ultimate resource unquote, and that every individual always puts in more

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800
[Amit Varma]: than he takes out.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is especially in relation with the state where illegal immigrants are paying

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.560
[Amit Varma]: all kinds of taxes, because they are consuming all kinds of things, and there are sales taxes

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.560
[Amit Varma]: with everything.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.760
[Amit Varma]: And, and like you said, and so I don't think that, you know, that it's a case that this

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.400
[Amit Varma]: argument doesn't apply to the US because of the way the system is structured.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.160
[Amit Varma]: I think this argument doesn't apply anywhere.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Human beings are a resource, if there are more people and greater economic networks,

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.760
[Amit Varma]: everybody benefits.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.760
[Guest]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.120
[Guest]: So at a broader level, that point is very true.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.560
[Guest]: But I was just saying that additionally, in the US, there are rules that specifically

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.880
[Guest]: stop you from getting welfare if you're an immigrant.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.160
[Amit Varma]: American politics is incredibly fascinating.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.880
[Amit Varma]: And I'll do a separate show with you at some point.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:12.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on sort of to the second part of Trump's story about jobs, which is protectionism.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, him being a protectionist, but which is outsourcing, whereas the narrative he tried

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.720
[Amit Varma]: to sell was that, hey, you guys are losing your jobs, there aren't enough good jobs in

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.240
[Amit Varma]: America because they're being outsourced.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.280
[Amit Varma]: And the fact of the matter is that some of the decline in these jobs is because of globalization,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.200
[Amit Varma]: which we all know is a really good thing.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.240
[Amit Varma]: It's again, a positive some game.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.440
[Amit Varma]: But the nativist arguments would be that no, it's not because we are losing these jobs.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:41.440
[Amit Varma]: And what do I care about people in China or India or Philippines or wherever?

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.440
[Amit Varma]: What's your take on that?

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.440
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.200
[Guest]: And this is, again, something that has been around since maybe at least the 70s or 80s,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.360
[Guest]: when the Japanese economy started improving.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:56.400
[Guest]: So America used to dominate the auto industry, for example, we are the biggest market for

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.320
[Guest]: cars and also the biggest producers.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:04.800
[Guest]: And then Japan rebuilt after World War Two, and then Toyota and Honda started doing well.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.920
[Guest]: Then in Korea, and then you have China and India also doing well.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:17.240
[Guest]: So as a result, you have some jobs, which once you could take for granted in the US,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.520
[Guest]: being done by people overseas, because it just makes it simple dollars and cents.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.480
[Guest]: It makes sense that you want to lower your costs.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.840
[Guest]: And neck and neck that benefits everyone, like if you are able to manufacture a product

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:37.240
[Guest]: for cheaper somewhere else, then that creates extra capital that can then create other industries

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.720
[Guest]: or that can create other businesses.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.600
[Guest]: So that's like economics 101.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:47.120
[Guest]: But again, it's protectionism is similar to the anti-immigrant sentiment right tight to

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.040
[Guest]: this hate of the other or the foreign.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.920
[Guest]: And yeah, that's why those two have gone hand in hand in the last couple of years.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.640
[Amit Varma]: And the scene effect from the point of view of say, a worker in small town America is

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.160
[Amit Varma]: that you know, these jobs are being shipped overseas because they're cheaper for the evil

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.640
[Amit Varma]: capitalist entity that is shipping them overseas and we are suffering, we don't have jobs.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.800
[Amit Varma]: But the unseen effect always is that they bring greater value to the consumers who are

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.800
[Amit Varma]: here as well, the company shipping them abroad are saving money and perhaps not shutting

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.760
[Amit Varma]: down because they were able to save that money.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.600
[Amit Varma]: But value is brought back into the economy and consumers get cheaper goods because of

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.600
[Amit Varma]: that.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:30.480
[Amit Varma]: So if you buy a good today for $10, which would otherwise be $12, if it was for, you

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.560
[Amit Varma]: know, done by local jobs, you might not buy it at all.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.920
[Amit Varma]: Or if you do your saving that $2 and a $2 in value, which is created by the saving goes

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.440
[Amit Varma]: back into the economy and create jobs.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And it's a positive some game.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:49.880
[Amit Varma]: And unfortunately, here again, people often tend to have, you know, they don't put the

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.040
[Amit Varma]: consumer at the center of this market process.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.920
[Amit Varma]: They look at other elements of it.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.320
[Amit Varma]: But the consumer should always be at the center and the value that he is saving, which goes

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320
[Amit Varma]: back into the economy.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.320
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.680
[Guest]: And most people don't get this, we've had until recently, we had leaders who talked

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.440
[Guest]: about this, that trade is good and NAFTA is good.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.600
[Guest]: So we had Bill Clinton, then after that you had George Bush, the last two guys who ran

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:21.360
[Guest]: for president, John and lost John McCain and Mitt Romney were also on board with trade

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.960
[Guest]: like they, they were the adults in the room who were telling the electorate that no trade

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960
[Guest]: is good.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.520
[Guest]: And you know, this is how the economy grows.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:36.400
[Guest]: You know, they fought an entire Cold War for this after all and have created this world

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:43.520
[Guest]: order of the free market economy and foreign trade and everybody has benefited from it.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:51.560
[Guest]: But suddenly we have this pushback from people who don't see that the benefits outweigh the

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.720
[Guest]: supposed costs.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:59.120
[Guest]: And this, you know, what you said about putting the consumer front and center, I find that

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:04.200
[Guest]: interesting because there's this show I like called South Park, which has, which takes

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.960
[Guest]: on a lot of social issues, often from a libertarian angle.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.880
[Guest]: And then this episode about the hate for Walmart, like everybody hates Walmart because Walmart

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.320
[Guest]: comes in and it destroys the local economy.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.400
[Guest]: That is the narrative.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.040
[Guest]: So in that episode, they go and they try to kill Walmart and then they find out the heart

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.040
[Guest]: of Walmart, it's a mirror, like that is the point they are making that Walmart does well

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:33.560
[Guest]: because of you, because you, the consumer wants the cheapest goods and that helps everyone.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.320
[Guest]: That's why Walmart is doing well.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:41.200
[Guest]: That's why NAFTA is good, that's why foreign trade is good, but we don't realize that it's

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.600
[Amit Varma]: a mirror at the heart of all this entire machine.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.360
[Amit Varma]: And we are the economy, the choices that we make give the economy its direction.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.120
[Amit Varma]: What you said about, you know, again, politics is very interesting because just going back

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.760
[Amit Varma]: to that, the Republicans have been the ones who are always for trade.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:02.120
[Amit Varma]: The anti free trade voices, which were earlier just lone voices, so to say, came from the

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.600
[Amit Varma]: far left of the Democratic Party.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:09.520
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, I think Bernie Sanders views about trade are very similar to Trump's.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.680
[Guest]: Oh, yeah, trade and also some aspects of immigration.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.800
[Guest]: So he's not exactly a pro immigration guy as well.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.960
[Guest]: He makes the right noises.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.800
[Guest]: And all my left wing friends hate it, and especially my Bernie fan friends hate it when

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.800
[Guest]: I say this.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.160
[Guest]: I think there's more that Bernie Sanders and Trump have in common than you would think.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:39.760
[Guest]: They always hate somebody saying that, but yeah, on immigration, on trade, things like

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.160
[Guest]: these, they are, it's very difficult to tell the two apart, just that one guy is a lot

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:51.800
[Guest]: more boorish and vulgar, and the other guy is much more, you know, affable, nicer, affable

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:57.040
[Guest]: and charming, but at its core, they have the same ideas on these, on these issues.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and partly because the populist ideas are simple stories.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.640
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, therein lies their appeal.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, you'd earlier said about immigration, that even though people thought about Trump

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.520
[Amit Varma]: that, okay, he's going to chill out in the White House, in your words, and not really

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.760
[Amit Varma]: bother about these, he's actually moved forward with his anti immigration policies.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.080
[Amit Varma]: But with protectionism, one would think it's the other way around, because at the end of

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.480
[Amit Varma]: the day, it pretty much every corporate interest group would look to its own interests and

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.560
[Amit Varma]: their interests lie in outsourcing.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.080
[Amit Varma]: So they would not let Trump do anything that harms him.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.280
[Amit Varma]: So how is that going in terms of protectionism?

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.080
[Amit Varma]: Has he been able to implement anything we should be worried about?

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.800
[Guest]: Protectionism he hasn't so far, but he wants to.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.600
[Guest]: Now, protectionism is this one weird thing that he's been obsessed with for 40 years.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.560
[Guest]: So I don't think he has too many principles, but this is one principle he holds very dear

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.640
[Amit Varma]: to his heart.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.380
[Amit Varma]: I guess because from a zero sum view of the world, it just makes sense that if others

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.040
[Amit Varma]: are winning, we must be losing.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.440
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.840
[Guest]: And because he's not a typical politician, I don't think he cares about the legacy.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.920
[Guest]: I don't think he cares about the party.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.040
[Guest]: He just wants to do what he thinks is right.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.840
[Guest]: So like, there's no leverage that businesses have over him other than maybe hoping that

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.720
[Guest]: Congress legislatively stops him.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.680
[Guest]: But he has been talking about like, NAFTA, he wants to renegotiate NAFTA, he pulled out

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.080
[Guest]: of the Trans Pacific Partnership, which was a bad deal, which by the way, everybody else

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.480
[Guest]: was also agreed on, even though it's a good deal for the US economy, but they pulled out

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:34.000
[Guest]: of it and the drumbeat against it was so intense that even Hillary Clinton, who at one point

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.920
[Guest]: supported the deal, decided that it was politically expedient to say that yes, yes, we should

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.640
[Guest]: pull out of that Trans Pacific Partnership, which was essentially a deal that would give

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:49.960
[Guest]: US the access to these East Asian markets at lower tariffs that they right now don't

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960
[Guest]: have access to.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.600
[Guest]: Those countries already have access to the US market.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.000
[Guest]: So there was literally the US was the one that was benefiting the most from that deal.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.520
[Guest]: But the simplistic anti-trade and protectionist rhetoric is so easy to sell that they pulled

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.520
[Guest]: out of it.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.800
[Amit Varma]: So I think that is one thing he did on day one that has hurt the economy.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.960
[Amit Varma]: But you're saying any of the other guys would also have done that because it was politically

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.080
[Amit Varma]: expedient and because that that was a popular decision to make?

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.840
[Guest]: Might have done that for sure.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.840
[Guest]: Right.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.600
[Guest]: I think sometimes politicians will say something but not follow through on it.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.000
[Guest]: I think Hillary Clinton might have stayed in it, you know, in the Clintonian way of

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.160
[Guest]: trying to have your cake and eat it too.

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.560
[Guest]: I think she might have stayed in the deal, even though during the campaign, she said

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.280
[Guest]: that we should leave it because she was Secretary of State when it was being negotiated.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.840
[Guest]: So she knows how useful it was.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.280
[Guest]: Her husband crafted NAFTA, which is the North American Free Trade Agreement.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.280
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.280
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.800
[Guest]: So I think she would have found a way to maybe stay in it.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.280
[Guest]: There's no way to tell for sure.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.080
[Guest]: But yeah, Trump doesn't really care about these things.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.520
[Amit Varma]: So he pulled out.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:00.760
[Amit Varma]: So my question is, with the things that Trump is doing on immigration and protectionism

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:06.100
[Amit Varma]: and both of us are really on the same page, we agree that these policies are harmful.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:10.000
[Amit Varma]: So my question is, what kind of effects will they have?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.680
[Amit Varma]: How harmful is it?

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.520
[Amit Varma]: And supposing the next president disagrees with Trump on all of these things, can they

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:22.680
[Amit Varma]: be easily reversed, or are we causing irreversible damage, which will harm us?

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:28.160
[Amit Varma]: And I don't need to specify what I mean by us, because I think all our economic fates

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.000
[Amit Varma]: are in a way tied together.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.240
[Amit Varma]: So if the US economy suffers in some way, the effects of that are felt everywhere.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.720
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I alternately feel optimistic and pessimistic on this.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.640
[Guest]: But I think sometimes I feel we have entered globally this phase of anti-immigrant sentiment

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.880
[Guest]: of protectionism, where everybody is now just going to put up walls and undo all the work

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880
[Guest]: of the last few decades.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.280
[Guest]: And sometimes I feel that Trump is just an aberration.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.920
[Guest]: He is literally the only guy at the top, like at least amongst politicians who believes

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.920
[Guest]: in this.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:09.600
[Guest]: So once he moves on, let's say even Mike Pence is not exactly a protectionist, or he's not

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.920
[Guest]: as much of an anti-immigration guy, neither is the Republican leadership in Congress.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:20.360
[Guest]: So I'm hoping that once Trump goes away, things will slowly return to normal.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.080
[Amit Varma]: But like I said, I alternate between optimism and pessimism.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the other argument is that, look, Trump got to the top because he got something

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.280
[Amit Varma]: in the culture, he appealed to something in the culture, and that includes these nativist

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.940
[Amit Varma]: instincts and this anti-immigration and anti-outsourcing feeling.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.680
[Amit Varma]: So even if Trump himself goes, once those ideas and those sentiments are there in the

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.880
[Amit Varma]: culture, somebody else will come along to cater to them.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.480
[Guest]: Yeah, true.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: And it's very likely that that can happen.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
[Guest]: And in this instance, I'm hoping that special interest groups from business side are able

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
[Guest]: to prevail.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.960
[Guest]: It's like one of those rare sides when I'm hoping the lobbies win.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:04.760
[Amit Varma]: Right, because their interest appears to coincide with ours for this one.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.080
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:10.320
[Guest]: Because there are some things you have to do that are much more complex for your economy

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.600
[Guest]: or for your country to do well, which are not always easy to sell in a soundbite or

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600
[Guest]: in a tweet.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.440
[Guest]: But as long as enough people at the top are on board with it, you know, hopefully things

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.240
[Guest]: will go back to the way they were.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.140
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to ask you a tough question here for which it's unfair of me to ask you this

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.300
[Amit Varma]: because I myself don't have any answers.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.960
[Amit Varma]: But of course, I don't have the depth of knowledge that you do.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.760
[Amit Varma]: We both agreed that these two answers that Trump offered to the decline in jobs or the

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:42.120
[Amit Varma]: underemployment crisis, as it were, are wrong answers that immigration is hugely beneficial

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:48.080
[Amit Varma]: for an economy in many, many unseen ways in some seen ways and globalization is good on

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.520
[Amit Varma]: the whole and the American people themselves benefit from it.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.120
[Amit Varma]: But so my tough question to you is that if you are in Trump's place and you have to craft

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:01.280
[Amit Varma]: an answer for those people in middle America saying that, you know, why don't I have jobs

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.040
[Amit Varma]: as good as my parents did?

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.680
[Amit Varma]: What is your sort of I mean, I know it's a very complex question, and it's a multifactorial

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.680
[Amit Varma]: thing.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.760
[Amit Varma]: But broadly, what is it that a politician can say in such a situation, which is the

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.160
[Amit Varma]: truth and not just, you know, the sort of stories that Trump was telling?

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I think that's what John McCain tried to do.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.440
[Guest]: And I think Mitt Romney as well, where they said that, listen, this is the reality live

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:33.600
[Guest]: in a global economy, and those jobs are not coming back, but we have better jobs and better

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.600
[Guest]: industries today.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:39.440
[Guest]: I guess it's always much better to be a knowledge based or service based economy than a manufacturing

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.440
[Guest]: based economy.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.080
[Guest]: It just makes logical sense.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.800
[Guest]: So we've had politicians sell that in the past.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.040
[Amit Varma]: And it doesn't do it in an arithmetic way.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Right, right.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040
[Amit Varma]: And those ideas don't sell.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.520
[Amit Varma]: And have adults in the room actually come to power saying those kind of adult things?

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:03.040
[Guest]: Yeah, in the sense that you had Bill Clinton, who, who crafted NAFTA.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:08.640
[Guest]: So he was this, he was the centrist Democrat, right before Bill Clinton, and all the other

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.320
[Guest]: leaders of the Democratic Party were much more leftist.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.080
[Guest]: Bill Clinton came and ruled in a much more centrist way.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Part of it was because of Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress, but did he campaign

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.680
[Amit Varma]: as a centrist?

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.680
[Amit Varma]: Or did he govern as a centrist?

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.800
[Guest]: They're very different things.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:30.200
[Guest]: He did campaign as a centrist as well, I believe, especially in his re-election, for sure.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:40.040
[Guest]: But I think even his rise in the early 90s, or 91 or 92, was running as a centrist, saying

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:48.640
[Guest]: that we need to move beyond the days of socialist Democrats, which he did successfully.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.640
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:54.840
[Amit Varma]: Gaurav, normally, I end my episodes by asking my guests, you know, what are they hopeful

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.840
[Amit Varma]: about?

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.840
[Amit Varma]: And what are they fearful about?

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.440
[Amit Varma]: But you've already, I think, sort of answered that question, let me kind of paraphrase what

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.440
[Amit Varma]: you said.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.520
[Amit Varma]: And if you have something to add to that, and what you're fearful of, is that people

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.840
[Amit Varma]: are building walls across the world, there is an anti-immigration sentiment, there is

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.080
[Amit Varma]: a protectionist sentiment, not just in the US, but elsewhere, especially where authoritarian

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.360
[Amit Varma]: figures have taken over in the US, in Hungary, in Turkey, even in India, and you're worried

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.800
[Amit Varma]: that we might all be shutting ourselves off and becoming more insular, which would have

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.040
[Amit Varma]: seemed unthinkable 10 years ago, when globalization seems so inevitable.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.440
[Amit Varma]: And what you're hopeful about is that, hey, it's only Trump right now in the American

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.440
[Amit Varma]: system.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.760
[Amit Varma]: There's no one else who really feels like this.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's an accident of history.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.640
[Amit Varma]: Is there something you'd like to add to these?

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.760
[Amit Varma]: Or have I managed to paraphrase you accurately?

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.760
[Guest]: Oh, yeah.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.640
[Guest]: I mean, I think that pretty much paraphrases it.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:52.240
[Guest]: And one more thing I'm optimistic about is that the US political system is designed with

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.600
[Guest]: checks and balances and opportunities to course-correct.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.800
[Guest]: So unlike in India, where once you get into power, you have a lot more structural advantage

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.240
[Guest]: to keep perpetuating that power, in the US, it's easier to course-correct, relatively

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240
[Guest]: speaking.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:12.600
[Guest]: So I'm hopeful that in November, the Democrats will take back at least one house of the Congress

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:21.080
[Guest]: and then act like a check against Trump's anti-immigrant and anti-trade policies.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.840
[Amit Varma]: Your point on how it's relatively easier in the US to course-correct is a hopeful note

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.520
[Amit Varma]: for you, because you're in New York, but not so hopeful for me, because I'm in Bombay.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.480
[Amit Varma]: Gaurav, thanks so much for coming on the show.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.760
[Amit Varma]: It should have happened long ago, and I hope it keeps happening in the future.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.760
[Amit Varma]: Thanks again.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.760
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.760
[Amit Varma]: It was great to be on the show.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.880

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.720
[Amit Varma]: with Anupam Manoor.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.720
[Amit Varma]: Do look for those.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:04.400
[Amit Varma]: In those episodes, we went into the philosophical and economic arguments against restricting

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:10.960
[Amit Varma]: immigration, that is for immigration, and against protectionism, that is for free trade,

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.880
[Amit Varma]: in quite a lot of detail.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.720
[Amit Varma]: Today we spoke more in the American context of what Trump has done.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.120
