00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Intel.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Two roads diverged in a wood and you, you took the one you're passing through.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Why do we take the paths we take in our lives?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
[Amit Varma]: For some of us, it's social convention and inertia.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: When I was growing up in the 1980s, good middle class boys were supposed to be engineers and doctors.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And maybe do that newfangled thing an MBA, certainly try for UPSC.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Why not just go along?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Some of us manage to ignore these conventions and find that golden intersection between doing something we love,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[Amit Varma]: something we are good at and something we can get paid for.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: But whatever choice we make, there's usually some rationale behind it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe a steady career, maybe a pot of gold if we get to the end of the rainbow,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: maybe an artistic satisfaction that can't be measured only in banknotes.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
[Amit Varma]: But some people, they go against the tide and make choices that seem destined not to work.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Your enemies laugh at you, your friends feel sorry for you.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: But you gotta do what you gotta do.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: As a great Kashi Nath Singh wrote in Kashi Ka Assi,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Bhaar mein jaye duniya, hum bajaye harmoniya.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Let the world go to hell, I will play my harmonium.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Abhinandan Sekri, the founder and CEO of News Laundry.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Abhinandan joined the news industry as a journalist with NewsTrack,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: a video news magazine that circulated by videocassette long before the internet existed.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
[Amit Varma]: His career took many unconventional routes after that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
[Amit Varma]: He was an assistant director on Meera Nair's film, Monsoon Wedding.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
[Amit Varma]: He jumped into making travel shows for television when there was no market for travel shows on television.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
[Amit Varma]: He started an NGO with Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, among others,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: at a time when they were all unknown and such activism seemed doomed to failure.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[Amit Varma]: He wrote comedy for television while the world went to hell around him.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And eventually, he formed News Laundry, a media house with a difference.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
[Amit Varma]: They would ignore advertisers and subsist directly of the goodwill of their readers.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Today, everyone is talking about this as a new trend in the creator economy.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Abhinandan and his team have been doing this for a decade.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
[Amit Varma]: When I invited him on the show and he agreed, I didn't have to do much digging about what kind of person he is.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
[Amit Varma]: One thing I love about Abhinandan is that what you see is what you get.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
[Amit Varma]: His public persona has no filters. I love that about him.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Before recording this episode, we were chatting about Aakar Patel's delightful tweets

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and I pointed out that Aakar has become a personification of the phrase, no more fucks to give.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Aakar is fearless in a way that most of us can only admire from a distance.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I felt Abhinandan had reached that state as well.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
[Amit Varma]: But he told me, nope, he still has some way to go.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Be that as it may, he is a fearless crusader for a better India.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And in times when the rest of the media seems to have sold itself out,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
[Amit Varma]: News Laundry continues to speak truth to power.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Many of us admire this, but we should also put our money where our mouth is.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
[Amit Varma]: If you agree, head on over to newslaundry.com slash subscription and support News Laundry.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
[Amit Varma]: You can even get a 25% discount if you write to Abhinandan at an email ID he reveals at the end of the show.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
[Amit Varma]: But I would say, ignore the discount, pay the full price. Pay to keep news free.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Now if that sounds like a commercial, it isn't. The commercial comes now.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
[Amit Varma]: How secure are we?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
[Amit Varma]: In general, we are not as secure as we think.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
[Amit Varma]: We rely on the state for the rule of law, but across the world, states tend to be predators rather than protectors.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
[Amit Varma]: We do get some security that comes from social trust and conventions, but that can work both ways.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
[Amit Varma]: One place where we are relatively secure though is the internet.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
[Amit Varma]: I often speak of technology with hope, as it empowers individuals and it also protects them.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And it does it so well and in such an unseen way that we often take it for granted.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
[Amit Varma]: There is no better example of this than the sponsor of this episode, Intel.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Devices powered by Intel help businesses stay connected and secure and provide them performance and stability.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Intel's 11th Gen vPro platform has layers of security that go beyond software,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
[Amit Varma]: with advanced threat detection and comprehensive multi-level security features.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
[Amit Varma]: No one will mess with you if you have Intel by your side.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
[Amit Varma]: The Intel vPro platform, built for business, wherever business happens.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Abhinandan, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit. Pleasure to be here.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
[Amit Varma]: So it's interesting, you know, I realized while looking up your bare biographical details that we are the same age.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Amit Varma]: You're both 47, though I'll get to 48 before you, so I'll be a step ahead.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
[Amit Varma]: And although we have sort of had orthogonal careers in the media, in journalism and all of that,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
[Amit Varma]: I actually don't know much about you and I'm not even sure how much we really have in common,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
[Amit Varma]: even though we've almost had, you know, parallel lives in Delhi and Bombay.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
[Amit Varma]: I was in Delhi for a very brief while.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
[Amit Varma]: I was in Bombay for a very brief while.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
[Amit Varma]: There you go, yeah.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
[Amit Varma]: And I've also worked in television and I've also been a journalist and we both do podcasts, all of that.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
[Amit Varma]: So I want to know a little bit more about the non-public persona.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Like if somebody searches for your name, you're all over.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the delightful things that I kind of like about everything I've seen of yours and whatever,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
[Amit Varma]: is that what you see is what you get, you know, you're just putting yourself out there.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
[Amit Varma]: So one gets a sense that there is a public persona of Abhinandan Sekri and hey, everybody knows that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure a lot of people must have told you that they feel a sense of familiarity with you when they meet you

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
[Amit Varma]: because they're so used to watching you.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
[Amit Varma]: But take me before that, like, you know, where did you grow up?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
[Amit Varma]: What was your childhood like?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
[Amit Varma]: What kind of a boy were you?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
[Guest]: Well, I've been through, let's say, two distinct phases as a boy.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
[Guest]: I had a very idyllic small town childhood.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
[Guest]: You know, Malguri days of the North, kind of.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
[Guest]: Dehradun was a small town, small town where everybody walked.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
[Guest]: The only time your car came out was if you're going to the club, you know, one of those evenings.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
[Guest]: My dad was a fauji, my mother was a school teacher.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
[Guest]: And Dehradun was a town for retired people and faujis and teachers and schools.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
[Guest]: And I'm talking like the 70s and 80s.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
[Guest]: So there weren't as many schools as there are now.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
[Guest]: Like, there was like, there were no red lights in Dehradun till like, even the late 90s.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
[Guest]: It's just after Uttarakhand was made and became a capital, it became anything.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
[Guest]: So, and when dad was in the army, you know, before he took premature retirement,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
[Guest]: because mum was a teacher in Vellum Girls School, we were allowed to be educated at the Doon School.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
[Guest]: So it was like a quota, kind of.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
[Guest]: So especially when many people who are, who like me, have got the benefit of quota,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
[Guest]: I don't realize we are quota kids.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest]: And when they grow up and they're doing really well, they say, bloody, what is this quota?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
[Guest]: I was like, can I use F words here on your show?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
[Unknown]: Of course, please.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
[Unknown]: I was like, fuck you, you're a quota kid.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
[Guest]: You would have been nothing had it not been for a quota.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
[Guest]: So, you know, I went to Vellum Boys School from class 1 to 6 and then Doon 7 to 12.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
[Guest]: And in fact, my grandfather used to teach Tamil and English at Doon.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
[Guest]: That's much before I was born.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
[Guest]: So our family has been in Dehradun for a long time.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
[Guest]: Mother is a Tamilian and father is a Punjabi.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
[Guest]: But during the holidays, my dad was in the army.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Guest]: So he was posted to, you know, Siliguri, Bhopal, Mathura.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
[Guest]: We spent a lot of time in cantonments, which meant air rifles.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
[Guest]: And now when I think of it, maybe that's how we've turned out so screwed up.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
[Guest]: Like, I would never let my nephew go with an air gun to shoot squirrels and chameleons and birds.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
[Guest]: But that's what we did, you know, because cantonments are safe.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
[Guest]: The rule was you had to get back home when lights are on.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
[Guest]: So you'd go into the bushes, you'd go into the thicket, you'd catch, you know,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
[Guest]: in little Rasna bottles, we'd catch tadpoles and then watch them grow.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
[Guest]: In Hajmola bottles, catch caterpillars, watch them become pupas and then butterflies.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
[Guest]: And even Dehradun was like that.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
[Guest]: You could go in. There was no fear.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Guest]: Like from the time I was six or seven, I could walk anywhere I wanted.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
[Guest]: My folks weren't worried.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
[Guest]: So yeah, it was an idyllic childhood.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
[Guest]: And school was, you know, although I was a day scholar till I was in class nine,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
[Guest]: because I was allowed to be all the both well and do all boarding.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
[Guest]: Because my mother was a teacher, I was allowed to go back home in the evening.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
[Guest]: So it was fun.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:43.000
[Guest]: I was a kind of, I won't say I was shy, but I was a quieter kid till I was maybe 12 or 13.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
[Guest]: After which I became an aggressive boy.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Guest]: I was very tiny. I was much smaller than all my batchmates.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
[Guest]: I was like, you know, way, way smaller.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
[Guest]: So I guess you compensate for that by being extremely aggressive.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
[Guest]: Because you know, boarding school, it's like prison rules.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Guest]: You know, if you don't push back, you.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
[Guest]: So you have to compensate for size.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Guest]: If, you know, if you fuck with me, I'm going to give you such a tongue lashing

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
[Guest]: and humiliate you in front of everybody.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
[Guest]: So that's how you get a bit aggressive.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Guest]: So now when I look back, I, you know, I'd like to not have been that aggressive

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
[Guest]: when I was in my teens.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
[Guest]: But those are the two.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
[Guest]: But yeah, before that, I was very quiet and retiring.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Guest]: I have two older sisters.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Guest]: So in any case, I was used to being quiet.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
[Guest]: One is six years older, one is three years older.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[Guest]: And there was, you know, kite flying, going for those Jhankis of Ramlila,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
[Guest]: watching the Ravan thing from the club.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
[Guest]: And you were the youngest because all my sister's friends are much older than me.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
[Guest]: So you, you were the sidekick who ran behind the gang.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Guest]: No one really was looking out for you.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest]: So it was a good, I'd say it was a very peaceful, happy childhood.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I've seen pictures on your Instagram of your school years,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
[Amit Varma]: I think where, you know, there's one picture of a group of you

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and someone makes a comment about which one is you.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[Amit Varma]: But I could make out you're kind of in the center.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
[Amit Varma]: You're the same kind of face.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And there's another one where there are, you know, one, two, three,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
[Amit Varma]: it's like a vertical picture, people leaning on each other

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
[Amit Varma]: and you're the kid at the bottom.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you mentioned sort of like one of the things

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
[Amit Varma]: that I remember not just having in school,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
[Amit Varma]: but kind of for much longer.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think people have it throughout their lives.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
[Amit Varma]: It's sort of the anxiety of fitting in, you know,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
[Amit Varma]: where you're still kind of discovering who you are in a sense,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
[Amit Varma]: as if that process is ever complete.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
[Amit Varma]: But that's sort of a dominant anxiety for many people.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
[Amit Varma]: At one level, the anxiety of fitting in.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
[Amit Varma]: At another level, the anxiety of what people will think of you,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
[Amit Varma]: which drives sometimes the things that you do,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
[Unknown]: the music you listen to and the music you pretend to listen to,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
[Amit Varma]: the books you carry around and the books you really enjoy reading

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of these things about myself,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
[Amit Varma]: I realized only later through looking back,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
[Amit Varma]: through self-reflection and all of that.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And it seems you've also kind of done a little bit of that

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
[Amit Varma]: because you just use the phrase now when I look back, you know.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about, you know,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
[Amit Varma]: when you look back at the young Abhinandan,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
[Amit Varma]: what were those anxieties?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
[Amit Varma]: When did you lose those anxieties?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Where does that process come if it is complete?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think it's complete for you.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think I kind of took a long time to get there.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
[Amit Varma]: But where does it happen where you get comfortable in your own skin?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
[Guest]: I mean, I would say there wasn't a time, like it wasn't an event.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
[Guest]: It's more a process like the pupa turning into a butterfly kind of thing.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Guest]: But yeah, I'd say maybe late 20s, early 30s onwards,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
[Guest]: I was, you know, pretty sure of my confidence levels were solid.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
[Guest]: It wasn't a put on confidence which you have when you're in your 20s.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
[Guest]: Like you said, what is expected of you is like,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
[Guest]: and I was always confident.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
[Guest]: And I'll get into the reason why that is,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
[Guest]: you know, when we get into this a little bit.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
[Guest]: But the real confidence, I guess, only in your 30s

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
[Guest]: is when it kind of starts to develop.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
[Guest]: Stuff like I love Punjabi music, right?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
[Guest]: So if I was going to pick up a girl or, you know,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
[Guest]: I would switch to English music, you know,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
[Guest]: right up to your late 20s or 30s.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Guest]: Now I don't give a shit.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
[Guest]: I was like, fuck, I listen to Geeta Zelda.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
[Unknown]: You want to sit, sit. You don't sit, don't sit.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
[Guest]: So those kind of things, you know, take a little longer.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
[Guest]: But I mean, yeah, that's when it happened.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
[Guest]: And I think Delhi has a lot to do with it, you know,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
[Guest]: because when I was young, when you talk about the anxieties,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
[Guest]: one is, of course, your middle class.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
[Guest]: And, you know, the way middle class is used is,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
[Guest]: let's face it, I was privileged even though

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
[Guest]: I was not a Nikhil Nanda or Jyotirath Dasindhya,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[Guest]: but I was still more privileged than 90% of the country.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[Guest]: But because our society has been so, you know,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
[Guest]: segmented that you're the bottom of the top.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
[Guest]: So stuff like not being able to afford the shoes

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
[Guest]: that others could, you know, not be able to afford a Nike,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
[Guest]: you wear power, it, you know,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
[Guest]: it kind of bites you a little self-conscious about it.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
[Guest]: But luckily it was never a big thing for me because my folks,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
[Guest]: I mean, that was a new thing of what brand I was wearing

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[Guest]: only when I, you know, in my teens.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
[Guest]: Before that, because of the kind of people my parents are,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
[Guest]: I was never even aware that there was anything

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
[Guest]: other than what we have.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
[Guest]: One is because there was no cable TV.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
[Guest]: So you didn't know.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
[Guest]: B, that wasn't a priority in our house.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
[Guest]: So you didn't know anyway.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
[Guest]: And there was never any shame.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
[Guest]: Like my mother comes from a family of, you know,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
[Guest]: teachers and academics, like my aunts have been teachers,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
[Guest]: my mother's a teacher, my grandfather's a teacher.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
[Guest]: And, you know, there was a typical Tamilians

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
[Guest]: who really chatto a lot of books.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
[Guest]: We had a lot of books at home.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
[Guest]: Like we had more books than anything else, basically.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
[Guest]: You may have a broken sofa, but your books are, you know,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
[Guest]: kept well.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
[Guest]: So there was never really that need.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
[Guest]: But I did go through a phase, I'd say in my teens to college,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
[Guest]: where you weren't, you were aware that you don't have

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
[Guest]: as much as the other kids who you grew up with.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
[Guest]: But honestly, it did not impact me as much as it impacted

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
[Guest]: others around that I saw, you know, because there were

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
[Guest]: a lot of us who were service kids and a lot of us

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
[Guest]: who were, you know, very wealthy.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
[Guest]: So it did impact me a little bit, but not enough

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
[Guest]: for it to take a knock on my confidence.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
[Guest]: I would be self-conscious about it and sometimes

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
[Guest]: a little embarrassed, but not enough to not speak out.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
[Guest]: So, yeah, and I think for that, you know,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
[Guest]: my mom and my sisters are, and I do think,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
[Guest]: I'm not married and I don't have kids,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
[Guest]: but it's funny coming from me.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
[Guest]: I think the unit of family, I mean, for all my progressive

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
[Guest]: and, you know, bohemian choices and angles in life,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
[Guest]: from my experience, I'll say, if you have a solid family,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
[Guest]: you can be so fucking confident that no one can shake that confidence.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
[Guest]: Because no matter what I did, for my mother,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
[Guest]: I was always a star.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
[Guest]: You know, I'm always the star.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
[Guest]: Even now she says, you know,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
[Guest]: internet pe kuch chalata hoga type, you know, she's,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
[Guest]: but, and I have two older sisters,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
[Guest]: they're both really smart, bright, very independent.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
[Guest]: So confidence was something that I saw and learned.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
[Guest]: So, yeah, so I was conscious that I'm not as well off

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
[Guest]: as many of the kids I'm growing up with,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
[Guest]: but, and sometimes I was embarrassed because,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
[Guest]: like your car doesn't have an AC, your car may break down.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
[Guest]: I have a secondhand Fiat, which is like 40,000 rupees.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
[Guest]: And at that time, you know, Maruti 800s had just come out.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
[Guest]: So people had Maruti 800s, some who were very rich had Mercedes.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
[Guest]: And you're going for a, you know,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
[Guest]: a friend's party who lives in this big bungalow

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
[Guest]: in North Delhi somewhere, and, you know,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
[Guest]: his probably one wheel of his car is worth your car.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
[Guest]: So that, you know, you, but otherwise, you know,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
[Guest]: me and another friend of mine were both service background.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
[Guest]: So we'd always say, you know,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
[Guest]: our dads couldn't give us a BMW, but give us a car.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
[Guest]: You know, that's, even if it didn't work half the time,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
[Guest]: which is more than what a lot of others get, but yeah.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
[Guest]: So, I mean, that kind of,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
[Guest]: it vanished early enough for me for it to,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Guest]: and even today money is not a motivation in my life.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
[Guest]: I want to, you know, fairly comfortable life.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
[Guest]: And I want choices, but I read, I mean,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
[Guest]: I, you see how I dress, you know,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
[Guest]: my entire wardrobe must be worth 20,000 rupees.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
[Guest]: I don't give a fuck about that shit.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
[Guest]: That's never been an issue, but it was when I was young.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
[Guest]: I tell, you know, many of my younger peers this,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
[Guest]: that when I wanted to buy expensive stuff,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
[Guest]: I couldn't afford it.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
[Guest]: So basically God outwits you.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
[Guest]: He gives you what you want, but not when you want it.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
[Guest]: And when he gives it to you, you don't want it.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
[Guest]: So I was very, you know, keen to buy, you know,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
[Guest]: shoes, kids that were expensive, you know,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
[Guest]: back then Air Jordans and shit, you couldn't,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
[Guest]: I couldn't afford them.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
[Guest]: Now I may not be able to buy a Rolls,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
[Guest]: but I can buy any shoe I want,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
[Guest]: but I don't have anything other than juttis

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
[Guest]: and you know, my one pair of kids.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
[Guest]: I used to love the Harley Davidson boots

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
[Guest]: because I'd seen friends of mine wear it.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
[Guest]: And a pair of Harley Davidson boots at that time

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
[Guest]: was like 8,000, 7,000, I'm talking like nineties, man.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
[Guest]: That was like, when I was a new strike,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
[Guest]: my salary was three and a half thousand bucks.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
[Guest]: So when you can afford it,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
[Guest]: you just want Kolhapuri chappals and kurta pyjamas.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
[Amit Varma]: So, so yeah.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, maybe the mindset of not wanting things

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
[Amit Varma]: is also a kind of richness.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned the books that surrounded you in your house

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
[Amit Varma]: and you know how it didn't matter

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
[Amit Varma]: if the sofa was broken, the books were all around.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
[Amit Varma]: And my childhood was similar to that,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
[Amit Varma]: extremely privileged.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
[Amit Varma]: My dad was a civil servant,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
[Amit Varma]: surrounded by books all the time.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's what I remember.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
[Amit Varma]: So my dad passed away earlier this year

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
[Amit Varma]: and we just sold his house

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and I have to go there next month

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
[Guest]: to clear out some of the stuff.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
[Amit Varma]: This is in Chandigarh.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And the thing that I think about most is books

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
[Amit Varma]: because all those books

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
[Amit Varma]: and I've got to find someone to give it away

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
[Amit Varma]: to some library or charity or whatever.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And all those books in a sense are my nursery.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
[Amit Varma]: They are kind of what shaped me

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
[Amit Varma]: because as a kid, I just sort of grew up

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
[Amit Varma]: just reading all the time

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and in different ways,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of forming my imaginative world there

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and kind of starting from there.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
[Amit Varma]: What was it like for you?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Because you mentioned your mother was also an academic.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Her whole side of the family was academics.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
[Amit Varma]: They were all obviously into reading.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Reading must have been both something sacred

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
[Amit Varma]: and at the same time a source of great pleasure

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
[Amit Varma]: for all of you.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
[Amit Varma]: what kind of stuff you read.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And of course we had a limited variety of books

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
[Amit Varma]: in general available.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
[Amit Varma]: So kids would grow up reading the same thing,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
[Amit Varma]: even the serious reading they would progress to

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
[Amit Varma]: would be, you know,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure there are lots of commonalities,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
[Amit Varma]: but give me a sense of how that was shaping you.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
[Guest]: A lot of what you read at that time

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
[Guest]: was because you heard your mother say,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
[Guest]: oh, this is very good.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
[Guest]: So you read it and you didn't really have a view

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
[Guest]: of what's good or bad.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
[Guest]: You just read.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
[Guest]: So my mother had this big collection,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
[Guest]: she still does, of P.G. Woodhouse

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
[Unknown]: and Jeeves and all that.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
[Guest]: So you went through those

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
[Guest]: before you really could understand them.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
[Guest]: Like now when I think back,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
[Guest]: I mean, I don't think, you know,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
[Guest]: 13, 14-year-olds should be reading this,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
[Guest]: especially someone who has no insight

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
[Guest]: or idea of British humor or British life

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
[Guest]: or British society.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
[Guest]: There's a lot of that subtext

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
[Guest]: and that's the world it's in.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
[Guest]: But you read it because you heard your mother say,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
[Guest]: oh, how fine, haha, innit?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
[Guest]: So you read it.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
[Guest]: The other thing that my folks had

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
[Guest]: was they had all the reader's digests

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
[Guest]: because they used to subscribe

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
[Guest]: from like 72 onwards.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
[Guest]: They were all...

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
[Guest]: So I got operated for appendicitis

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
[Guest]: when I was in class eight.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
[Guest]: So I had to, you know,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
[Guest]: be in bed for about 10, 12 days.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
[Guest]: And during that time,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
[Guest]: I chartered, like,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
[Guest]: I think from 72, 73 onwards,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
[Guest]: all the reader's digests.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
[Guest]: So, you know,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
[Guest]: whether it's that drama in real life...

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
[Unknown]: Humor in uniform.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
[Unknown]: Humor in uniform,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
[Guest]: college humor,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
[Guest]: laughter, the best medicine.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
[Guest]: And of course,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
[Guest]: there was drama in real life

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
[Guest]: and there used to be this,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
[Guest]: you know, the long walk home type.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
[Guest]: Later I got to know

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
[Guest]: there was a certain Christian angle

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
[Guest]: to the reader's digest.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
[Guest]: So all these stories

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
[Guest]: had a certain message

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
[Guest]: about there being a God

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
[Guest]: and you should be good.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
[Guest]: And it was subliminal.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
[Guest]: Of course, it didn't

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
[Guest]: convert you to Christianity

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
[Guest]: in case everyone wants to go

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
[Guest]: and, you know, attack the reader's digest.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
[Guest]: But later I understood

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
[Guest]: that there was a certain politics

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
[Guest]: behind that as well.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: But I charted all that.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
[Guest]: Then you try to pick up stuff

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
[Guest]: that is way beyond your league,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
[Guest]: like War and Peace

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
[Guest]: and Thorn Birds,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
[Guest]: which used to be this thick book.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Colin McAloo, I remember that.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
[Guest]: So, you know,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
[Guest]: you pick those up,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
[Guest]: you abandon those halfway,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
[Guest]: but you learn something.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
[Guest]: You learn English words.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
[Guest]: Then there was a lot of Thomas Hardy,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
[Guest]: which I would still recommend,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
[Guest]: that, you know,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
[Guest]: I mean, I wouldn't recommend it

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
[Guest]: to someone your in my age

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
[Guest]: because there's a certain,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
[Guest]: you know, I don't mean Tess

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
[Guest]: and Jude the Obscure,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
[Guest]: which are very depressing,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
[Guest]: but, you know,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest]: Return of the Native

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
[Guest]: or Far From the Madding Crowd.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
[Guest]: There's a certain Yash Chopra-esque-ness

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
[Guest]: to his books.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
[Guest]: There's the hero

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
[Guest]: and there's the Evelyn Bathsheba.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
[Guest]: She's vain.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
[Guest]: And then, you know,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
[Guest]: she falls in love with someone

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
[Guest]: and then, you know,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
[Guest]: the other guy comes

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
[Guest]: and, you know, saves her

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
[Guest]: and then there's some tragedy.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
[Guest]: So, I mean,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
[Guest]: I think Thomas Hardy was,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Guest]: the thinking man,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
[Guest]: Yash Chopra.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
[Guest]: So, you know,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
[Guest]: those kind of books were there.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
[Guest]: So those you appreciated

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
[Guest]: at a younger age.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
[Guest]: And I still would recommend them

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
[Guest]: to people who are young

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
[Guest]: because I think there's a lot,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
[Guest]: I mean, there's something,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
[Guest]: there's a feel-good factor.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: You learn something,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
[Guest]: he writes well,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
[Guest]: it's a story well told.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
[Guest]: Then, of course,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
[Guest]: you had the, you know,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
[Guest]: she had all those classics,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
[Guest]: Leo Tolstoy and Dickens,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
[Guest]: Shakespeare.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
[Guest]: In fact,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
[Guest]: we still have some of,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
[Guest]: those ones which have that

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
[Guest]: that orange with the gold emboss,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
[Unknown]: you know,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
[Amit Varma]: the books I'm talking about.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
[Guest]: So, I still have those lying.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
[Guest]: You don't have the heart

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
[Guest]: to throw them.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
[Guest]: Although,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
[Guest]: when my mom sold a house

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
[Guest]: in Dehradun

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
[Guest]: and, you know,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
[Guest]: moved to Delhi

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
[Guest]: because here there was a flat,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
[Guest]: the books couldn't fit here.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
[Guest]: So, we gave a lot of them

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
[Guest]: and that was pretty heartbreaking.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
[Guest]: I would have loved

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
[Guest]: to get them all

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
[Guest]: because you can't accommodate

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
[Guest]: those books

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
[Guest]: in an apartment

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
[Guest]: which you could in a,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
[Unknown]: in a bungalow

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
[Guest]: in Dehradun

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
[Guest]: in a bungalow

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
[Guest]: in Dehradun.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
[Guest]: So, yeah,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
[Guest]: that was the kind of stuff

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
[Guest]: and my sister,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
[Guest]: I've even read

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
[Guest]: Mills and Boons,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
[Guest]: yeah,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
[Guest]: because my sister went

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
[Guest]: through the

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
[Guest]: Mills and Boons phase.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
[Guest]: So, it was lying there.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
[Guest]: You read it,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
[Guest]: of course,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
[Guest]: they'd laugh at you

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
[Guest]: but you read it.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
[Guest]: But, you know,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
[Guest]: like,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
[Guest]: when you grow up

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
[Guest]: with two sisters

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
[Guest]: much older than you,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
[Guest]: you get bullied a lot.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
[Guest]: Like, A,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
[Guest]: you get bashed

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
[Guest]: really badly

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
[Guest]: because I don't know

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
[Guest]: whether it's gendered

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
[Guest]: to say this now

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
[Guest]: but, you know,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
[Guest]: if you're an older brother

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
[Guest]: and you hit

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
[Guest]: a younger sister,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
[Guest]: I'm sure the parents

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
[Guest]: will, like, whack you

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
[Amit Varma]: but, you know,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
[Amit Varma]: as my older sisters

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
[Guest]: and I was much tinier

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
[Guest]: so...

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
[Guest]: They're going to listen

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
[Guest]: to this and they're

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
[Guest]: going to whack you again.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
[Guest]: And then stuff do,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
[Guest]: cruel things like

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
[Guest]: paint your nails

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
[Guest]: and then you don't

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: know how to get it off

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
[Guest]: because, you know,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
[Amit Varma]: you're, like,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
[Amit Varma]: six, seven.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
[Amit Varma]: You try to wash it off

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
[Amit Varma]: and it doesn't come off

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and then you have to

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
[Amit Varma]: go to school the next day

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
[Guest]: and I'm like,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
[Guest]: and, you know,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
[Guest]: class one, two

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
[Guest]: in an all-boys school,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
[Amit Varma]: it can get cruel.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
[Unknown]: They say,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
[Guest]: what the fuck are you wearing?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
[Guest]: You know,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
[Guest]: like,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
[Guest]: you're a girl,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
[Guest]: you're a girl,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
[Guest]: type shit.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
[Guest]: So then, of course,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
[Guest]: my mom took it off

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
[Guest]: when I went back,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
[Guest]: so you,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
[Guest]: shit like that happens

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
[Guest]: so you pick up their books,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
[Guest]: you learn,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: you...

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
[Guest]: But one thing

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
[Guest]: about growing up

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
[Guest]: with two older sisters

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
[Guest]: is you,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
[Guest]: you have a

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
[Guest]: richer and more,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
[Guest]: a better sense of

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
[Guest]: who you are.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
[Guest]: That's the upside

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
[Guest]: of having

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
[Guest]: a bruised face

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
[Guest]: and nails

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
[Guest]: on your

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
[Guest]: sweater.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
[Guest]: Yeah,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
[Guest]: so that was,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
[Guest]: and there was a lot

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
[Guest]: of kite flying,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
[Guest]: I remember,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
[Guest]: in Dehradun.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
[Amit Varma]: I used to fly kites.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
[Amit Varma]: It was fun.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
[Amit Varma]: What did you want to be

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
[Amit Varma]: at this point in time?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
[Amit Varma]: What did you want to be

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
[Amit Varma]: when you grow up?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
[Amit Varma]: did you,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
[Amit Varma]: did you,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
[Amit Varma]: for example,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
[Amit Varma]: ever have any

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
[Amit Varma]: inkling of the career

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
[Amit Varma]: you would go on to have?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Did you want to write

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
[Guest]: because you read so much

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
[Guest]: or were you just going

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
[Guest]: with the flow?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
[Guest]: And also,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
[Guest]: Amit, you know,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
[Guest]: you were the same age

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
[Guest]: as I am.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
[Guest]: There were not

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
[Guest]: just options

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
[Guest]: that were there.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
[Guest]: Like,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
[Guest]: what do you want to be?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
[Unknown]: Whatever job you get,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
[Unknown]: take it, son.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
[Guest]: You don't have

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
[Guest]: the means to think about it.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
[Guest]: So,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
[Guest]: I was in that zone.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
[Guest]: there was a time

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
[Guest]: when, you know,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
[Guest]: in class 11,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
[Guest]: you read Fountainhead

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
[Guest]: and you want to be

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
[Guest]: an architect,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
[Guest]: which is like

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
[Guest]: a dumb thing to do,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
[Guest]: but I guess I went

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
[Guest]: through that phase

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
[Guest]: and I actually did.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
[Unknown]: Not at my age,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
[Unknown]: you know.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe if you're a teen.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
[Guest]: Maybe if you're 7,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
[Guest]: yeah.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
[Guest]: So,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
[Guest]: but,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
[Guest]: I honestly had no idea.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
[Guest]: I stumbled into journalism

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
[Guest]: and I'll tell you how.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
[Guest]: I had no idea

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
[Guest]: what I wanted to be.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
[Guest]: But one thing

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
[Guest]: I remember

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
[Guest]: very early in life

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
[Guest]: at the back of my head

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
[Guest]: was that

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
[Guest]: I want to do something

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
[Guest]: on my own.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
[Guest]: I don't want to be,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
[Guest]: reporting to a boss.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
[Guest]: That,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
[Guest]: I had articulated it

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
[Guest]: a few times,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
[Guest]: but then I shut up

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
[Guest]: because

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
[Guest]: you don't have the ability

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
[Guest]: to speak.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
[Guest]: So,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
[Guest]: I would just keep,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
[Guest]: but I remember

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
[Guest]: that was

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
[Guest]: a key,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
[Guest]: that was the only thing

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
[Amit Varma]: that I knew.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Why did you feel like that?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
[Amit Varma]: can you put a finger on it?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
[Guest]: I don't know, yeah.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
[Guest]: I think

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
[Guest]: my college years

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
[Guest]: were

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
[Guest]: completely

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
[Guest]: uncush free.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
[Guest]: There was no one

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
[Guest]: watching over me.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
[Guest]: My sisters were either

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
[Guest]: here or abroad.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
[Guest]: And,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
[Guest]: I was pretty much,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
[Guest]: my parents weren't really

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
[Guest]: with me here at the time.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
[Guest]: And I was a bit

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
[Guest]: adrift in college.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
[Guest]: I was,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
[Guest]: like,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
[Guest]: no one was there

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
[Guest]: to ask me,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: have you

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
[Guest]: gone to class?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
[Guest]: Have you not gone to class?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Guest]: So I was doing

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
[Amit Varma]: what the fuck

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to do.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
[Guest]: This was Hansraj,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
[Guest]: you wouldn't get no marks.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
[Guest]: Hansraj,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
[Guest]: that was my second year.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
[Guest]: I remember,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
[Guest]: this thing was zero,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
[Guest]: because you could get

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
[Guest]: the admit card

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
[Guest]: by one old monk.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
[Guest]: Bottle was enough

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
[Guest]: to get your admit card

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
[Guest]: even if you didn't

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
[Guest]: have the attendance.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
[Guest]: So,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
[Guest]: I think at that phase,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
[Guest]: I was at my

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
[Guest]: rebellious

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
[Guest]: best,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
[Guest]: worst,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
[Guest]: I don't know

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
[Guest]: what the...

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
[Guest]: Peak.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
[Unknown]: Yeah,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
[Unknown]: at peak,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
[Guest]: yes,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
[Guest]: yes.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
[Guest]: Let's keep it neutral.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
[Guest]: It was in a good or bad way.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
[Guest]: And at that time,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
[Guest]: I think that

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
[Guest]: those years

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
[Guest]: formed my personality

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
[Guest]: to a great extent.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
[Guest]: And then I had,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
[Guest]: I think I had become

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
[Guest]: a kind of person

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
[Guest]: who I knew

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
[Guest]: would not,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
[Guest]: like,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
[Guest]: survive in a job

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
[Guest]: for very long.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
[Guest]: In the long run,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
[Guest]: I would need to do

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
[Guest]: something on my own.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
[Amit Varma]: that's all I can answer.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I guess because of

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
[Guest]: the rebelliousness.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
[Guest]: Rebelliousness

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
[Guest]: and,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
[Guest]: and yeah,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
[Guest]: you just,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
[Guest]: you just felt

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
[Guest]: that I have

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
[Guest]: some,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
[Guest]: I want to do something

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
[Guest]: that is not this,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
[Guest]: this or that.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
[Guest]: It'll be something else.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
[Amit Varma]: But that's something else

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
[Amit Varma]: was vague at the time.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
[Guest]: It was vague.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
[Guest]: I didn't know.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
[Guest]: when I was in college,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
[Guest]: I,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
[Guest]: in fact,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
[Unknown]: I wrote a few articles

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
[Guest]: for a magazine

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
[Guest]: called Parenting Here.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
[Unknown]: It used to be a

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
[Unknown]: magazine for parenting.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
[Guest]: What did you,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
[Guest]: what did you write for them?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
[Guest]: I wrote book reviews.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Oh,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
[Guest]: okay,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
[Amit Varma]: that's cool.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
[Guest]: So,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
[Guest]: so,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
[Guest]: I had,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
[Guest]: while I was in college,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
[Guest]: I,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
[Guest]: I had a huge,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
[Guest]: I used to read a lot

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
[Guest]: because you have a lot of time.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
[Guest]: You have a lot of intelligence,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
[Guest]: cerebral people.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
[Guest]: And that I wasn't a talker.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
[Guest]: I was a listener

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
[Guest]: because in any case,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
[Guest]: when you have sisters

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
[Guest]: six years older than you,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
[Guest]: you are not expected to talk.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
[Guest]: So you just listen.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
[Guest]: So I absorbed a lot

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
[Guest]: and I knew what to read,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
[Guest]: what to pick.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
[Guest]: And in college,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
[Guest]: I was the talker.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
[Guest]: And there,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
[Guest]: the people who I was

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
[Guest]: hanging out with weren't,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
[Guest]: they would not

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
[Guest]: be even allowed

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
[Guest]: into the circle

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
[Guest]: that my sister hung with,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
[Unknown]: you know,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
[Unknown]: whether it was a Bundy house,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
[Guest]: theater,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
[Guest]: that kind of,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
[Guest]: these are the people

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
[Guest]: who the police would drag.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
[Guest]: And,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
[Guest]: DU today

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
[Guest]: is a very tame version

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
[Guest]: of Delhi University

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
[Guest]: of the 90s.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
[Guest]: there,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
[Guest]: I've seen such horrible fights

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
[Guest]: which used to happen

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
[Guest]: between Hindu college

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
[Guest]: and Khalsa.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
[Guest]: And,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
[Guest]: the Kirodimal guys

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
[Guest]: would come and bash up

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
[Guest]: someone in the Hindu hostel

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
[Guest]: and then 50 guys

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
[Guest]: would march out

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
[Guest]: and bash up

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest]: 10 other people.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
[Guest]: So,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
[Guest]: I had friends

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
[Guest]: in the hostel there.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
[Guest]: Fuck a book,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
[Guest]: they wouldn't even

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
[Guest]: have a bunch of friends

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
[Guest]: like that in college.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
[Guest]: So,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
[Guest]: it was this,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
[Guest]: and I appreciated them,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
[Guest]: I liked them,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
[Guest]: it taught you survival.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
[Guest]: one thing I'll say

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
[Guest]: is Delhi University,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
[Guest]: I don't know

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
[Guest]: what it's like today

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
[Guest]: because I believe

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
[Guest]: now you have to

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
[Unknown]: get an ID card

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
[Guest]: to get in.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
[Guest]: But,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
[Guest]: if you've seen

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
[Guest]: Rang De Basanti,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
[Guest]: what I liked about

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
[Guest]: Rang De Basanti

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
[Guest]: was a very accurate

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
[Unknown]: reflection of DU.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
[Guest]: Like,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
[Guest]: that DJ guy,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
[Guest]: Aamir Khan.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
[Guest]: Like,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
[Guest]: when we were in college,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[Guest]: we used to hang out

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
[Guest]: with DJs

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
[Guest]: for the last 10-12 years.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
[Guest]: In fact,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
[Guest]: they used to,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: some of them

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
[Guest]: in the Jubilee Hall,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
[Guest]: they had their wives

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
[Guest]: and all.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
[Guest]: So,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
[Guest]: there were 35-year-olds

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
[Guest]: and DJ when he says,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
[Guest]: when he says

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
[Guest]: that you're already

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
[Guest]: in your mid-30s,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
[Guest]: what are you still doing

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
[Guest]: hanging out in college

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
[Guest]: with us?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
[Guest]: He says,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
[Guest]: yahan DJ ki koi

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
[Guest]: aukaat hai.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
[Guest]: So,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
[Guest]: I've known many guys

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
[Guest]: like that,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
[Guest]: which were Rakesh Mehra

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
[Guest]: and he's a DU product.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
[Guest]: You know,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
[Guest]: someone from

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
[Guest]: my DU days

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
[Guest]: and

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
[Guest]: they don't come

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
[Guest]: from backgrounds

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
[Guest]: like you and I.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
[Guest]: You know,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
[Guest]: like I said,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
[Guest]: we may not have been rich

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
[Guest]: but we are privileged.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
[Guest]: Just the privilege of confidence

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
[Guest]: is a big thing.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
[Unknown]: I mean,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
[Guest]: you have already

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
[Guest]: 2000 books at home

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
[Guest]: is more than what

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
[Guest]: people have all their lives.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
[Guest]: So,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
[Guest]: so,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: you're talking about people

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
[Guest]: who

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
[Guest]: are from,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
[Guest]: I don't want to get

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[Guest]: into locality names

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
[Guest]: but a basti type locality

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
[Guest]: in North Delhi

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
[Guest]: where

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
[Guest]: forget it,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
[Guest]: broken on fiat,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
[Guest]: there is no chance

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
[Guest]: of a car.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
[Guest]: In DU,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
[Guest]: even if

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
[Guest]: and I don't want to

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
[Guest]: take too many names

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
[Guest]: to embarrass those here

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
[Guest]: but there is a very

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
[Guest]: prominent industrial

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
[Guest]: house

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
[Guest]: in Delhi.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
[Guest]: I've seen

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
[Guest]: that boy

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
[Guest]: get walloped

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
[Guest]: in the middle

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
[Guest]: of Hindu College

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
[Guest]: by this one guy

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
[Guest]: who would not,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
[Guest]: who would probably be

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
[Guest]: socially

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
[Guest]: at that guy's

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
[Guest]: driver's level

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
[Guest]: and then him

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
[Guest]: come the next day

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
[Guest]: with his cousin

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
[Guest]: and say,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
[Guest]: Amit Bhai,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
[Guest]: maaf kar do,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
[Guest]: what can we do for you?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
[Guest]: Now,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
[Guest]: Amit Bhai

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
[Guest]: must have been like

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
[Guest]: 10 years older than us,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
[Guest]: maybe 14

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
[Guest]: but he would never

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
[Guest]: leave college

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
[Guest]: because outside college

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
[Guest]: he was

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
[Guest]: the son of a driver.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
[Guest]: There,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
[Guest]: a guy who drove

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
[Guest]: a Mercedes

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
[Guest]: would come and

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
[Guest]: touch his feet.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
[Guest]: So,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
[Guest]: he never would

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
[Guest]: leave college.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
[Guest]: So,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
[Guest]: DU really makes you

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
[Guest]: survive.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
[Guest]: That's why

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
[Guest]: DU is a very

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
[Guest]: aggressive place

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
[Guest]: but I think

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
[Guest]: it taught me to

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
[Guest]: get on with the

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
[Guest]: Chandrawal,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
[Guest]: goons.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
[Guest]: It taught me to

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
[Guest]: kind of hold my own,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
[Guest]: not,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
[Guest]: get,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
[Guest]: don't get into combat

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
[Guest]: but don't back off either

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
[Guest]: because then they'll

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
[Guest]: fucking eat you up.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
[Guest]: Make it known that

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
[Guest]: I'm not going to

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
[Guest]: attack you

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
[Guest]: but you may

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
[Guest]: wallop me

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
[Guest]: but I will create

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
[Guest]: a scene in the canteen

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
[Guest]: that may compromise

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
[Guest]: your...

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
[Guest]: So,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
[Guest]: it teaches you these

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
[Guest]: survival in the forest

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
[Guest]: kind of thing.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
[Guest]: So,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
[Guest]: I think that

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
[Guest]: shaped a lot of me,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
[Guest]: when I was a teen

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
[Guest]: and growing up

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
[Guest]: and because

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
[Guest]: in Delhi

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
[Guest]: and also you come

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
[Guest]: from Dehradun, right?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
[Guest]: I was in Dehradun

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
[Guest]: from the time I was

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
[Guest]: born to the time

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
[Guest]: I was 12.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
[Guest]: You come to Delhi

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
[Guest]: where suddenly it

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
[Guest]: matters,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
[Guest]: who you are.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
[Guest]: One of the reasons

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
[Guest]: it didn't matter

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
[Guest]: because in Dehradun

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
[Guest]: it didn't fucking matter.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
[Guest]: Even if you had

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
[Guest]: a lot of money,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
[Guest]: you could do

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
[Guest]: nothing with it.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
[Guest]: You still would

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
[Guest]: walk and,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
[Guest]: go to the Indian

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
[Guest]: Dune Club

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
[Guest]: with the

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
[Guest]: dance floor would shake

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
[Guest]: and all the kids

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
[Guest]: would run around

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
[Guest]: and do

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
[Guest]: Kalabhaji type

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
[Guest]: things,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
[Guest]: you know.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
[Guest]: But suddenly

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
[Guest]: here,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
[Guest]: there was

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
[Guest]: wealth.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
[Guest]: It was 92,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
[Guest]: reforms had just

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
[Guest]: kicked in

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
[Guest]: from everybody

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
[Guest]: having ambassadors

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
[Guest]: and Fiats

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
[Guest]: or no car.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
[Guest]: Now,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
[Guest]: there were

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
[Guest]: Maruti 800s

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
[Guest]: coming.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
[Guest]: 118NE was

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
[Guest]: one of the

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
[Guest]: premium cars

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
[Amit Varma]: for everybody.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
[Amit Varma]: earlier that

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Amit Varma]: in school

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
[Amit Varma]: to kind of

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
[Amit Varma]: survive there,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
[Amit Varma]: to do your thing,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
[Amit Varma]: your strategy was

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
[Amit Varma]: to be aggressive

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
[Amit Varma]: and you kind of

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
[Amit Varma]: regret that later.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And here you said

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
[Amit Varma]: that in college

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
[Amit Varma]: the strategy,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
[Amit Varma]: it was a fine dance

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
[Amit Varma]: obviously,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
[Amit Varma]: but you learned

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
[Guest]: how to get along

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
[Guest]: with people.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
[Guest]: Like,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
[Guest]: what was that

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
[Guest]: aggression like

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
[Guest]: in school,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
[Guest]: for example?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
[Guest]: I had a good

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
[Guest]: vocabulary.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
[Guest]: I could

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
[Guest]: construct a sentence

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
[Guest]: and I'm still

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
[Guest]: considered a funny guy

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
[Guest]: by many people.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
[Guest]: Although I'm,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
[Guest]: I think a lot of

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
[Unknown]: my jokes are

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
[Unknown]: uncle jokes.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
[Unknown]: The youngsters

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
[Amit Varma]: in office tell me

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
[Amit Varma]: that this is,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
[Amit Varma]: your jokes are

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
[Guest]: very uncle jokes.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
[Guest]: That's very rude.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
[Guest]: But like,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
[Guest]: if someone would,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
[Guest]: I'd feel this guy

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
[Guest]: is at the back

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
[Guest]: of his mind,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
[Guest]: he may

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
[Guest]: threaten me.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
[Guest]: A,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
[Guest]: I had a lot of

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
[Guest]: friends.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
[Guest]: we had a bunch of,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
[Guest]: we were a pack,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
[Guest]: you know.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
[Guest]: So,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
[Guest]: that was one

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
[Guest]: kind of

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
[Guest]: insulation

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
[Guest]: from anyone

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
[Guest]: trying to bully me.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
[Guest]: The second was,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
[Guest]: I was extremely

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
[Guest]: cutting and nasty

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
[Guest]: when I would

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
[Guest]: like,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
[Guest]: rip through someone

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
[Guest]: and I would make sure

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
[Guest]: I do it

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
[Guest]: during toy time

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
[Guest]: and everyone

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
[Guest]: sitting and studying.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
[Guest]: So,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
[Guest]: I'd say,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
[Guest]: you just be nasty.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
[Guest]: You just say things

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
[Guest]: and when you're like

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
[Guest]: 13, 14

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
[Guest]: and you're humiliated

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
[Guest]: like that

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
[Guest]: in front of people,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
[Guest]: you start crying.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
[Guest]: And when someone

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
[Guest]: starts crying,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
[Guest]: why the fuck

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
[Guest]: are you crying?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
[Guest]: You know,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
[Guest]: you do shit like that.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
[Guest]: But,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
[Guest]: then you know that

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
[Guest]: this guy is not

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
[Guest]: going to pick on you

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
[Guest]: next.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
[Guest]: He'll pick on

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
[Guest]: someone else

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
[Guest]: because he may

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
[Guest]: wallop you

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
[Guest]: but you've

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
[Guest]: humiliated him

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
[Guest]: in the middle

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
[Guest]: of.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
[Guest]: So,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
[Guest]: when that,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
[Guest]: so,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
[Guest]: those are the

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
[Guest]: kind of

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
[Guest]: survival devices

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
[Guest]: you use.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
[Guest]: you don't dissect

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
[Guest]: them when you're

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
[Guest]: young.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
[Guest]: So,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
[Guest]: the next guy

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
[Guest]: does not

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
[Amit Varma]: pick on me.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And you meet

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
[Amit Varma]: some of those guys

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
[Amit Varma]: now?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Like,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
[Amit Varma]: what is it like?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Like,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
[Amit Varma]: have you ever

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
[Amit Varma]: met someone

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
[Amit Varma]: who you made

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
[Amit Varma]: cry or vice versa?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
[Guest]: You know,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: and is it

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
[Guest]: that the

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
[Guest]: shared

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
[Guest]: understanding

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: that what

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
[Guest]: happened in

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
[Guest]: Vegas stays

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
[Guest]: in Vegas

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
[Guest]: sort of?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
[Guest]: Yeah,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
[Guest]: it is.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
[Guest]: You know,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
[Guest]: we had our

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
[Guest]: 25th anniversary

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
[Guest]: a long time

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
[Guest]: he's a lawyer

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
[Guest]: and

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
[Guest]: I met him

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
[Guest]: when I was

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
[Guest]: at NewsTrek

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
[Guest]: and CP

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
[Guest]: and he was

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
[Guest]: like,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
[Guest]: now,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
[Guest]: this is what I

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
[Guest]: mean,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
[Guest]: sometimes you

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
[Guest]: don't even

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Guest]: do it knowing

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
[Guest]: who you're

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
[Guest]: doing it to.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
[Guest]: So,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
[Unknown]: I said,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
[Unknown]: hey,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
[Guest]: what's up?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
[Guest]: He said,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
[Guest]: what's up?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
[Guest]: He says,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
[Guest]: I'm studying

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
[Guest]: law because

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
[Guest]: that time,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
[Guest]: I had started

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
[Guest]: at Dune you're

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
[Guest]: just like 70 guys

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
[Guest]: a batch.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
[Guest]: So,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
[Unknown]: you know everybody

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
[Unknown]: pretty and you've

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
[Guest]: spent six years

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
[Guest]: with them

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
[Guest]: because no one

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
[Guest]: can join like

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
[Guest]: an eight night,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
[Guest]: you have to join

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
[Guest]: from the seventh

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
[Guest]: onwards.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
[Guest]: So,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
[Guest]: you know each

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
[Guest]: other pretty well,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
[Guest]: you're close.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
[Guest]: So,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
[Guest]: he said that

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
[Guest]: damn,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
[Guest]: it's good to sit

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
[Guest]: and have lunch

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
[Guest]: with you because

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
[Guest]: I couldn't stand

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
[Guest]: you in school

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
[Guest]: and I was

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
[Guest]: stunned.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
[Guest]: I was really

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
[Guest]: mean.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
[Guest]: And,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
[Guest]: I was like,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
[Guest]: okay,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
[Guest]: point.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
[Guest]: But I said,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
[Guest]: I didn't say anything

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
[Guest]: to you.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
[Guest]: He says,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
[Guest]: no,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
[Guest]: but that was

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
[Guest]: enough for me

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
[Guest]: not to like you.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
[Guest]: So,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
[Guest]: you figure stuff

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
[Guest]: out after that,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
[Guest]: but no,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
[Guest]: it's not,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
[Guest]: but like I said,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
[Guest]: I wasn't like,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
[Unknown]: I wouldn't say

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
[Guest]: I was,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
[Guest]: I'd pick on anyone,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
[Guest]: I'd,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
[Guest]: that would happen,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
[Guest]: tomorrow I would,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
[Guest]: I'd bat with someone

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
[Guest]: and tomorrow I really

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
[Guest]: don't care.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
[Guest]: It's gone.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
[Guest]: It's,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
[Guest]: I'm happy to start again.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
[Guest]: But,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
[Guest]: it was,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
[Guest]: you realize that

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
[Guest]: some people do

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
[Guest]: keep that in mind

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
[Guest]: for a while,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
[Guest]: but it's not so much

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
[Guest]: that there's any animosity

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
[Guest]: with anybody.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
[Guest]: in fact,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
[Guest]: one of the guys

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
[Guest]: I didn't really like

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
[Guest]: when I was in school,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
[Guest]: I used to find him

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
[Guest]: really

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
[Guest]: a nasty piece of work

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
[Guest]: and we had a,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
[Guest]: one of those,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
[Guest]: little gang battles

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
[Guest]: in school.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
[Guest]: It was a new fashion.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
[Unknown]: It wasn't as common

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
[Unknown]: as it is now.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
[Guest]: It had just come in

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
[Guest]: and it was a

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
[Guest]: dengue hemorrhagic,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
[Unknown]: hemorrhagic,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
[Unknown]: I don't know how to pronounce it,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
[Guest]: when you hemorrhage.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
[Guest]: So,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
[Guest]: I hemorrhaged from my nose

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
[Guest]: and I wouldn't stop bleeding.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
[Guest]: So,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
[Guest]: for two days

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
[Guest]: and my platelet count

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
[Guest]: had gone down

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
[Guest]: to like some

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
[Guest]: 22,000,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: 18,000,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
[Guest]: it was going that low

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
[Guest]: and you don't plot.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
[Guest]: So,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
[Guest]: I needed four units

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
[Guest]: of platelets every day

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
[Guest]: and those days,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
[Guest]: all these fancy hospitals

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
[Guest]: were on there.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
[Unknown]: So,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
[Guest]: there were two places

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
[Guest]: and it was some fancy place

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
[Guest]: and we could only afford

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
[Guest]: the Red Cross

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
[Guest]: because it was free

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
[Guest]: but you had to go with

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
[Guest]: the person who's going

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
[Guest]: to give you blood.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
[Guest]: They'd give blood.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
[Guest]: They'd separate platelets

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
[Guest]: and give you platelets.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
[Unknown]: So,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
[Guest]: I needed four every day

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
[Guest]: for four days.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
[Guest]: That's 16 people

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
[Guest]: and my sister would go there

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
[Unknown]: and,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
[Unknown]: you know,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
[Guest]: she'd call up my friends

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
[Guest]: and that's when I realized,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
[Guest]: family and friends

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
[Guest]: are worth more than,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
[Guest]: it's a cliche

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
[Guest]: and I'm sure people say it

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
[Guest]: and maybe don't mean it.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
[Guest]: I fucking absolutely

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
[Unknown]: swear by that,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
[Unknown]: you know.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
[Guest]: The source of confidence

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
[Guest]: comes from family and friends.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
[Guest]: You can't get from money.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
[Guest]: You can't get from anything else.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And this guy came.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
[Amit Varma]: He was one of the guys.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
[Guest]: So,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
[Guest]: this guy who couldn't stand.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
[Guest]: So,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
[Guest]: every day my sister would come

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
[Unknown]: and say,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
[Unknown]: I said,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
[Guest]: who all gave today?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
[Guest]: So and so.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
[Guest]: So,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
[Guest]: she was like,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
[Guest]: she took his name.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
[Guest]: I was like,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
[Guest]: what the fuck?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
[Guest]: He said,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
[Guest]: yeah.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Guest]: And he came with four people

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
[Guest]: and he was doing really well.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
[Guest]: He's one of the most

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
[Guest]: successful guys of our batch

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
[Guest]: and she said,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
[Guest]: he came with four guys

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
[Guest]: from his office.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
[Guest]: He made them come with him

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
[Guest]: and they were friends

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
[Guest]: because when I was there,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
[Guest]: there were a lot of people

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
[Guest]: who need platelets at the time.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
[Guest]: The people who would

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
[Guest]: need it for units,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
[Unknown]: but they could only get one.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
[Unknown]: And she says,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
[Guest]: for you,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
[Guest]: there'd be like 10 guys there

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
[Guest]: and I'd say,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
[Guest]: we only need four.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
[Guest]: You know,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
[Guest]: six of you go back,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
[Guest]: come tomorrow.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
[Guest]: So,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
[Guest]: a lot of the other people

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
[Guest]: would say,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
[Guest]: can two of yours

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
[Guest]: please give to us

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
[Guest]: because we don't have

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
[Guest]: four people here.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
[Guest]: So,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
[Guest]: I am with three people

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
[Guest]: who gave me blood at the time

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
[Guest]: and I was like,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
[Guest]: I called him.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
[Guest]: I said,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
[Guest]: dude,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
[Guest]: there's enough

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
[Guest]: informality to say,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
[Guest]: why the f**k

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
[Guest]: did you come here

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
[Guest]: and you're not friends.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
[Guest]: You know,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
[Guest]: you can say that

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
[Guest]: without it being

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
[Guest]: mean or malicious

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
[Guest]: because you've

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
[Guest]: grown up together.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
[Guest]: You knew

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
[Guest]: when it was

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
[Guest]: that you saw

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
[Guest]: your first porn,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
[Guest]: when it was

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
[Guest]: that you discovered it.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
[Unknown]: You know everything

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
[Guest]: about everyone

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
[Guest]: because in a boarding school,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
[Guest]: that's how it is.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
[Guest]: He's like,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
[Guest]: no dude,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
[Guest]: you f**king,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
[Guest]: one of our batch mates

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
[Guest]: said that you had

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
[Guest]: and I was like,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
[Guest]: f**k that.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
[Guest]: You should just,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
[Guest]: it's not worth

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
[Guest]: carrying them.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
[Amit Varma]: So,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
[Amit Varma]: when you look back at that

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
[Amit Varma]: and you know,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
[Amit Varma]: even I sort of

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
[Amit Varma]: look back on my past

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and the person I was

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and I sometimes wonder

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
[Amit Varma]: how someone who knew me

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
[Amit Varma]: in my 20s

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
[Amit Varma]: can be friends

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
[Amit Varma]: with me today

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and that is also

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
[Amit Varma]: one reason that

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't like to be quick

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
[Amit Varma]: to judge other people.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Like today,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
[Amit Varma]: we live in an age

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
[Amit Varma]: where everybody

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
[Amit Varma]: is so judgmental,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
[Amit Varma]: especially and I think

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
[Amit Varma]: social media

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
[Amit Varma]: has made that worse

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
[Amit Varma]: where it's almost

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
[Amit Varma]: as if by picking on

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
[Amit Varma]: some random thing

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
[Amit Varma]: by standing in judgment

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
[Amit Varma]: over them in a sense

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
[Amit Varma]: you're showing

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
[Amit Varma]: how virtuous you are.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
[Amit Varma]: So,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
[Amit Varma]: we are no longer

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
[Amit Varma]: willing to give people

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
[Amit Varma]: the benefit of the doubt.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe so and so

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
[Amit Varma]: meant something else.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe it was a weak moment.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they did this then

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
[Amit Varma]: but they're a different

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
[Amit Varma]: person now,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
[Amit Varma]: you know,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
[Amit Varma]: and I just think that

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
[Amit Varma]: we contain multitudes,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
[Amit Varma]: we're always changing

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and we are all

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
[Amit Varma]: essentially the same,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
[Amit Varma]: you know,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
[Amit Varma]: at the end of the day

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
[Amit Varma]: it's an accident of,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
[Amit Varma]: you know,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
[Amit Varma]: nature and nurture

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and whatever happens

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
[Amit Varma]: to you and all of that

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
[Amit Varma]: that kind of makes us

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
[Amit Varma]: be different people

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
[Amit Varma]: think about that

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
[Amit Varma]: aspect of things

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
[Amit Varma]: because

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
[Amit Varma]: you are also

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
[Amit Varma]: very active on social media

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000
[Amit Varma]: perhaps even more than me

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
[Amit Varma]: and

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
[Amit Varma]: this is something that

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I kind of find

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
[Amit Varma]: disturbing

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
[Amit Varma]: because especially

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
[Amit Varma]: on Twitter shitter

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
[Amit Varma]: what you kind of get

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
[Amit Varma]: is that everyone is

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
[Amit Varma]: signaling

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and that requires

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
[Amit Varma]: this extreme kind of

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
[Amit Varma]: aggression

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
[Amit Varma]: always shitting on people

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
[Amit Varma]: not even,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
[Amit Varma]: you know,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
[Amit Varma]: like one of the

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of mottos of any group

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm part of is

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
[Amit Varma]: assume goodwill,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
[Amit Varma]: right?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
[Amit Varma]: You begin,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
[Amit Varma]: that is a default,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
[Amit Varma]: if there's something wrong

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
[Amit Varma]: it's okay to assume

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
[Amit Varma]: that it's a mistake.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
[Amit Varma]: What is

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of your sense

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
[Amit Varma]: of that because

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
[Amit Varma]: I find young people

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
[Amit Varma]: rushing to judgment

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
[Amit Varma]: rushing to hardened

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
[Amit Varma]: positions

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
[Amit Varma]: and those hardened

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
[Amit Varma]: positions,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
[Amit Varma]: in fact,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
[Amit Varma]: are saved forever

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
[Amit Varma]: on social media

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
[Amit Varma]: like if some

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
[Amit Varma]: of the stuff

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
[Guest]: I wrote or thought

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
[Guest]: when I was 20

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
[Guest]: imagine dude

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
[Guest]: there would be

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
[Guest]: screenshots of that

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
[Guest]: today

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
[Guest]: if those moments

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
[Guest]: are stored in

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
[Amit Varma]: frustration

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
[Amit Varma]: like I'd be

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
[Amit Varma]: cancelled

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
[Amit Varma]: a million times over

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
[Amit Varma]: I feel that

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
[Amit Varma]: somehow in this

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
[Amit Varma]: performative age

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
[Amit Varma]: in this angry age

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
[Amit Varma]: that space to grow

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
[Amit Varma]: for young people

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
[Amit Varma]: isn't there

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
[Guest]: what are your

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
[Guest]: sort of thoughts on that?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
[Guest]: Yeah,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
[Guest]: this is something

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
[Guest]: that I think about

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
[Guest]: a lot

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
[Guest]: and I don't mind

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
[Guest]: think by default

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
[Guest]: actively think

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
[Guest]: about what

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
[Guest]: what is it

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
[Guest]: that drives this

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
[Guest]: on social media

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
[Guest]: what

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
[Guest]: even my behavior

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
[Guest]: on social media

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
[Guest]: has evolved

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
[Guest]: when I was

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
[Guest]: I got onto Twitter

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
[Guest]: because during the

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
[Guest]: Jan Lokpal movement

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
[Guest]: we were using

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
[Guest]: you know

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
[Guest]: we were using

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
[Guest]: this

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
[Guest]: what do you call it

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
[Guest]: SMS

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
[Unknown]: SMS

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
[Unknown]: SMS

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
[Unknown]: and then you know

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000
[Guest]: Sibbal and Jadambaram

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
[Guest]: they blocked it

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
[Guest]: that you couldn't do

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
[Guest]: then we had to

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
[Guest]: so that's how

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
[Guest]: I got on Twitter

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
[Guest]: and in fact

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
[Guest]: that time

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
[Guest]: you know

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
[Guest]: Arvind also got on

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
[Guest]: Twitter at that time

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
[Guest]: and everybody

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
[Guest]: this is something

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
[Guest]: that can be used

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
[Guest]: and

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
[Guest]: now

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
[Guest]: then the Jan Lokpal

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
[Guest]: movement turned into

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
[Guest]: you know

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
[Guest]: so that time

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
[Guest]: we had

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
[Guest]: Lokpal

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
[Guest]: debates

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
[Guest]: and it was all about that

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
[Guest]: it was more a tool

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
[Guest]: because I wasn't

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
[Guest]: really a social media

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
[Guest]: friendly kind of guy

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
[Guest]: it's not something

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
[Guest]: that comes naturally

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
[Guest]: to me

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
[Guest]: then when you're

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
[Guest]: on it

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
[Guest]: there's that

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
[Guest]: slight headiness

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
[Guest]: that

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
[Guest]: oh dude

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
[Guest]: I've got so many followers

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
[Guest]: because I'm your

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
[Guest]: fucking bloody

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
[Guest]: prime time

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
[Guest]: talking shit

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
[Guest]: every night

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
[Amit Varma]: of course you'll

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
[Guest]: get followers

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
[Guest]: you know

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
[Guest]: like

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
[Guest]: I still see people

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
[Guest]: our age

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
[Guest]: and

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
[Guest]: you suddenly had

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
[Guest]: a lot of followers

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
[Guest]: people like

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
[Guest]: were saying nice

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
[Guest]: things to you

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
[Guest]: because you know

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
[Guest]: that time it was

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
[Guest]: fashionable to

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
[Guest]: you know

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
[Guest]: support the

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
[Guest]: Jan Lokpal

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
[Guest]: movement

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
[Guest]: and

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
[Guest]: we can get into

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
[Guest]: that later

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
[Guest]: because I know

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
[Guest]: you can't stand

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
[Guest]: Arvind and

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
[Guest]: you know

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
[Guest]: we should

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
[Guest]: we should

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
[Guest]: talk about that

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
[Guest]: and

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
[Guest]: so

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
[Guest]: that was

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
[Guest]: one phase

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
[Guest]: then

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
[Guest]: you know

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
[Guest]: I started

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
[Guest]: talking to people

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
[Guest]: and

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
[Guest]: it was this

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
[Guest]: there was no

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
[Guest]: filter

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
[Guest]: you know

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
[Guest]: you just

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
[Guest]: that

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
[Guest]: Time Magazine

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
[Guest]: has done a

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
[Guest]: cover story

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
[Guest]: on the

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
[Guest]: online

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
[Guest]: disinhibition

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
[Guest]: syndrome

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
[Guest]: so I was

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
[Guest]: victim of

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
[Guest]: the online

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
[Guest]: disinhibition

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
[Guest]: syndrome

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
[Guest]: and then

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
[Guest]: after that

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
[Guest]: I don't

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
[Guest]: now respond

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
[Guest]: to trolls

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
[Guest]: once in a

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
[Guest]: while

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
[Guest]: if I'm

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
[Guest]: one

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
[Guest]: and it'll be a

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
[Guest]: strategic response

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
[Guest]: I'll be responding

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
[Guest]: for a reason

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
[Guest]: that may not

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
[Guest]: be apparent

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
[Guest]: but

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
[Guest]: there is a

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
[Guest]: reason I'm

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000

[Guest]: now

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
[Guest]: taking a

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
[Guest]: position

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
[Guest]: on

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
[Amit Varma]: the

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
[Amit Varma]: death

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
[Amit Varma]: penalty

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
[Amit Varma]: think

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
[Guest]: in my

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
[Amit Varma]: early

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
[Guest]: 40s

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
[Guest]: or maybe

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
[Guest]: when I was

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
[Guest]: 40

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
[Guest]: but right

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
[Guest]: from my

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
[Guest]: late

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
[Guest]: 20s

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
[Guest]: to

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
[Guest]: my

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
[Guest]: you know

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
[Guest]: late

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
[Guest]: 30s

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
[Guest]: it was

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
[Guest]: evolving

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
[Guest]: based on

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
[Guest]: what I

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
[Guest]: was

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
[Guest]: doing

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
[Guest]: and

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
[Guest]: I

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
[Guest]: kept

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
[Guest]: evolving

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
[Guest]: based on

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
[Guest]: what I

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
[Guest]: read

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
[Guest]: what

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
[Guest]: Twitter

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
[Guest]: what people

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
[Guest]: end up doing

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
[Guest]: and they

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
[Guest]: don't have

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
[Guest]: to

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
[Guest]: they

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
[Guest]: take a

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
[Guest]: very firm

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
[Guest]: position

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
[Guest]: which is

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
[Guest]: not

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
[Guest]: thought

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
[Guest]: through

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
[Guest]: and because

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
[Guest]: you have

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
[Guest]: taken that

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
[Guest]: position

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
[Guest]: it's that

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
[Guest]: cognitive

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
[Guest]: dissonance

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
[Guest]: because you

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
[Guest]: said

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
[Guest]: some

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
[Guest]: people

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
[Guest]: they

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
[Guest]: don't

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
[Guest]: have

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
[Guest]: a

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
[Guest]: very

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
[Guest]: firm

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
[Guest]: position

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
[Guest]: they

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
[Guest]: have

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
[Guest]: a

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
[Guest]: very

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
[Guest]: firm

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
[Guest]: position

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
[Guest]: which

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
[Guest]: they

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
[Guest]: don't

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
[Guest]: have

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
[Guest]: they

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
[Guest]: don't

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
[Guest]: have

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
[Guest]: the

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
[Guest]: right

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
[Guest]: to

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
[Guest]: have

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
[Guest]: the

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
[Guest]: right

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
[Guest]: to

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.920
[Guest]: like everyone okay not everyone too many people I know who are young have anxiety

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.360
[Guest]: I can't do this I have anxiety you know we can't do this on that day I have to

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.560
[Guest]: see my therapist I have anxiety one is you should have anxiety you can't go

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:34.960
[Guest]: through life with a sense of Buddha like equilibrium you will have very anxious

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.600
[Guest]: moments when you well wait till you fucking get dumped then you'll know when

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:43.880
[Guest]: you with a tween feeling in your stomach you know up the second is I think it's

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.920
[Guest]: because of social media you know I have to check myself like I don't have the

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.200
[Guest]: Twitter app on my phone but sometimes if something happens there's a new cycle

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.600
[Guest]: when news laundry is involved I have to tell myself to stop fucking looking at

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.320
[Guest]: your phone you know you keep looking you keep looking you up kuch bolu up kuch

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.360
[Guest]: dalu up kuch karu up kuch respond karu and I've realized that causes anxiety so

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:12.520
[Guest]: it is not the kids fault they have grown in an age where there is this one

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.640
[Guest]: ingredient that is a standalone anxiety machine that they are growing up with

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.960
[Guest]: now that is something that a lot of kids these days face and my kids I'm talking

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:27.720
[Guest]: 20s even and a lot of them take very committed positions because of this

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:33.680
[Guest]: wanting to this you know wanting to be a part of the woke police or oh how dare

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.400
[Guest]: you like okay maybe my view on gender or yeah guys you got to understand we grew

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:44.640
[Guest]: up at a time when the term faggot was considered okay I mean think about that

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:52.680
[Guest]: it has taken some undoing I mean we grew up at a time where in our textbook there

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:58.560
[Guest]: was and this is a ICSC textbook where I know it's against the law to use the

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.580
[Guest]: jatav community there's a slang associated the jatav community which

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:05.360
[Guest]: Mayawati belongs to that slang that is associated jatav community was a part of

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:09.800
[Guest]: that short story in our textbook and that's what we're talking about so of

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.880
[Guest]: course a lot of my views evolved like on gender like I didn't get this whole

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:19.940
[Guest]: gender fluidity like I mean even now I you know a guy wearing nail varnish you

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:29.440
[Guest]: know I guess it may be childhood trauma because you know I mean I my my immediate

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.400
[Guest]: response I do stiffen up a little bit but I understand that's a fucked up

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.640
[Guest]: primitive response but but because you're wrong on some things you aren't

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:44.080
[Guest]: wrong on everything and the wokeness is like fuck we are everything in the

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.160
[Guest]: theorem it's not only mathematical theorems are mathematical theorems

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:55.080
[Guest]: everything else is in the graze and it'll evolve so that is something that

00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:00.040
[Guest]: of social media where you take a very firm position and because you've taken

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:04.160
[Guest]: it in written it now you got to keep defending it is what leads to anxiety it

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.160
[Guest]: leads to you know I mean it will be interesting to see what this generation

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:12.520
[Guest]: looks like in their 40s I mean we are still dealing with the first generation

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:17.800
[Guest]: of social media kids I mean I think they'll be very different people from

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.880
[Guest]: pre social media like in India the pre-lib kids and the post lib kids

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.840
[Guest]: then worldwide they'll be the pre social media kids and the post social media

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.400
[Guest]: kids and I think it's gonna be a very different personality I don't know

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:34.200
[Guest]: whether it'll be better or worse good or bad but the impact it'll have on them is

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:39.960
[Guest]: enormous and at least till now I don't think overall in a good way but we may

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:44.080
[Guest]: be being the uncles beta ye bahut kalat cheez hai ye tv like you know if you read

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.560
[Guest]: Neil postman's amusing ourselves to death a lot of what he said was very

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:53.640
[Guest]: true and sensible but most of it hasn't turned out to be true so I agree with

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.200
[Amit Varma]: you but just because this is too dark a vision and one wants to though I'm

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.720
[Amit Varma]: normally the pessimist in the room but the counterpoint I'd give to this is

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.440
[Amit Varma]: that I think a lot of these people we see being performative on Twitter and

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.400
[Amit Varma]: social media are really vocal minorities it's easy to sort of fall for the

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.960
[Amit Varma]: selection bias and generalize retro this is what the young generation is like but

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.000
[Amit Varma]: I think that there's a silent majority out there I think most young people

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.840
[Amit Varma]: perhaps aren't necessarily like this but what worries me about this and about

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.280
[Amit Varma]: wokeness in particular if I am to elaborate is that with both extreme

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:32.000
[Amit Varma]: ideologies on all sides of the spectrum the problem I have is when you sort of

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.920
[Amit Varma]: reduce a person to their identity of birth which they had nothing to do with

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.360
[Amit Varma]: so you know on on the right side it could be that you are hated just because

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.680
[Amit Varma]: you're a Muslim and that's it that's enough and you can't love who you want

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.640
[Amit Varma]: and on the left it's again you're either an oppressor or you're a victim and once

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.160
[Amit Varma]: you are reduced to a particular thing like she said savannah once you're

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.640
[Amit Varma]: reduced to that one it shuts down conversation completely because the

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.480
[Amit Varma]: implicit message is that the content of the argument doesn't matter you know

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.160
[Amit Varma]: you're an oppressor making it and you're responsible for all oppression but the

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.520
[Amit Varma]: other aspect of it like forget the fact forget who might be at the receiving end

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.200
[Amit Varma]: of that the other aspect of it is that once you start thinking in those

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.680
[Amit Varma]: categories and I would imagine that once you take those positions you start

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.840
[Amit Varma]: thinking in those categories you become the person you pretend to be you become

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.400
[Amit Varma]: your persona in a sense then it's it's very sad because then you're thinking in

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.840
[Amit Varma]: a very limited way about people people are rich people are deep people are

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.800
[Amit Varma]: complex and you reduce them to something and you think about them like that and

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.640
[Amit Varma]: maybe you think about yourself if you think about yourself in some terms of

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.000
[Amit Varma]: victimhood that kind of prevents you like one of the things I was I have

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.400
[Amit Varma]: discussed in previous episodes is how you know there is so much talk for example

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.320
[Amit Varma]: about how the current dispensation is casteist now the thing is that more

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Dalits voted for Modi in both 2014 and 2019 than for any other party a fact

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.560
[Amit Varma]: that you know Mivani lamented in the context of Gujarat and I think what's

00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:00.440
[Amit Varma]: happening there is that upper-class elites how Anna activists on Twitter

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.480
[Amit Varma]: will always be about oh you know Dalits are victims but Dalits across the

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:08.120
[Amit Varma]: country are implicitly saying with their actions that hey we are not only Dalits

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.760
[Amit Varma]: we're a lot more than that and there might be a problem with the identity

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.040
[Amit Varma]: they are asserting in its place which is a whole Hindu identity and all that

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.600
[Amit Varma]: there's also a problem with that you know but it's dangerous to think in

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:25.760
[Amit Varma]: terms of people as categories and that's as much a criticism about a particular

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.560
[Amit Varma]: ideology as a lament for the young people who fall into those modes of

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.540
[Amit Varma]: thinking and you work with a lot of young people which I don't on an active

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.880
[Amit Varma]: daily basis what do you see around you like when I say that these are only

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.720
[Guest]: vocal minorities or what's what's your sense in fact I was about to come to

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:45.680
[Guest]: that you know I think you're right statistically but because we live in

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:51.960
[Guest]: little bubbles in India like statistically like I said by growing up

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.600
[Guest]: you and I were not necessarily middle-class if you take exactly the

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:59.120
[Guest]: statistical Indian population was 60 crore in 1983 84 when I was because I

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:05.040
[Guest]: remember that number from a book start corrode key Abadi Valadeesh Martial so

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.920
[Guest]: we were probably in the top five or ten crores so we were definitely on

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:13.600
[Amit Varma]: middle-class I'd say we were the top 1% even then if we could read books yeah

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.680
[Guest]: financially but when sort of bank accounts are concerned of four G's but

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:21.280
[Guest]: yeah as far as when it comes which is what privilege is all about confidence

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.440
[Guest]: of no you can do it yeah because knowing who you know kind of thing is it makes a

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:31.200
[Guest]: difference but so statistically you may be right but the world we inhabit I'd

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.880
[Guest]: say you are not because the world that I inhabit which is the news world the

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:41.240
[Guest]: media space it is not a minority it is the majority now that maybe that's

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.160
[Guest]: because media is all about media and social media is important if you're in

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.680
[Guest]: media you're you know like you're on Twitter and stuff you're definitely on

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.280
[Guest]: one of it like I don't know many reporters or people who are trained to be

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:56.640
[Guest]: reporters who are not on Twitter so now maybe people you know artists

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.560
[Guest]: aren't maybe they're on Insta which is also social media maybe there are many

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.960
[Guest]: people who aren't and even if they are they aren't taking that position people

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.200
[Guest]: in the media space definitely are they're taking very committed hard

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:15.120
[Guest]: positions based on a tweet and that is a problem and I think that's a problem for

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:20.200
[Guest]: them because they damage themselves a lot more than who they you know lash out

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:27.040
[Guest]: to a troll a I think young people underestimate and I didn't and I'm not

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:32.120
[Guest]: saying our generation did everything great I think we fucked up a lot and

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.880
[Guest]: some of the office spaces that you worked in a deeply problematic I mean on

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:41.080
[Guest]: gender on the language that was used on what was okay to say what was okay to

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.160
[Amit Varma]: get away with still are from what I hear about the corporate world in the

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.400
[Guest]: advertising industry you know yeah but in news it's like moved like yeah it's

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:54.800
[Guest]: it's moved very significantly but on certain other things maybe the downside

00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:00.120
[Guest]: of not you know questioning or pushing back at authority because you were asked

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.280
[Guest]: to do something you did it is because that's what we were taught right from

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.360
[Guest]: school if you know if your teacher slapped you he slapped you today you

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:13.800
[Guest]: know if a teacher slaps a child is gonna be very shindy at home you know when we

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.360
[Guest]: were in school I remember ribs broken yeah because of a beating you just

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.640
[Guest]: didn't complain I'm missing it's a good thing but the good thing that emerged

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:28.720
[Guest]: from that is that we learnt when I would join News Trek and Madhus told me to do

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.680
[Guest]: something I didn't say no mother let me tell you how to do it

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.360
[Guest]: fuck dude like I can't even think of doing that I have kids who are telling

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:41.760
[Guest]: me how to run my business man they come for an interview for a job and halfway

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.120
[Guest]: in they are telling me how to run news laundry which is great in a sense I

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.880
[Guest]: don't think so I think it's stupid because you haven't lived long enough to

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:55.200
[Guest]: know shit you may have read a lot you just don't know and not everyone's gonna

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.520
[Guest]: be patient to indulge your parents maybe patient indulge you I'm not I'm not your

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:05.960
[Guest]: uncle or dad or mom I want to see what you can do yeah and you cannot run a

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:11.360
[Guest]: business you're 20 you're 21 you're 22 if you can then go run it don't tell me

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:16.240
[Guest]: how to run it you don't come for a job and tell the guy how to do his

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:20.680
[Guest]: especially when especially when they've spoken well you've you heard them out I

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:26.080
[Guest]: mean they talk they don't know shit yeah that attitude that sense of confidence

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:30.200
[Guest]: that social media gives that leveler I think keeps them from learning I think

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:38.440
[Guest]: their learning curve on basic dynamics interpersonal dynamics is going to be a

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:43.400
[Guest]: lot longer their awareness is a lot more than ours way more they will know how

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.960
[Guest]: many states that are they will know who this chief minister every state is they

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.200
[Guest]: may know you know what is the latest bill to be tabled they would know you

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:55.640
[Guest]: know what happened at the climate conference but their understanding of

00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:01.000
[Guest]: how the world operates being able to identify one car from the other is one

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.440
[Guest]: thing being able to identify how their engine works takes time so their first

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:11.480
[Guest]: level awareness I think is way more than ours but the second level understanding

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:16.560
[Guest]: is deeply compromised because of the that cocksure attitude that I know

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.600
[Guest]: everything because it's a theorem it's not a theorem only a theorem is a

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.640
[Guest]: theorem everything else is evolving I'll give you an example on this whole Dave

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:28.960
[Guest]: Chappelle thing my views many youngsters still tell me I didn't think there was

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.320
[Guest]: anything wrong with Dave Chappelle's I just saw the closer the last one I

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.440
[Guest]: haven't seen much was earlier work I must admit but what I've seen of his

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:42.760
[Guest]: which is a little bit I don't seem as homophobic or transphobic now I may be

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.840
[Guest]: wrong but I was talking to someone so how can you say that you oh my god oh

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:53.520
[Guest]: yeah everything oh my god yeah I said okay let's let's reason this let's start

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.840
[Guest]: off from my starting point is I understand homophobia is a thing because

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.880
[Guest]: I know I went to an all-boys school I know how horrible it was for many guys

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.080
[Guest]: who couldn't come out and it is a question of coming out man yeah I mean

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:09.840
[Guest]: many that's I mean it's taken them in their 40s to come out yeah because the

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:14.640
[Guest]: trauma of childhood doesn't go you know with bloody dormitory full of you know

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:19.600
[Guest]: prison rules kind of situation it I understand there's something called

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:24.600
[Guest]: homophobia and transphobia I understand a significant amount of people if not

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:31.640
[Guest]: majority have that I'm aware of that and I acknowledge that now let's come to is

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:38.120
[Guest]: Dave Chappelle that are you willing to start your point of view from the fact

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:44.080
[Guest]: that there is something called overwokenness or you know this over

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:50.480
[Guest]: political correctness and then is it possible that is what is leading to the

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.880
[Guest]: and and then come the dude would refuse to acknowledge that there is such a

00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:01.600
[Guest]: thing which is why there is there is no conversation if you cannot even

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.920
[Guest]: acknowledge that there is such a thing as an overwokenness that everything is

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:09.320
[Guest]: this performative political correctness then dude you have decided this is a

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:13.520
[Guest]: mathematical theorem and you're fucked it's not my loss because I will learn

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.440
[Guest]: because I understand these are fluid things if things that are complex

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:24.920
[Guest]: socio-political sociological gender contextual to the society are in not

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:29.480
[Guest]: everybody who lived in the 1800s was evil they were good people then as many

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.520
[Guest]: as now there was trouble as many as now but slavery was a thing which was normal

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:38.760
[Guest]: casteism was a thing like Mangal Pandey in that film when Mangal Pandey is going

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.640
[Guest]: in the morning he's the hero Amir Khan is Mangal Pandey is the hero of the film

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:48.120
[Guest]: I don't know whether you remember this now the guy who's sweeping the heart

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:54.680
[Guest]: where he's taking a dip because Pandey ji is Janu Dhari and it was a comedy

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:59.000
[Guest]: sequence now I think it was a problematic thing to have that as a

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.160
[Guest]: comedy sequence in Mangal Pandey in the 2000s whenever it was made because it's

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:08.280
[Guest]: not cute that your hero doesn't want this you know Dalit guy's shadow to

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:14.600
[Guest]: follow them and he is the hero you could have made that comment in a way that was

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:19.360
[Guest]: sympathetic to Mangal Pandey that dude he was a product of the 1800s but it's

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:26.880
[Guest]: not funny it's not okay so not everybody lives them only evil they were a product

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:30.040
[Guest]: just like you and I a product of our times we grew up in a generation where

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.560
[Guest]: calling someone a faggot was affectionate a fag what are you doing this evening

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:39.800
[Guest]: yeah let's go get a drink like you can't do that today so we are now this

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.360
[Guest]: generation thinks that they've got two plus two is four and it'll be four forever

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:50.280
[Guest]: life is not math and I think because of social media because it is set there in

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:55.440
[Guest]: stone it is math I remember the first so-called back then it was a scandal the

00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:01.000
[Guest]: whole you know gay scandal that came out in school was with much you know this

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.280
[Guest]: thing you're telling my sister of course one couldn't tell parents because my

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:08.200
[Guest]: parents would flip out and you know they'd probably say beta you are too so

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.000
[Guest]: tiny no one has tried anything on you you know whatever they'd flip out but my

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.240
[Guest]: sister I remember telling me that so what's the problem I said what do you

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:21.000
[Guest]: what's the problem dude he's a homo and she's like so you know I was what 15 or

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.080
[Guest]: 16 and she was I think in college by then she was finished college six years

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.520
[Guest]: older so yeah she must be in third year so and then she sat me down she says

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.480
[Guest]: what what makes you think that there's something wrong with that I couldn't

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.480
[Guest]: answer the question I said because I'm not so she's what's natural she's are

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:43.360
[Guest]: you natural you're so much tinier than everybody else are you freak then you

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:49.520
[Guest]: know so she sat me down she explained to me she asked me questions I didn't have

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:56.480
[Guest]: answers to why is it not normal I was like hey okay she says who says that

01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:03.000
[Guest]: this is how it should be are you following some you know Veda or some

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.520
[Guest]: part Ramayan Mahabharat Lekha so then you kind of said yeah what the fuck man

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.800
[Guest]: so by the time I was in class 12 I was on most progressive kids in my class

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.480
[Guest]: because that time majority of the boys are still dude oh dude don't hey dude

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.880
[Guest]: you can't be a fag gonna shit I was like dude shut the fuck up yeah just leave

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.400
[Guest]: these guys alone and I remember you know certain guys being bullied and I was

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.080
[Guest]: like fuck dude back off and because I had friends who were you know big big

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.160
[Guest]: you know people would listen to me but it took a while to evolve and even for

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:40.400
[Guest]: 1991 I was more progressive than 90% of my batch and I'm still evolving I'm

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.360
[Guest]: still learning but I'm not wrong on everything dude I may be wrong on some

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:54.800
[Guest]: and this is a sense of self-doubt that the overwoke Gen Z doesn't have they

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.600
[Guest]: know today how it is forever and oh boy are they fucking in for a surprise when

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:06.120
[Guest]: they and sorry just one thing I did this one fantastic book review that he was my

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.920
[Guest]: flatmate for a while when I was in college because you know we couldn't

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.520
[Guest]: afford to for me to have a live by myself so I had because my dad is 4g

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.640
[Guest]: quota he had got you know the retired of forges or get annoyed others on colony

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.120
[Guest]: in South really there was one colony in easterly there's an ecology with all the

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.840
[Guest]: retired 4g colonies that had come up so he got a flat there so I was sharing it

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.160
[Guest]: his name is Sunil Mehra in fact he was a writer for India today an outlook and

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.520
[Guest]: one of the most gifted writers now he does this Dastan Goyi and he was one of

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:40.600
[Guest]: the petitioners for that 66 a 66 a world now shit everything of minus 66 a the

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:49.600
[Guest]: decriminalizing homosexuality which was not 66 a which was 377 66 a was that

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.760
[Guest]: information information so and I remember Tara Deshpande had come in a

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.720
[Guest]: film called it's rocky subhan and you know she was like rave reviews and she's

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.120
[Guest]: the new Smith apart till the thinking man sex bomb and gave her to Donna and she

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:12.800
[Guest]: was 24 and she wrote a book so an autobiography and I remember he reviewed

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:18.360
[Guest]: it and it was patronizing a little nasty but it was really funny and I was not

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:23.720
[Guest]: yet 24 and I was I think I must have been 20 21 at the time when I when he

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.200
[Guest]: was he I read it he said you know you're really smart you're really bright you're

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.160
[Guest]: really talented but you haven't lived long enough yet to write an

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.200
[Guest]: autobiography you are nothing to tell me I mean idea Ronaldo who grew up in

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:40.400
[Guest]: poverty and buddy became Ronaldo then in 24 you have a story but if you're a

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.960
[Guest]: middle-class kid like you and me what do you write 24 that I'd done a film and

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.280
[Guest]: that is something that I think a lot of kids need to do you just haven't lived

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.360
[Guest]: long enough yet and there is no substitute to experience and that is

01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.000
[Guest]: something that I am more and more convinced as I get older yeah we're

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.680
[Amit Varma]: gonna be called uncles for saying this first of all credit to your sister for

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.440
[Amit Varma]: sitting down and having that conversation with you back in that day

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.480
[Amit Varma]: which is pretty impressive and also good that you listened because in this age of

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.800
[Amit Varma]: social media if you had already taken stances everywhere then who knows but

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.440
[Amit Varma]: like one way to figure out I should have beaten me up so one way to figure out

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.200
[Amit Varma]: how sort of open people are I think it's just to ask them that what facts would

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.320
[Amit Varma]: convince you you are wrong and if there's absolutely nothing then

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.840
[Amit Varma]: obviously it's dogmatic like you know I've gotten into scraps because you know

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.640
[Amit Varma]: when Chimamanda Adichie wrote an excellent piece on social media a while

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.760
[Amit Varma]: back I linked it and people were like hey but she's transphobic and all that

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.320
[Amit Varma]: and I was like why is she transphobic and I didn't find any of that convincing

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.840
[Amit Varma]: and one of the reasons was hey but because she defended JK Rowling and and

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.440
[Amit Varma]: I was like okay so why is Rowling transphobic because I really don't think

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.040
[Amit Varma]: she is from everything that I have read I think those are over interpretations

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and what I've realized is that when these so-called facts Rowling is

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.240
[Amit Varma]: transphobic when it almost becomes a dogmatic matter and it reminds me in

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.080
[Amit Varma]: some ways of the blasphemy law in Pakistan like in Pakistan if someone is

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.160
[Amit Varma]: charged with blasphemy you can't even say they may not have

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.920
[Amit Varma]: committed blasphemy because if they say that you will be a blasphemer yourself

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.000
[Amit Varma]: so it's not like you're defending blasphemy all you're saying is that she

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.640
[Amit Varma]: hasn't committed blasphemy but just by saying that she may not have committed

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.720
[Unknown]: it you're a blasphemer yourself so of course I got called a transphobe myself

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:29.400
[Amit Varma]: which is as far from the truth as it can be so let's kind of get back to the

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.360
[Amit Varma]: trajectory of a career we left off in DU where which the environment sounds like

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.200
[Amit Varma]: a lot of these young people should actually perhaps go there and get some

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.080
[Guest]: experience. Really they should I mean I tell them by something I regret often is

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.560
[Guest]: like when I flip out when I get angry which I don't get so often I used to get

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.800
[Guest]: really angry very often like I was on a hair trigger all the time and there was

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.920
[Guest]: stress I was doing a lot of things I was shooting having a plate I was like my

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:56.680
[Guest]: day was packed man and at that time just because you're always on edge you flip

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.440
[Guest]: out I don't do that so much but sometimes when I do I really regret it

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.800
[Guest]: later at night like which I don't carry grudges because if I carry grudges and

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:08.400
[Guest]: the same you know standard is applied to me a lot of people won't talk to me ever

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:15.560
[Guest]: because when I lose it I can say really nasty things but you know this I have

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:22.880
[Guest]: said often enough that you should have been in DU in the 90s and you would not

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:28.240
[Guest]: be so oh yeah oh yeah oh this was you know too much oh I can't deal with this

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:33.480
[Guest]: oh this gives me anxiety dude there till you were back home you'll always be

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:40.680
[Guest]: dealing with anxiety that was just the environment it was so yeah I think I

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.840
[Guest]: mean I think there is something to say about tough love yeah you can't go

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:51.680
[Guest]: through life not expecting to have doubt or be anxious it's not a condition it's

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.840
[Guest]: life and that's not to say I'm not denying that there is something called

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:59.320
[Guest]: anxiety but I just think that unless there is something deeply wrong with

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:06.600
[Guest]: this generation the data of people who I know who have anxiety is way more than I

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:12.080
[Guest]: think would be considered an acceptable level for a society to be largely

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:17.120
[Guest]: healthy then our society is finished. Jonathan Hayton made this great

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:23.080
[Amit Varma]: observation in in the context of teenage girls committing suicide more and more

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.300
[Amit Varma]: in the US and suffering from depression and there was a Facebook study which

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.600
[Amit Varma]: actually validated this which Facebook suppressed many years ago and the thesis

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.320
[Amit Varma]: was this that when the internet really started exploding people worried about

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.360
[Amit Varma]: teenage boys young boys they said that they'll play video games all the time

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.840
[Amit Varma]: and they'll be violent and all that now it turns out that that was just fine the

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.800
[Amit Varma]: boys played video games and learn problem-solving it wasn't a big deal

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.600
[Amit Varma]: they developed fine the problem happened with the girls because how girls were

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.800
[Amit Varma]: typically socialized when they're adolescent or pre-adolescent or whatever

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.360
[Amit Varma]: not my words I'm kind of paraphrasing what others have said and experts have

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.560
[Amit Varma]: said is that they're kind of hanging out together in school and that's how they

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.720
[Amit Varma]: are being social and you know all of that but what social media did was it

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.920
[Amit Varma]: pushed them into a performative space like Instagram where everybody's looking

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.240
[Amit Varma]: at best and all of that and the anxieties of having to be performative

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.760
[Amit Varma]: having to compete all the time like I think you and I had the luxury of being

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:19.800
[Amit Varma]: able to fall into our skins and discover a self without needing to construct it

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.280
[Amit Varma]: for ourselves to compete with everybody else's constructed selves and it's it's

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.720
[Amit Varma]: something I I feel really bad for all these people I but I hope that it's kind

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.760
[Amit Varma]: of a small minority and if you see more of them perhaps it's you know the

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.480
[Amit Varma]: self-selection of the media profession itself which might attract those people

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.280
[Amit Varma]: that's my hope I don't know but to get back to the narrative of your life so

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.800
[Amit Varma]: you've done your economics at Hansraj College and all that what are you

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:50.320
[Amit Varma]: looking at doing and how do you then you know end up at news track looking at

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.480
[Guest]: just surviving I mean there's certain bits that I won't go into because I'm a

01:08:53.480 --> 01:09:01.300
[Guest]: very sure private person but a variety of things in by 95 was just through my

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:07.000
[Guest]: life no spin where I was kind of a drift and I would have to watch out for myself

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.680
[Guest]: or my sisters would have to watch out for what I did there was nobody else

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:15.640

[Guest]: which had probably 30 reporters at the time I mean everyone who's heading any

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.840
[Guest]: news organization in there right now of consequence is from news track you know

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.280

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.280
[Guest]: chance yeah exactly so I went and one thing was that and this is what I even

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:35.560
[Guest]: tell I mean I may have been rebellious and often not you know I had a lot of

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.680
[Guest]: problems I wasn't I was great but I was very hard-working which is like

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.400
[Guest]: tilted laziness makes me more angry than anything else when I see a young person

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:49.560
[Guest]: who's working and is lazy oh man I just flip out I'm like if you fucking can't

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:55.080
[Guest]: work at this age when you're fucking 47 you'll be doing jack shit you're at your

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.480
[Guest]: prime I could get by like I could get by three to four days without sleeping more

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.720
[Guest]: than three hours a day yeah today of course I've got diabetes and I'm sure

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.120
[Guest]: that's one of the reasons but I can't do that really if I go without eight

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.240
[Guest]: hours of sleep for my second day I'll get a cough cold I'd be zombieing yeah

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.000
[Guest]: I know what you mean when you're young you can do that you can you know get

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:22.040
[Guest]: smashed you can wake up in the morning six head to office so so and we're

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:27.280
[Guest]: talking about pre-internet pre EVMs so I started work as a researcher there was

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.960
[Guest]: such a thing as a researcher and later in news there were no such things as

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.760
[Guest]: researchers news laundry still has people as researchers I must add I

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.680
[Guest]: actually started that what I learned from Madhu and researcher meant that you

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.720
[Guest]: didn't have the internet so let's say I remember the first story I was working on

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:49.480
[Guest]: was on Altaf Hussain of the MQM Mukthuhadi Qaumi movement of Pakistan so

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.480
[Guest]: of course I don't know who the fuck Altaf Hussain was so say go to the

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.320
[Guest]: Indira Day library and get me research on Altaf Hussain which research on Altaf Hussain

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.320
[Guest]: meant you took a file you wrote on that Altaf Hussain for Alpana Kishore

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:04.440
[Guest]: who was my you know immediate boss at the time and then Madhu was her boss

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.160
[Guest]: and you go to so competent house which is cannot place middle circle was a

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.280
[Guest]: news track office Indira Day office was a block the you know the corner office

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.760
[Guest]: and Indira Day library was in this end block only on the inner circle so you

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.400
[Guest]: went and then you know with those wheels you pull those things and those columns

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.760
[Guest]: move yeah I don't know what you call those but they're on these tracks so

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.200
[Guest]: these huge from the you know from the ground to the ceiling there these

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.560
[Guest]: cabinets and you with a wheel you can move them there like ten of them

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:38.560
[Guest]: stacked up so all the time magazines all the India Today magazines all the Times

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:43.280
[Guest]: of India newspapers they're all in these big big files like with the date right

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:50.040
[Guest]: from like 1980 to 82 82 to 83 83 and you just start taking them out at random and

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:53.040
[Guest]: looking for and looking for anything to do with Altaf Hussain and what you do

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:57.160
[Guest]: with a search of Altaf Hussain today and then you so you read like one

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.840
[Guest]: paragraph of the globe of everything and then say okay Altaf Hussain photocopy

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.720
[Guest]: photocopy so over like four five days you have a file that is fairly thick of

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.360
[Guest]: Altaf Hussain related articles and then you take it to the reporter he or she

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.360
[Guest]: will read that then they will determine the story of Altaf Hussain and that story

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.960
[Guest]: will be scripted there will be shoots happening over two three four days then

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.440
[Guest]: edits happening over two three days and then a story will come out which will be

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:25.600
[Guest]: anything from 5 to 25 minutes that's how the news was I'm so glad you sketched it

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.440
[Amit Varma]: out in detail like that because people today including me often just take the

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.800
[Amit Varma]: internet for granted that research hai toh search karo and it's like physically

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.720
[Amit Varma]: going there moving wheels columns moving taking out shit at random there's no

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.800
[Guest]: search you got everything yeah so you just take one file after the other so

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.280
[Guest]: you got like the one you see Pooja Bedi photo you know it's not Altaf Hussain

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.440
[Guest]: yeah so it's the people may be thinking so that means you read every magazine

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.680
[Guest]: no you're smart you open it if there's a cover story in Pakistan you know there

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.720
[Guest]: will be an Altaf Hussain so then you find good if the cover story is on

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.200
[Guest]: Rajiv Gandhi's assassination for example then you know that these pages you don't

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.080
[Guest]: even go you see okay this story is from page 29 to page 38 is Rajiv Gandhi

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:07.240
[Guest]: nothing on that page that says Pooja Bedi's photo this is not Altaf Hussain

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.640
[Guest]: tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk so that's how you go through it so sometimes you can go

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:17.800
[Guest]: through like 20 magazines in like 40 minutes and you're fairly accurate so

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:22.680
[Guest]: yeah that was how we did research and then you know within three months I was

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.280
[Guest]: you know elevated to a reporter then you start doing your own stories meanwhile

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.400
[Guest]: news track kind of died I mean it became a weekly show the cassettes were

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:37.560
[Guest]: phased out in fact cassettes were phased out the month I joined hmm I think a

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.040
[Guest]: month before that we were just in the last do those archives exist anywhere

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.560
[Amit Varma]: but I have the VHS tapes in my office so I want to ask you about one particular

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.040
[Amit Varma]: sorry for the digression but one particular story that imprinted itself

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.600
[Amit Varma]: on me just because it was so hilarious and so truthful which I still remember

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.040
[Amit Varma]: which would have been before your time but you might have seen it and it was

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.320
[Amit Varma]: this interview of Devi Lal where he was being asked that you know why he made

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Om Prakash Chautala the chief minister of Haryana at the time and I remember

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.840
[Amit Varma]: the angle was like he he was sort of in a banyan and dhoti and his feet were up

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.280
[Amit Varma]: on this thing in the garden and the angle was from below the shoes giant

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:19.920
[Amit Varma]: kids and Devi Lal in the background and the question was ki apne apne bete ko

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:26.040
[Amit Varma]: chief minister kyu banaya and Devi Lal said toh kya bhajanlal ke chhode ko banaya

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:32.560
[Amit Varma]: which I thought was a remarkable answer right it's yeah and I haven't

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.720
[Guest]: obviously found it anywhere on YouTube but if you have the tapes I have all the

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:44.280
[Guest]: archives so but so of course then aaj tak started as a bulletin and I remember

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.120
[Guest]: aaj tak started and here's again where I was wrong and so wrong when aaj tak

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:56.440
[Guest]: started people may take Hindi news as a viewership thing for granted but I mean

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.640
[Guest]: back then I think Ajit was a Punjabi paper that had a huge circulation

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.360
[Guest]: otherwise news was an English thing on television you know there was a Hindi

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.840
[Guest]: but you know news track the Hindi news track was a later thing India today was

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:13.360
[Guest]: a Hindi magazine there was Dharam Yuga and Saptahik Hindustan but they didn't

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.800
[Guest]: have you know the kind of sway I don't know about the numbers but I'm guessing

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.840
[Guest]: considering they didn't really rock the world and they've folded up soon India

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.080
[Guest]: today English magazine there was an Indian Hindi which was like an

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:31.280
[Guest]: afterthought but news was English news track then you know after news tracks

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.560
[Guest]: spectacular success eyewitness had started Karan Thapar started some

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.560
[Guest]: cassettes then there was people plus you know there was a whole bunch of them

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:45.360
[Guest]: came so when aaj tak started most people and you just you know observe and

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.800
[Guest]: say haan theek hi bolte hain many people were of the view that chalega kahan hai

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:55.240
[Guest]: Hindi people don't want news they want Govinda they want cinema so for English

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.200
[Guest]: speaking there's news for Hindi speaking there's cinema you know that was a

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.160
[Guest]: thinking and fuck how wrong everybody was and how fucking patronizing I know

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.560
[Amit Varma]: and how aaj tak exploded a news news track folded up and aaj tak became the thing

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.400
[Guest]: yeah so then I reported for aaj tak and that was a huge like kind of shock

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.240
[Guest]: because from stories being between you know 5 to 15 minutes the first phase

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.560
[Guest]: when it was it was aaj tak as a bulletin was 24 minutes because there was

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.480
[Guest]: six minutes FCT which is called free commercial time three minutes belong to

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:31.320
[Guest]: the government three minutes belong to the person and you know we had to finish

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.680
[Guest]: stories in 90 seconds I was like what the fuck 90 seconds is just mai samay baan raha hoon tab tak to

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:42.680
[Guest]: so that is what you know I don't show refer to soundbite so that we had

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:48.800
[Guest]: formula opening voiceover which is about you know half a page bite middle voice

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:55.640
[Guest]: over bite closing voiceover piece to camera done story over and that you know

01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:00.880
[Guest]: you saw how people like SP Singh who died you know way too early and there

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.320
[Guest]: was Ajay Dada who also unfortunately died in the car accident and Naqvi Dada

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:08.560
[Guest]: they they knew how to tell that story quickly you know just get to the meat of

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:13.200
[Guest]: the story and of course there's some one of the advantages of working in the 90s

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.320
[Guest]: was that you got to cover three general elections in five years normally for

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.280
[Guest]: people who took 15 years because you know they will all they will all be wrong

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.960
[Guest]: Sitaram Kesari made that government collapse so there was one then there was

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.480
[Guest]: a hung Parliament Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 13 day government in the 13 month

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:34.240
[Guest]: government and another election so there was you know so you got to cover you

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:40.880
[Guest]: know two Lok Sabha elections very close to each other and there were really

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.400
[Guest]: funny things because that is the first time there was live happening for

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.520
[Guest]: private otherwise Doordarshan used to live so it was Aapka Faisla and which was all

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:56.520
[Guest]: the reporters and anchors would be India Today's which was Tavleen, Veer, Madhu and

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:05.080
[Guest]: who was the fourth? Karan Thapar and all the reporters would be us guys and the

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:09.400
[Guest]: infrastructure and the producers would be Doordarshan's and I remember there was

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.000
[Guest]: such a huge difference because in our time if you didn't get the shit done you

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.520
[Guest]: know your ass would be fucking kicked and Madhu didn't suffer fools and we

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:24.920
[Guest]: were working with producers so both you know there was a guy called

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.560
[Guest]: Ujhaar Singh he now I think does a show on News X he used to do a show you may

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:33.920
[Guest]: have seen him he used to anchor a bunch of stuff and he got LK Advani

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:39.520
[Guest]: like it was a fucking scoop at night LK Advani ko wale aaya hai. That time there used to be

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.440
[Guest]: these big OB vans you know now OB vans are these short truck type things that

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.960
[Guest]: also aren't used now you have a little bit the OB van was the size of a you

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.600
[Guest]: know bus inside there was all these monitors there would be the faders there

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:55.240
[Guest]: would be the big consoles like you know this one and it had this one master

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:58.320
[Guest]: switch once you switch it off you know like the old ACs you can't switch it on

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.920
[Guest]: for half an hour you have to wait half an hour and then switch it on so it was

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:07.560
[Guest]: dinner time and Doordarshan is Sarkari job so they said dinner time so Ujhaar said

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:13.040
[Guest]: bacha I've got LK Advani, Advani ji aa rahe hain, aa rahe honge, khatak he switched it off

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:19.560
[Guest]: oh my god and Ujhaar was like I can't get him back and these guys were like hum drink khaane jaane hain

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:27.960
[Guest]: yeh nahi hoga, unko leh drink ke baad hai. I'm like f**k you saw the power of a government job man you know they

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.920
[Guest]: were answerable to nobody but anyway I was I worked really hard like for the

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:38.040
[Guest]: time that I was there I didn't stand out for my intellect or anything but if

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.680
[Guest]: anything needed to be done which needed you to stay in office for three nights I

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.080
[Guest]: wouldn't why no no I wanted to go home one was for a lot of people that was

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.440
[Guest]: genuine this thing especially back then for girls that you know the parents

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.680
[Guest]: won't say you'll go to office on Monday come back on Thursday you f**k it's serious

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:57.800
[Guest]: for a lot of guys also that would be the case apne koi poochne wala tha nahi toh bhai

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:04.560
[Guest]: jahe main Thursday au ki Friday au ki main aungi nahi no one gave a f**k so I I worked

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:10.000
[Guest]: very hard for those four years from 95 to 99 but when Madhu quit which was I

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.200
[Guest]: think 96 97 I knew that I'm not gonna want to work here for very long

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.200
[Guest]: age journalism the way it was being done that time was not for me and at the back

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.840
[Guest]: of my head it was that I I had no problem with Madhu because I was very

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:30.600
[Guest]: young I was just 20 but as I became 22 23 that thought crystallized maybe had

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.240
[Guest]: Madhu continued to be my boss I would have happily worked I don't know but

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:37.080
[Guest]: when there was a change of management the whole you know office change

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:42.680
[Guest]: everything changed then Prashant who was also with me at News Trek we quit and we

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:46.720
[Guest]: started a production house called small screen in 99 and then we did a

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:51.080
[Guest]: documentary film which won a couple of awards so we got back then like three

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.120
[Guest]: and a half thousand dollars in award money that kept you going for a month

01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:01.560
[Guest]: then his wife gave us some money to go month on month my sister would give us

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:06.160
[Guest]: something so there were two three years of struggle where I often wondered

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:11.040
[Guest]: because buffoons who was who were I I'm not saying I was their boss but in

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.800
[Guest]: office they would be nobody's were suddenly anchoring prime times you know

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.760
[Guest]: that is when the boom happened the mid-2000s and when Prashant you say

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:22.240
[Guest]: we didn't make a mistake? we'd be watching TV and say this idiot is anchoring

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.040
[Guest]: what are you doing? okay then we I don't want to take names and then someone he's become

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:29.120
[Guest]: managing editor I said are you fucking serious that duffer doesn't know his

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:32.760
[Guest]: ass from his elbow and then suddenly that time a Hyundai Accent came

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:38.160
[Guest]: everyone started buying Hyundai Accent I went from earning I joined at

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.040
[Guest]: three and a half thousand then I you know moved to seven thousand soon I became a

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:44.780
[Guest]: reporter then I went up to eleven and a half thousand when I quit which was in

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:48.560
[Guest]: Bombay I was posted to Bombay and Millind Khandekar was my boss at the

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.160
[Guest]: time I think now he's heading Aaj Tak and he was with ABP for a while at that

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:57.480
[Guest]: time sorry yeah that you know a lot of these people who we had worked with

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.000
[Guest]: would find out so from eleven thousand twelve thousand salaries at that time

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.800
[Guest]: we're talking people are getting forty forty five thousand just unheard of yeah

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.960
[Guest]: in our profession and here we had one documentary film and after that we didn't get

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:16.080
[Guest]: another project so we'd get a film for some hotel to do a

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:20.000
[Guest]: corporate film you know it was like and then you know you'd often wonder dude

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.040
[Guest]: have we made the wrong choice like you know people who are not even half as

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.560
[Guest]: smart as us or so we thought are anchoring primetime shows they are

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.000
[Guest]: wearing suits you and I are still struggling to you know buy another pair

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.680
[Guest]: of shoes but I'm glad we stuck it out I'm so glad because then when the boom

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:43.800
[Guest]: happened then you know we got you know one show we got election shows for some

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.720
[Guest]: Tamil child channel we got because we had the reporter's background then we

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.480
[Guest]: did a couple of travel shows in the travel boom started then you know we

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.600
[Guest]: just got high when I played became a spectacular success then Fox Traveller

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.720
[Guest]: came we did Twist of Taste with Neel Bhatia so I was so glad we stuck it out

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.880
[Guest]: because for the next seven or eight years you know now startup is a thing so

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.480
[Guest]: from just Prashant, me, Pancham and Ramakant who were our office guys and

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.280
[Guest]: Ramakant is still with us at News Laundry Pancham has retired and gone back to his

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.800
[Guest]: village in Kumaon he just retired last year so the four founders of small screen

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:21.800
[Guest]: were Prashant, Ramakant, Pancham and me and then without any funding we see we grew

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.360
[Guest]: from like you know four people to 54 people and it's organic growth no

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.960
[Guest]: funding you know you did a show you saved some money you hired another

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.600
[Guest]: person you did a show save some money bought an Apple G3

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.640
[Guest]: those days it was G3 then you saved some money bought a G4 hired another editor

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.880
[Guest]: and then you grew grew and then at one time there was not a travel there was

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:46.040
[Guest]: not a lifestyle channel in India which did not have a travel show that wasn't

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.480
[Guest]: produced for us Twist of Taste you know what's with Indian men what's Indian

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.720
[Guest]: women, Roti Raasta India, Highway on my Plate I don't even remember the names of

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.360
[Guest]: you know we had a travel show on every every channel and meanwhile there were

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.480
[Guest]: other shows we were doing we were doing small-time ad films and meanwhile I was

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.600
[Guest]: writing this show called Gustakhi Maa from the Great Indian Dimasha again I

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:11.680
[Guest]: remember that how did I get that a friend of mine used to work at NTV Manvi

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:18.080
[Guest]: Sinha she was you know at profit she was an anchor there and she was in Vellum

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.160
[Guest]: Girls she was a school captain I was at Doon and she was my mother's favorite

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.360
[Guest]: student and my mother used to keep saying that you're the Tannikamma she's

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:30.120
[Guest]: going for debates at the age of 14-15 you are being sent up to the headmaster

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.080
[Guest]: for indiscipline because I used to get into it. She was Sharma ji ka beta. She was Sharma ji ka beta

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.840
[Guest]: and I was the guy who was always being complained about that your son you know

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.840
[Guest]: did this and then he was rude to such and such teacher and then he was rude to such and such boy

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.560
[Guest]: and then he did this and he did that so Manvi was there and they were looking to

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:50.440
[Guest]: start and it was very hush-hush at the time we can't tell you too much but it's

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.720
[Guest]: political and it's funny can you do that I was like of course I can do that

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.440
[Guest]: because like stories would get rejected all the time at Aaj Tak because I would

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.840
[Guest]: you know try to add some funny element to the stories and it was Nakul and I said

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:07.000
[Guest]: Niku yeh kya tamashe kar rahe ho yeh news hai yeh kaisa voice ho lika I remember and I was

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.800
[Guest]: always asked to do like during election time we do political stories otherwise

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.520
[Guest]: you'd ask to do stories like go to Lodhi Garden and ask do a Vox Pop and what do

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.960
[Guest]: people feel about Bill Clinton's impeachment like why the fuck does Lodhi

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:25.960
[Guest]: Garden walk and give a fuck about Bill Clinton but you know or go to all the netas and ask them

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.920
[Guest]: what is the New Year resolution I remember Pranam Mukherjee going to his

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.320
[Guest]: house and that that guy also had a bungalow opposite Pranam Mukherjee that

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:38.240
[Guest]: you know the guy who hurt his leg in a bomb blast Bitta Bitla that Sikh guy

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:43.040
[Amit Varma]: yeah yeah I forget the name but I know who you are talking about and Sushma Swaraj I

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.760
[Guest]: remember you know you could just walk into the house and ask for an interview

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:51.080
[Amit Varma]: yeah yeah dude and they'd entertain you because NewsTrack was the only game in

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.920
[Guest]: town no one would say no to NewsTrack camera yeah so you know when I was 21 22

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:58.360
[Guest]: I've interviewed like Sushma Swaraj, I've interviewed Pranam Mukherjee, I've interviewed that

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:02.480
[Guest]: Home Minister would keep changing his outfit Patil, Pratibha Patil, no no no

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:08.480
[Guest]: Congress guy from Maharashtra um the Home Minister who got a lot of flack

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.120
[Guest]: when the bomb blast happened, Shivraj Patil, so I mean I've interviewed all these guys

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:18.600
[Guest]: because if you were an Aaj Tak on NewsTrack camera you were the biggest you

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.520
[Guest]: know game were there any memorable New Year resolutions dude everybody want to

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:28.240
[Guest]: write a book every this year I will write a book I was like okay so there

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.080
[Guest]: was nothing very creative I remember so it was it was exciting in that in that

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.960
[Guest]: sense and any of this so then when this happened Manvi said she called me and

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.120
[Guest]: she said you know NDTV is looking for a show where they look for a funny guy who

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.640
[Guest]: knows politics and I thought you're the guy so why don't you come and meet the

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.520
[Guest]: producer and Pranoy, I didn't get Pranoy, I was at Dosco, now this is what I mean a

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:55.560
[Guest]: privilege yeah as soon as you walk in you say small circles, Doon, Bachelor 92, oh really

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:01.600
[Guest]: Doon, Bachelor 66 you know that immediate there's a bond there so they asked me to

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.560
[Guest]: write two three scripts which were quite funny there was so much of material in

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:11.880
[Guest]: any case so then I wrote that show from 2003-2010 which was a daily show

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.440
[Guest]: I mean first it was a weekly and then became a daily show which is very hard

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.600
[Guest]: that taught me discipline waking up every morning at 6 after having watched

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:22.680
[Guest]: two or three bulletins a night before you know wait for the newspapers to come

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.760
[Guest]: see the first bulletin by 11 o'clock have three scripts ready three gags to

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:33.840
[Guest]: send back but because of this kida of news by now news had become you know

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.760
[Guest]: channels had started they had mushroomed all sorts of Zee, Star had started with

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:43.000
[Guest]: NDTV in part now it wasn't insane like it is now but it was still ridiculously

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.320
[Guest]: shrill and I remember me and Madhu would often meet in Delhi you know at because

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:50.080
[Guest]: I have a common friend who's very good friend of us you'd often meet at some

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.640
[Guest]: wedding or something not to say I move in Madhu's circles but I have this one

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.200
[Guest]: friend who is very friendly with Madhu whose parents are very friendly with

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:02.560
[Guest]: Madhu so because at that time we were all marriageable age there were three

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.320
[Guest]: quick succession marriages and Madhu was there at the marriage so was I and we

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:09.480
[Guest]: like dude what the fuck is happening because now I have a lot of respect for

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.200
[Guest]: them and many of them are friends of mine but many of them went through a

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:18.800
[Guest]: phase where they were so impressed with themselves being on TV that they became

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.360
[Guest]: like oh my god look here I am look here there's this happening and I'm here kind

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:27.840
[Guest]: of thing and we had done all that at News Strike you know so Madhu said we

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:33.600
[Guest]: should do a show that is takes apart all this so we pitched that show we took it

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:37.920
[Guest]: to Rajdeep who had started CNN-IBN we took it to Pranoy we took it to this one

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:43.160
[Guest]: who at times now he was doing Arnab it was a great idea because you know now

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:47.160
[Guest]: people take for granted that everyone takes potshots at each other in the mid

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:53.000
[Guest]: 2000s to the early 2011-12s and all there was this unspoken rule you will

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.880
[Guest]: attack everybody but not fellow media no matter what you think of them and I was

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:03.680
[Guest]: like who the fuck made this rule and this is when things like my sister's talk

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:09.800
[Guest]: who made this rule you know very early in life I was taught that is it a rule

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:14.800
[Guest]: of nature or is it math if it is neither of these it can be broken so I'm like

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:18.200
[Guest]: why the fuck can't you name each other and you know and still be friends I

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:23.560
[Guest]: really like this a lot about Barkha we have done searing critique of Barkha I

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:28.320
[Guest]: myself have criticized various aspects of us and I also really admire various

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:33.400
[Guest]: aspects of hers but she can take it in the jaw and move on she's a TK you

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.360
[Guest]: didn't like that TK you like this TK chalo to see when you write but she's

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.240
[Guest]: she won't sulk someone like Sagarika doesn't have that

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:46.560
[Guest]: quality after the eight birth but I cut the cut tea for life and most people in

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.800
[Guest]: the media were like this so I thought didn't give a fuck cuz I have very good

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:53.160
[Guest]: friends or not in the media so I said I don't want to be friends anyway Madhu

01:32:53.160 --> 01:33:02.360
[Guest]: doesn't give a fuck because dude I'm your so dude so everyone said lovely

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:05.760
[Guest]: idea but you criticize us also we said of course you criticize you we can't be

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:10.320
[Guest]: on your channel and take photos but you no no no no no but you do and many say

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:14.400
[Guest]: no you know this is not done we shouldn't comment on media to Prashant

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.720
[Guest]: Madhu me Rupak by that time our friend had also joined small screen because he

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:22.280
[Guest]: had said he was in a family business he's a childhood friend of mine and he

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:27.280
[Guest]: said dude he's creative creative bent he says I don't want to do that you know

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:31.800
[Guest]: let me come on to small screen and we'll do something and it's grown ever since

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.720
[Guest]: now small screen news laundry around separately because for propriety reasons

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:39.640
[Guest]: you know corporate governance it's conflict of interest there hundreds of

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:44.800
[Guest]: things happen so we separated in 2014 and also the investor demands conditions

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.120
[Guest]: precedence you cannot sit on any other board and all that shit so you have to

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:54.600
[Guest]: separate everything but so Prashant said I fuck everyone y'all I'm internet

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:59.320
[Guest]: pitch aligned to my internet Sarah Dekta connect he says they pay an 8% to

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:05.040
[Guest]: dictate so by that time I was also I'm only a professional career meanwhile

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.400
[Guest]: Arvind KJ well it also happened in 2002 when I was shooting documentary then we

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.680
[Guest]: came very friendly and then we started an NGO together and stuff then when

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:17.280
[Guest]: this thing happened I realized the power of the internet I said Prashant you're

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.240
[Guest]: very smart let's do this on the internet so then when we said do this on the

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:25.080
[Guest]: internet then from one show which would was clothesline Madhu's show it became

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:28.720
[Guest]: Niku you do a series called I agree where you interview we'll do articles

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.480
[Guest]: we'll do cartoons we'll do comics and there was not much additional cost

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:37.040
[Guest]: because small screen had you know 50 employees it had you know 12 editing

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:41.560
[Guest]: machines it had eight directors it had you know so an additional cost for five

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.160
[Guest]: people we'd hire and we'd start it was a passion project it was Kida tha news ka

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:50.560
[Guest]: Kida Prashant kotha Madhu kotha mujhe tha that was the only reason news

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.920
[Guest]: started and in two three years it became a thing and one thing from the

01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.680
[Guest]: beginning we were clear that it is subscribers only I had it I had you know

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:05.240
[Guest]: at that time and I remember discussing this Madhu figured that ads will kill

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:10.800
[Guest]: news and if you see in 2012 our mission statement says this I said news cannot

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.560
[Guest]: survive on ads because even though the insanity of Arnab had not happened yet

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.600
[Guest]: the whole thing of Bunty and Bubbly anchoring a show you know this was I

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:25.040
[Guest]: think in 2004-5 when Rani Mukherjee I was watching news I was like what the

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:30.440
[Guest]: fuck how can you your prime time is sacred you cannot turn this into a

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:36.440
[Guest]: gimmick to do Bunty and this is NDTV dude it's not like times now every channel

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:42.320
[Guest]: was doing Sohail Seth was a fucking toast of every show fucking talking crap

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:49.440
[Guest]: like I was like what the fuck what how is this news and it was just stupid

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.040
[Guest]: wasn't Arnab insanity let me repeat but the reasons for it being ridiculous for

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:59.440
[Guest]: different but I was like because ads because this dude will get you ads that

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:03.160
[Guest]: dude will get you ads no one is going to say anything about cricket because

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:08.040
[Guest]: cricket will get you ads so we had the luxury of not having to make a living

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:12.560
[Guest]: because small screen was doing amazing work so we could take that you know just

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:18.200
[Guest]: you could afford to be virtuous we will not take ads from the start so that was our

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:23.360
[Guest]: mission statement news cannot survive on ads boss either you will do TRP or

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.040
[Guest]: news because that's the nature of the beast so then and then of course once it

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:36.280
[Guest]: started and again but I will say that boss Madhu is you have to know her to

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:40.320
[Guest]: understand what an amazing person she is you know she is the kind who would not

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.520
[Guest]: even ask for a Padmashree and Padmashree givers will know better than to offer it

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:49.560
[Guest]: to her because she'll say other journalists have no problem taking

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.920
[Guest]: Padmashree's she would not even look at it so they know better than to give it

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.920
[Guest]: to her she was the kind of person who when we would be and I will not take

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.560
[Guest]: names here at night there was a big thing that happened in Delhi with a very

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:05.680
[Guest]: big name and we all knew that person is friends and so you like dude and mother

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.920
[Guest]: was in office at night mother we're gonna do this story this why are you

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:15.680
[Guest]: telling me go do it but you know he's friends with you know who your brother

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:20.080
[Guest]: your family or whatever your reporter you do the story I'll handle rest who

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.760
[Guest]: the fuck has the balls to say that today tell me and the only reason mother was

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.040
[Guest]: not considered one of the big like you know

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:35.800
[Guest]: Virgie's and some particular is because she's a woman Madhu was a boss who you

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.760
[Guest]: could learn so much from and because she came from such privilege she didn't give

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.560
[Guest]: a shit about consequences she said you do your job I will handle the rest from

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:52.560
[Guest]: VP Singh bloody threatening us to bloody banning our tape to get all sorts of

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.160
[Guest]: shit happening that's that's not your job you report she wasn't I mean the way

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.560
[Guest]: the newsroom changed when she quit was I someday I'll maybe write a book it's

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:10.400
[Guest]: it's dramatic how India today pre Madhu and India today post Madhu one of the

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.560
[Amit Varma]: things I've been doing in the last couple of years is looking at people's

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.720
[Amit Varma]: interviewing styles a lot part of this is kind of deliberate just to look at

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.960
[Amit Varma]: matters of the craft and how people do what they do and part of it is whenever

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.440
[Amit Varma]: I have a guest on my show I'll always watch every other interview of theirs

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:30.320
[Amit Varma]: that I can find just to look for material and one of the things I noticed

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.840
[Amit Varma]: was and and normally with Indian interviews I'm incredibly dismayed

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:38.800
[Amit Varma]: because people are interrupting all the time looking for gotcha moments staying

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.960
[Amit Varma]: at a very shallow level and you mentioned Madhu and I remember her

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.720
[Amit Varma]: interviews are always so immaculate and in particular Dinesh Thakur was on my

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.600
[Amit Varma]: show recently so while researching for him I watched Madhu's interview with

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Dinesh Thakur and I was a first one where I could just see that you know

01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.240
[Amit Varma]: like I take tons of notes for my episodes from the books which I had

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:03.800
[Amit Varma]: already done by the time I watched that video and she used so many of the same

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.040
[Amit Varma]: quotes that I was planning to ask him about and so much of that so meticulous

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:12.080
[Amit Varma]: and well-organized it strikes me and I want to use that to double-click on

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.920
[Amit Varma]: something that you said earlier where perhaps being a bit modest you said in

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.560
[Amit Varma]: the 90s that you weren't particularly smart or whatever but you were a hard

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.600
[Amit Varma]: worker and that reminds me of something I read in an interview some 20 years ago

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.800
[Amit Varma]: and I mentioned this on my show but I can't figure out whose interview it is

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:30.400
[Amit Varma]: it's a sports person and it's not Dravid though it sounds like he would have said

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.320
[Amit Varma]: it where the person was asked about talent and he said you know what talent

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:38.080
[Amit Varma]: is talent is not fast twitch muscles or hand-eye coordination or any of those

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.520
[Amit Varma]: things talent is when you've been getting up every day in the morning to

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.080
[Amit Varma]: run and one day it's a Sunday and it's a holiday and you get up at 6 a.m. and

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.400
[Amit Varma]: there's a thunderstorm outside and your body is aching and you just want to

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:54.040
[Amit Varma]: stay in bed and you still go out and run in the rain that's talent right and one

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:57.840
[Amit Varma]: of the lessons that I have learned in my life is that hard work is everything

01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:03.320
[Amit Varma]: everything you know I won't put a nuance to that hard work is the whole game like

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:07.960
[Amit Varma]: I remember I used to think in my 20s that oh I am so talented I am meant for

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.520
[Amit Varma]: big things and oh this guy knows nothing or whatever you know in my arrogant way

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.120
[Amit Varma]: and of course I wasn't as saliented as I thought I was then but self-delusion

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:19.660
[Amit Varma]: kind of helps you stick with the game and fake it till you make it and through

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:24.280
[Amit Varma]: life I've realized many of the people who had that natural flair for things

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.760
[Amit Varma]: for doing things didn't really get very far and the guys who got far were the

01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:32.880
[Amit Varma]: guys who worked hard regardless of how much natural flair they must have like

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:36.480
[Amit Varma]: in a cricketing context I see this with someone like Virat Kohli where in the

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.040
[Amit Varma]: under 19 years if you look at him the first time he played the IPL it was like

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:44.360
[Amit Varma]: such a limited player, he can play a square of the wicket, he has his areas but so

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:48.600
[Amit Varma]: limited and then I think he went on to become a finest batsman right even if

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.280
[Amit Varma]: he's better in some formats than others and it's hard work it's work ethic it's

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.400
[Amit Varma]: purely that and you've earlier mentioned about you've described your own work

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:58.640
[Amit Varma]: ethic and at the same time you've spoken about how young people today feel so

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.880
[Amit Varma]: entitled that they're not putting in that work they're not putting in at

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:06.400
[Amit Varma]: hours and that process is so important equally another thing that I kind of

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:10.760
[Amit Varma]: talk to my writing students about and try to kind of drive home is that

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:14.080
[Amit Varma]: getting it done is more important than getting it right there's always a

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.600
[Amit Varma]: trade-off between these right but the only way to get it right is to get it

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:21.440
[Amit Varma]: done again and again and again and again and iteration leads to excellence like

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.520
[Amit Varma]: you've spoken about how you wrote Gussaki Ma for what those seven

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:28.720
[Amit Varma]: eight years and that every fucking day waking up in the morning and every

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:33.200
[Guest]: fucking day yeah and and and has to be funny and I know 50% of them weren't

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.320
[Amit Varma]: funny at all yeah 30 moderately funny 20 really funny I know that but you have to

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:40.960
[Amit Varma]: get it done you have to get it done and and chances are that just getting it

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:46.160
[Amit Varma]: done meant your funniest ones were way funnier than someone who you know just

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.840
[Amit Varma]: spent four years writing one thing because that iteration is what makes it

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.240
[Amit Varma]: good which makes a lot of good habits reflexive which eventually over time

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.520
[Amit Varma]: makes it easy tell me a little bit about work ethic and what you said about Madhu

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.600
[Amit Varma]: reminded me of that because what I remember from her interview of Dinesh

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:04.520
[Amit Varma]: Thakur is that this is so bloody good you look at all these other jokers and

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:08.920
[Guest]: she's put in the work at her age and Madhu this is and something I used to

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:13.720
[Guest]: get really frustrated that this person is ready for an interview she says get

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.080
[Guest]: me his book I need to read the book I said we don't have time to read the book

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.480
[Guest]: she said I'm not going to do the interview he said he's he's giving it

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.960
[Guest]: tomorrow morning okay I'll read the book through the night she will not do an

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:29.640
[Guest]: interview unless she's read the book I'm like dude like just no she'll stay up

01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:34.240
[Guest]: all night she'll read the book about the work ethic one thing I will I will agree

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:39.400
[Guest]: with you that it is hard work but unless it's something like cricket I can't

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:45.720
[Guest]: what's the word overstate or understate access is so important of course I mean

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:49.720
[Guest]: the luck is luck is a big part of the game but once you get lucky yeah once

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:53.720
[Guest]: you get lucky it's yeah I mean getting a foot in even if you are not wealthy

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:58.680
[Guest]: yourself being in a circle where you can get access to an office where you have a

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.760
[Guest]: chance to prove yourself is extremely important I'm sure there are thousands

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:07.080
[Guest]: out there who are smarter than me more hard-working than me they just haven't

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:11.000
[Guest]: had the chance they don't know Madhu they didn't know Sabrina who took them

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.760
[Guest]: into Madhu's office like I got to work on monsoon wedding as a camera assistant

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:20.920
[Guest]: I was wrangling cable but I knew dude and that was hard work dude like you

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:25.120
[Guest]: know I remember the first day of the set the first scene we were shooting was

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.080
[Guest]: Naseer at the golf course asking the other guy for money I don't know if you've seen

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:32.960

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:53.840
[Guest]: you get to just sit and observe man that this is how the best work and he told me

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:58.880
[Guest]: one day I was like Babuji you're frozen and he writes in Urdu with the book and I said

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.520
[Guest]: what are you working on because Fiza's lyrics are done, the songs are recorded

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:09.400
[Guest]: he said I'm writing I said what he said how does it matter what I'm a writer so

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:17.680
[Guest]: I write for four hours a day I was like what he says anything but I write he

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:23.520
[Guest]: says too many people are writers but they don't write I was like fuck even

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.760
[Guest]: Gulzar just writes and 80% of what he writes is not gonna he has these books

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.560
[Guest]: he just writes and reads and writes and reads and writes he says if you're a

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:36.160
[Guest]: writer you sit every morning and just write till lunch then after lunch you

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:41.000
[Guest]: read then in the evening write some more and at night when he's watching and he

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.120
[Guest]: like he has this easy chair and he watches the TV on mute and reads the ticker

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.800
[Guest]: and you're saying what nonsense is this and this is before it had gone insane

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:55.080
[Guest]: and then he has a book he'd pick up something and write so you know I got to

01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.800
[Guest]: learn from him I got to learn from Mira, I got to learn from Sabrina, I got to learn from Madhu

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:04.280
[Guest]: I got to learn from the fucking best yeah so I had to be above average you

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.960
[Guest]: see even if I was a dumb fuck you just have access to people who are just the

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.600
[Guest]: best at their game and we're all working hard I mean that seems to be the common

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:17.680
[Guest]: thread and that is when I realized so many people I know you know they roll

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.880
[Guest]: these joints I'm working on a film I'm a writer and filmmaker

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.280
[Guest]: we're all going to be 50 years old by the time we make a film

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:27.960
[Guest]: because people like Gulzar didn't learn this boss you can't be smoking pot for six

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:33.240
[Guest]: days and write for one you're fucking right for all seven days even the best

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:39.360
[Guest]: do that and so you know I just got and then when you know you got to learn so

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:43.280
[Guest]: much you got you saw such ridiculous things you saw the hollowness of a lot

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:47.360
[Guest]: of Bollywood you saw the shallowness of a lot of Bollywood you got but you got

01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:56.040
[Guest]: to see what made who happy and you learned and you know I I learned from

01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:01.160
[Guest]: Arvind in 2002 when we didn't have any work Prashanth and I we'd make

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.400
[Guest]: documentary films which we were making no money on

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:09.240
[Guest]: ken waisey apni kaunsi dukaan chal rahi thi toh kuch seekhi leta hai toh there is this guy called Rajender Singh

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:12.160
[Guest]: called the water man of India I don't know if you're familiar with him I guess I say what he

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:15.720
[Guest]: he has a water conference I used to I don't know if he still does in his

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:21.000
[Guest]: village in Rajasthan called Bikampura so he was setting up something called the

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.480
[Guest]: Jal Bhagirathi foundation with Gaj Singh and if you go to Alwar he's turned that

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.800
[Guest]: whole place through water harvesting into like a green belt like there's this

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:34.760
[Guest]: patch in Rajasthan which is like green it's not a desert so he was you know

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:39.080
[Guest]: back in early 2002 was a big name he said okay and water was of great

01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:42.480
[Guest]: interest to us because Sheila Dixit was privatizing the Delhi water supply back

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:47.520
[Guest]: then and I was ideologically opposed to it so I said let's go to his conference

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:51.880
[Guest]: that season there I saw Arvind speak he had just quit his job with IT and I was

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:56.600
[Guest]: very impressed with his speech with his life story so we met and we spoke and he

01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.720
[Guest]: came back to Delhi I came back to Delhi and then Prashanth met him at another

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:05.680
[Guest]: water talk in Habitat and he got him back to office now Arvind had no you

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:12.320
[Guest]: know money neither did I he needed films for his RTI work and other you know

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:19.600
[Guest]: entire I had an editing system and skills he said I can't pay you I said

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:26.080
[Guest]: chalo theek hai seekhi lenge there's another thing that I tell people not

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:29.880
[Guest]: everything need be about money you will learn something you will if you see an

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:32.920
[Guest]: opportunity take it to walk away if you don't think you're learning anything but

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:37.200
[Guest]: it's not always about the money so then I started Rogan Parivartan was like a

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:41.080
[Guest]: 10-man organization men man and women there was you know Santosh was there who

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:47.200
[Guest]: unfortunately died before the first election and then we did a couple of

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.600
[Guest]: campaigns together RTI campaigns and by that time I had started writing

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:54.600
[Guest]: Gustav Khema for NDTV so I had a kind of holdover media I knew people in the

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:57.800
[Guest]: media because many of my former colleagues were at prominent channels

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:03.800
[Guest]: in senior places so we did a campaign on RTI we partnered with like 53 news

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.560
[Guest]: organizations across the country every newspaper and I remember that time so

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:11.320
[Guest]: many people were so forthcoming you could walk into HD I walked into Veer's office

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:14.440
[Guest]: and I was like will you be part of it yeah we'll be part of it and Ram gave me time

01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:18.080
[Guest]: will you be part of it yeah Pranoik you know came on board everyone came on

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:22.720
[Guest]: board yeah every newspaper came on board and then he won the maxis in 2004 or 5

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:26.080
[Guest]: and by then Manisha and I had become good friends and with that money he

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:32.160
[Guest]: found PCRF which then you know once the RTI amendments you know I spent a night

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.920
[Guest]: in Tughlaq Road police station because we were protesting in 2006 against the

01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:40.720
[Guest]: that file notings and stuff they will not be there so that time I got I

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:45.240
[Guest]: learned so much from Aruna Roy, Shekhar Singh, Prashant I saw how these guys

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:50.160
[Guest]: work like I had seen Gulzar work now Gulzar is not a materialistic man he's

01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:52.960
[Guest]: not hungry for fame but he's famous he takes for granted when you go to a

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:57.080
[Guest]: restaurant with him it comes to a standstill so I could get that even the

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:01.200
[Guest]: humblest of people will write because this is who I am with you know from

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:05.080
[Guest]: someone like Madhu you learn you know you have more than enough money you're

01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:11.200
[Guest]: just you know working because it excites you but there's no real

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:15.880
[Guest]: then you meet people like Arvind and Aruna who are not

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:20.120
[Guest]: exactly well to do but they're working like where will this lead to like what

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.840
[Guest]: will happen like how will you where do you see yourself in 10 years if you ask

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:27.400
[Guest]: them like will you still be able to afford a college you know like what the

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:31.040
[Guest]: fuck are you doing then you learn something from people like that so then

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:35.760
[Guest]: he set that up with the Max's award money then of course the whole RTI

01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:40.880
[Guest]: movement like he was like okay RTIs are coming out the whole that sports events

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.320
[Guest]: Kalmadi's event in Delhi what is it called the Commonwealth Games that

01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:48.840
[Guest]: whole yeah RTI say we've taken out the information that each toilet paper

01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:53.720
[Guest]: was bought for 180 rupees per roll which is for like 20 rupees or you know the

01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:56.520
[Guest]: balloon was bought for 13 crore which is only going to use once there was a lot

01:53:56.520 --> 01:54:03.520
[Guest]: of corruption in those but now what there's no prosecution happening so that

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.400
[Guest]: is when his frustration led him to like Jan Lokpal has to be there like just

01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.960
[Guest]: getting the information out is not enough someone has to use our information

01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:14.640
[Guest]: to prosecute these guys and CVC can't do it because CVC will tell suppose you

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:18.560
[Guest]: know whatever department you in the CVC doesn't do an investigation it tells you

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:22.360
[Guest]: to appoint a person to investigate your own department so that's a conviction

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:29.440
[Guest]: rates of corruption are so low so I I learned a lot about the the thinking on

01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:33.120
[Guest]: governance how he had figured out governance at a level where I hadn't

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:36.920

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:23.480
[Guest]: have that conversation but what are they talking about that yeah so I had you

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.880
[Guest]: know I the way Arvind had broken on governance or something that I was like

01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:32.520
[Guest]: okay well and I really liked him and I I found him very sincere and I found his

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:37.560
[Guest]: choices very hard and when he had actually said that we will block the RTI

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:43.280
[Guest]: amendments that's when I realized that this guy has skills which which

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.200
[Guest]: basically are audacity so I still remember we were sitting in Sundar Nagri

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:51.440
[Guest]: that's where the Parivartan office used to be Sundar Nagri is you know slum

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.400
[Guest]: resettlement and he has one little room there he used to work in that slum on

01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:02.800
[Guest]: RTI and stuff it must have been about 2003-2004 it must have been and this

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:07.360
[Guest]: before he got the magsaysay board and he said that Manmohan Singh is oh

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:11.520
[Guest]: yeah it had to be 2004 passed because Manmohan Singh was PM by now they're

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:14.920
[Guest]: gonna be amending the RTI act file noting will be taken out in a certain

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.640
[Guest]: punitive thing he says if they I mean that's the end of the act and it's taken

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.080
[Guest]: us so long there's a lot of lobbying done by you know Aruna and everyone to

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.200
[Guest]: get it through as a national act although it was it existed in Delhi and

01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:29.200
[Guest]: Maharashtra and Rajasthan as a national act of Parliament it only came once the

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:31.800
[Guest]: UPA came in I was like you know Manmohan and his bureaucrats want to kill this

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:39.240
[Guest]: act so I said shit yeah he says we'll block it I was like sorry he says we'll

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:46.440
[Guest]: stop the amendments I said you and like eight of us little lalloos here out of

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:51.480
[Guest]: whom I'm the only one who's a regular source of income even though it's not

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:58.080
[Guest]: great he says why can't we do it? who all do you know? I said I know this one I know

01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.800
[Guest]: that one let's talk to Arunaji let's talk to Prashant let's do this let's

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.760
[Guest]: dude in fucking two months he had blocked the fucking amendments here and

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:14.120
[Guest]: that's when I said dude this guy is fucking insane he will aim for something

01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:19.920
[Guest]: so big which seems impossible but he will work night and day he'll sleep two

01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:22.760
[Guest]: hours he won't go back home he took a little

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:26.960
[Guest]: Kholi in Sundar Nagri he used to live in that slum and I always used to wonder

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:31.720
[Guest]: dude how does your wife like deal with you yeah so I I saw that and I remember

01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:34.880
[Guest]: I had written this in Times of India they had asked me for a column you know

01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:38.520
[Guest]: as just someone as a fellow traveler when he became chief minister for the

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.000
[Guest]: first time he asked me once you want to go for a weekend you want to come I'm

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.760
[Guest]: going to Maharashtra it's a nice hill station Mull I said okay chalo let's see

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:51.880
[Guest]: I'll get we bloody got to Mull he wanted to go there study a lady who had run a

01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:55.240
[Guest]: in Maharashtra she was running a trade union and she had been very effective

01:57:55.240 --> 01:58:00.240
[Guest]: at getting the tribal lands back from mining that had been given so she like

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:04.560
[Guest]: she ran that place like fucking dawn she had of course she wasn't doing anything

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:10.280
[Guest]: bad but she had managed to retrieve land that in no one in the country had been

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.440
[Guest]: able to get back from industrialist so we were bloody and we've got there we

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:18.560
[Guest]: stayed in some guest house so there were rats like roaming around me so once I

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.120
[Guest]: was there I was there I was like dude seriously you've got me for this what

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:26.440
[Guest]: would haha he have you learn because after that I never went anywhere with

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:31.520
[Guest]: him because it was a nightmare two days because okay I may not be you know the

01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:35.240
[Guest]: Prince of Wales but that's what my idea of a holiday dude I can't I can't deal

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:41.000
[Guest]: with that shit so so from him I learned a different skill you know that don't

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:49.760
[Guest]: think that it's too big a task just start doing it you'll get it and I

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:53.040
[Guest]: remember and this is something that many people have I remember I've been on

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:57.000
[Guest]: panels back then because I was in the face of you know PCRF it had three

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.520
[Guest]: trustees Arvind, Manish and me and whenever Anna would say we want to come to Delhi

01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:06.480
[Guest]: I'm like dude who will buy the air ticket money is not money so half the

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:11.120
[Guest]: time getting donations you know because Arvind and Manish were busy either at Ramle

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:14.320
[Guest]: so I was sending the cheques I remember someone telling me this has all been

01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.680
[Guest]: funded by XYZ or so and so I was like really who told you they are senior

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:22.440
[Guest]: journalists what we call senior we know son you don't know anything I

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:28.600
[Guest]: think I signed the fucking cheques and anything goes like like I mean I can

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:33.120
[Guest]: tell you one lot who gave us a lot of support without them was Sri Sri Ravishankar's

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:38.680
[Guest]: team they were resource rich they had a team for wonderful people I really like

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:41.560
[Guest]: them personally I don't agree with a lot of what Sri Sri does and he's become

01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:46.400
[Guest]: very different but all those people were really nice people I mean they were

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.200
[Guest]: really gently sweet you could say some very horrible offensive things to them

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:54.920
[Guest]: that's a no no no we don't agree but they will not hate you for it but other

01:59:54.920 --> 02:00:00.680
[Guest]: than his team there was you know it was not funded by any industrialist or RSS

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:03.600
[Guest]: or anything I remember we used to go around each other collecting money

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:08.640
[Guest]: we used to say we want to go to Maharashtra we have to buy the air ticket

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:12.520
[Guest]: and throughout he was like I don't want to I said you should contest election

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:15.840
[Guest]: because I remember I've been with him in Digvijay Singh's house when we were

02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:19.320
[Guest]: doing an RTI thing because it was internal you know all the yes men of

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:23.640
[Guest]: Manmohan or Sonia wanted to undercut so-and-so so and Arvind had become a

02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:26.920
[Guest]: prominent RT activist he had chances to get anyone would have given a ticket

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.400
[Guest]: yeah he would have won from Sundar Nagri hands down and as you keep saying as a

02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:36.320
[Guest]: disjoint politics if you want such a kida no no no no no this is not what we

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:41.880
[Guest]: do and I remember I said I mean I don't know if I should say this I had a huge

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:47.360
[Guest]: argument with him once that he never used to vote I was like you want to

02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:51.680
[Guest]: change I said this is and I remember and he reasoned it with me is how many RTI's

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:56.360
[Guest]: have you filed in your life I said none is I filed about 500 is your one vote

02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:58.840
[Guest]: every five years more valuable is my involvement in democracy more valuable

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:04.320
[Guest]: holding them accountable says vote vote what to do waste of time now of course he

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:11.080
[Guest]: wants that vote you see but but you know people change they evolve they you know

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:16.880
[Guest]: you agree you disagree but I have by accidents of meeting people and you know

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:22.880
[Guest]: some I knew because of who I knew sometimes I was I've just been able to

02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:27.920
[Guest]: learn from people who have you may like them you may hate them but they have

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:34.000
[Guest]: pulled off shit that is fucking unbelievable and I think for that that's

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.840
[Guest]: a privilege that is pure luck there are people way more talented way smarter way

02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:45.560
[Guest]: more hard-working who just haven't had that love or access so I want to double

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.720
[Amit Varma]: click on a bunch of things here and like after the break we will talk about

02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:52.880
[Amit Varma]: politics of course and we will talk about media which are the two big themes

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.160
[Amit Varma]: I want to talk to you about but before we go into the break like an observation

02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:02.560
[Amit Varma]: and a story and observation is like here you've pointed out what is common to all

02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:06.480
[Amit Varma]: of these guys like you know I've been saying that doesn't matter how big the

02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:10.520
[Amit Varma]: goal is just start doing it or Gulzar sub just writing for four hours every

02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:15.440
[Amit Varma]: day and you know I I've often thought that I meet two kinds of writers you

02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:19.080
[Amit Varma]: know and one kind of writer is someone who's in love with the idea of being a

02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:22.600
[Amit Varma]: writer keep my writer whom I award you Tunga all of those things and the other

02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:25.760
[Amit Varma]: kind of writer just wants to write whether they see themselves as writers

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:31.000
[Amit Varma]: necessarily or not and I've always said that what is important like like one

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.760
[Amit Varma]: thought experiment I kind of unleash on my writing students in my last webinar

02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:39.360
[Amit Varma]: with them is put a hundred people in a room and there are hundred writers right

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:44.020
[Amit Varma]: and they range from excellent writers to good writers to mediocre to bad to up

02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:49.880
[Amit Varma]: India writers whatever you've got the whole spectrum I had to throw that in

02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:54.760
[Amit Varma]: there I knew you'd love so so you have that whole spectrum of writers out there

02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:58.080
[Amit Varma]: and you ask them what their goals are and you won't know the difference

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.840
[Amit Varma]: between them because they'll all have great goals you know in the Donald

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:04.680
[Amit Varma]: Trump's words in all caps I have my goals are the best but you ask them what

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:07.720
[Amit Varma]: their processes are and you will immediately know who are the great

02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:11.360
[Amit Varma]: writers and who are the shit writers because processes matter just that

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.080
[Amit Varma]: notion of Gulzar Saab entering his writing gym every day writing for hours

02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:19.280
[Amit Varma]: every day which means that when he actually gets a specific thing or when

02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:23.240
[Amit Varma]: he's actually writing for a specific goal it is likely to be so so so much

02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:27.400
[Amit Varma]: better than it would otherwise have been which is inspiring another story I want

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:29.960
[Amit Varma]: to throw out there like I agree with everything you said about privilege and

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:33.240
[Amit Varma]: luck you and I neither of us would be sitting here if not for having got

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:37.840
[Amit Varma]: basically won the lottery of life again and again and again right what makes me

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:43.440
[Amit Varma]: really hopeful about these current times is that I see young creators who are

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:48.720
[Amit Varma]: beginning to transcend these barriers of you know privilege and luck and all of

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:53.120
[Amit Varma]: that and one person who's impressed me particularly is have you heard of

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:57.560
[Amit Varma]: Mohammed Salim Khan no okay so Mohammed Salim Khan is known as MSK and he's a

02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.920
[Amit Varma]: vlogger I've been watching a lot of vlogs on YouTube and toying with the

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.200
[Amit Varma]: idea of starting one myself he was born in a village in West Bengal and his

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.360
[Amit Varma]: family kind of came to Mumbai when they were very young and they lived in a

02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:13.240
[Amit Varma]: chawl somewhere extremely poor and he told the story during a talk which I'll

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:17.960
[Amit Varma]: also link but I found I find it very inspiring and the opposite of kind of

02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:22.280
[Amit Varma]: privilege so he's in this chawl in Mumbai with his family and when he's 16

02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:27.000
[Amit Varma]: or 17 I think when he's in his teens he his mother his siblings they go back to

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.200
[Amit Varma]: the village and then they get a phone call saying your father's gone mad so

02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:35.200
[Amit Varma]: literally mad so come back to Bombay so they go back to Mumbai and they find

02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.640
[Amit Varma]: that all the belongings in the house are outside the house in in that chawl and

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:43.520
[Amit Varma]: the father's alone inside the house and he's lost it but they take him for

02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:47.400
[Amit Varma]: treatment and they managed to get him treated and after he's treated his

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:50.440
[Amit Varma]: mother asked his father that you remember we used to have this trunk

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:54.680
[Amit Varma]: where we had saved up everything that we had over 15 years all our savings were

02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:59.240
[Amit Varma]: in there do you remember where the trunk is and he says so I was in an auto and

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:04.160
[Amit Varma]: the guy asked me for change and I didn't have change so I gave him the trunk so

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:10.200
[Amit Varma]: they basically lost everything right and this kid is 15 or 16 MSK and at this

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:14.640
[Amit Varma]: point in time he decides two things he says one I will buy my parents a house

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:18.880
[Amit Varma]: in Bombay and two because he is a young teenager I will have this particular

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:23.000
[Amit Varma]: super bike that I would really like to ride and he does it all and he does it

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.480
[Amit Varma]: all by being a creator in today's economy so he's got a vlog which I link

02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:30.440
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes and again same work ethic working damn hard like one of his

02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:33.800
[Amit Varma]: vlogging ethics is that every day there are days when he's

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:37.560
[Amit Varma]: traveling when he's put out three videos in a day which is not trivial you would

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:42.640
[Amit Varma]: know and is kind of done that so that's inspiring now that's obviously it's

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:47.240
[Amit Varma]: something that's had starting to happen recently privilege and access and those

02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:51.120
[Amit Varma]: things still matter for a hell of a lot these people like us who are visible and

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:55.640
[Amit Varma]: have the kind of chances that we do but I just that's if there is one thing that

02:05:55.640 --> 02:06:00.840
[Amit Varma]: kind of makes me hopeful in these sort of dark times it is that technology is

02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:05.240
[Guest]: empowering people absolutely there's no doubt dude I'm in court against India

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:12.760
[Guest]: today yeah someone who had hired me as a reporter and I remember you know back

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:17.200
[Guest]: then Kali you know would often be in office I mean I guess she was working on

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:23.960
[Guest]: something or the other I mean I am up against a company that I could not even

02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:30.400
[Guest]: think of like if AP would walk in we'd all stand up you know yeah of course and

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:32.760
[Guest]: that's because the internet I don't have to buy a buddy you know three crore

02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:35.880
[Guest]: license have hundred crores to you don't have done a newsroom of course there's

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:41.040
[Guest]: no doubt about that though I still think that what technology has done for

02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:46.760
[Guest]: influencers is good and bad because and this is something one of my favorite

02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:51.760
[Guest]: comedians has said often in his rant that you know you ask any youngsters

02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:57.200
[Guest]: today he was quoting some research that they did in the US some like insane 50

02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:02.160
[Guest]: 60 percent people what do you want to be as a profession an influencer he's like

02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:05.960
[Guest]: dude this generation is fucked if like over half of them want to be influencers

02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:10.920
[Amit Varma]: that is their ambition that is their goal we're done was it Vahal who came up

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:14.440
[Amit Varma]: with that phrase about being famous for being famous

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:18.120
[Amit Varma]: was it I don't know I don't know who came up with it I know I think that is I

02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:21.760
[Guest]: think that was a post-war whole thing I think that was someone observed that

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:25.600
[Guest]: were Kardashians Kardashians as I've been told I remember this from before

02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:28.540
[Amit Varma]: actually famous for being famous but whatever could have been McLuhan also I

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:31.280
[Amit Varma]: don't know so let's take a quick commercial break and on the other side

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:35.920
[Amit Varma]: of the break we shall talk about politics and activism and of course the

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:42.160
[Amit Varma]: media do you want to read more I've put in a lot of work in recent years in

02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:46.680
[Amit Varma]: building a reading habit this means that I read more books but I also read more

02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:50.280
[Amit Varma]: long-form articles and essays there's a world of knowledge available through the

02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:54.760
[Amit Varma]: internet but the problem we all face is how do we navigate this knowledge how do

02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:58.880
[Amit Varma]: we know what to read how do we put the right incentives in place well I

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:02.320
[Amit Varma]: discovered one way a couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:07.440
[Amit Varma]: CTQ compounds at CTQ compounds comm which aims to help people up level

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:11.240

[Amit Varma]: programs called the daily reader every day for six months they sent me a long

02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:19.400
[Amit Varma]: form article to read the subjects covered went from machine learning to

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:23.480
[Amit Varma]: mythology to mental models and marmalade this helped me build a habit of reading

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:27.680
[Amit Varma]: at the end of every day I understood the world a little better than I did before

02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:32.440

02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:13.840
[Amit Varma]: welcome back to the scene in the unseen I'm chatting with Avinanthan Sekri about

02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:19.640
[Amit Varma]: about a lot of things so let's I'm also I'm very curious about the activism bit

02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:24.240
[Amit Varma]: because it seems at one level to be fueled by an idealism that one doesn't

02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:29.160
[Amit Varma]: always expect from journalists say or people who are you know in the media and

02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:33.800
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth and before we get to the activism per se I'm curious about

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:39.080
[Amit Varma]: your conception of journalism like in a sense you said you were an accidental

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:43.120
[Amit Varma]: journalist you joined news track at at what point do you actually start

02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:48.080
[Amit Varma]: thinking about what is journalism what is its purpose are there any higher

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:52.040
[Amit Varma]: ideals involved I mean obviously working with people like the people you worked

02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:56.760
[Amit Varma]: with may have you know makes a difference to that but how do you kind

02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.000
[Amit Varma]: of formulate what what is good journalism what is bad journalism and

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.680
[Amit Varma]: where is this good journalism and bad journalism to be defined apart from the

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:11.160
[Guest]: craft see I often say that I don't call myself a journalist I have often

02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:14.880
[Guest]: corrected people at you know events I'm introduced as you know so I'm not a

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:19.640
[Guest]: journalist call me a news professional or an entrepreneur because the word

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:25.920
[Guest]: journalist suggests reporting for me that's important and I haven't done any

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:29.640
[Guest]: reporting in years and years I mean I may have done one story for news laundry

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:34.480
[Guest]: which was more just googling figuring out putting two and two together and

02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:40.800
[Guest]: writing you know a piece on that when I was a news track I did some journalism

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:46.040
[Guest]: yes during election you were expected to do get some do some reading up ask

02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:52.560
[Guest]: questions you know put some kind of story together we did a series in the

02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:57.640
[Guest]: run-up to I think there was an election 97 was there an election 97 or 96 I mean

02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:03.880
[Guest]: run up to that election we did a series in partnership with BBC where I think

02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:08.600
[Guest]: of the BBC her name was Nisha Pillay or Nina Nisha Pillay she had come down the

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:10.880
[Guest]: producer that come down sooner putting that together I was part of the

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:15.000
[Guest]: production team although I've heard in reporters role but because I could go

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.500
[Guest]: nights I was always said okay you put this together so I was involved in the

02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:24.880
[Guest]: production of that so for me good journalism should have the following it

02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:31.960
[Guest]: it but this is a list of things that it should have it could have more a the

02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:38.960
[Guest]: facts must be vetted and accurate to there must be a context to the story it

02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:42.800
[Guest]: cannot be a standalone story they must you must lay the world that the story

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:46.960
[Guest]: exists in and this is as far as the information that you're giving to the

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:54.400
[Guest]: audience is concerned you must put as many sides of the story of the facts I'm

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:58.680
[Guest]: not saying it has to be a monkey balancing but you can't say that this

02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:02.080
[Guest]: one is corrupt you have to have and this is something that we've you know a lot

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:06.360
[Guest]: of activist organizations have wanted to partner with News Laundry to do reports

02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:10.800
[Guest]: and I know they mean well but they send us a report a video report where five

02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.160
[Guest]: people have accused the SDM of corruption as have you asked the SDM no

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.800
[Guest]: have you sent an email no can you only day after tomorrow because it's so far

02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:23.440
[Guest]: from village you know like there's a lot of organization grassroots organization

02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:28.080
[Guest]: and there you know correspondents are just the village folk they can't go 40

02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:33.800
[Guest]: kilometers tomorrow to get a bite yeah they forgo a day's salary now and I

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:39.080
[Guest]: really want to work with them but journalistically that is not a story I

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:43.040
[Guest]: can put out no matter how much I agree with them and their cause because you

02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:48.960
[Guest]: got to ask the guy are there any other sides to it to it has to be relevant you

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:54.440
[Guest]: know to the the choice of story has to be and has to be some purposes choice of

02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:58.920
[Guest]: economy by could be I mean it may have these things but it's not it's not so

02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:04.400
[Guest]: that is good journalism but most importantly when do you stove story

02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:10.680
[Guest]: about what now if today someone is to ask me is the story of road being

02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:17.760
[Guest]: blocked in Mahim Junction Mahim Bombay because of the Mars a story or not yeah

02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:22.960
[Guest]: it's a story is it the story that I should today no and it is not because

02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:28.040
[Guest]: you want to hide one thing it is the story on Kalmadi's corruption let's say

02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:30.960
[Guest]: I get one more you know Kalmadi corruption has been done but so you get

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:36.400
[Guest]: one more angle give a heavy water man I got he kept but it is journalism but

02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:42.120
[Guest]: it's not good journalism is that relevant today your journalist when you

02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:46.880
[Guest]: say it's the first draft of history vallage of cliche hair the way it has to

02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:51.880
[Guest]: be relevant for today now and it has to be fueled by a sense of wanting to make

02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:59.080
[Guest]: things better that has to be the purpose now that why someone does something is

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:05.000
[Guest]: going to be very vague and very broad and very but for me when I'm hiring

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.680
[Guest]: for news laundry and I'm not saying there's no room for that other kind of

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:13.880
[Guest]: journalism I just do it because I'm good at it I'm smart I have access to so-and-so

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:19.640
[Guest]: but then maybe news on is not the place for you because what I consider good

02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:24.080
[Guest]: journalism is you are doing it from a sense of curiosity because you want to

02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:30.840
[Guest]: make things better and that is to me more or less what what good journalism

02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:36.280
[Guest]: should should have can have other stuff but it should have these things so you

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.040
[Amit Varma]: know we come to politics later because now that we started talking about

02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:43.040
[Amit Varma]: journalism and I thought we'll go from sort of where that idealism developed to

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.800
[Amit Varma]: activism and that seemed like a natural segue but let's talk about the media for

02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:51.000
[Amit Varma]: a while and we'll come back to politics it and I'll push back mildly on a couple

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.920
[Amit Varma]: of these things because I think this conception of journalism that you kind

02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.460
[Amit Varma]: of spoke about is relatively recent you could even say that it started say with

02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Walter Lippmann's book public opinion in I think 1910 1911 and all of that and

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:07.800
[Amit Varma]: gradually evolved over a period of time from there and I'm not saying that any

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:11.280
[Amit Varma]: of these are wrong I'm just saying that there are added shades I'd like to kind

02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:15.440
[Amit Varma]: of talk about for example one way in which the media certainly changed say

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:19.680
[Amit Varma]: from when you would have started with news tractor today is that back then

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:23.360
[Amit Varma]: there was a broad consensus on the truth there was something called mainstream

02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:26.960
[Amit Varma]: media which was basically mainstream which was all of all of the game there

02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:31.200
[Amit Varma]: was a broad consensus on the truth you know there might have been slight

02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:34.840
[Amit Varma]: ideological shades here and there with different major publications you know

02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:38.240
[Amit Varma]: the Hindu will be a little left and so on but in general there was a broad

02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:43.560
[Amit Varma]: consensus kidney I see hair and that's because very few people really had the

02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.120
[Amit Varma]: tools of publishing the tools of distribution all of those things now

02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:51.360
[Amit Varma]: what's happened over the last few decades is that that has kind of

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.640
[Amit Varma]: obviously by now changed completely and everything is dispersed and of course

02:15:55.640 --> 02:16:00.040
[Amit Varma]: there are good and bad sides to that the good part obviously is that everyone is

02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:04.360
[Amit Varma]: kind of empowered and anyone can you know add their voice to that mix like

02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:07.800
[Amit Varma]: indeed news laundry have done and you're fighting India today and and the bad

02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.840
[Amit Varma]: part of course is that everything seems to be a narrative battle today there are

02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:15.800
[Amit Varma]: people for whom reality just doesn't matter it's you know you build your

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:19.480
[Amit Varma]: narrative of the world you choose your tribe and whatever fits that works for

02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:24.080
[Amit Varma]: you and that's a story you want to hear so I might consider news laundry to be a

02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:28.120
[Amit Varma]: journalistic outlet and of India to be not a journalistic outlet but in a sense

02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:32.360
[Amit Varma]: they are fulfilling similar functions at opposite ends where people have similar

02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:34.960
[Amit Varma]: views of the world and you might be feeding that view of the world with

02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:38.840
[Amit Varma]: facts and figures and all of that my broader question was that you know when

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:42.240
[Amit Varma]: you speak about you've been sent a story from a village and your point is key

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:46.160
[Amit Varma]: listen you haven't done the rigor you know you haven't gone to the SDM and

02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:50.520
[Amit Varma]: asked him what he thinks of the allegations and the way I look at it is

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:55.920
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to sort of information there are many parts to the puzzle you

02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:58.840
[Amit Varma]: want to put together as complete a picture as you can but you'll never get

02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:03.400
[Amit Varma]: the whole picture yeah and then there are other people who cannot put together

02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:07.440
[Amit Varma]: as complete a picture as you but as long as they give some parts of the picture I

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:11.240
[Amit Varma]: actually think that is legit and I don't even know whether I'd call it journalism

02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:14.680
[Amit Varma]: it's not journalism but it is still legit and to think of the term

02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:20.440
[Amit Varma]: journalism as a monolithic thing so I'm kind of rambling and thinking aloud but

02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:25.200
[Amit Varma]: I'm saying that like one of the things that I have learned at our age is that

02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:28.640
[Amit Varma]: you know there are many things I used to think of in a particular way

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:32.880
[Amit Varma]: conceptually and I've realized that I need to rethink them I need to rethink

02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:36.440
[Amit Varma]: what this means I need to rethink what a book is does a book have to be a

02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:40.320
[Amit Varma]: hundred thousand words like earlier in the 90s were restricted by the formats

02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:43.920
[Amit Varma]: an article is 800 words a book is a hundred thousand you know a Hollywood

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:48.440
[Amit Varma]: film is 90 minutes a Bollywood film is three hours and over time I've realized

02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:52.760
[Amit Varma]: that especially in the modern age these concepts have kind of broken down down

02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:57.680
[Amit Varma]: for me and similarly when we define journalism in a kind of a rigid way and

02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:00.800
[Amit Varma]: I understand that you're defining it in this particular way because there's a

02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:03.920
[Amit Varma]: certain kind of rigor you want and you've defined that as news laundry's

02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.080
[Amit Varma]: mission and that's great and that's as it should be but I think that there has

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:13.760
[Amit Varma]: to be space for all of this stuff to also go on so I I don't disagree with

02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:19.760
[Guest]: you I think that that is also journalism and a kind of journalism that fulfills a

02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:25.240
[Guest]: certain I mean yeah I I'm not overwhelmingly in agreement but I'm not

02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:29.240
[Guest]: in disagreement either I think it's an interesting thought I think there's

02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:33.360
[Guest]: space for that thought to be entertained and maybe explored and investigated and

02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:37.640
[Guest]: see what emerges but yeah it seems like a rational position to have what I

02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:41.000
[Guest]: disagree with you is that Open India and News Laundry are two sides of a coin

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:46.600
[Guest]: Open India has no ground reporting they have outright fabricated lies I don't by

02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:49.440
[Amit Varma]: the way just to clarify I don't mean two sides of the same coin in a

02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:53.440
[Guest]: journalistic sense because they're not journalists yeah I mean in a narrative

02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:58.400
[Guest]: sense yeah so so we our bedrock is ground reports now that ground report

02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:03.680
[Guest]: could lead anywhere yeah and I will tell you most see since I may be the face of

02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:11.240
[Guest]: News Laundry and I'm identified as liberal our reporters are not

02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:16.120
[Guest]: ideologically as committed as you might think a many of them are not

02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:19.520
[Guest]: ideologically which is why I like them they they do not think this side is

02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:22.440
[Guest]: right or that side is right because a they're young so they still have that

02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:30.160
[Guest]: doubt and I have some fantastic talented people be we go with this is what is on

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:34.760
[Guest]: the ground now one may choose to say that we are exploring stories that tend

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:38.520
[Guest]: to be more against the BJP therefore subscribe to the liberal narrative but

02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:43.280
[Guest]: that is because the BJP is in power and in 2012 when we started the Congress is

02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.840
[Guest]: a punching bag and anyone can go to 2012 and see that stuff but what we do is

02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:52.080
[Guest]: reportage it is journalism what Open India does is not journalism so I mean

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:55.720
[Guest]: and I don't want to give them any more you know time or mentions because I

02:19:55.720 --> 02:20:03.520
[Guest]: think it's a really wild gutter level thing and just because you know that has

02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:07.760
[Guest]: a certain audience is that is not enough for me to take someone like that

02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:12.720
[Guest]: seriously from a perspective of the craft from perspective of society DK

02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:15.040
[Guest]: just like it's important to take an Arnab seriously it's important to take

02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:17.760
[Guest]: you know measles seriously it's important to take Covid seriously it's

02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:23.360
[Guest]: important to take Open India seriously as a disease which needs to be addressed but

02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:27.560
[Guest]: if you're talking about the craft that is that you know that space so that is

02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:32.400
[Guest]: one important thing and I think the whole my my entire flirtation of the

02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:39.840
[Guest]: activism happened because of my deep sense of injustice that always bothered

02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:49.200
[Guest]: me and it irritated me at many levels and I think that is why I saw in Arvind

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:57.120
[Guest]: someone who I liked I think you know this guy is taking on someone who needs

02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:01.960
[Guest]: to be taken on you know for a while I voted Mayawati now I was at that time

02:21:01.960 --> 02:21:05.920
[Guest]: you know it was at which election was this when I mean of course she didn't

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:10.440
[Guest]: win a single seat in Delhi but what pissed me off was that friends of mine

02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:14.120
[Guest]: and you know the good friends we'd be you know at dinners and parties and you

02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:18.240
[Guest]: know the Delhi scene and you belong to a certain privilege set and so you have

02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:23.040
[Guest]: active social life you know BJP wasn't fashionable then she got Congress

02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:28.240
[Guest]: Kodenge vote ya yeh karenge woh karenge theek hai thoda kuch BJP ko de denge kuch it

02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:31.480
[Guest]: wasn't as polarised as it is now but when I'd say I'm a Mayawati ki party

02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:37.840
[Guest]: you know they'd be like they'd be pin drop silence hain? why Mayawati? I was like why

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:40.640
[Guest]: not you know how corrupt she is? I was like do you know how corrupt really many of your

02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:44.040
[Guest]: Congress leaders are? just cause they're DOSCOS it's fine kyu kaiyon ke bete

02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:51.480
[Guest]: hamara saathi bete hoti hoti and what I realised was Mayawati's corruption was a

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:55.600
[Guest]: special kind of corruption that needed to be pointed out while others was not

02:21:55.600 --> 02:22:00.320
[Guest]: so it wasn't about corruption it was about belonging to so I think it may

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:04.240
[Guest]: stem from and I'm just maybe dissecting myself although I haven't really done

02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:09.000
[Guest]: any major introspection and seen where this comes from maybe it was that you

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:16.800
[Guest]: know in the privileged set I was not as privileged as the privileged so you know that thing that

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:23.600
[Guest]: fucking you know always root for the underdog whether it was just that I grew

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:26.640
[Guest]: up with you know a set of parents who I didn't see them do anything wrong in

02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:31.400
[Guest]: their lives like fucking nothing like like sometime a dude kuch toh kar lete hain

02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:37.920
[Guest]: koi bungla bungla chhod de like nothing you know get screwed over by people who

02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:46.480
[Guest]: were corrupt and you know dicks maybe it was that but that is why I think like

02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:49.640
[Guest]: there was no reason for us to start newslaundry small stream was doing very

02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:56.920
[Guest]: well like we had like I said shows ads you're doing everything man

02:22:56.920 --> 02:23:02.800
[Guest]: sarkari programs private programs award-winning ads we were the game in

02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:08.840
[Guest]: town but keeda tha newslaundry chalu karna and I remember my partner saying it

02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:15.200
[Guest]: yeah dude fine you had your little fun don't fucking fuck up the climb I mean

02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:19.520
[Guest]: now you're gonna go separate we need to put so much more money in it VC funding

02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:22.800
[Guest]: will come in we need to separate offices we need to compliance you do all this

02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:27.680
[Guest]: fuck it let's just make travel shows food shows and make money and you know

02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:35.440
[Guest]: but I see I mean when I get up every morning I get up fucking excited yeah

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:39.440
[Guest]: I'm trying to get to office let's fucking pick another fight today let's

02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:46.160
[Guest]: do this and that is very addictive for me I don't care today I don't care if I

02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:51.440
[Guest]: am driving into my friend's farmhouse in in any case which I think is a very

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:54.560
[Guest]: luxurious body which cost 15 like where everybody's bodies are one crore and

02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:58.640
[Guest]: above I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck I'm wearing track pants or chappals

02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:03.320
[Guest]: but when I wake up every morning I am excited I am saying let's pick a fight

02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:08.840
[Guest]: today and that to me was something that attracted me to Arvind that's something

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:13.840
[Guest]: that attracted me to Madhu so yeah I think that is the basic keeda and as

02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:18.160
[Guest]: long as that keeda is there I guess I'll be excited by what I do I mean I loved

02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:21.280
[Guest]: by the way I mean we have we probably won't discuss it because it's not of an

02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:27.920
[Guest]: interest to you shooting high on a plate was a magical experience like seven

02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:31.520
[Guest]: years to travel across this country by road like how many people do you know

02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:40.400
[Guest]: who can say I have traveled to every state in this country a be by road over

02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:43.560
[Guest]: seven years with you know three of my closest friends

02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:49.520
[Guest]: Rokey, Mir, Prashant like fucking in a car lade, jhagde, fucking tore each other's eye

02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:53.520
[Guest]: because you know the road buddy when you drive from Delhi to Kolkata Kolkata to

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:57.320
[Guest]: bloody Arunachal Nagaland you know you're gonna get on each other's nerves

02:24:57.320 --> 02:25:03.720
[Guest]: also yeah but man what what one learns about patience about restraint about not

02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:08.320
[Guest]: holding grudges about letting it fly when you have to about a fight is not

02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:14.160
[Guest]: the end of the world it is it is just something you deal with and move on okay

02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:17.560
[Amit Varma]: so I am going to defy your expectations and talk a bit more about that but in a

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:21.840
[Amit Varma]: bit just to kind of continue with the thought and first of all when you were

02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:24.760
[Amit Varma]: musing about you know why did I support Mayawati was it because I was less

02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:29.040
[Amit Varma]: privileged than them I think sometimes your privilege is not always a causation

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:33.720
[Amit Varma]: for the way you behave I think you know people can have opinions independent of

02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:38.120
[Amit Varma]: where they come from though obviously those do play a part so here's my

02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:43.320
[Amit Varma]: question we often talk about journalism as having the sacred ground that these

02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:46.560
[Amit Varma]: are the values and you've named you know you named some values of the craft that

02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:50.400
[Amit Varma]: this is a rigor you should show but you know we'll often all those cliches will

02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:53.600
[Amit Varma]: come up about how you come for the afflicted of like the comfortable and

02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:57.200
[Amit Varma]: all of that which mean a lot to me as well and at the same time it's a

02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:01.080
[Amit Varma]: business so key you know a publisher will tell you keep a man charity

02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:05.200
[Amit Varma]: nickel row I have you know profit banana and that is my Dharma and I get that

02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.600
[Amit Varma]: completely that is completely rational now one way of looking at it and I

02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:13.600
[Amit Varma]: strongly feel that it is true is that even for the kind of news that you do

02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:18.360
[Amit Varma]: and what journalism should be that there is a market that market will pay and

02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:21.800
[Amit Varma]: we'll come to that later about how you know the implications of that model and

02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:26.120
[Amit Varma]: how I believe it can work and I think it's working for you to some extent but

02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:30.840
[Amit Varma]: here's a thought experiment supposing that market was not there supposing the

02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:35.480
[Amit Varma]: whole country was full of people who don't care about that kind of journalism

02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:40.040
[Amit Varma]: they just want narratives and by the way I'm I have to say again I'm sorry it

02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:44.440
[Amit Varma]: seems like it almost seems like you know I implied an equivalence between you

02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:48.080
[Amit Varma]: guys and Op India I was just speaking in the narrative sense you know what I

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:51.880
[Amit Varma]: think about them so in the thought experiment that there is no market at

02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:54.720
[Amit Varma]: all for this and I don't believe that to be the case I am hopeful that there is a

02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:59.360
[Amit Varma]: market for the kind of work you do but assuming that there is no market for it

02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:03.640
[Amit Varma]: at all my sense is that you would do it anyway that there are people who would

02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:07.120
[Amit Varma]: do it anyway there would be a handful of people but they'd get the job done

02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:12.960
[Amit Varma]: anyway yes which makes it a little bit like an idealistic project you know it's

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:17.600
[Amit Varma]: like saying that this is my dharma to do this and I will do this and even if

02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:21.400
[Amit Varma]: there's no one reading it and no one wanting it I still kind of have to do it

02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:27.200
[Amit Varma]: how much do you see yourself therefore as fundamentally an activist even now

02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:31.200
[Amit Varma]: like I kind of in my mind when I was thinking about it I broke it up into two

02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:35.680
[Amit Varma]: that was activism here and these are the things we'll talk about us come media

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:39.120
[Amit Varma]: ke baare me these are the things we'll talk about but during this conversation

02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:42.800
[Amit Varma]: it strikes me that they're actually the same thing that you are an activist for

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:47.280
[Guest]: a you know what is what is your sense of this now you know this term activist is

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:52.560
[Guest]: something that I never described myself as until I was described as one in one

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.520
[Guest]: of these talk shows activists then Lokpal no motor like today I'm not an

02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:03.000
[Guest]: activist I'm a film producer I mean a TV show producer a filmmaker document

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:08.080
[Guest]: filmmaker I'm not an activist because for me it was never a full-time thing it

02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:11.920
[Guest]: was something like for example when we did the first you know Dharna against

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:18.160
[Guest]: amendments I had worked with Meghna on a film Filhal and that time the hero that

02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:21.160
[Guest]: was Palash Sen he's a lead singer of Euphoria so I've become friends with

02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:26.240
[Guest]: Palash at that time so I told Arnab I know Palash this Palash ko bol aake gayega

02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:30.920
[Guest]: woh yahan saari college wale aa jayenge toh Palash came with Euphoria and he

02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:36.200
[Guest]: sang ki freedom and you know this charging up everybody and he didn't know

02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:40.680
[Guest]: head or tail about RTI he came because Niku bol raha hai dost hai thekh bol raha

02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:45.080
[Guest]: hoga honest banda hai pahun jaata hoon I remember he said hila do yahan se door nahi

02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:49.000
[Guest]: hai parliament house hila do wahan ki sun rahi hai Sonia Gandhi and we had to

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:52.440
[Guest]: calm down we are not like picking a fight with Sonia Gandhi right now because

02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:56.160
[Guest]: she's the only hope of RTI because when one was killing it she was trying to so

02:28:56.160 --> 02:29:02.000
[Guest]: so is is Palash an activist my assumption this is I think where it

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:07.000
[Guest]: comes from while growing up my assumption was and it hasn't changed

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:14.720
[Guest]: that much that's in my expectation and I know it's doesn't pan out usually but we

02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:20.560
[Guest]: all should do whatever we can in our own way to make things better like the

02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:24.960
[Guest]: chartered accountant of PCRF and was chartered accountants nightmare because

02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:27.440
[Guest]: you know we would get some grant from something from something and because the

02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:31.760
[Guest]: government are always scrutinizing you he was working for us for free you know

02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:36.480
[Guest]: if anyone need to be represented God Prashant ji was doing it for free you

02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:41.120
[Guest]: know Prashant Bhushan comes from a religious family but there are others so

02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:44.920
[Guest]: whenever you say he's an activist so I would always think and I've thought this

02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.440
[Guest]: through this is not I'm just nothing allowed because I've this question I've

02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:52.440
[Guest]: thought it through I don't see myself as an activist I don't see Prashant as an

02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:56.360
[Guest]: activist I don't see Aruna as an activist I don't see Nikhil Dey as an

02:29:56.360 --> 02:30:03.320
[Guest]: activist I see them as doing something that they enjoy while holding the system

02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:09.600
[Guest]: that should make that possible to be honestly done accountable and in making

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:13.920
[Guest]: it accountable it is taking a disproportionate time for them to do

02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:18.320
[Guest]: that rather than what is Arunaji's mission to run Barefoot College to run a

02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:24.600
[Guest]: basically place where people who don't have money can have skills have access

02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:31.560
[Guest]: do stuff to become empowered financially better off than they are now in so doing

02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:36.280
[Guest]: bloody she has to do RTH what do I want to do I want to create a reader funded

02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:42.760
[Guest]: news platform that takes no ads I don't want to be fighting Kalipuri in court I

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:46.640
[Guest]: don't be fighting bloody Time's up in court but I am fighting both of them I

02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:50.920
[Guest]: don't want to be fighting Sakal in court but I'm doing that I don't want to be

02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:55.920
[Guest]: dealing with IT raids in my office but I'm dealing with that and coming at 11

02:30:55.920 --> 02:30:58.480
[Guest]: 13 already keeping me there sitting of one o'clock answering questions which

02:30:58.480 --> 02:31:04.040
[Guest]: have no head or tail so does that make me an activist no I want to do my job

02:31:04.040 --> 02:31:10.000
[Guest]: which excites me if you get in the way I will fight you and I think that is what

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:15.000
[Guest]: Prashant does that is what Arvind used to do that is what Arunaji does that is

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:19.360
[Guest]: what Nikhil does that is what you know I guessing everyone who calls himself

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:25.760
[Guest]: activists do they are doing what they think is you know excites them gives

02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:28.360
[Guest]: them satisfaction and gives them two meals a day or whatever their

02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:33.440
[Guest]: aspirations are and if you get in the way we will fight you in a certain way

02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:37.440
[Amit Varma]: for some people activist has almost become a bad word but I was just kind of

02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:40.960
[Amit Varma]: thinking in a different kind of semantic sense and thinking maybe even your

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:44.120

02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:08.080
[Guest]: convincing them 10 at a time 12 at a time 15 at a time I'll probably

02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:15.480
[Guest]: in fact for your readers will give a discount and reveal figure something out

02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:20.640
[Guest]: right now but see I mean whatever I have done I have done by instinct and that is

02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:25.920
[Guest]: when also I started working news track I had just I had just taken my final year

02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:30.560

[Guest]: something Oxford I'll be my editor Maharaj is in Oxford on something so I've

02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:51.640
[Guest]: done things by instinct like when I quit our stuck me and Prashant had no idea

02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:54.520
[Guest]: what the fuck we're gonna do and like I said that self-doubt even when you turn

02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:59.640
[Guest]: on the TV and complete laddus are sitting and reading the news and you're

02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:03.920
[Guest]: holding your head this guy is like there and we are pretty struggling like

02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:08.600
[Guest]: Sutya's fucking late night going to railway stations getting a tape shooting

02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:12.560
[Guest]: ourselves editing and I can shoot I can edit I can wrangle cable which is I've

02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.480
[Guest]: done I have I have never been ashamed to take a job whether it was to pick up tea

02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:20.920
[Guest]: or wrangle cable and I remember Naseer sir was such a gentleman when we

02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:24.600
[Guest]: were on the set of Monsoon Wedding and a lot of the kids there who are working

02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:29.480
[Guest]: with friends of Meera's friends kids or you know other privileged kids the very

02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:33.800
[Guest]: few kids who were really you know assistant material most of them were

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:40.640
[Guest]: rich kids having a nice September you know Meera's shooting a film so you know

02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:43.480
[Guest]: the cast came in the most well-known costume was Naseer and they said

02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:47.160
[Guest]: they are Nimbu Pani Lani so you had spot boys that spot boys hadn't come very early in

02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:51.640
[Guest]: the morning so I had no problem getting picking up Nimbu Pani Lani and Naseer

02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:58.400
[Guest]: sir said Nikhil don't do this I said no I'm okay he says no you don't have to

02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:01.800
[Guest]: serve us tea and coffee on a tray you're not a spot boy I said I don't fucking

02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:07.600
[Guest]: care let's just get the shit done so like wrangling cable I was 24 at that

02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:11.760
[Guest]: time some of the other productions are 21 22 and a small scene had been set up

02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:15.560
[Guest]: Chadar had been made and I'd had won an award in San Francisco and I was

02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:23.600
[Guest]: wrangling cable I don't have a problem with it I've never been shy to work so

02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:28.800
[Guest]: so that Keeda is what you know like I said you know everyone said it's a shit

02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:33.960
[Guest]: idea so everything is by instinct I've when we quick news track let's do

02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:37.840
[Guest]: something we'll do a travel show okay one document is done now what we'll

02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:43.120
[Guest]: wait Salah who on a high when I played so actually a lot of people are very

02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:49.400
[Guest]: surprised when they know me otherwise that you know my my rational approach to

02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:53.920
[Guest]: life I believe in God and I pray every day and that is something a lot of

02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:59.160
[Guest]: people who know me can't this is like seriously like what the fuck like you

02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:05.240
[Guest]: who's rational who's scientific who has a evidence-based approach because the

02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:13.640
[Guest]: things that have happened to me are just there has to be some other like in 2000

02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:19.200
[Guest]: 99 you're quitting a job saying that we'll make travel shows when there is no

02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:23.520
[Guest]: fucking market for travel shows it doesn't exist there are four channels

02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:29.640
[Guest]: cable TV has just come in there used to be only one when you started three years

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:32.560
[Guest]: later you have the fucking biggest travel show in the country like what

02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:36.720
[Guest]: explains that we'll do newslaundry friends tell you no to the body got on

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:42.280
[Guest]: a company to body got could go to the body got jail ponchaga we are sufficient

02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:46.080
[Guest]: self-sufficient we don't need anyone's fucking funding we have subscribers what

02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:52.920
[Guest]: explains that so I have a deep faith in a higher being that is watching over now

02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:55.200
[Guest]: if you ask me why the fuck is he letting other stuff I I'm sorry I don't know

02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:01.480
[Guest]: those answers but someone has been very good to me and I can't explain why so

02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:05.360
[Amit Varma]: I'll link a column in the show notes are written just about how we underestimate

02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:08.720
[Amit Varma]: luck in the sense that just the fact that we are born at all is really a few

02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:12.160
[Amit Varma]: trillion to one and I actually tried to calculate the numbers and all of that so

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.520
[Amit Varma]: you'd imagine that it's just incredibly unlikely that we should even exist but

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:20.720
[Amit Varma]: the point is it is inevitable that some things will exist similarly it is

02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:24.080
[Amit Varma]: inevitable that some people will get very lucky like even I feel I got

02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:27.800
[Amit Varma]: extremely lucky in the sense for five years ago if I was to were to pitch to

02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:31.920
[Amit Varma]: anyone key are made Chargante key podcast karunga Chargante logo say audio

02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:35.520
[Amit Varma]: may bad karunga I would have been kicked out the room right but luckily in these

02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:40.000
[Amit Varma]: times I could just do it and it it can work so I think some people inevitably

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.560
[Amit Varma]: get lucky so I don't think that's necessarily evidence of a higher force

02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:46.560
[Amit Varma]: in fact mathematics indicates that there will be some people who are extremely

02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:50.200
[Amit Varma]: lucky and it just happens to be you and me sitting here but regardless of that

02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:52.600
[Amit Varma]: and I'll kind of get back to that and by the way monsoon wedding I would have

02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:56.600
[Amit Varma]: carried cables for that as well because that's one of my two favorite Indian

02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:00.480
[Amit Varma]: films of that decade along with Luck by chance I think they're just both

02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:06.160
[Guest]: incredible and the stories I have from that set I just just magical that that

02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:12.240
[Guest]: funny inspiring ridiculous everything it was it was an insane that the film got

02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:16.480
[Amit Varma]: made as a matter of miracle yeah so you know monsoon wedding being such a dear

02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:21.080
[Amit Varma]: film to me I'd love to hear your stories from there go ahead

02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:27.920
[Guest]: so Randeep Hooda's hand broken was not part of the script but he had fractured

02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:33.840
[Guest]: his hand so I had to be woven into the script that was but you know now this is

02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:39.520
[Guest]: the the cultural kind of you know friction that happens and it's not

02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:44.720
[Guest]: always sexism but it's okay you tell me what you make out what what will you

02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:49.040
[Guest]: call this now the camera department the cameraman was Declan Quinn he had shot

02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:51.520

02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:55.080
[Guest]: so thrilled ki bhai I'm carrying the camera because he was in his like late

02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:59.400
[Guest]: 50s at the time and it was you know he's in monsoon when he saw on the shoulder so

02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:03.640
[Guest]: I was wrangling cable with him and as soon as Meera called cut I was to take

02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:08.280

02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:12.680
[Guest]: how to change the film role etc so that because it's you know it's hard on the

02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:17.560
[Guest]: shoulder so you know long shots when you're when Rhea was I think Vasundhara's

02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:21.120

[Guest]: make sure doesn't trip over and he's he wasn't a young man at the time so now

02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:30.440
[Guest]: the entire camera department was you know there was this one young girl and

02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:33.720

[Guest]: shoot don't come dressed like this because we were in charge of security

02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:06.400
[Guest]: and it wasn't you know now of course it is very scary things are for security

02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:10.200
[Guest]: but that time it was I mean it's not like we had like bouncers and all it was

02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:21.080
[Guest]: first shoot was done at Jamali Kamali in one of those old tombs now in Delhi to

02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:25.200

02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:07.520
[Guest]: stage I was physically holding a cop back from moving to the scene and he

[Guest]: this shot go to wardrobe put on a pair of shadi clothes and come stand in the

02:43:45.560 --> 02:43:49.200
[Guest]: crowd as guests so all those guests of Madhu's you know that old lady dancing

02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:53.400
[Guest]: that's sorry Meera's mother there's a couple there they're friends of her

02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:57.200
[Guest]: some defense colony so of course all of us who could be spared for like five

02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:02.560
[Guest]: minute shots went wore shadi clothes from the wardrobe came and started

02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:06.720
[Guest]: ordering Bacardi and started doing stuff like that so now I freeze that scene

02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:13.280
[Guest]: where you know Alia's father you know the young girl who Alia her father which

02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:19.520
[Guest]: is played by Vohra Rahul Vohra he's you know at the bar talking to someone so

02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:22.920
[Guest]: I'm at the back ordering a one Bacardi coke please that was my line and then

02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:26.960
[Guest]: you're trying to sip as long as you can hoping that retake per retake ho so that

02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:30.160
[Guest]: we get a breather because otherwise it was hard work even sipping so much

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:36.440
[Guest]: Bacardi it was it was a trip man it was just a wonderful wonderful experience I

02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:41.440
[Amit Varma]: learned so much on that set I'm also curious about you know this is media but

02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:44.480
[Amit Varma]: at the same time it seems very different from everything else that you're doing

02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:47.920
[Amit Varma]: did you want to be a filmmaker I mean I know you've made many documentaries and

02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:51.960
[Amit Varma]: done a lot of that but did you also at some point say that okay I these are the

02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.400
[Guest]: kind of movies I want to make and I have four scripts written and sitting at my

02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:04.600
[Guest]: table for the last nine ten years I wrote my first script in 2002 when I was

02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:10.360
[Guest]: working on Filhaal with Meghna because I just found the whole experience of

02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.880
[Guest]: filmmaking so bizarre where most of our time is to be spent waiting for either

02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:20.440
[Guest]: Sushmita or some star to show up I was like dude on Monsoon Running and that is

02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:24.600
[Guest]: when I disagreed a lot with people that oh Bombay is very professional Delhi's

02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:27.640
[Guest]: not professional Bombay Delhi's are professional I was like dude I've just

02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:31.600
[Guest]: come from a set in Delhi where we shot a film in 26 days and I was a foreign

02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:34.680
[Amit Varma]: crew there this is completely different I was like dude here I'm spending four

02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:39.560
[Guest]: hours a day just waiting for a star to show up what are you talking about what

02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:43.440
[Guest]: are you even talking about so that is something I didn't agree with I didn't

02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:47.920
[Guest]: get that and I've written a piece on this also on one of my earlier blogs but

02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:52.480
[Guest]: but just the whole experience and you know our producer Jhamu Sugandh

02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:56.560
[Guest]: remember there was that Bharat Shah you know that whole that there was he was

02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:00.120
[Guest]: laundering money so Jhamu Sugandh was the guy who produced Hum Dil Dechi Ke Sanam

02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:03.560
[Guest]: he became very big after that and he produced a whole bunch of films so there

02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:07.040
[Guest]: was some inquiry on him on back then I don't know so half way through the film

02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:12.600
[Guest]: of course in Bollywood lingo you have to call him Jhamuji everything GGG Jhamuji

02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:18.080
[Guest]: was missing so no one knew whether the fifth schedule will happen or not I was

02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:24.280
[Guest]: finding it bizarre then usually an AD is a faalto like you will not be hanging

02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:29.520
[Guest]: with the stars because I was Meghna's friend and she was a director so places

02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:32.720
[Guest]: where the AD did not really belong would go like Sushmita's birthday bash you

02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:36.640
[Guest]: know after the whole thing because when you're shooting a film for that duration

02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:41.800
[Guest]: it's just those people who are your life and which is what I find very strange

02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:48.640
[Guest]: which is why I have a thesis anyone who works in showbiz in Bollywood is not

02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:53.880
[Guest]: what we would call normal emotionally that is their normal but in our world

02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:57.960
[Guest]: that would be an unhinged an unequilibrium place because you work with

02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:02.800
[Guest]: such intense proximity with the crew for like a long time where you have affairs

02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:08.200
[Guest]: you have crying, jhagda, ladai everything with those people then tak you move on to

02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:12.520
[Guest]: another crew and you might not see these people ever again or you might not see

02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:16.040
[Guest]: them in three years like even some of the people who I met from you know

02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:22.000
[Guest]: monsoon rain today it's been what it's been 20 years we still meet like we are

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.400
[Guest]: fucking chaddi buddies we are not we were together for three months three

02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:31.200
[Guest]: intense months when you were on set for 16, 14, 15, 12 hours so you were like

02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:35.640
[Guest]: sadowing together, bitching people out together, laughing together so you get

02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:39.560
[Guest]: very intense bonds that's why a lot of affairs happen on film sets because that

02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:43.880
[Guest]: is your life like normally if you have a birthday party, I have a birthday party

02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:47.680
[Guest]: the 20 people there will be my close friends if I'm having a bigger party

02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:52.680
[Guest]: than the peripheral you know circle then the further circle if you are having a grand party

02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:56.320
[Guest]: but if you have a party of 20 people, they will be your childhood friends

02:47:56.320 --> 02:48:01.640
[Guest]: now I used to find it very strange that there are 20 people in this party and I am also a

02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.440
[Guest]: faggot and I have nothing to do with it and he is also a faggot, he doesn't even know

02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:11.760
[Guest]: they've also met only, where are his friends? and I realized that in Bollywood

02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:15.440
[Guest]: when you are on a project, your friend is shooting for some other project in Thailand

02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:19.640
[Guest]: some in Australia, some in Malaysia because if all your friends are from Bollywood

02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:23.560
[Guest]: okay, your other friends don't fit in with this world, they are not from Bombay

02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:31.520
[Guest]: so I figured that emotionally showbiz you have to be a little unhinged to

02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:36.240
[Guest]: survive, to have an emotional kind of to make sense of your world because your

02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:40.840
[Guest]: closest friends are changing every film so many such experiences I said yeah

02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:46.040
[Guest]: this is a film so while I was there I had so much time I started writing a

02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:49.200
[Guest]: film and I wrote it then I wrote another film this is about reporting and

02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:54.280
[Guest]: elections because I saw news is such a ridiculous space so I have got four

02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:58.600
[Guest]: scripts ready but you see you want to do too much in life I want to do that also

02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:02.040
[Guest]: I want to do activism, I want to do news laundry also so maybe in another 3-4 years when

02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:06.120
[Guest]: you know someone else can take over as CEO of news laundry and run it

02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:10.040
[Guest]: crowdfunding kar lo abhi aa jayenge

02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:16.800
[Guest]: yeah but I I mean I think maybe another year it'll be stable enough to just run

02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:21.440
[Guest]: systems and completely be in place but yeah I absolutely want to make I think

02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:25.800
[Guest]: cinema being on a film set is a magical experience if you've been on a film set

02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:31.600
[Guest]: man it's addictive and I can see why people get addicted to wanting to make

02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:36.080
[Guest]: it and spend their lives go to depression, get into drugs, alcoholism, attempt

02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:40.280
[Guest]: suicide but they will not say fuck it let me give up and go back and do

02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:47.440
[Guest]: something else that pull is so tempting it is a the stakes are so high if you

02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:53.160
[Guest]: make it you fucking make it man and just the buzz the energy like I remember and

02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:56.160
[Guest]: also the bitching I don't you know this is one scene I'll never forget

02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:00.160
[Guest]: on that day Devdas was being shot

02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:05.440
[Guest]: Bhansali, Bhansali and so there was an accident and that time a bunch of films

02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:10.720
[Guest]: were being made there was this Bas Itta Sa Khwab Hai, Abhishek Bachchan, Phil

02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:15.520
[Guest]: Hall was being shot so you know in Kamalistan there are 4-5 film sets

02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:19.360
[Guest]: all lunch together at least us lower down people would do lunch in the lawn

02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:23.760
[Guest]: together with the Lightman, Shytman etc and that time this Olive was a new

02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:27.360
[Guest]: place so matlab palil se neeche ho Bandra mein wahan par tha it was this new

02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:31.400
[Guest]: everybody came back you know went there at the end of the shoot people at my

02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:36.720
[Guest]: level didn't but because I was you know her friend who was good wherever she

02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:41.080
[Guest]: was invited so I would also go there so we were there and I don't know whether

02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:47.080
[Guest]: we were celebrating you know a birthday or so it was of course stars there was

02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:52.880
[Guest]: you know Phil Hall with the stars of other films sitting left right and there

02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:56.960
[Guest]: had been an accident on Sanjay Leel Bhansali set where one of those storm

02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:01.880
[Guest]: fans had fallen and it had killed one of the Lightman or the set spot boys do

02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:04.560
[Amit Varma]: you remember this at all I don't remember this at all but if you google

02:51:04.560 --> 02:51:07.880
[Guest]: it there was a death on Sanjay Leel Bhansali set and then Devdas ki shooting

02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:14.080
[Guest]: band ho gayi, shuru ho gayi ki nahi, now that is when I realized that fucking no one is

02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:19.640
[Guest]: anyone's friend here dude the thrill of bitching out that this film may stop

02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:24.920
[Guest]: Charu ki film rukh chahiye and every table was talking about that

02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:28.360
[Guest]: because I was a fly on the wall bhai mera na lena na dena no one want to talk to

02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:33.440
[Guest]: Saidi Adi so I was just there because I was I would go hang out near this table

02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:36.600
[Guest]: hang out near that table everyone talking about the same thing because it's a very

02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:41.480
[Guest]: small it's like if you think the news world is incestuous Bollywood is that and

02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:48.240
[Guest]: more, ek doosre ki baate karni, navel gazing, wo sade, wo gire, wo, toh mera bhi

02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:52.840
[Guest]: mujhe bada fascinating laga, achha mene waha dekha, thoda dekhta, shahrukh comes in

02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:56.640
[Guest]: in his typical style half his shirt tucked in half out looking very tired

02:51:56.640 --> 02:52:06.360
[Guest]: in his jutti type and jeans dude I am NOT joking every table got up stood in

02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:11.600
[Guest]: line like they're doing a baratiyon ka swagat, hey Shahrukh how are you man everything

02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:15.680
[Guest]: okay oh man love you man I was like fuckers you're not bitching him out like

02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:20.240
[Guest]: in front of me five minutes ago have you no shame I can see you still but dude

02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:23.600
[Guest]: that's the fucking world and I mean I've given you one instance there was just so

02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:28.400
[Guest]: many instances I saw that no one's anyone's enemy no one's anyone's friend

02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:35.200
[Guest]: you are just an ally for the period of your film emotionally that puts you in a

02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:42.800
[Guest]: state of relationships which I don't consider normal when I commit to someone

02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:45.800
[Guest]: of course a single guy at 47 saying this but I don't mean romantically commit I

02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:50.840
[Guest]: mean when I commit friendship to someone and that person is my friend everybody

02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:54.320
[Guest]: else is noise I may be nice to you I may be friendly with you but I'm not your

02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:58.880
[Guest]: friend my friends remain constant through life I have old friends who

02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:02.040
[Guest]: we've been together since you're six years old eight years ten year old I've

02:53:02.040 --> 02:53:07.960
[Guest]: made very few new friends in my life maybe in my mid 20s I kind of finished

02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:11.880
[Guest]: I've made maybe half a dozen since but if someone were to say who are your

02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:15.560
[Guest]: friends it's been the same names for years in showbiz it's not like that

02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:20.040
[Guest]: which is like for example Amitabh Bachchan's father died like tomorrow God

02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:23.720
[Guest]: forbid you know my parent any parent you know they all have to die at some point

02:53:23.720 --> 02:53:27.240
[Guest]: who do the people my side you know about my friends who knew him who grew up with

02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:33.160
[Guest]: him you know no not Amar Singh and Anil Ambani who I met five years ago yeah but

02:53:33.160 --> 02:53:38.520
[Guest]: do you have any close friends that that world doesn't allow it so I find the

02:53:38.520 --> 02:53:46.640
[Guest]: whole emotional equilibrium of showbiz and the emotional equilibrium of non

02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:50.000
[Guest]: showbiz are very different maybe it's different for sports persons I've never

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:53.880
[Guest]: observed them closely but yeah I observed that so I wrote about that I

02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:57.080
[Guest]: wrote films that maybe they'll never get produced maybe I'll just leave them and

02:53:57.080 --> 02:54:00.520
[Guest]: if someone wants to produce them I think they're fantastic scripts maybe I will

02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:07.080
[Guest]: one day but yes to the your answer I f**k yeah I want to make a movie

02:54:07.080 --> 02:54:11.400
[Amit Varma]: I'll write it down for you, the day you decide, the day you find a CEO for

02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:15.040
[Amit Varma]: news laundry and you open this up for crowdfunding no worse you'll get the

02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:19.200
[Amit Varma]: funding I'll write it down but we'll come back to that later from what you said

02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:23.360
[Amit Varma]: about the emotional equilibrium of Bollywood and how they're shaped so

02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:28.240
[Amit Varma]: differently one of the things I've been musing on recently is how what we do

02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:33.200
[Amit Varma]: changes us in such profound ways like just you know at the very basic level of

02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:36.600
[Amit Varma]: my podcast I'm doing for our interviews or whatever that forces me to research

02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:41.160
[Amit Varma]: and go deeper than I otherwise would it forces me to listen you know for shorter

02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:45.200
[Amit Varma]: stuff you don't listen it forces me to read a lot more all of these things and

02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:51.080
[Amit Varma]: I feel that's changed me in some ways now obviously you see these changes in a

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:55.080
[Amit Varma]: much more extreme and obvious form in something like Bollywood where you are

02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:59.920
[Amit Varma]: in those compressed environments of great intensity and so on and so forth

02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:04.480
[Amit Varma]: you see those perhaps in the work you do you see those in politics where I've

02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:08.200
[Amit Varma]: always held that politics invariably corrodes character because you're

02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:12.240
[Amit Varma]: constantly making compromises and building personas who are not who you

02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:15.480
[Amit Varma]: are and eventually the person you know the mokotas you wear become you

02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:18.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm you know I don't know if that's the case with Arvind you know him much

02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:24.720
[Amit Varma]: better but I would always sort of it as a general rule of politics so what would

02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:29.840
[Amit Varma]: be your reflections on that and also to what extent do you think that the kind

02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:34.800
[Amit Varma]: of work that you do has also shaped you in terms of what you are because of

02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:38.320
[Amit Varma]: course you are I saw the slip of yours where you talk about journalism being a

02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:42.720
[Amit Varma]: combat sport and you say that man I saw who very personality as he has so it's

02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:46.320
[Amit Varma]: fit for you so in a sense that causation is coming that the kind of work you do

02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:50.320
[Amit Varma]: is because of the kind of person you are but does it also work the other way

02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:54.880
[Amit Varma]: because you constantly have to therefore in your line of work especially if

02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:58.540
[Amit Varma]: you're doing journalism with rigor as you spoke about you have to be a

02:55:58.540 --> 02:56:02.820
[Amit Varma]: constant skeptic you have to constantly question everything not be quick to

02:56:02.820 --> 02:56:09.400
[Guest]: judgment what's your sense of this well friends who've known me for years will

02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:13.960
[Guest]: like scoff if you say that I'm not quick to judgment they find me the most

02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:19.000
[Guest]: judgmental because you know have arguments and fight at social dues where

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.760
[Guest]: you should not do that on political issues on someone saying something and I

02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:29.040
[Guest]: wouldn't just let it pass I'm like that's not okay fuck you and sometimes

02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:33.320
[Guest]: people will pass so they took it as judgmental I didn't see that as

02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:38.080
[Guest]: judgmental it's just that you don't let certain things slide but you're right

02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:44.280
[Guest]: things become habits you know like smoking like writing as follows are sub

02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:49.600
[Guest]: following the news seeing what was the right thing to do at a governance level

02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:54.440
[Guest]: following governance following the news in a way which is unhealthy for you like

02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:59.960
[Guest]: you know I had gone with my sis for a holiday and we would you know driving in

02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:05.120
[Guest]: the u.s. the whole that that whatever the concierge Colorado River Grand Canyon

02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:10.640
[Guest]: and you know you do that whole Vegas to Bobby I'd keep checking any TV app

02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:15.360
[Guest]: Indian Express app she said fucking switch off man you can't switch off

02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:19.120
[Guest]: that's something on news professionals most news people I know can't switch off

02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:24.520
[Guest]: now I'm sure that takes its toll on us mental health I mean maybe someone to

02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:29.320
[Guest]: someone else I'm a complete fucking basket case warped what is the

02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:33.280
[Guest]: equilibrium it is different for different people that is one thing not

02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:39.000
[Guest]: being able to switch off questioning governance and also the model you choose

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:46.280
[Guest]: because we are subscription based not wanting to go for the click thing stuff

02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:51.120
[Guest]: that is solid but people think it valuable enough it's not like I don't

02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:57.320
[Guest]: want to be news long to be a really big kind of but I'm in no hurry you know it

02:57:57.320 --> 02:58:03.800
[Guest]: has to be done on our terms so it does shape you because of the decisions you

02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:09.680
[Guest]: made it and many you know I've changed my view about many other things like

02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:15.720
[Guest]: about now the other thing what you said I had a very judgmental view on politics

02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:20.800
[Guest]: and politicians now I have a more nuanced view because I understand the

02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:26.440
[Guest]: game that is being played I mean I'll give you some examples of my why

02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:35.200
[Guest]: considering I was one of the dozen at the you know PCRF level when there are

02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:38.840
[Guest]: several million people in the party why I'm and why am I not there it was the

02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:43.120
[Guest]: most obvious thing Arvind contested Santosh contested Manish contested

02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:48.680
[Guest]: well fucked it until they could not contest you know it so I knew that was

02:58:48.680 --> 02:58:52.160
[Guest]: not for me how did I know that was not for me was that when we were running

02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:56.400
[Guest]: that whole Jamboree circus call it what you want of course it was an event we

02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:59.080
[Guest]: had to get eyeballs that was whole idea I mean I asked Mayur to come I asked

02:58:59.080 --> 02:59:02.880
[Guest]: Rocky to come they have no interest in activism they came because they're friends

02:59:02.880 --> 02:59:06.680
[Guest]: of mine I said tomorrow we'll get coverage that Rocky Mayur will come

02:59:06.680 --> 02:59:10.000
[Guest]: then you call up a friend and write a report because it is about media management dude

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:15.040
[Guest]: it's let's not kid ourselves that was a very important one when Arvind will go

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:19.840
[Guest]: on stage it should be in the evening people are fucking watching TV okay now

02:59:19.840 --> 02:59:23.920
[Guest]: but we used to be sitting there so you know and again I think this whole

02:59:23.920 --> 02:59:30.800
[Guest]: emotional equilibrium being in a bizarre land if you have to be a politician this

02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:35.560
[Guest]: this combination like I have a theory that bureaucrats have to be either

02:59:35.560 --> 02:59:40.000
[Guest]: servile or completely obnoxious and bossy and I asked Mr. Lavasa this in the

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:44.640
[Guest]: interview that either they are will treat you like your shit that means

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:50.000
[Guest]: you're below them but when joint secretary better secretary I get it then

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:55.000
[Guest]: yes sir no sir like fucking have some dignity yeah minister Raja to ladies

02:59:55.000 --> 03:00:01.160
[Guest]: anger so if you are going from such civility to such obnoxious arrogance

03:00:01.160 --> 03:00:06.600
[Guest]: several times a day you're fucking mentally fucked here when we would be

03:00:06.600 --> 03:00:10.840
[Guest]: sitting and you know some days there were no crowds would be coming you don't

03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:15.680
[Guest]: figure out how do we SMS bhejo yeh karo wo karo studio java used to be going

03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:19.840
[Guest]: from studio to studio you know arguing with Singh V and Sanjay Jha and all and

03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:25.200
[Guest]: that's another thing me and Sanjay Jha used to have such ugly debates because I

03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:29.240
[Guest]: was representing team Anna what was called and I would rather call it team

03:00:29.240 --> 03:00:33.960
[Guest]: Lokpal and he was representing the Congress because he was like cause I

03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:37.880
[Guest]: spoke so of course and we had such ugly exchanges in fact we bumped into each

03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:43.920
[Guest]: other and with a think fest and it was a nasty exchange now if we meet we're

03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:48.360
[Guest]: friendly you see it's changed now we have a common that time he was my

03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:54.880
[Guest]: adversary now his adversity was mine I had back then you know I had very close

03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:59.440
[Guest]: friends from who are now in this camp who would happily entertain me today

03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:05.480
[Guest]: they will not so when we used to be getting these crowds etc together we'd

03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:09.120
[Guest]: be sitting and I don't know if you remember you were in Bombay but that

03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:12.800
[Guest]: whole Jan Lokpal movement was no one we hadn't seen anything like this in India

03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:17.680
[Guest]: it had become an event and now the farmers the numbers that they have at

03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:23.040
[Guest]: ten times on their bad day what we had on our best day you know the ten times

03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:28.760
[Guest]: more but is it in the television event no it's not five thousand people on

03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:32.200
[Guest]: Jantar Mantar was a bigger television event then one lakh farmers out of him

03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:37.480
[Guest]: twenty are dead probably it's more it's probably number is fifty but it's not an

03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:41.160
[Guest]: event our production is a small production was a fucking big event every

03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:46.040
[Guest]: night in prime time we were all there during that time there are people who

03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:50.000
[Guest]: got excited and said desh badlenge, next revolution aayi hai, jasba hum mein bhi tha hai

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:55.600
[Guest]: we used to get excited jab wo stage se you know dil diya hai, we used to fucking we used to

03:01:55.600 --> 03:01:59.320
[Guest]: feel them of course backstage jaake we used to be two-sowing ourselves and we'd say

03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:03.240
[Guest]: bloody Anna is not eating so many people said tumhe sharam nahi hai, tum kha rahe hain, Anna nahi kha rahe hain

03:02:03.240 --> 03:02:07.880
[Guest]: toh main kha hai yaar bhai toh uski choice hai mere toh main kone mein jaake khaal deta tha

03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:11.840
[Guest]: but there were some guys who wouldn't eat yaar until Anna eats I won't eat one of them

03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:14.680
[Guest]: still works with Arvind till today I was like dude you'll fucking die Anna's used to it

03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:17.520
[Guest]: he's doing this every two three years you've never done this you're like 25

03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:22.480
[Guest]: your body's eating up fat faster he didn't fucking eat till Anna ate, there were people like that at the back

03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:27.120
[Guest]: and they're still there in the history the one thing that fucking used to get

03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:31.560
[Guest]: my goat and we know how hard it is to produce this whole event how hard it is

03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:36.920
[Guest]: to excite people and want them to make change you'll sit in the evening

03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:40.480
[Guest]: Ghaziabad mein office ho raha tha, some fucking three chootiyas will walk in

03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:44.080
[Guest]: tum logon yeh karna nahi hai, tum yeh ho, tum gande ho, tum wo sade ho

03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:48.480
[Guest]: Arvind and Manish should sit and listen to it yaar, haan toh humein kya karna chahiye, accha aap bata hai

03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:54.080
[Guest]: I'd say fuck you yaar, who the fuck are you to tell me kya karna chahiye, chal tune kya kiya life mein

03:02:54.080 --> 03:03:02.360
[Guest]: chalte phirte, roz gaali khao kisi se, na hum so rahe hain, na paisa kama rahe hain, sad rahe hain roz

03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:05.240
[Guest]: aur log aake lecture din lag jaate hain, I used to get very irritated

03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:09.800
[Guest]: Arvind said you can't lose your temper here, I mean you got to listen to the guy

03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:16.840
[Guest]: he has a worse life than you, he is probably in some slum, his life is shit

03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:20.120
[Guest]: your day's been shit na, his life is shit, let him come and vent here

03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:27.320
[Guest]: I couldn't do that, I'd fucking flip out, and fucking they could sit and listen to people

03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:33.240
[Guest]: tell them that they are fucking shit every day, having had such a miserable day

03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:39.320
[Guest]: I was like dude this is not for me man, I fucking can't do this, I can't sit and bloody listen to some people

03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:44.600
[Guest]: telling me I'm a chutiya, after I've been working my ass off, just because his life is worse than mine

03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:51.560
[Guest]: I'm giving you one instance, there are many instances of letting something slide

03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:58.640
[Guest]: and I understand, and what fascinates me is that many journalists who have covered politics for much longer than I have

03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:04.520
[Guest]: and I'm not saying they should not criticise, they must criticise, but even when they are not publicly criticising

03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:09.760
[Guest]: when they are discussing politics, their understanding of politics is dismal

03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:15.640
[Guest]: politics is not the game you are playing, it's a different game, it's up to you whether you want to play it or not

03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:21.360
[Guest]: you play your game, but many of them say this is what this one should do, I'm like dude you have no idea

03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:26.280
[Guest]: what it takes, when there are 20,000 people joining your party every day

03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:32.400
[Guest]: if you think you are going to be doing a due diligence and head hunting on each of them

03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:37.480
[Guest]: which one should be allowed and which should be taken, your party will be like Jay Prakash, Narayan Vajju

03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:42.960
[Guest]: Hyderabad, Lok Satta, you will get one seat at some point and then that is it

03:04:42.960 --> 03:04:48.080
[Guest]: you are not a CEO of a board that is vetting people and hiring them

03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:52.320
[Guest]: when anyone joins Usenry, they have three stages of vetting

03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:56.480
[Guest]: when you are launching a party, there is zero stage of vetting, they are just fucking coming

03:04:56.480 --> 03:04:59.680
[Guest]: those who stick to it, stick to it, those who leave, leave, that's it

03:04:59.680 --> 03:05:07.880
[Guest]: I'm giving you a basic level, but I understood how messaging works, I understood how politics works

03:05:07.880 --> 03:05:16.400
[Guest]: I understood what it takes for a bunch of losers in a room to make a movement that became the biggest thing

03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:20.400
[Guest]: since fucking Quit India movement or whatever it is or JP's movement

03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:25.280
[Guest]: to a party, I get it, it's not my game, I don't want to play that game

03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:31.640
[Guest]: not now anyway, maybe when I'm 60 and I feel that I have zero fucks to give

03:05:31.640 --> 03:05:36.640
[Guest]: like we were talking, but it's a game which is not

03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:40.640
[Guest]: what fascinates me is how few people understand that

03:05:40.640 --> 03:05:45.880
[Guest]: and what your expectations from that game should be and what your expectations from this game should be

03:05:45.880 --> 03:05:52.680
[Guest]: again I repeat, that's not to say that one should not impose your values on politics

03:05:52.680 --> 03:05:57.680
[Guest]: otherwise they will go off the rails, they have to be held to account to what they said yesterday versus yesterday

03:05:57.680 --> 03:06:09.280
[Guest]: but it's too complicated and there are too many compromises that I would find hard to

03:06:09.280 --> 03:06:14.280
[Amit Varma]: did that game change the people who did play it?

03:06:14.280 --> 03:06:18.680
[Guest]: of course it did, but it better have, otherwise they have no business being there

03:06:18.680 --> 03:06:23.680
[Guest]: otherwise they'll have one little spark in the pan and that's the end of it

03:06:23.680 --> 03:06:27.680
[Guest]: if they want to grow, they have to learn

03:06:27.680 --> 03:06:32.680
[Guest]: and I was telling you about Barkha, a lot of people critique her and criticize her for a lot of reasons

03:06:32.680 --> 03:06:37.680
[Guest]: and some justified, some completely unjustified, but she's a super hard worker for which I have a lot of respect for

03:06:37.680 --> 03:06:44.280
[Guest]: I mean she works harder than people half her age and she is a phenomenal learner

03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:49.280
[Guest]: she does one f**k up, she knows what the f**k up is, she's got the intelligence to identify it

03:06:49.280 --> 03:06:55.280
[Guest]: and move on to the best, she will transition with the only person who I've seen who's a better learner than her is Aravind

03:06:55.280 --> 03:07:01.280
[Guest]: I've seen him not knowing how to handle 10 people, to figuring that out

03:07:01.280 --> 03:07:05.280
[Guest]: to not knowing how to handle 100 people, to f**king knowing how to handle a million

03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:10.280
[Guest]: and he'll keep f**king up, but the thing is that when that whole thing happened

03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:16.280
[Guest]: and Aravind Tavleen Singh used to keep writing this, this is Neeti Central

03:07:16.280 --> 03:07:21.280
[Amit Varma]: another rag, that was a proto-op India in a way

03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:26.280
[Guest]: yeah correct, every third week, this is the end, what a foolish mistake resigning from Chief Minister

03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:30.280
[Guest]: oh my god, masterstroke by Amit Shah, Kiran Bedi, I've worked with Kiran ji

03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:35.280
[Guest]: the moment she was made Chief Minister in Canada of BJP, I tweeted it and you can see on my Twitter

03:07:35.280 --> 03:07:42.280
[Guest]: I was like dude, BJP is done, they will be happy if they get double digits

03:07:42.280 --> 03:07:48.280
[Guest]: because I've worked with her, she is a star, she can't handle it

03:07:48.280 --> 03:07:54.280
[Guest]: so, that oh he's resigned, this is the end of the movement, this is the end of the party

03:07:54.280 --> 03:08:00.280
[Guest]: that movement and that party, their obituary has been written so many times in print shamelessly

03:08:00.280 --> 03:08:06.280
[Guest]: after getting it wrong three times and I, the Times of India piece that I wrote, I was like the one thing that I can tell you is

03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:12.280
[Guest]: this guy, till he is on earth, is not going down

03:08:12.280 --> 03:08:17.280
[Guest]: he will f**k up, he will identify his f**k up, he'll say okay let's fix this, move

03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:23.280
[Guest]: and he'll become bigger and better at that game, the game he chooses to play

03:08:23.280 --> 03:08:30.280
[Amit Varma]: so I have a follow up question here, which is, I just recorded with M R Madhavan of PRS yesterday

03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:35.280
[Amit Varma]: and I don't know whether that episode will come before this or after, but one of the things we were discussing was

03:08:35.280 --> 03:08:41.280
[Amit Varma]: how politics and coming to power involves many different games, not one game

03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:45.280
[Amit Varma]: and the context in which I mentioned this to him was, one game is how to win elections

03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:49.280
[Amit Varma]: which a party may master and if it comes to power, obviously it has mastered

03:08:49.280 --> 03:08:53.280
[Amit Varma]: and the other game is governance, where they might be starting with a completely clean slate

03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:57.280
[Amit Varma]: and have to learn from scratch and all that and he pointed out how there is a third game after you become a minister

03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:02.280
[Amit Varma]: but let's not go there, but in the context of say Mr. Kejriwal

03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:06.280
[Amit Varma]: whom I don't know personally and you have obviously known him very closely

03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:11.280
[Amit Varma]: and this is a question that could apply to many similar politicians, to in fact many people who enter politics

03:09:11.280 --> 03:09:18.280
[Amit Varma]: is that it seems that there are two games here for him, you know maybe three but here are the first two

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:23.280
[Amit Varma]: one game is that you get into the kind of work you do, whether you call it activism or not, social work, whatever

03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:28.280
[Amit Varma]: because you have a set of principles, you want to bring about a certain change

03:09:28.280 --> 03:09:33.280
[Amit Varma]: that's why you get into it, then you enter politics and you are playing actually a different game

03:09:33.280 --> 03:09:38.280
[Amit Varma]: where your game is to win power no matter what happens, those principles are orthogonal

03:09:38.280 --> 03:09:44.280
[Amit Varma]: sometimes they may help, sometimes they may not matter at all because what you need to do to win power

03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:48.280
[Amit Varma]: is something completely different and then you get to power.

03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:53.280
[Amit Varma]: Now there is of course a third game of governance on how you make things happen but let's leave that aside for the moment

03:09:53.280 --> 03:10:00.280
[Amit Varma]: it strikes me that there are times where there can be a harsh conflict between these two games

03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:08.280
[Amit Varma]: you might for example begin with liberal principles but then to get elected if you have to appeal to say an illiberal polity

03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:15.280
[Amit Varma]: you know if you have to, you know like one of the things that I have criticized the Aam Aadmi Party on for example in recent years

03:10:15.280 --> 03:10:23.280
[Amit Varma]: is not speaking up adequately on issues like the abolition of 370 or the CAA-NRC protests or at different points in time

03:10:23.280 --> 03:10:28.280
[Guest]: not speaking up would still be okay but endorsing it saying we welcome what happened in Kashmir

03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:34.280
[Amit Varma]: in Kashmir is just, I mean I don't have words for it, it's just horrendous

03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:39.280
[Amit Varma]: and I understand the political rationale which members of the Aam Aadmi Party have given me

03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:43.280
[Amit Varma]: that listen his focus, his narrative is a governance narrative

03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:47.280
[Amit Varma]: he'll do the work in education and health and all of that and that's what people want

03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:53.280
[Amit Varma]: and he will not fight with the BJP on you know social issues because the Hindu vote is what it is

03:10:53.280 --> 03:10:55.280
[Guest]: or not yet anyway

03:10:55.280 --> 03:11:00.280
[Amit Varma]: and that doesn't sit well with me, I understand the political logic

03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:05.280
[Amit Varma]: but what I would then say is that okay he might be making some progress

03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:10.280
[Amit Varma]: or he might be doing it for reasons that are rational within that second game of getting votes and winning elections

03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:14.280
[Amit Varma]: so my personal view is you cannot out-out Hindutva BJP

03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:18.280
[Amit Varma]: but yeah if you're saying I won't fight on that front, I'll fight on the governance front

03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:20.280
[Amit Varma]: where I'm in a strong position, I get that logic

03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:23.280
[Amit Varma]: but that first game then I would say you have completely lost it

03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:25.280
[Amit Varma]: because then what do you stand for

03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:28.280
[Amit Varma]: and I find that there is a certain kind of contradiction there

03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:31.280
[Amit Varma]: and I have asked this even in the context of the BJP

03:11:31.280 --> 03:11:35.280
[Amit Varma]: because on the one hand the BJP comes out of the social movement that has certain beliefs

03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:39.280
[Amit Varma]: that again I could not disagree with more strongly

03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:43.280
[Amit Varma]: and on the other hand they also have this great will to power

03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:46.280
[Amit Varma]: where no matter what it takes they will win elections

03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:50.280
[Amit Varma]: they'll go to the Northeast and say you guys eat beef, no issues with you guys eating beef

03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:54.280
[Amit Varma]: or politicians that they were abusing one day they'll welcome into the party the next day

03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:58.280
[Amit Varma]: or buy them off when they lose the elections because there is a will to power

03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:01.280
[Amit Varma]: and my question there to you know people within the know

03:12:01.280 --> 03:12:03.280
[Amit Varma]: or people sympathetic to them has always been that

03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:09.280
[Amit Varma]: is there a conflict there between their true beliefs and you know actually winning the vote

03:12:09.280 --> 03:12:10.280
[Amit Varma]: but that's a separate question

03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:14.280
[Amit Varma]: you've seen sort of Arvind close up how would you respond to this

03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:15.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean how would you respond to this

03:12:15.280 --> 03:12:22.280
[Guest]: see I mean I don't want to be too dishonest

03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:28.280
[Guest]: and at the same time I don't want to you know kind of use my proximity to him

03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:33.280
[Guest]: to discuss stuff that I don't think is fair as a friend who's known him for 20 odd years

03:12:33.280 --> 03:12:38.280
[Guest]: and through being a co-traveller you know at least a part of

03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:44.280
[Guest]: and you know when the first election happened I had not joined the party officially

03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:48.280
[Guest]: like it was this confusing thing like on the one hand I was a founder member

03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:52.280
[Guest]: but I did not take party membership because when the party was actually announced

03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:55.280
[Guest]: this whole thing that you know when Digvijay Singh said ki

03:12:55.280 --> 03:12:59.280
[Guest]: khud chalaar laddo it's like you're not agreeing with anything

03:12:59.280 --> 03:13:02.280
[Guest]: and he had no intention of fighting any election

03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:06.280
[Guest]: had those continuous barbs and provocation not happened

03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:10.280
[Guest]: there would be no AAP today

03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:13.280
[Guest]: now many people say that oh he had a long game plan

03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:18.280
[Guest]: I can tell you with certainty it would be a miracle to get him a contested election

03:13:18.280 --> 03:13:22.280
[Guest]: the Arvind of 2006-2007 even up to 2009-10

03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:26.280
[Guest]: ab usse vote nahi dalwa paaye hum sala yeh election ladwaayenge

03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:30.280
[Guest]: he was not interested that continuous barbs

03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:33.280
[Guest]: theek hai you know this Mani Shankar hai yaar

03:13:33.280 --> 03:13:37.280
[Guest]: these gutter snipes these keedaas I remember the way he used to talk

03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:39.280
[Amit Varma]: contested election contested election

03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:42.280
[Guest]: he said okay f**k you I will contest an election yaar

03:13:42.280 --> 03:13:45.280
[Guest]: it was pure f**k you to them yaar

03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:48.280
[Guest]: that is why he contested

03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:51.280
[Guest]: now when that decision happened it happened you know behind us

03:13:51.280 --> 03:13:54.280
[Guest]: where all the emporiums in Delhi wo baba khadak singh marg

03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:57.280
[Guest]: wahan peeche ek badi si ek auditorium hai pata nahi

03:13:57.280 --> 03:13:59.280
[Guest]: kiska tha wo diya tha hume

03:13:59.280 --> 03:14:01.280
[Guest]: and it was all that we will do everything by referendum

03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:03.280
[Guest]: which of course came to bite him also

03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:06.280
[Guest]: you know shiru mein karna chahiye ki nahi karna chahiye

03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:07.280
[Guest]: haan haan karna chahiye

03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:10.280
[Guest]: okay we have a party and now we are all founding members

03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:13.280
[Guest]: but before that you know there have been a smaller meeting with

03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:16.280
[Guest]: Kiran ji with Prashant and all that

03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:18.280
[Guest]: the party will be formed

03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:20.280
[Guest]: he knows which way the crowd is going to go

03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:23.280
[Guest]: and if he wants the crowd to go this way he will

03:14:23.280 --> 03:14:25.280
[Guest]: put the proposition in a way that

03:14:25.280 --> 03:14:27.280
[Guest]: he will win the proposition

03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:30.280
[Guest]: which is why when Prashant and Yogendra ji and all left the party

03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:31.280
[Guest]: who left with them yaar

03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:33.280
[Guest]: did it impact the party kuch nahi hua

03:14:33.280 --> 03:14:36.280
[Guest]: see I will just come to the 2-3 other things that I learnt

03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:39.280
[Guest]: one thing I learnt is you cannot come on Sunday practice

03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:40.280
[Guest]: and be the captain of the team

03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:43.280
[Guest]: to be the captain of the team you have to be in the bunkers

03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:45.280
[Guest]: everyday with the boys

03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:46.280
[Guest]: if you are not everyday with the boys in the bunkers

03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:48.280
[Guest]: on Sunday you come and say I am the best player

03:14:48.280 --> 03:14:50.280
[Guest]: because I have a law degree

03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:51.280
[Guest]: the players will say thank you

03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:52.280
[Guest]: but you are not our captain

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:55.280
[Guest]: the guy who has been in the bunker everyday with us is our captain

03:14:55.280 --> 03:14:56.280
[Guest]: they got that wrong

03:14:56.280 --> 03:14:58.280
[Guest]: they thought because they are smarter

03:14:58.280 --> 03:14:59.280
[Guest]: they are more articulate

03:14:59.280 --> 03:15:02.280
[Guest]: they have more degrees

03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:03.280
[Guest]: they will prevail

03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:06.280
[Guest]: no that's not how politics works

03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:07.280
[Guest]: it is the time you spend

03:15:07.280 --> 03:15:09.280
[Guest]: which is why Rahul

03:15:09.280 --> 03:15:11.280
[Guest]: give it 24 hours of your day

03:15:11.280 --> 03:15:13.280
[Guest]: the guy had no life for that time yaar

03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:15.280
[Guest]: he wouldn't go home

03:15:15.280 --> 03:15:17.280
[Guest]: whereas the rest of us would go home

03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:19.280
[Guest]: nahaad hokhe phir monday ko aate the

03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:20.280
[Guest]: woh toh saara din wahi tha

03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:21.280
[Guest]: toh jab aap aayenge

03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:22.280
[Guest]: aur hazaar log baithe hain

03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:23.280
[Guest]: unko bolenge

03:15:23.280 --> 03:15:25.280
[Guest]: boss meri baat sunenge hai arvind

03:15:25.280 --> 03:15:26.280
[Guest]: kiski baat sunenge ho

03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:28.280
[Guest]: it's common sense yaar

03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:29.280
[Guest]: and we privileged don't get it

03:15:29.280 --> 03:15:30.280
[Guest]: we think because we are smarter

03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:31.280
[Guest]: we are more articulate

03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:32.280
[Guest]: we are better looking

03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:33.280
[Guest]: they will listen to us

03:15:33.280 --> 03:15:34.280
[Guest]: they won't

03:15:34.280 --> 03:15:35.280
[Guest]: now what is your question sorry

03:15:35.280 --> 03:15:37.280
[Guest]: ya ya

03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:39.280
[Guest]: I still have faith in him

03:15:39.280 --> 03:15:41.280
[Guest]: I believe

03:15:41.280 --> 03:15:43.280
[Guest]: his moral compass is

03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:45.280
[Guest]: too solid

03:15:45.280 --> 03:15:47.280
[Guest]: to become

03:15:47.280 --> 03:15:49.280
[Guest]: what many of the others

03:15:49.280 --> 03:15:51.280
[Guest]: like to do what a couple

03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:53.280
[Guest]: do I always agree with what he does?

03:15:53.280 --> 03:15:55.280
[Guest]: no, I don't

03:15:55.280 --> 03:15:56.280
[Guest]: which is another reason I could probably

03:15:56.280 --> 03:15:58.280
[Guest]: never be in politics

03:15:58.280 --> 03:16:00.280
[Guest]: you know I'd have to go and speak

03:16:00.280 --> 03:16:01.280
[Guest]: I remember when we had to go and

03:16:01.280 --> 03:16:03.280
[Guest]: defend Kiran ji is that

03:16:03.280 --> 03:16:05.280
[Guest]: SCI remember when she did that whole

03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:07.280
[Guest]: she did this whole skit

03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:08.280
[Guest]: I remember I was holding my head

03:16:08.280 --> 03:16:09.280
[Guest]: I was like dude come on

03:16:09.280 --> 03:16:10.280
[Guest]: don't ask me to defend this

03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:11.280
[Guest]: on prime time at night

03:16:11.280 --> 03:16:12.280
[Guest]: because sometimes you can't

03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:14.280
[Guest]: defend shit man

03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:16.280
[Guest]: but I

03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:17.280
[Guest]: I think he

03:16:17.280 --> 03:16:18.280
[Guest]: if there is anyone

03:16:18.280 --> 03:16:20.280
[Guest]: who can take down the BJP

03:16:20.280 --> 03:16:22.280
[Guest]: in this country

03:16:22.280 --> 03:16:23.280
[Guest]: it is him

03:16:23.280 --> 03:16:25.280
[Guest]: and they know it

03:16:25.280 --> 03:16:26.280
[Guest]: otherwise you think

03:16:26.280 --> 03:16:27.280
[Guest]: they gave a shit one

03:16:27.280 --> 03:16:29.280
[Guest]: state which had none

03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:30.280
[Guest]: when they came in

03:16:30.280 --> 03:16:32.280
[Guest]: Rajnath Singh removed that

03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:33.280
[Guest]: one ACB that was under him

03:16:33.280 --> 03:16:34.280
[Guest]: the anti-corruption

03:16:34.280 --> 03:16:35.280
[Guest]: other Delhi chief minister

03:16:35.280 --> 03:16:36.280
[Guest]: has only one police station

03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:37.280
[Guest]: under her

03:16:37.280 --> 03:16:38.280
[Guest]: which Shira Dixit didn't use

03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:39.280
[Guest]: for 15 years

03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:40.280
[Guest]: as soon as he came

03:16:40.280 --> 03:16:41.280
[Guest]: he got an affair against

03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:43.280
[Guest]: Sibal, Ambani and Moily

03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:44.280
[Guest]: remember?

03:16:44.280 --> 03:16:45.280
[Guest]: and they did that in parliament

03:16:45.280 --> 03:16:46.280
[Guest]: they passed that whatever

03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:47.280
[Guest]: resolution and

03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:48.280
[Guest]: that was taken

03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:50.280
[Guest]: they have been doing politics

03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:51.280
[Guest]: long enough to identify the guy

03:16:51.280 --> 03:16:53.280
[Guest]: who is their biggest threat

03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:54.280
[Guest]: it is not Rahul

03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:56.280
[Guest]: it is this guy

03:16:56.280 --> 03:16:58.280
[Guest]: and I

03:16:58.280 --> 03:16:59.280
[Guest]: and like I said

03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:01.280
[Guest]: I think that his utterances

03:17:01.280 --> 03:17:03.280
[Guest]: on Kashmir were

03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:04.280
[Guest]: and they just did not

03:17:04.280 --> 03:17:05.280
[Guest]: said okay with me

03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:06.280
[Guest]: you can't abandon

03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:07.280
[Guest]: our Kashmiri brothers and

[Guest]: sisters like that

03:17:08.280 --> 03:17:09.280
[Guest]: ironically

03:17:09.280 --> 03:17:10.280
[Guest]: fucking it

03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:11.280

[Guest]: LG was overruling everything

03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:16.280
[Guest]: but I also understand

03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:18.280
[Guest]: politics enough to know

03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:19.280
[Guest]: what is being done

03:17:19.280 --> 03:17:21.280
[Guest]: why

03:17:21.280 --> 03:17:22.280
[Guest]: I will never publicly

03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:23.280
[Guest]: endorse it

03:17:23.280 --> 03:17:24.280
[Guest]: and I will always question

03:17:24.280 --> 03:17:25.280
[Guest]: because as a journalist

03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:26.280
[Guest]: that is why

03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:27.280

[Guest]: I consciously wouldn't

03:17:30.280 --> 03:17:31.280
[Guest]: but

03:17:31.280 --> 03:17:32.280
[Guest]: as a citizen

03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:33.280
[Guest]: I cannot endorse that

03:17:33.280 --> 03:17:34.280
[Guest]: but do I understand that

03:17:34.280 --> 03:17:35.280
[Guest]: yes I understand that

03:17:35.280 --> 03:17:37.280
[Guest]: and do I believe

03:17:37.280 --> 03:17:39.280
[Guest]: that this guy

03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:41.280
[Guest]: is morally corrupt

03:17:41.280 --> 03:17:42.280
[Guest]: no

03:17:42.280 --> 03:17:43.280
[Guest]: that I don't

[Guest]: I

03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:45.280
[Guest]: I will still vouch for him

03:17:45.280 --> 03:17:46.280
[Guest]: he is my friend

03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:47.280
[Guest]: and one can

03:17:47.280 --> 03:17:48.280
[Guest]: you know

03:17:48.280 --> 03:17:49.280

[Amit Varma]: right and I won't

[Amit Varma]: push back on that

03:21:28.280 --> 03:21:29.280
[Amit Varma]: but it does

03:21:29.280 --> 03:21:30.280
[Amit Varma]: strike me that

03:21:30.280 --> 03:21:31.280
[Amit Varma]: like when I

03:21:31.280 --> 03:21:32.280
[Amit Varma]: think of what

03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:33.280
[Amit Varma]: a man's

03:21:33.280 --> 03:21:34.280
[Amit Varma]: character is

03:21:34.280 --> 03:21:35.280
[Amit Varma]: I will think

03:21:35.280 --> 03:21:36.280
[Amit Varma]: of his

03:21:36.280 --> 03:21:37.280
[Amit Varma]: actions

03:21:37.280 --> 03:21:38.280
[Amit Varma]: and you

03:21:38.280 --> 03:21:39.280
[Amit Varma]: know when

03:21:39.280 --> 03:21:40.280
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned

03:21:40.280 --> 03:21:41.280
[Amit Varma]: incorruptible

03:21:41.280 --> 03:21:42.280
[Amit Varma]: and I just

03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:43.280
[Amit Varma]: look at that

03:21:43.280 --> 03:21:44.280
[Amit Varma]: Kashmir thing

03:21:44.280 --> 03:21:45.280
[Guest]: for example

03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:46.280
[Guest]: yeah

03:21:46.280 --> 03:21:47.280
[Guest]: right

03:21:47.280 --> 03:21:48.280
[Guest]: so you

03:21:48.280 --> 03:21:49.280
[Amit Varma]: know either

03:21:49.280 --> 03:21:50.280
[Amit Varma]: he genuinely

03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:51.280
[Amit Varma]: believed that

03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:52.280
[Guest]: he was

03:21:52.280 --> 03:21:53.280
[Amit Varma]: incorruptible

03:21:53.280 --> 03:21:54.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean I

03:21:54.280 --> 03:21:55.280
[Amit Varma]: know

03:21:55.280 --> 03:21:56.280
[Amit Varma]: sure I mean

03:21:56.280 --> 03:21:57.280
[Amit Varma]: look I am

03:21:57.280 --> 03:21:58.280
[Guest]: sure even

03:21:58.280 --> 03:21:59.280
[Guest]: Modi is

03:21:59.280 --> 03:22:00.280
[Amit Varma]: incorruptible

03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:01.280
[Amit Varma]: financially

03:22:01.280 --> 03:22:02.280
[Amit Varma]: I kind of

03:22:02.280 --> 03:22:03.280
[Amit Varma]: disagree but

03:22:03.280 --> 03:22:04.280
[Amit Varma]: anyway

03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:05.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean if

03:22:05.280 --> 03:22:06.280
[Guest]: you have

03:22:06.280 --> 03:22:07.280
[Guest]: inside

03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:08.280
[Guest]: info feel

03:22:08.280 --> 03:22:09.280
[Guest]: free to

03:22:09.280 --> 03:22:10.280
[Guest]: give it here

03:22:10.280 --> 03:22:11.280
[Unknown]: but

03:22:11.280 --> 03:22:12.280
[Unknown]: Hitler was

03:22:12.280 --> 03:22:13.280
[Guest]: a vegetarian

03:22:13.280 --> 03:22:14.280
[Unknown]: Mohan was

03:22:14.280 --> 03:22:15.280
[Guest]: incorruptible

03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:16.280
[Guest]: yeah

03:22:16.280 --> 03:22:17.280
[Guest]: I mean he

03:22:17.280 --> 03:22:18.280
[Guest]: was a

03:22:18.280 --> 03:22:19.280
[Guest]: primary

03:22:19.280 --> 03:22:20.280
[Guest]: I get

03:22:20.280 --> 03:22:21.280
[Guest]: it

03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:22.280
[Guest]: yeah

03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:23.280
[Guest]: I

03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:24.280
[Guest]: don't

03:22:24.280 --> 03:22:25.280
[Guest]: believe

03:22:25.280 --> 03:22:26.280
[Guest]: that

03:22:26.280 --> 03:22:27.280
[Guest]: he was

03:22:27.280 --> 03:22:28.280
[Guest]: an

03:22:28.280 --> 03:22:29.280
[Guest]: incorruptible

03:22:29.280 --> 03:22:30.280
[Amit Varma]: man

03:22:30.280 --> 03:22:31.280
[Guest]: I

03:22:31.280 --> 03:22:32.280
[Guest]: don't

03:22:32.280 --> 03:22:33.280
[Guest]: believe

03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:34.280
[Guest]: that

03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:35.280
[Guest]: he was

03:22:35.280 --> 03:22:36.280
[Guest]: a

03:22:36.280 --> 03:22:37.280
[Guest]: vegetarian

03:22:37.280 --> 03:22:38.280
[Guest]: yeah

03:22:38.280 --> 03:22:39.280
[Guest]: so

03:22:39.280 --> 03:22:40.280
[Guest]: I

03:22:40.280 --> 03:22:41.280
[Guest]: don't

03:22:41.280 --> 03:22:42.280
[Guest]: believe

03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:43.280
[Guest]: that

03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:44.280
[Guest]: he was

03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:45.280
[Guest]: an

03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:46.280
[Guest]: incorruptible

03:22:46.280 --> 03:22:47.280
[Guest]: man

03:22:47.280 --> 03:22:48.280
[Guest]: I

03:22:48.280 --> 03:22:49.280
[Guest]: don't

03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:56.360
[Guest]: one way or the other, but so like my dadi used to say hum toh congressi hain, that generation

03:22:56.360 --> 03:23:00.040
[Guest]: was like that, they took part in the freedom movement, she was from Kanyamaha Vidyalaya

03:23:00.040 --> 03:23:04.360
[Guest]: for her Bapu, you know they had met these people, hum toh congressi hain, meanwhile

03:23:04.360 --> 03:23:08.840
[Guest]: my side of the family that had seen the partition had come from Lahore, they were for the Sangh,

03:23:08.840 --> 03:23:15.480
[Guest]: they are not even for the BJP, which is why Atal lost in 2004, the Sangh wasn't on his

03:23:15.480 --> 03:23:21.280
[Guest]: team and the Sangh, today Modi may be bigger than the Sangh, which is many pieces have

03:23:21.280 --> 03:23:26.200
[Guest]: been written about it and will it last, can they, but at least pre-Modi you could not

03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:32.720
[Guest]: be bigger than the Sangh, because people like my grand aunt, you know from, they were extended

03:23:32.720 --> 03:23:37.440
[Guest]: relatives from my father's side, from Punjab when they had come, I mean just one of them

03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:43.360
[Guest]: is alive today, otherwise they were five sisters all right, I, you know we got on well, they

03:23:43.360 --> 03:23:46.560
[Guest]: were nice, they were wonderful, they weren't bigoted like these bloody open air types,

03:23:46.560 --> 03:23:51.920
[Guest]: I mean that I will say, but they will say we will vote for who the Sangh says, if the

03:23:51.920 --> 03:23:54.600
[Guest]: Sangh says BJP, BJP, if the Sangh says Congress, we will vote for the Congress, but what the

03:23:54.600 --> 03:24:02.680
[Guest]: Sangh says, so that is that generation of voters, our generation of voters should be

03:24:02.680 --> 03:24:09.720
[Guest]: what is prudent, who can take down A, who can take down B, is he the perfect candidate,

03:24:09.720 --> 03:24:15.400
[Guest]: maybe not, was Mayawati the perfect candidate, no, but I was sick of the Congress saying

03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:21.000
[Guest]: that we are so cool because we are rich, sophisticated and corrupt, but she is not because she is

03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:26.720
[Guest]: not rich, sophisticated, but she is corrupt, so I won't vote for Mayawati today, if someone

03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:30.080
[Guest]: else, I can't argue with anyone saying that Mayawati is the best candidate, I know she

03:24:30.080 --> 03:24:35.360
[Guest]: is not, but at that time I wish a couple of hundred thousand people had voted for her

03:24:35.360 --> 03:24:40.160
[Guest]: and bloody she had, if you read the book Behenji by Ajay Bose, her coming to Chief Minister

03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:45.680
[Guest]: was a bloody miracle and it fucking jolted UP like nothing has before, we needed something

03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:52.040
[Guest]: like that, so right now if you don't like the way the country is heading, I don't see

03:24:52.040 --> 03:24:58.280
[Guest]: anyone even close to Arvind being able to take, and also not just the Shahrukh Khan ki film,

03:24:58.280 --> 03:25:05.600
[Guest]: Baniye ka Dewaag aur Mian Bhai ki Daring, it applies to him, he will take on anything,

03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:14.280
[Guest]: like he doesn't, he has, I don't give a fuck, so that is the reason I think he is the best

03:25:14.280 --> 03:25:19.080
[Amit Varma]: man, but yeah, I mean other than that, I kind of agree with you about how voters should

03:25:19.080 --> 03:25:24.520
[Amit Varma]: not, you know, be fixed on one party and how we should be prudent, but I am also reminded

03:25:24.520 --> 03:25:28.640
[Amit Varma]: of something, was it Hannah Arendt who said this, I forget who, but those who vote for

03:25:28.640 --> 03:25:33.200
[Amit Varma]: the lesser evil should remember that they are still voting for evil, so you know, my

03:25:33.200 --> 03:25:38.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of pessimism runs much deeper, I just think that, you know, like you, I will oppose

03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:44.240
[Amit Varma]: whichever party is in power, because you know, that is kind of the nature of the beast, let's

03:25:44.240 --> 03:25:48.880
[Amit Varma]: move on to talking about the media and I will end the show by asking about your experiences

03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:53.160
[Amit Varma]: of Highway on a Plate, because you know, you intrigued me a lot with the little that you

03:25:53.160 --> 03:25:57.520
[Amit Varma]: did say about it, but like when I look at the media, one of the things that I think

03:25:57.520 --> 03:26:05.160
[Amit Varma]: is really exciting for creators of any kind today is that when I look back at the 1990s,

03:26:05.160 --> 03:26:09.320
[Amit Varma]: creators were dependent on intermediaries, so if I was a writer, I could not reach my

03:26:09.320 --> 03:26:13.560
[Amit Varma]: audience directly, my audience may value my work, because time is money, they are spending

03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:17.400
[Amit Varma]: time reading or listening or whatever, but I have no way to capture that, I have to go

03:26:17.400 --> 03:26:22.720
[Amit Varma]: to intermediaries like a Times of India or a news channel or whatever, give my work to

03:26:22.720 --> 03:26:27.760
[Amit Varma]: those intermediaries, they collate eyeballs, they get advertising, I got a tiny, tiny chunk

03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:32.320
[Amit Varma]: of that. I think that whole model is broken down completely, as you have also, you know,

03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:36.360
[Amit Varma]: mentioned earlier and experienced and in fact, led the way for that. The model is broken

03:26:36.360 --> 03:26:41.880
[Amit Varma]: down in two ways. One, I think that the way people discover content, consume content,

03:26:41.880 --> 03:26:46.480
[Amit Varma]: filter content has changed completely. But I also think that advertising model is completely

03:26:46.480 --> 03:26:50.720
[Amit Varma]: broken. Like John Wanamaker once famously said, half the money I spent on advertising

03:26:50.720 --> 03:26:54.720
[Amit Varma]: is wasted, I don't know which half, I think today the percentage is like way more than

03:26:54.720 --> 03:27:00.400
[Amit Varma]: that. All these metrics, which you know, publications used to get ads are basically just being gamed,

03:27:00.400 --> 03:27:06.080
[Amit Varma]: it is a mugs game. And I think consumers are now more and more reaching creators directly

03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:13.840
[Amit Varma]: and creators are able to not only build communities of their audiences, but also monetize that,

03:27:13.840 --> 03:27:19.160
[Amit Varma]: because and especially what I feel is that the more you provide value to the consumer,

03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:24.280
[Amit Varma]: the greater the level of engagement. So it is not just a total eyeballs that matter.

03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:31.000
[Amit Varma]: It is a degree of engagement, like a news laundry support reader would 100% feel much

03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:36.640
[Amit Varma]: more engaged and feel much more ownership than say Times of India reader, right? Tell

03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:41.600
[Amit Varma]: me a little bit about your experiences of this, because you are essentially, you know,

03:27:41.600 --> 03:27:45.880
[Amit Varma]: the first pioneer of this kind of thing where you are, where you have decided that advertising

03:27:45.880 --> 03:27:50.080
[Amit Varma]: Jai Bharme, you know, we'll take the support of those we serve and as working out. So tell

03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:53.840
[Amit Varma]: me, I'm very fascinated to know more about how you're thinking on this evolved and how

03:27:53.840 --> 03:28:00.000
[Guest]: it's panned out. So I won't go on too long on this, because this, I mean, they're just

03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:04.800
[Guest]: so many angles, I lived with this for so long and learned so much, you know, it could take

03:28:04.800 --> 03:28:12.440
[Guest]: hours. But I will say a few basic things. One is, you have to find your, like you said,

03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:16.760
[Guest]: your immediate tribe has to be very committed and convinced of what you're doing, because

03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:20.840
[Guest]: they will carry your word faster than you will carry your word further. I will not get

03:28:20.840 --> 03:28:26.320
[Guest]: into too much detail in that. But, you know, giants like Google and Facebook need to be

03:28:26.320 --> 03:28:30.280
[Guest]: controlled and regulated. They need to be broken up. But how do you break up something

03:28:30.280 --> 03:28:34.600
[Guest]: like Facebook and Vivek Khol and I discussed this and you really wonder how because it's

03:28:34.600 --> 03:28:38.600
[Guest]: a network. How can you break up a network? It's not like big oil that you ran into fire

03:28:38.600 --> 03:28:46.120
[Guest]: for. But the power they have is deeply, deeply worrying. And they can shut you and me out

03:28:46.120 --> 03:28:53.320
[Guest]: if they choose to. Which is why regulation is an important aspect, which is why I believe

03:28:53.320 --> 03:28:58.280
[Guest]: we live in a post ideological age. I find the whole commentary around, you know, people

03:28:58.280 --> 03:29:02.200
[Guest]: who identify themselves as communists or socialists as idiotic as people who identify themselves

03:29:02.200 --> 03:29:06.480
[Guest]: as capitalists, because I shouldn't use the word like idiotic, but unwise. It is not a

03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:11.440
[Guest]: thought through position, because if you look at history, political history and economic

03:29:11.440 --> 03:29:16.840
[Guest]: history of the world, I mean, some of the most capitalist countries, so to speak, have

03:29:16.840 --> 03:29:22.720
[Guest]: the biggest socialist programs, whether it is, you know, the US. But the argument then

03:29:22.720 --> 03:29:27.440
[Guest]: would be that you shouldn't call them capitalist and vice versa on the other side, which is,

03:29:27.440 --> 03:29:31.360
[Guest]: you know, you live on. What's wrong with you? I'm blanking out. US, what do you get? You

03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:36.240
[Guest]: get after the Great Depression, the fatigue of talking about three hours is completely

03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:39.400
[Guest]: the big deal. What is a big new deal? The new deal, you know, the new deal and getting

03:29:39.400 --> 03:29:45.920
[Guest]: giving everyone that basic survival unemployment that you live on. In Singapore, you know,

03:29:45.920 --> 03:29:51.960
[Guest]: the housing that you get is like way subsidized. There's no place like Singapore where everything

03:29:51.960 --> 03:30:00.800
[Guest]: is like market, market, capitalist, capitalist. Look at China, communist state. I just think

03:30:00.800 --> 03:30:05.120
[Guest]: that the regulation that is required. So I believe regulation is something that is very

03:30:05.120 --> 03:30:10.520
[Guest]: important. But what you call regulation is what is like this whole debate around news

03:30:10.520 --> 03:30:13.560
[Guest]: media. Should you not be regulated? Of course, we should regulate. But who says we aren't

03:30:13.560 --> 03:30:18.000
[Guest]: regulated? The way it is worded, that there is no regulation, there is a regulation. We

03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:23.200
[Guest]: do abide by laws. We have to. There is some compliance we have to do. So what is regulation

03:30:23.200 --> 03:30:27.400
[Guest]: is important. Now, that is a very important part in the world going forward with people

03:30:27.400 --> 03:30:32.080
[Guest]: like Google and Facebook coming as powerful as they are. The honeymoon that you and I

03:30:32.080 --> 03:30:36.800
[Guest]: are going through right now can really be brought to a very rude and abrupt end. I think

03:30:36.800 --> 03:30:42.400
[Guest]: Germany is going down the right way. I think other countries also have to have think through

03:30:42.400 --> 03:30:49.400
[Guest]: how you control these guys because they are cornering the growth of the Internet when

03:30:49.400 --> 03:30:53.920
[Guest]: it comes to the financial aspect of the commerce of it is being cornered by four or five big

03:30:53.920 --> 03:30:59.880
[Guest]: guys that is not healthy for any society. So let's put that aside. That is all I have

03:30:59.880 --> 03:31:03.080
[Guest]: to say about this aspect. And it's a very important aspect of the growth. But when it

03:31:03.080 --> 03:31:06.640
[Guest]: comes to what can you and I do, you know, identify that tribe, convince people. And

03:31:06.640 --> 03:31:14.560
[Guest]: I've also realized that in the first stage, people don't identify with a brand or a mission.

03:31:14.560 --> 03:31:20.320
[Guest]: They identify with the person. Do they like Amit? Do they like Madhu? Do they like Abhinandan?

03:31:20.320 --> 03:31:22.920
[Guest]: And that's also true for politics today in the digital age, you know, which is why this

03:31:22.920 --> 03:31:28.760
[Guest]: whole lament of, oh, it's a one man party. Oh, it's dude, if you understand politics

03:31:28.760 --> 03:31:35.120
[Guest]: and messaging, that is how it will be, at least in the foreseeable future, at least

03:31:35.120 --> 03:31:42.760
[Guest]: as far as the media consumption and consumer behavior of voters is right now, your party

03:31:42.760 --> 03:31:47.440
[Guest]: will not be bigger than your leader. And no matter what noble intentions may have been

03:31:47.440 --> 03:31:53.760
[Guest]: started by that, we are against central command. High command culture, high command culture,

03:31:53.760 --> 03:32:00.520
[Guest]: you cannot do without that. Your party will not survive for one year. Similarly, stage

03:32:00.520 --> 03:32:05.560
[Guest]: one has to be person. People have to like you. So you have to put out what you believe.

03:32:05.560 --> 03:32:09.880
[Guest]: Your message is you. And then they say, OK, what this guy saying we agree with or disagree

03:32:09.880 --> 03:32:14.600
[Guest]: with. Like a lot of people in the beginning and now have stopped getting that hate mail

03:32:14.600 --> 03:32:19.880
[Guest]: and that hate tweets. We thought you were a good boy. Why? Because in 2012, my primary

03:32:19.880 --> 03:32:26.600
[Guest]: attack was at Manmohan and Gang. Now it is at your boy. Now you hate me. But at that

03:32:26.600 --> 03:32:33.560
[Guest]: time, you liked me. A chai enthusiastic, a lot I said, say Congress, a lot I take care,

03:32:33.560 --> 03:32:40.280
[Guest]: you know, so support. Subscribers. I hear message. So no matter how many tweet key by

03:32:40.280 --> 03:32:43.840
[Guest]: if I had to choose between two and a gun was put to my head, of course, I choose Congress

03:32:43.840 --> 03:32:48.440
[Guest]: because I hate I hate religious bigotry. Oh, my God, he's like this. Hello. Welcome to

03:32:48.440 --> 03:32:54.400
[Guest]: the party. Of course, anyone sensible will be, you know. Now, the next stage for growth

03:32:54.400 --> 03:33:00.160
[Guest]: opinions will not get you scale. If I had like for you, a single podcast, if I was doing

03:33:00.160 --> 03:33:04.360
[Guest]: a podcast, I can make a living doing a podcast. You know, I can get a few hundred, a couple

03:33:04.360 --> 03:33:08.160
[Guest]: of thousand subscribers. That's enough to take care of my needs. But if I want to do

03:33:08.160 --> 03:33:13.760
[Guest]: reporting, I want to make a difference in the news world. You cannot be the only star.

03:33:13.760 --> 03:33:17.880
[Guest]: You have to, over time, take the backseat. You have to become the side. And you have

03:33:17.880 --> 03:33:23.600
[Guest]: to have a bunch of people who are really good at what they do and are passionate as you.

03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:28.880
[Guest]: They aren't there for the anchor. But I want to be an anchor. I want to be an anchor. This

03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:34.400
[Guest]: lady, Narasimhan, was a Mr. Model or something. What was your pursuit? What are you doing?

03:33:34.400 --> 03:33:39.920
[Guest]: Have you ever had an interest in this? You know, have four or five such people who are

03:33:39.920 --> 03:33:47.640
[Guest]: as driven by the mission as you are because you cannot do it. So, you know, we have such

03:33:47.640 --> 03:33:51.240
[Guest]: a phenomenal team, you know, our design team. You know how committed they are. They're so

03:33:51.240 --> 03:33:56.440
[Guest]: young and they have that. There's a raid. Should we come to office? I said, kids, you

03:33:56.440 --> 03:34:01.760
[Guest]: stay home, man. Should we come? How have they not named us? They are willing to jump into

03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:10.320
[Guest]: the fight with you. And they're 24. I'm fucking 47 here. You know, have that team and you'll

03:34:10.320 --> 03:34:15.040
[Guest]: go through mistakes. You'll hire five lemons who are just there for the ride. And then

03:34:15.040 --> 03:34:22.000
[Guest]: when they realize, dude, these guys mean business, then I'm quitting. I'm joining Times. Congratulations.

03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:30.560
[Guest]: Why would you come here if that was your intention? But most importantly, opinions will not for

03:34:30.560 --> 03:34:37.520
[Guest]: what I'm doing. It has to be ground reports. The crux of growth is ground reports. First

03:34:37.520 --> 03:34:41.920
[Guest]: post had more opinion piece than anybody does. They will know it's going to pay to pay first

03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:47.360
[Guest]: post. Nobody. Your ground reporting has to be of a certain caliber. If it has to grow

03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:52.160
[Guest]: and podcasts are very important because podcasts are very important for your primary tribe.

03:34:52.160 --> 03:35:00.440
[Guest]: Your primary tribe likes the sound of your message of your passion. But podcasts are

03:35:00.440 --> 03:35:04.960
[Guest]: high engagement. Absolutely. So that and we started podcasts, you know, before anybody

03:35:04.960 --> 03:35:11.560
[Guest]: had because I was addicted to podcast from the mid 2000s. So I was just addicted to the

03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:15.080
[Guest]: NPR podcast when that bloody Lehman broke and they started Planet Money. I was addicted

03:35:15.080 --> 03:35:20.120
[Guest]: to that podcast and I haven't missed an episode in the last so many years. And I was like

03:35:20.120 --> 03:35:26.000
[Guest]: podcast. And I think he started out in 2013, 14. I forget when we started a podcast. And

03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:30.920
[Guest]: I was like, why the fuck should I start a podcast? I like do it. It is the most highest

03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:35.880
[Guest]: engagement thing. And sure, it was. And when we put it behind the paywall, you know, that's

03:35:35.880 --> 03:35:40.520
[Guest]: when we saw the biggest spurt in subscribers back then, when we just had three or four

03:35:40.520 --> 03:35:45.200
[Guest]: ground reporters. Today, we have maybe 10, 11, 12 ground reporters. And we want to take

03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:49.760
[Guest]: this number up to 50 ground reporters. We want to have the network of reporters who

03:35:49.760 --> 03:35:54.880
[Guest]: are passionate, driven and not influenced by advertisers.

03:35:54.880 --> 03:36:01.960
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous. But my one comment on that issue about, you know, a handful of these networks

03:36:01.960 --> 03:36:06.640
[Amit Varma]: owning the Internet is that, yes, I think that's an existential threat to all of us.

03:36:06.640 --> 03:36:12.120
[Amit Varma]: And I'm incredibly worried about it. But I also feel that we should not reflexively think

03:36:12.120 --> 03:36:16.360
[Amit Varma]: of state coercion as the answer. If state coercion is to be the answer, then it's people

03:36:16.360 --> 03:36:20.760
[Amit Varma]: like Modi who could be deciding or people like Trump. And so I'm just really wary of

03:36:20.760 --> 03:36:24.560
[Amit Varma]: that. That's fine. You want to regulate the media, but who's regulating you? You know,

03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:29.480
[Amit Varma]: any dispensation that really regulates you through the power of the state will crush

03:36:29.480 --> 03:36:33.460
[Amit Varma]: dissent in some way or the other. That's kind of what I mean. Yeah, that's a more complicated

03:36:33.460 --> 03:36:39.920
[Guest]: discussion that, you know, we can leave for some other day, but there's an inevitability

03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:48.080
[Guest]: to governments. And there's an inevitability to governments framing regulatory frameworks.

03:36:48.080 --> 03:36:50.080
[Guest]: Do you want to influence that as much as possible?

03:36:50.080 --> 03:36:56.640
[Guest]: Yeah. Now, how you go about that is a different, but at least in the current state of how things

03:36:56.640 --> 03:37:00.800
[Guest]: are run in the world, you can't get around that problem. And one thing that I've learned

03:37:00.800 --> 03:37:09.200
[Guest]: from people like Arvind especially is that identify the problem that you can't change

03:37:09.200 --> 03:37:14.480
[Guest]: and then fucking set that aside as a given. This is a given we're living with. Now, what

03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:22.440
[Guest]: can I change to get to where I want to get? Governments framing policy for anything is

03:37:22.440 --> 03:37:32.000
[Guest]: a given. How we get about influencing that is what we can do. Well said, you know, you

03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:35.040
[Amit Varma]: mentioned highway on a plate and all that. I won't ask you to elaborate on it at a too

03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:40.320
[Amit Varma]: much length, but I have a broader question that also kind of touches upon that experience,

03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:45.000
[Amit Varma]: which is that you, you spoke that while shooting highway on a plate, you visited every state

03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:50.760
[Amit Varma]: in this country, which is phenomenal. Now, both of us grew up in little privileged bubbles

03:37:50.760 --> 03:37:55.520
[Amit Varma]: over time. We came out of it little bits at a time and our eyes open and you see something

03:37:55.520 --> 03:37:59.120
[Amit Varma]: new and a layer falls off somewhere and a veil falls off somewhere else. And you see

03:37:59.120 --> 03:38:06.080
[Amit Varma]: something in a way that you didn't see before. And in your case, one as a general thing,

03:38:06.080 --> 03:38:10.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, when you look back as the young you, the 20 year old you, and you look at

03:38:10.600 --> 03:38:16.040
[Amit Varma]: you today, what are the layers that you think fell off? In what way are you kind of different

03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:22.160
[Amit Varma]: from that? And would this experience of having taken you to so many states for this show

03:38:22.160 --> 03:38:27.400
[Amit Varma]: and would also the experience of so much ground reporting, you know, actually, you know, getting

03:38:27.400 --> 03:38:31.900
[Amit Varma]: out in the field and, you know, even though a lot of ground reporting may have been back

03:38:31.900 --> 03:38:36.320
[Amit Varma]: in the day, you know, how did this make you see the country differently? Like if there's

03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:40.120
[Amit Varma]: a young person who, who has the same kind of background as you and I do, but they're

03:38:40.120 --> 03:38:43.640
[Amit Varma]: young, they're 22, what do you want to tell them that, bro, the world is not how you see

03:38:43.640 --> 03:38:49.760
[Guest]: it, but what else would you add to that? I mean, there are many things, but I mean, maybe

03:38:49.760 --> 03:38:55.520
[Guest]: the couple of things that are most important learnings for me were that, you know, I had

03:38:55.520 --> 03:39:03.000
[Guest]: this cockiness and arrogance that, that many people have, because, you know, I come from

03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:07.320
[Guest]: a home that is very well read, I have read so many books, I went to a good school, I

03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:12.880
[Guest]: passed exams fairly effortlessly, I never owned a textbook in my life. And yet I'd,

03:39:12.880 --> 03:39:19.440
[Guest]: you know, I'd pass, I may not top, and people would say, you know, you have that cockiness.

03:39:19.440 --> 03:39:25.080
[Guest]: The one thing that I learned through my travels with having a plate, the documentary films

03:39:25.080 --> 03:39:36.200
[Guest]: I shot, Arvind, everybody, the people who are in the gig, know the gig best. So, which

03:39:36.200 --> 03:39:42.840
[Guest]: is why central planning is something that I'm completely against the whole Swaraj model.

03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:48.080
[Guest]: And I'll illustrate this by one specific example, because while I was shooting having a plate,

03:39:48.080 --> 03:39:53.080
[Guest]: I was also flirting with activism at the time, you know, quote, unquote, again, you called

03:39:53.080 --> 03:39:57.840
[Guest]: yourself a journalist earlier, and you've spoken about that right now. Great. So you're

03:39:57.840 --> 03:40:02.520
[Amit Varma]: exhausting me to submission. This is the whole reason of for our podcast, you tire the person

03:40:02.520 --> 03:40:09.040
[Guest]: out and then they speak the truth. But, you know, we were in the Northeast, I think this

03:40:09.040 --> 03:40:15.680
[Guest]: must have been, maybe somewhere near Nagaland. I think this was in a village called Thembang,

03:40:15.680 --> 03:40:21.920
[Guest]: if I'm not wrong. And, you know, have you traveled to Arunachal Nagaland, etc? No, sadly

03:40:21.920 --> 03:40:26.560
[Guest]: not. It's really, I mean, now, of course, when you go into Arunachal, that you have

03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:29.840
[Guest]: to stop to show your inner line permit, etc. Now there's lots of shops there, where I had

03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:34.760
[Guest]: gone for the first time. It was like, you go then there's this deep green river and

03:40:34.760 --> 03:40:39.200
[Guest]: lush forest, like Jurassic Park, you know, it's a, it's very dramatic entry. And then

03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:43.480
[Guest]: as you go further, because they're clouds very low, now you like driving in and out

03:40:43.480 --> 03:40:50.080
[Guest]: of clouds. It's really, I mean, the visibility can be very low. And the weather isn't that

03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:54.000
[Guest]: great all the time. So, and you know, in the evening, when you're not shooting, you sit

03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:59.680
[Guest]: with whether you're in a village, you go. I was like, what would you want over here

03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:07.840
[Guest]: if you were given the funds in this local area? This is a cinema hall. Someone said

03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:16.000
[Guest]: a hall where we can have marriages, parties, you know, dance parties, music. I was like,

03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:23.120
[Guest]: dude, like, seriously, this is why, you know, central planning may be a good idea. What

03:41:23.120 --> 03:41:29.280
[Guest]: do they want? A cinema hall. They want a hall for parties. And then when you stay and talk,

03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:33.520
[Guest]: you understand why they said, because in our village, if any kid wants to watch a movie

03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:37.320
[Guest]: or wants any entertainment, they have to go to, you know, depending on which village,

03:41:37.320 --> 03:41:43.840
[Guest]: Kohima, Phunishalong. And you've seen the roads here. We lose whatever X amount of kids

03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:48.440
[Guest]: every year to accidents. If they had a place here, they wouldn't drive 40 kilometers away

03:41:48.440 --> 03:41:53.400
[Guest]: to watch a film or to go for a party or to play in a band. There should be one close

03:41:53.400 --> 03:41:58.600
[Guest]: by. And I'm like, you know, would a central planner here saying that, you know, in the

03:41:58.600 --> 03:42:05.080
[Guest]: Northeast, in these eight villages, what should we put? Would anyone say cinema hall? No man.

03:42:05.080 --> 03:42:09.840
[Guest]: Would they say a bloody hall for music system and a stage where people can perform? No.

03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:16.240
[Guest]: They say, Khamba lagao, bamboo lagao, whatever the fuck lagao. No, those guys know best.

03:42:16.240 --> 03:42:22.040
[Guest]: And when you sit and talk to them, you get. So one learning was that. Oh, lovely story,

03:42:22.040 --> 03:42:27.160
[Guest]: which you might like. I know your listeners would have said this on a Highway My Plate

03:42:27.160 --> 03:42:32.800
[Guest]: podcast. There's a place near Rajasthan called Sendra. It has the best dahi bhallas in the

03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:38.800
[Guest]: country. Now, before Pragati Padana was demolished, there used to be an annual food festival there

03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:47.160
[Guest]: and prizes are given that most, you know, best chart. These are winning best dahi bhalla

03:42:47.160 --> 03:42:53.720
[Guest]: for years. So we were supposed to go to Jaipur from Jaipur, you know, via Jaisalmer, ahead

03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:58.040
[Guest]: all that. But we had to make this detour to Sendra for dahi bhallas because our research

03:42:58.040 --> 03:43:01.960
[Guest]: showed that there's this place called Sendra. I was like, dude, we're going to take a hundred

03:43:01.960 --> 03:43:08.320
[Guest]: kilometre detour for dahi bhallas, like one sequence. And as a producer, you're thinking,

03:43:08.320 --> 03:43:11.600
[Guest]: is it worth the trip? So I was in any case in a very negative frame of mind. I was like,

03:43:11.600 --> 03:43:15.760
[Guest]: how special can dahi bhalla be? So while I was sitting there, you know, waiting for the

03:43:15.760 --> 03:43:23.200
[Guest]: shot to be set up, I was telling Rocky, bloody fucking what, two hour detour for dahi bhalla.

03:43:23.200 --> 03:43:29.200
[Guest]: How special can dahi bhalla be? Dahi bhalla is dahi bhalla. The guy heard me. Now you're

03:43:29.200 --> 03:43:34.200
[Guest]: cocky, arrogant, city slicker. Isko angrezi nahi aati hogi. Usko toh saare aati hi thi.

03:43:34.200 --> 03:43:38.280
[Guest]: Although he was dressed in his, you know. He said, aapne kahi yeh scotch whisky baat

03:43:38.280 --> 03:43:43.280
[Guest]: se boor rahe hai? Whisky toh whisky hai. Scotch wali kyu khaas hai? Aur yahan aamari wali

03:43:43.280 --> 03:43:49.200
[Guest]: kyu achi nahi hai? Maine kahi, bataiye. He says, kyunki Scotland ki stream hai ta, uska

03:43:49.200 --> 03:43:54.200
[Guest]: paani khaas hota hai. Unki hawa khaas hoti hai. Wo jin lakdi mein rakhta hai, wo lakdi

03:43:54.200 --> 03:43:59.200
[Guest]: khaas hoti hai. Toh wo taste aapko yahan mili nahi sakta. Hamari jo gai hai, jisse ham

03:43:59.200 --> 03:44:05.200
[Guest]: dood nikalenge, uska jo dahi banta hai. Is hawa mein banta hai. Jo ghaas wo khaati hai.

03:44:05.200 --> 03:44:09.200
[Guest]: Jo ham paani use karte hai. Aap jaante hain, jab aapko Delhi aate hain, Pragati Meydan

03:44:09.200 --> 03:44:13.200
[Guest]: dahi bhalle banane. Ham teen tanker yahan se laate hain, aapke paani se nahi banate

03:44:13.200 --> 03:44:18.200
[Guest]: dahi bhalle ham. Agar scotch whisky khaas hoti hai, dahi bhalla khaas kyu nahi hoti

03:44:18.200 --> 03:44:21.200
[Guest]: hai. Toh nahi hoti hai. I was like, fuck man, that makes sense. He says, aap yahan

03:44:21.200 --> 03:44:24.200
[Guest]: se, main aapko bata doong hain hum kya kya daalte hain, kitna daalte hain. Dil mein

03:44:24.200 --> 03:44:29.200
[Guest]: bana ke dekha doon. Nahi aapke paas hamara paani hai, nahi meri ghaas hai, nahi meri

03:44:29.200 --> 03:44:35.200
[Guest]: ghaas hai. Aap se banega hi nahi. I said, okay, fuck you, Niku. You fucking talk too

03:44:35.200 --> 03:44:39.200
[Amit Varma]: much. Shut the fuck up. You know. How were the dahi bhallas? Outstanding, dude. And

03:44:39.200 --> 03:44:44.200
[Guest]: I'm not a dahi bhalla guy. And I was like, fuck, you're right, man. There is something

03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:51.200
[Guest]: about this which is, I can't get in Delhi. And I mean, other than the film that I want

03:44:51.200 --> 03:44:54.200
[Guest]: to make, one thing that I want to do is, with Rocky, Mayur and Prashant, I want to write

03:44:54.200 --> 03:45:01.200
[Guest]: a book on Highway Unplayed. We have about 12,000 photographs. And Prashant and Rocky

03:45:01.200 --> 03:45:06.200
[Guest]: aap photograph ki raas. They were fucking, I'm an impatient guy when I'm shooting. And

03:45:06.200 --> 03:45:09.200
[Guest]: photographers are impatient. They're saying, wait, abhi aa raha hai, kadik. I said, we

03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:14.200
[Guest]: have to make 500 kilometers today. Ek aur photograph, kadik, kadik. Fuck, they would

03:45:14.200 --> 03:45:21.200
[Guest]: just maro my bund by bloody taking pictures. But now I see why. Because we have got pictures

03:45:21.200 --> 03:45:27.200
[Guest]: from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to fucking Arunachal. Like, I have a big poster

03:45:27.200 --> 03:45:31.200
[Guest]: in my house, which has about 100 pictures, this, this, this, this size. It starts off

03:45:31.200 --> 03:45:35.200
[Guest]: on the left corner with Kashmir, ends with Kanyakumari, and there's every state in the

03:45:35.200 --> 03:45:42.200
[Guest]: front, like from Somnath Temple to Ajmer to bloody Nagaland to Tawang Monastery to Leh.

03:45:42.200 --> 03:45:50.200
[Guest]: That is one mission that I want, that this book has stories of, and I'm not saying this

03:45:50.200 --> 03:45:56.200
[Guest]: in the chest-thumping that I love my India, Subhash Ghai or Akshay Kumar way, but the

03:45:56.200 --> 03:46:02.200
[Guest]: magic that, that being out there does. Probably this will happen to any country, but our country

03:46:02.200 --> 03:46:06.200
[Guest]: is very diverse. I think there's one cliche about India, that is that everything you say

03:46:06.200 --> 03:46:10.200
[Guest]: about India, the opposite is also true. Yeah, exactly. We are extremely kind, we are very

03:46:10.200 --> 03:46:15.200
[Guest]: cruel. What, what Veer Das has just said, which he's got a lot of flack for, he's making

03:46:15.200 --> 03:46:19.200
[Guest]: a different point, but everything I say about India is the opposite, also very true. We

03:46:19.200 --> 03:46:24.200
[Guest]: are extremely cruel and callous because of how we see lynchings happen in front of us.

03:46:24.200 --> 03:46:30.200
[Guest]: Like, in a country which is not considered so civilized as the US, even if a guy who

03:46:30.200 --> 03:46:34.200
[Guest]: looks like me with a beard, brown skin and all, if I'm suffering with someone, I'll be

03:46:34.200 --> 03:46:39.200
[Guest]: like, dude, you okay? Can I help you? Like in Germany, this guy really poached my cab.

03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:42.200
[Guest]: The guys in line said, we're really sorry, Germany is not like this. That guy is not

03:46:42.200 --> 03:46:47.200
[Guest]: from here. And they got me a cab because I was standing in line, the line was behind

03:46:47.200 --> 03:46:52.200
[Guest]: me and some guy just came and took the cab. Would that happen here? No. And we said, we

03:46:52.200 --> 03:47:01.200
[Guest]: are more civilized? No. But yes, here, when, you know, I was unwell, bloody people who

03:47:01.200 --> 03:47:06.200
[Guest]: you can't stand will come and give you blood when, and people who we don't see eye to eye

03:47:06.200 --> 03:47:10.200
[Guest]: to, we fight so much, yeah. Politically, we are on opposite sides. Prashant is, you know,

03:47:10.200 --> 03:47:14.200
[Guest]: Sushant's brother, Sushant sir, you see him on times often. He is as right as they come

03:47:14.200 --> 03:47:19.200
[Guest]: and I remember we used to fight so much. When I needed blood, he was there. He says, dude,

03:47:19.200 --> 03:47:25.200
[Guest]: I'm like 100 kilos, take two liters from me, you know. It's very complicated. And if that

03:47:25.200 --> 03:47:30.200
[Guest]: is something that I want to do, maybe, you know, when I'm, if I live to be 60, 65, maybe

03:47:30.200 --> 03:47:35.200
[Guest]: I'll spend five years finally putting all these pictures together and writing my travels

03:47:35.200 --> 03:47:41.200
[Guest]: and learnings from people like this guy who used to run this small dosa shop between,

03:47:41.200 --> 03:47:46.200
[Guest]: where do all the South Indian chefs come from? What's that? Udipi. Udipi to Mangalore, I

03:47:46.200 --> 03:47:51.200
[Guest]: think that was a stretch. He runs a small dosa shop. He's, he didn't even have two clothes

03:47:51.200 --> 03:47:58.200
[Guest]: to cover his body. We were a crew of 10. We must have eaten like 500 worth of dosa. We

03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:02.200
[Guest]: said, eat, okay. And we had a policy, we'd pay, otherwise we will not review it because

03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:07.200
[Guest]: you can't go eat for free and say that we. So we tell all the dhaba owners, restaurants,

03:48:07.200 --> 03:48:11.200
[Guest]: and then they'd understand, you know, all the hospitality, because after Rocky Mahir

03:48:11.200 --> 03:48:15.200
[Guest]: became big names, people would want to see us review. So we said, and people would say,

03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:20.200
[Guest]: we won't feature you. Then they'd say, okay, fine. Take the money. This guy said, I won't

03:48:20.200 --> 03:48:25.200
[Guest]: take money. I said, dude, you can't not take money. There are fucking 10 of us. Your hole

03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:33.200
[Guest]: in the wall is worth less than one wheel of a car. So please, please, no, no, no, no.

03:48:33.200 --> 03:48:37.200
[Guest]: And you know, there was a language barrier because then I usually pull out my Trump card

03:48:37.200 --> 03:48:39.200
[Guest]: and then we won't feature you on the show because that's our policy. He says, don't

03:48:39.200 --> 03:48:43.200
[Guest]: feature me. He said, I don't want to be featured in your show. It's late at night. You've

03:48:43.200 --> 03:48:48.200
[Guest]: come here. I enjoyed talking to you. I fed you those cells. I'm not going to take money

03:48:48.200 --> 03:48:52.200
[Guest]: from you. If that means you don't feature me, don't feature me. You know, you fucking

03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:56.200
[Guest]: meet magical people who have nothing and will give you everything. So, and you can't cross

03:48:56.200 --> 03:49:01.200
[Amit Varma]: dicks also. So yeah, someday. Yeah. I mean, that cliche is one. In fact, I keep repeating

03:49:01.200 --> 03:49:05.200
[Amit Varma]: about the opposite also being true in India. I'd done an episode with JP Narayan where

03:49:05.200 --> 03:49:11.200
[Amit Varma]: I put to him, I mentioned what an illiberal society India had. And of course I meant things

03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:15.200
[Amit Varma]: like how we treat women, caste, all of that. And he said at the same time, it's very liberal

03:49:15.200 --> 03:49:18.200
[Amit Varma]: in some ways. You look at the cuisine, look at the food, which you ate. Everything in

03:49:18.200 --> 03:49:23.200
[Amit Varma]: every meal you must have eaten has really come from all over the place. And just to

03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:29.200
[Amit Varma]: add something to this Dahi Valla angle, one angle he probably forgot is that, for example,

03:49:29.200 --> 03:49:35.200
[Amit Varma]: why do people eat so much tomato juice when they're flying? Because at that altitude,

03:49:35.200 --> 03:49:41.200
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't taste but taste and tomato juice, tomato juice tastes better for that way, which

03:49:41.200 --> 03:49:44.200
[Amit Varma]: is why they sell more of it up there than down here. So maybe there's something to that

03:49:44.200 --> 03:49:49.200
[Amit Varma]: as well. And yeah, and I, of course, you know, as you would know, I have a deep distaste

03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:55.200
[Amit Varma]: for central planning, but that is one way in which Modiji and Heruji are exactly the

03:49:55.200 --> 03:50:00.200
[Amit Varma]: same, great belief in doing everything from the top down. So I'm, you know, I've really

03:50:00.200 --> 03:50:03.200
[Amit Varma]: taken enough of your time and you've been very kind with your time and insights. I'm

03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:09.200
[Amit Varma]: going to ask you one final question, which I can't help but ask, which I ask all my guests.

03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:13.200
[Amit Varma]: I'd like you to recommend some books for my listeners to read, books that might have

03:50:13.200 --> 03:50:17.200
[Amit Varma]: shaped you, changed you in some way that are dear to you, or even books where you want

03:50:17.200 --> 03:50:23.200
[Amit Varma]: to stand on a soapbox and shout, read this book, please read this book.

03:50:23.200 --> 03:50:31.200
[Guest]: Okay, that's a difficult one because there's so many and also what phase of life are we

03:50:31.200 --> 03:50:37.200
[Guest]: talking about? Like, I would not recommend, you know, Guha's India After Gandhi or many

03:50:37.200 --> 03:50:42.200
[Guest]: of his books, because I think he, because his wealth of knowledge is so immense, he

03:50:42.200 --> 03:50:47.200
[Guest]: can tell you a story that would ordinarily take someone 100,000 words, he can tell it

03:50:47.200 --> 03:50:52.200
[Guest]: to you in 10,000. So India After Gandhi can tell you a lot about the odds that India was

03:50:52.200 --> 03:50:59.200
[Guest]: shaped in with, in a fairly, I mean, think about how big the country is, keeping that

03:50:59.200 --> 03:51:04.200
[Guest]: in mind. So, you know, but I would not recommend that to someone who's in class 10, 11, 12,

03:51:04.200 --> 03:51:08.200
[Guest]: or even first year college. Maybe you should read that if you're in your 20s or 30s. I

03:51:08.200 --> 03:51:13.200
[Guest]: would not recommend Thomas Hardy to anyone who's maybe mid to late 20s.

03:51:13.200 --> 03:51:18.200
[Amit Varma]: Let me give a twist to that. What would 47 year old Niku recommend to the 20 year old Niku?

03:51:18.200 --> 03:51:23.200
[Guest]: Oh, dear God, that PG Woodhouse is going over your head. So fucking don't waste your time

03:51:23.200 --> 03:51:25.200
[Guest]: by reading them just because your mother says they're funny.

03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:27.200
[Amit Varma]: I love PG Woodhouse but continue.

03:51:27.200 --> 03:51:37.200
[Guest]: Yeah, but yeah, I would recommend, you know, honestly, I read a lot for my age. So I actually

03:51:37.200 --> 03:51:43.200
[Guest]: wouldn't. But what I will say is that books that have completely knocked my socks off

03:51:43.200 --> 03:51:50.200
[Guest]: is M and the Big Whom by Jerry Pinto. I think, and you know, I've read some other books

03:51:50.200 --> 03:51:56.200
[Guest]: of Jerry after that, which are not that great, but don't hold me to it. But I will hazard

03:51:56.200 --> 03:52:01.200
[Guest]: saying that that's probably the best book by an Indian author I have ever read. His

03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:08.200
[Guest]: mastery over the language, his craft, and not just that even Rushdie has. Rushdie is

03:52:08.200 --> 03:52:13.200
[Guest]: very good at language and I would also recommend Shame. Highly recommend Shame. For me, it's

03:52:13.200 --> 03:52:19.200
[Guest]: better than Midnight's Children. But he's able to communicate the most profound emotions

03:52:19.200 --> 03:52:24.200
[Guest]: in like four words. Like how the fuck does he do that? And that story, it is so honest.

03:52:24.200 --> 03:52:32.200
[Guest]: It is so identifiable. You can see many of your life instances there. So I'd say M and

03:52:32.200 --> 03:52:38.200
[Guest]: the Big Whom is a must read for anyone. When I read it and when you send a wave, I read

03:52:38.200 --> 03:52:45.200
[Guest]: it, I closed it. Next day, I bought five copies. And whoever I met in the next week, I said,

03:52:45.200 --> 03:52:49.200
[Guest]: here, read this book, read this book, read this book. So that very few books have had

03:52:49.200 --> 03:52:54.200
[Guest]: that effect on me. M and the Big Whom is one. I loved Shame by Rushdie. I think Thomas Hardy

03:52:54.200 --> 03:52:59.200
[Guest]: should be read when you're in young twenties. It has an idyllic romance in it. And I think

03:52:59.200 --> 03:53:03.200
[Guest]: when you're that age, you should be a romantic. Fuck politics. It'll come to you eventually.

03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:08.200
[Guest]: You know, think of the romance and the beautiful things in the world. I mean, so in your early

03:53:08.200 --> 03:53:16.200
[Guest]: twenties, you know, I would say, you know, I loved it was panned by critics. I loved

03:53:16.200 --> 03:53:21.200
[Guest]: The Ground Beneath Her Feet by Rushdie. I even liked Shalimar the Clown a lot. I loved

03:53:21.200 --> 03:53:26.200
[Guest]: Brightened Rock by Graham Greene. I mean, it's like a punch in the gut. You know, the

03:53:26.200 --> 03:53:32.200
[Guest]: darkness that he creates, you get depressed. That's the thing about books. There's so

03:53:32.200 --> 03:53:38.200
[Guest]: many dozens and hundreds of them. Like for me, The Great Gatsby was like a wonderful

03:53:38.200 --> 03:53:42.200
[Guest]: book and it was so thin. It's the only book that I finished because also because it was

03:53:42.200 --> 03:53:48.200
[Guest]: thin and I was on a flight and I flipped it over and started reading it again. Because

03:53:48.200 --> 03:53:52.200
[Guest]: you know, you just, and then later so many things fall into place because then you're

03:53:52.200 --> 03:53:56.200
[Guest]: curious about Fitzgerald. Why did he write it? What was this Gilded Age all about? What

03:53:56.200 --> 03:54:02.200
[Guest]: was he commenting on? But today to people you're in my age whose eyes are getting weaker,

03:54:02.200 --> 03:54:09.200
[Guest]: I recommend podcasts because they are a fantastic way to learn. And Real Dictators is one that

03:54:09.200 --> 03:54:15.200
[Guest]: I highly recommend. It is just phenomenal. And also before I finish, I must plug News

03:54:15.200 --> 03:54:21.200
[Guest]: Laundry and I will say all for Amit's listeners, mail me at abhinandansekri at gmail.com. I

03:54:21.200 --> 03:54:27.200
[Guest]: repeat, abhinandansekri at gmail.com and we'll get you 25% off and we'll also send you a

03:54:27.200 --> 03:54:31.200
[Guest]: gift hamper from News Laundry. If you're in India, I can't ship it overseas, but if you

03:54:31.200 --> 03:54:35.200
[Guest]: give me an Indian address, I'll ship it. So you can mail me and we'll give you a 25%

03:54:35.200 --> 03:54:39.200
