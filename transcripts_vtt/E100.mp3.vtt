00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
[Amit Varma]: The driving theme of my life is procrastination.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, my epitaph could be,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Here lies a man who waited and waited,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and now the wait is over.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[Amit Varma]: I find it hard to get things started,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
[Amit Varma]: or to keep them going once I do get them started.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
[Amit Varma]: It was different with the seen and the unseen.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
[Amit Varma]: When Amit Doshi, who runs I.V.M. podcast,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
[Amit Varma]: came to me and asked if I wanted to do a podcast with him,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
[Amit Varma]: I said no.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I didn't listen to podcasts,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I didn't understand why other people listen to podcasts,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
[Amit Varma]: I wasn't interested.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
[Amit Varma]: But he persisted,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
[Amit Varma]: and I mentioned an idea I had for a TV interview show

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to do one day,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: called the seen and the unseen.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
[Amit Varma]: He said, hey, let's do a podcast instead.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And I figured, yeah,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
[Amit Varma]: television wasn't happening anytime soon,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: so why not, let's jump into this.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: We did one episode,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
[Amit Varma]: then another,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and another.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And here we are now,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
[Amit Varma]: 100 episodes.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
[Amit Varma]: The basic principle that got me here,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
[Amit Varma]: take one step,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and then just keep putting one foot in front of the other.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
[Amit Varma]: There's a life lesson in there that I need to learn from.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral science.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: How does one celebrate a 100th episode?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I like to keep celebrations low-key.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't like to celebrate my birthday and so on.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
[Amit Varma]: But I thought the least I can do for my 100th episode

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
[Amit Varma]: is get a special guest on the show.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Not some celebrity superstar or a big public intellectual,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
[Amit Varma]: but someone with whom I can always reliably have conversations that are special,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
[Amit Varma]: at least for me.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is my good friend, Shruti Rajgopalan,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
[Amit Varma]: who teaches economics at Purchase College in New York,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
[Amit Varma]: but happens to be here in Mumbai now.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: So this is actually going to be a face-to-face conversation,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Amit Varma]: unlike the Skype conversations we usually have.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
[Amit Varma]: I think this is her 8th appearance on the show,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: and quite apart from the fact that she is so brilliant and insightful.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
[Amit Varma]: I think it might be because she is the one person I know

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
[Amit Varma]: whose views are closest to mine.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
[Amit Varma]: We agree with each other on most things,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: which leads to two possible reasons for why I like having her on the show.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
[Amit Varma]: One, she validates my sparkling insights.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Two, she confirms my biases.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm inclined to think it's a former, but that could just be my bias.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Before we start shooting the breeze though, a quick commercial break.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
[Amit Varma]: but can't really afford to have paintings by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more. Head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
[Amit Varma]: from some of the best artists in India,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
[Amit Varma]: and adapts them into objects of everyday use.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
[Amit Varma]: These include wearable art, like stoles and shrugs,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
[Amit Varma]: home decor like cushion covers and table runners,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and accessories like tote bags.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
[Amit Varma]: and artists get royalties on sales, just like authors do.

[Amit Varma]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
[Amit Varma]: including fridge magnets with some stunning motifs,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
[Amit Varma]: and salad bowls and platters made of mango wood.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vasvo x Vasvo,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Brinda Miller, Dilip Sharma, Shruti Nelson, and Pradeep Mishra.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
[Amit Varma]: They accept bulk orders for corporate and festival gifting,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
[Amit Varma]: but even if you want to buy just for yourself or a friend,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
[Amit Varma]: head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000

[Amit Varma]: And if you want a 20% discount, apply the code IVM20.

[Amit Varma]: That's I-V-M for IVM Podcast.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:12.000
[Amit Varma]: IVM20 for a 20% discount at IndianColors.com.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
[Guest]: There's a slight, like maybe half a second delay,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
[Guest]: and sometimes we've spoken over each other just for half a sentence.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
[Guest]: I'll do my best to do the same in the studio.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Right. So you made a list of kind of, you know,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
[Amit Varma]: the impressions that have stayed with you over a hundred episodes,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
[Amit Varma]: or the last 99 episodes of the seen and the unseen.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
[Guest]: So first, I must congratulate you.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[Guest]: What works, what doesn't work?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
[Guest]: Well, I don't know about that.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
[Guest]: I don't think of these things very critically in terms,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Guest]: I'm not judging every guest and every person.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
[Guest]: I usually think of it as, you know,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
[Guest]: some kind of a learning exercise that usually most of your guests

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
[Guest]: have an insight that I wouldn't have thought of.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
[Guest]: And even if the insight is, you know, very straightforward,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
[Guest]: and it's a simple idea,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
[Guest]: they bring in a particular amount of context to the area of the world

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
[Guest]: that they're speaking about, which I learn a lot from.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
[Guest]: So I usually think of this in a sort of professorial way

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
[Guest]: of how do you more critically engage with ideas.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
[Guest]: I'm not very critical about the guests.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Guest]: I'm my favorite guest on your show.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
[Guest]: No, I'm kidding. I have a few favorites.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
[Guest]: I really loved Gunwant Patil. I think he was amazing.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
[Guest]: What I loved about his show was he has recognized the first principles

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
[Guest]: of liberty and markets, but not the way I did,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
[Guest]: coming from books from Adam Smith and Frederick Hayek

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
[Guest]: and Frederick Bastiat and so on.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
[Guest]: It's sort of like farming. He's sort of homegrown, you know.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
[Guest]: He just, through experience, he's figured out that state coercion

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
[Guest]: has really led to the misery of farmers.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
[Guest]: And instead of treating the symptoms the way most of the elites

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
[Guest]: want to treat just the loans or just the subsidies,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
[Guest]: he has really thought about the core problem,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
[Guest]: which is that farmers are denied choice.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
[Guest]: And he was so eloquent about it. He is by far my most favorite guest.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
[Amit Varma]: No, and you know, it's interesting.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Amit Varma]: I remember WhatsApping you at the time in great excitement.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Our good friend, Barun Mitra, had organized his farmer's conference

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
[Amit Varma]: in Deolali in Nasik, which had a bunch of these

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Shedkari Sangatana leaders who'd worked with Sharad Joshi.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And he wanted Bharat to meet India, in his words.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[Amit Varma]: So he took a bunch of English-speaking Bombay people along,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
[Amit Varma]: me being one of them.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And the fascinating thing I realized there was, you know,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
[Amit Varma]: I always had the impression, which I now realize to be mistaken,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
[Amit Varma]: that our ideas, being so counterintuitive,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
[Amit Varma]: will necessarily be the ideas of the elite.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And when I got there, I realized that, my God, that, you know,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
[Amit Varma]: the way we view the world, many of these farmer leaders,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
[Amit Varma]: like Gunwant Patil ji, Manvendra Kachole ji,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
[Amit Varma]: and a bunch of, you know, really fine, deep thinkers,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
[Amit Varma]: the way we view the world is pretty common,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
[Amit Varma]: in the sense we've arrived at the same place, but in different ways.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
[Amit Varma]: I've arrived at there by finding these ideas in books,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
[Amit Varma]: thinking, ha, this makes sense, and then applying them to the real world,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and over a period of time, they kind of get validated.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
[Amit Varma]: These guys don't care about the books.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
[Amit Varma]: These guys have seen, you know, life playing out and affecting them,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and from that, they've come to these, what we would call libertarian conclusions,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, they've reached Hayak without reaching Hayak,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
[Amit Varma]: they've reached Friedman without reading Friedman,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Amit Varma]: which is just, which was incredibly fascinating,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and that was the one Hindi episode I did,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
[Amit Varma]: because I just wanted him to be comfortable,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
[Guest]: and what did you think of my Hindi?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
[Guest]: Your Hindi is terrible.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
[Unknown]: Okay, don't say that.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
[Unknown]: I grew up in Delhi, so I have high standards.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
[Guest]: Gunwan ji's Hindi is excellent.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
[Unknown]: Obviously.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
[Guest]: So I really enjoyed that episode.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
[Guest]: I know for some of your listeners,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
[Guest]: the Hindi language bar might have been a bit difficult,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
[Guest]: but I was very comfortable listening to him,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
[Guest]: and in fact, the thing that both of us picked up on,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
[Guest]: which is that they think of these ideas in a non-academic way,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
[Guest]: I think that might be more productive than the way we think about it,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
[Guest]: because we think about it in a particular box,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
[Guest]: parts dependent on the literature that we have read,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Guest]: and then what we have read, we try to apply to the real world

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
[Guest]: that we see in front of us.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
[Guest]: Theirs are just so naturally intuitive and seamless,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
[Guest]: I think the way they communicate those ideas

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
[Guest]: might just be a tad better than what we are trying to do.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
[Amit Varma]: That's the one big thing I got from the episode.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's pretty mind-blowing also,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, I got so much feedback after that episode,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
[Amit Varma]: saying that, wow, this has completely opened my mind,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
[Amit Varma]: I didn't know these were the problems,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
[Amit Varma]: and I was thinking that, okay, for like 15 years,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
[Amit Varma]: I've been writing columns about exactly these problems,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
[Amit Varma]: but yeah, it's completely different when he says it in his voice,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
[Amit Varma]: in his language, and he contextualizes it

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
[Amit Varma]: in his own personal experience and pain,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
[Amit Varma]: and that reaches out and makes a difference.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
[Guest]: Yeah, and he was a very natural guest,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
[Guest]: like all the emotion was right there,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
[Guest]: his frustrations with the government,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
[Guest]: his frustrations when he was describing BT cotton,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Guest]: and how he was so thrilled that they did it on the sly,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
[Guest]: and then it became so big that they couldn't quite ban it,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
[Guest]: and so he was a very natural sort of,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
[Guest]: so I really loved him, I loved Gunwanji.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
[Amit Varma]: That was episode 86, and before you tell me your other favorites,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
[Amit Varma]: I got to tell you that your first episode with me

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Amit Varma]: was Right to Property, right?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And that was a transitional episode for me,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that before that,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: my impression was I have to hook people onto the show,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Amit Varma]: and I'd been told that the data shows

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
[Amit Varma]: that about 20-minute interviews are the way to go,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and that's your sweet spot,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
[Amit Varma]: and people don't like to listen to more than that,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and I used to aim for 20 minutes,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[Amit Varma]: which is mind-blowing to think of it now.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
[Amit Varma]: I even had a 10-minute episode with Mohit Satyanand.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
[Amit Varma]: I remember.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is a miniature masterpiece, but it's a miniature.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And then my episode with you on Right to Property

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
[Amit Varma]: went for an hour, and I thought,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
[Amit Varma]: what a nice conversation this was, you know,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and why am I doing 20 minutes?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And then as I became a regular podcast listener myself,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
[Amit Varma]: and started binging on other interview shows like Sam Harris and so on,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
[Amit Varma]: I realized that, hey, most people who listen to podcasts regularly

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
[Amit Varma]: listen at double speed.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
[Amit Varma]: So if you have a 20-minute show,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
[Amit Varma]: by the time you've put on your shoes to go jogging outside,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
[Amit Varma]: the 10 minutes are gone.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
[Amit Varma]: That's double speed.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
[Amit Varma]: It's all over.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And the kind of podcast I would crave to listen to

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
[Amit Varma]: would be two-hour conversations, three-hour conversations,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
[Amit Varma]: like Sam Harris sometimes, Joe Rogan,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
[Amit Varma]: or Dan Carlin's Great Hardcore History podcast,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
[Amit Varma]: and I thought I need to do more of those,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
[Amit Varma]: and we reached a stage where now I aim for a minimum of an hour,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
[Amit Varma]: otherwise I feel like it wasn't rewarding enough.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And...

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
[Guest]: My podcast listening habits are similar.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
[Guest]: So I listen to the podcast on the subway

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
[Guest]: when I'm walking the dog or in the car,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
[Guest]: and I thought I was the exception,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
[Guest]: that I like really long conversations.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
[Guest]: I remember when we did the Right to Property,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
[Guest]: I even said, should we break at some point?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
[Guest]: Do we need to re-record something?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
[Guest]: And later my husband pointed out to me the same thing that you said,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
[Guest]: that it's double speed, and he said traffic is so bad in most places

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
[Guest]: that it's not like you're getting anywhere from point A to point B in 10 minutes.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
[Guest]: So most people are stuck in a car or some kind of mass public transit

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
[Guest]: for at least 40, 45 minutes,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
[Guest]: and that seems to be an unexpected boon for podcasters.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Traffic is our killer app.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
[Guest]: Or our friend.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Traffic is our friend.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
[Guest]: So what are the other episodes which...

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
[Guest]: So, you know, I mean, some personally,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
[Guest]: like I think the one you did with Vishwanath,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
[Amit Varma]: the Zen Rain Man episode on...

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Vishwanath Sikandar, yeah.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
[Guest]: Yeah, he was really great.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
[Guest]: I don't know very much about water conservation in India.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
[Guest]: I know in general about common pool resource problems, right?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
[Guest]: The tragedy of commons that we keep talking about.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
[Guest]: So the stuff that he spoke about both academically resonated with me

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
[Guest]: and also like I've grown up in India, right?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
[Guest]: We've all had the days when your mother said

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
[Guest]: take half a bucket of water and you're done.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
[Guest]: So it just resonated with me,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
[Guest]: but the types of ideas he talked about, again,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
[Guest]: were just so ground up, no pun intended,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
[Guest]: and so sort of counterintuitive but very practical.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
[Guest]: And his general theme that we need to keep it local

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
[Guest]: and involve local communities,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
[Guest]: I think that is an underappreciated idea in India.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Guest]: We want Sarkar to do everything

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
[Guest]: and Sarkar usually means some centralized power.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
[Guest]: And even in politics, we usually look to who is the prime minister

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
[Guest]: and not who is your municipal corporator or something like that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
[Guest]: So I think that episode really hooked me on.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, how was the chatting with him?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
[Amit Varma]: It was great.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Our mutual friend Gautam John put me on to him

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
[Amit Varma]: and Gautam said you've got to speak to him

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and obviously I take Gautam.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if Gautam is recommending someone,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
[Amit Varma]: then that person is good.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Amit Varma]: So I requested an interview, fixed it up,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
[Amit Varma]: he got there, I didn't know what to expect.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[Amit Varma]: So that was one of those episodes which surprised me

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
[Amit Varma]: in the depth of insight that he came up with

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and which surprised a lot of people

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
[Amit Varma]: because it's always continuously got great feedback since then.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, that was really good.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, sometimes what happens is that

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
[Amit Varma]: you have a guest from whom you expect a lot

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and things just don't work out.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe sometimes you can't get into that easy conversational flow

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
[Amit Varma]: that you crave during a conversation like this

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and that doesn't happen

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and sometimes they don't open up enough

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
[Amit Varma]: and the stars don't align.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes you have a guest

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[Amit Varma]: you have like no expectations from at all

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
[Guest]: and boom, you end up with something that's kind of soul-marketing.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
[Guest]: Yeah, he was really, I mean, he was so great.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
[Guest]: And you know, the simple idea,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
[Guest]: we don't think of water that way,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
[Guest]: but water is renewable.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
[Guest]: It replenishes every day.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
[Guest]: So the things that he's talking about

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
[Guest]: are not even long-term,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
[Guest]: you know, we need to do this over a period of 10 years or 20 years.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
[Guest]: You'll see the results quite quickly.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
[Guest]: So even from the start of his ideas

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
[Guest]: to when we get better water resources

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
[Guest]: for the local community,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
[Guest]: I think it was very valuable.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
[Guest]: I really hope his ideas

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
[Guest]: get a bigger market

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
[Guest]: and can convert into action

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
[Amit Varma]: in more places.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is something you were kind of pointing out

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
[Amit Varma]: earlier when we were having lunch before this

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
[Amit Varma]: and you were having phool kopi short shared over Calcutta,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
[Amit Varma]: which the chef had to make specially for us

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
[Amit Varma]: because it's off-menu.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And you were pointing out that

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
[Amit Varma]: the episodes which kind of resonated with you

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
[Amit Varma]: were the ones with that single big idea

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
[Guest]: which can actually make a difference.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I really, I mean,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
[Guest]: this one I'm biased because Alex Tabarrok

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
[Guest]: is one of my former professors and a co-author

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
[Guest]: and, you know, you've met him.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
[Guest]: He's just one of the most brilliant economists

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
[Amit Varma]: and insightful people.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Such a lovely man, yeah.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Very lovely and generous.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
[Guest]: Yes, and also very lovely and generous,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
[Guest]: but also like just one of the best

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
[Guest]: insightful economists that I have met.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
[Guest]: I use his and Tyler Cowen's book

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
[Guest]: in my principal's class.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
[Guest]: It's full of gems like this.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Your reference was FSI episode.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
[Guest]: He did two.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
[Amit Varma]: He did one on rent control and one on FSI.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
[Guest]: I think rent control,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
[Guest]: we've all been hammering away at it.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
[Guest]: And if you live in Mumbai,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
[Guest]: it's really hard to be a fan of rent control.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
[Guest]: With the FSI episode,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
[Guest]: what I really loved about it,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
[Guest]: and this you see in a lot of Alex's work,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
[Guest]: it's, I mean, after all,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
[Guest]: their site is called Marginal Revolution,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
[Guest]: a small step to change the world, right?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
[Guest]: So it's a small idea

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
[Guest]: which could completely change many things.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
[Guest]: It can change the architecture of Bombay, right?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
[Guest]: We live tall instead of live broad, right?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
[Guest]: We live in smaller clusters.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
[Guest]: We think of distance very differently.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
[Guest]: We may start walking to work

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
[Guest]: instead of taking a car to work, right?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
[Guest]: Prices may drop,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
[Guest]: so there's more mixed living

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
[Guest]: in the sense that, you know,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
[Guest]: the person who comes to drive my car,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
[Guest]: the person who comes to do the housekeeping at home

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
[Guest]: doesn't have to travel an hour in a local train

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
[Guest]: to come and work in our homes

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
[Guest]: or something like that.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
[Guest]: So, you know, it becomes more affordable.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
[Guest]: And then, you know, cities,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
[Guest]: as a landscape, they generate ideas.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
[Guest]: Cities are basically labor markets

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
[Guest]: and they're innovation markets.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
[Guest]: What kind of ideas can be generated

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
[Guest]: if you're not spending all our time

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
[Guest]: in individual silos and cars on the road

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
[Guest]: and instead spending it in communities,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
[Guest]: spending it in public areas,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
[Guest]: spending it walking around,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
[Guest]: spending it listening to podcasts

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
[Guest]: and in closer proximity with other people?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
[Guest]: I think there's also a huge equalizing factor.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
[Guest]: If you look at cities like Hong Kong and New York,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
[Guest]: which are tall as opposed to sprawled out,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
[Guest]: everyone at every income level

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
[Guest]: has to interact with each other.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
[Guest]: I go to the Metropolitan Opera,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
[Guest]: which is a fairly elite sort of interest,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
[Guest]: even in New York.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
[Guest]: And the moment the opera is over,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
[Guest]: everyone is walking out to the same subway.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
[Guest]: And there is something very lovely about that

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
[Guest]: in that we genuinely,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
[Guest]: despite our income and class differences,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
[Guest]: we can genuinely interact with each other,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
[Guest]: make eye contact

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
[Guest]: when we're in the same subway compartment

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
[Guest]: and things like that.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
[Guest]: So a simple thing like changing the FSI

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
[Guest]: can have very long-term consequences

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
[Guest]: on the kind of spontaneous order

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
[Amit Varma]: that emerges for the lack of a better word.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll just sum it up for my listeners

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
[Amit Varma]: by saying FSI basically is how tall

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
[Amit Varma]: you're allowed to make your buildings.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And Bombay has a very low FSI of around 1.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of cities around the world

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
[Amit Varma]: have FSIs of 15, 25, 30, and so on,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
[Amit Varma]: like New York and Hong Kong.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And Alex's point can be summed up

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
[Amit Varma]: in just three words.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Reclaim the sky.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, we are restricted

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
[Amit Varma]: by how much land we have access to.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Don't think of reclaiming the sea

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
[Amit Varma]: or reclaiming land.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Reclaim the sky.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
[Amit Varma]: Just build upwards.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And all the typical objections fall apart,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
[Amit Varma]: which he sort of addresses

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
[Amit Varma]: in that great episode,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
[Amit Varma]: which was one of the early 20-minute episodes.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And now I look back on that

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and I'm thinking that, damn it,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, Alex Tabarrok came with me

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and sat where you are sitting twice.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And I spoke to him for 20 minutes each.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
[Guest]: What a waste.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure he'll give you more time.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
[Guest]: He's an incredibly lovely and generous person.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
[Guest]: So the FSI was one of those ideas.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
[Guest]: You know, another one of them

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
[Guest]: was the television price controls episode

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
[Amit Varma]: that you did with Ashok Malik.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
[Guest]: And, you know, we all complain

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
[Guest]: about how terrible television is.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
[Guest]: Like, it just caters to the lowest common denominator.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
[Guest]: We all complain about how terrible

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
[Guest]: news channels are, right, on TV.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
[Guest]: And it's just this screaming match

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
[Guest]: with even the screen,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
[Guest]: the amount of information

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
[Guest]: and the number of tickers going on.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
[Guest]: It's like my stress levels increase

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
[Guest]: the moment I watch television.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
[Guest]: And the quality is pretty poor.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
[Guest]: There is no real analysis.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
[Guest]: There's no insight.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
[Guest]: It's a screaming match.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
[Guest]: There's a lot of misrepresentation of facts.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
[Guest]: And Ashok Malik basically told us

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
[Guest]: that it's not cultural.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
[Guest]: It's a problem of licensing and price controls.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
[Guest]: And the same way it produces poor quality food

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
[Guest]: or poor quality apartments in Mumbai,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
[Guest]: it is producing poor quality television.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And Ashok's point fundamentally to sum it up

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
[Amit Varma]: was that, look, it's very easy to blame

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
[Amit Varma]: private operators, right?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Hey, television is so bad.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
[Amit Varma]: It's not the state's fault.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
[Amit Varma]: But actually what happens...

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
[Amit Varma]: See, my Hindi is so good.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
[Amit Varma]: But actually what happens is that

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
[Amit Varma]: the state carries out price controls

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
[Amit Varma]: in terms of they have sold these licenses

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
[Amit Varma]: at such exorbitant amounts

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore stopped people coming into the market

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
[Amit Varma]: that the guys who've paid so much money

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
[Amit Varma]: for these licenses have no option

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
[Amit Varma]: but to cater to the lowest common denominator,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
[Amit Varma]: which is why you'll see Arnab

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
[Amit Varma]: and variations of Arnab on all the news channels.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
[Amit Varma]: It's a screaming match.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And you don't have space for cultivating niches

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
[Amit Varma]: or going into nuance.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Or subscription television.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, because once you pay that kind of money,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
[Amit Varma]: you don't have a choice.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
[Amit Varma]: It's a structural problem created by the state.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
[Amit Varma]: So don't blame your bad television on Republic TV.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Republic TV is a symptom.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
[Guest]: I think that's...

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
[Guest]: Another symptom is that you're listening to this

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
[Unknown]: as a podcast and not on radio.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
[Guest]: This could be a lovely radio show,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
[Guest]: but radio stations only want to play Bollywood music

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
[Guest]: because, again, that's the largest market

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
[Guest]: that you can have.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's the point Amit Doshi actually keeps making,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
[Amit Varma]: where he says that if you look at New York,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
[Guest]: you have so many dozens of FM stations.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
[Guest]: Excellent radio.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Because it's cheap.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
[Amit Varma]: So you can cater to every niche,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
[Amit Varma]: you can cater to every taste,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
[Amit Varma]: you can experiment.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Over here, you have a few licenses sold

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
[Amit Varma]: for many whatever it is,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
[Amit Varma]: tens, hundreds of crores.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
[Amit Varma]: You have to recover that money.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
[Amit Varma]: You have no option.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
[Amit Varma]: You have to go lowest common.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
[Guest]: And the lowest common here is,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
[Guest]: you know, jokes and Bollywood.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
[Guest]: With a few traffic updates thrown in

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
[Guest]: or sprinkled in, right?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
[Guest]: And it's the same old, same old, right?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
[Guest]: The Gabbar's voice.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
[Guest]: And yesterday I was thinking,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
[Guest]: the number of RD Burman riffs,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
[Guest]: like we don't even have new music

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
[Guest]: on these radio shows, right?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
[Guest]: The number of times like some RD Burman riffs

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: plays on radio,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
[Guest]: this is all because that is what is

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
[Guest]: instantly recognizable.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
[Guest]: You're sitting in the car most of the times

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
[Guest]: when you're listening to the radio.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
[Guest]: And you want people to tune in,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
[Guest]: which means they have to have

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
[Guest]: either celebrity interviews

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
[Guest]: or something like this.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
[Guest]: And your show could be wonderful on radio.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
[Guest]: Like it could get this fantastic market

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
[Guest]: if it could be broadcast over radio waves,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
[Guest]: but it simply cannot be done.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
[Guest]: And the problem is exactly the same

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest]: as what Ashok Malik discussed with television.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
[Amit Varma]: I actually think it's better this way

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, the future of television,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
[Amit Varma]: for example,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
[Amit Varma]: is not appointment viewing,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
[Amit Varma]: it's streaming,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
[Amit Varma]: it's on-demand viewing.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
[Amit Varma]: And similarly,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
[Amit Varma]: so what Netflix is to Star Plus,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
[Amit Varma]: I would say that IBM podcasts

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
[Amit Varma]: or podcasts in general

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Amit Varma]: are to FM radio.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
[Guest]: Fair enough, but I'm an economist.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
[Guest]: All cost is opportunity cost.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
[Guest]: You could have been a radio show host

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
[Guest]: 15 years ago,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
[Guest]: and we could have had a huge market

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
[Guest]: of people who are educated in policy.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
[Guest]: Which never happened.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: And not just you,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
[Guest]: there could have been multiple variations

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
[Unknown]: of this kind of show,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
[Guest]: which never happened.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
[Guest]: And we had to wait for one,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
[Guest]: technology to help us decentralize the medium.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
[Guest]: And two,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
[Guest]: we had to wait for something like Jio,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
[Guest]: which has put data on every phone.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
[Guest]: Otherwise it would have only been

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
[Guest]: a rich man's play thing, right?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Cell phone and data connection.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And I could actually have made some money.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
[Guest]: And you could have made some money.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
[Guest]: I did offer to buy lunch.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
[Amit Varma]: You did offer to buy lunch

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
[Amit Varma]: but we cannot have our guests

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
[Amit Varma]: buying our host lunch.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
[Guest]: We are very feminist on this show.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
[Guest]: So we also offer to buy lunch.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
[Amit Varma]: You offered,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
[Amit Varma]: but the offer was declined.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
[Amit Varma]: When I come to New York next,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
[Amit Varma]: perhaps as a starving refugee,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
[Amit Varma]: you can buy me a meal at the time.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
[Guest]: I don't think Trump's government

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
[Unknown]: is taking in refugees.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
[Guest]: You might be able to come in as a podcaster.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
[Guest]: You might have better luck with that.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Starving podcaster.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Make podcasting great again.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
[Guest]: Then a couple of other episodes.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
[Guest]: Since you mentioned starving podcaster,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
[Guest]: one idea which I think can have a big impact

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
[Guest]: is the dhanwapsi idea

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
[Guest]: that Rajesh Jain talked about, right?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
[Guest]: I mean, the idea is pretty simple.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
[Guest]: It is a direct transfer of public wealth,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
[Guest]: but we keep saying this is our wealth.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
[Guest]: These are public sources,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
[Guest]: but they are not controlled by us.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
[Guest]: They're controlled by representation of us,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
[Guest]: which is the government.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
[Guest]: So they really become the play thing

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
[Guest]: of those few people in power,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
[Guest]: whether it is Indian forests,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
[Guest]: Indian mines, Indian roads, Indian land.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
[Guest]: I mean, we're in Mumbai.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
[Guest]: Half of the town part of Mumbai,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
[Guest]: the southern part of Mumbai,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
[Guest]: is state land, right?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
[Guest]: Whether it's the port

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
[Guest]: or whether it's all these LIC buildings

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
[Guest]: and all these old buildings.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
[Guest]: And that's a lot of locked up value

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
[Guest]: which the state has no business holding on to.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
[Guest]: And Rajesh Jain's simple idea is

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
[Guest]: we need the state to divest this wealth

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
[Guest]: and put it in a fund

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
[Guest]: and transfer it one time

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: to every single family in India.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
[Guest]: And it has to be equal.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
[Guest]: It has to be non-discriminatory.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
[Guest]: And it is really the people's wealth

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
[Guest]: and people will know how to spend it better.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
[Amit Varma]: That was an interesting episode in the sense

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
[Amit Varma]: my episode with Rajesh was two hours long.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
[Amit Varma]: My longest so far,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
[Amit Varma]: but hopefully I'll have many more

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
[Amit Varma]: which are much longer.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
[Amit Varma]: But that was two hours long

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
[Amit Varma]: and everybody said it was too short.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
[Amit Varma]: I wanted more of it,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
[Amit Varma]: which is uniformly.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, you know,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
[Amit Varma]: like I've told Rajesh

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and if he's listening to this,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
[Amit Varma]: I know he won't mind my saying it,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
[Amit Varma]: but I don't really think

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
[Amit Varma]: his specific short-term plans

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
[Amit Varma]: or what he's doing with Dhanwapsya

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
[Amit Varma]: are going to work at all.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
[Amit Varma]: It's like almost a fool's dream.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
[Amit Varma]: But where I appreciate what he's...

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
[Amit Varma]: I used it as a phrase,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm not calling him a fool.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Far from that.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
[Amit Varma]: But what is important about the venture,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
[Amit Varma]: nevertheless,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
[Amit Varma]: is to make that conceptual breakthrough.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Because most people just think

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
[Amit Varma]: that all the wealth that they have

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
[Amit Varma]: is the wealth that they have, you know.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
[Amit Varma]: If they're poor, they're poor.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
[Amit Varma]: But what Rajesh is trying to get across to you

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
[Amit Varma]: is that, look,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
[Amit Varma]: our public wealth is so much

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
[Amit Varma]: that every individual is actually worth,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, 50 lakhs

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
[Amit Varma]: or even more than that.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And all of that is being wasted.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's time to give some of it

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
[Amit Varma]: back to the people

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
[Amit Varma]: instead of just lying around.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Especially in a poor country like ours,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
[Amit Varma]: where, you know,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
[Amit Varma]: poverty is still a problem

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
[Amit Varma]: we are trying to tackle 71 years later.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
[Amit Varma]: So just conceptually in terms of

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
[Amit Varma]: realizing that the government

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
[Amit Varma]: is not a separate, mybop entity

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
[Amit Varma]: and what it has is what it has.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Realizing that, no,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
[Amit Varma]: the government is your servant

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and what we call public wealth

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
[Amit Varma]: is actually our wealth.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
[Amit Varma]: It's our debt capital, so to say.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
[Guest]: No, I'm with you on that.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
[Guest]: I am in the business of ideas

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
[Guest]: and not so much implementation.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
[Guest]: So I think about it

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
[Guest]: in terms of the value of ideas

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
[Guest]: and not how quickly

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
[Guest]: this can turn into action necessarily.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
[Guest]: And there are ideas

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
[Guest]: for whom the time may not have come yet,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
[Guest]: which are not popular enough.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
[Guest]: But nevertheless,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
[Guest]: I think this is something

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
[Guest]: worth thinking about.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
[Guest]: And even if Dhan Vapasi

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
[Guest]: by itself doesn't happen,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
[Guest]: the change in mindset

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
[Guest]: that this is our wealth,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
[Guest]: they simply control it

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
[Guest]: and we need to take back the control,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
[Guest]: I think that idea is very powerful.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
[Guest]: Whether we redistribute 15 lakhs

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
[Guest]: or 50 lakhs

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
[Guest]: or whatever the number is

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
[Guest]: or how it is done

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
[Guest]: and whether it's an entitlement

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
[Guest]: or a transfer,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
[Guest]: those are things, you know,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
[Guest]: which are less interesting.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
[Guest]: But I think that a simple idea

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
[Guest]: is so powerful

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
[Guest]: that this is really our wealth

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
[Guest]: and it must be returned

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: to us in some way.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
[Guest]: It's been taken away from us.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Guest]: I don't think Indians

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
[Guest]: think that way.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
[Guest]: It's usually government's wealth

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
[Guest]: and we are clearly

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
[Guest]: not participants in the government

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
[Guest]: because they only think

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
[Guest]: of citizens come elections.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
[Guest]: Another big idea, I think,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
[Guest]: which has a huge impact

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
[Guest]: and India really needs

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
[Guest]: is the episode that you did

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
[Guest]: with Parth Shah.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
[Guest]: He's another old friend,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
[Guest]: a common friend of ours

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
[Guest]: and I think what Parth is doing

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
[Guest]: with the right to education

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
[Guest]: and school choice

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
[Guest]: is extremely valuable

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
[Guest]: and I think the two-fold idea,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
[Guest]: one that the right to education

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
[Guest]: is simply driving out

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
[Guest]: the private market

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
[Guest]: because it's trying to...

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
[Guest]: The Right to Education Act

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
[Guest]: essentially defines

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
[Guest]: all education goods as inputs.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
[Guest]: What is a good school?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
[Guest]: A good school is one

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
[Guest]: which has a playground,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
[Guest]: which has bathrooms,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
[Guest]: which has windows of this size

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
[Guest]: and which has a midday meal

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
[Guest]: and, you know,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
[Guest]: so on and so forth.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
[Guest]: According to me,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
[Guest]: a good school is one

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
[Guest]: where the children learn

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
[Unknown]: and I have read

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
[Guest]: the Right to Education Act

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
[Guest]: and there's not a single

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
[Guest]: learning outcome mentioned

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
[Guest]: in the schedule.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
[Guest]: So this mindset

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
[Guest]: that you can have a good school

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
[Guest]: only if it checks off

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
[Guest]: all these boxes

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
[Guest]: and it looks like a good school.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
[Guest]: And this is, again,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
[Guest]: typically a problem

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
[Guest]: of elites making policy.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
[Guest]: They go to Norway or Sweden

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
[Guest]: or wherever

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
[Guest]: and see what good schools look like

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
[Guest]: and then they turn it into policy.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
[Guest]: The trouble is

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
[Guest]: a lot of great learning takes place

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
[Guest]: in tiny budget schools

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest]: which cannot afford

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
[Guest]: windows sometimes,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
[Guest]: which cannot afford,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
[Guest]: you know,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
[Guest]: a good teacher-student ratio

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
[Guest]: or cannot afford

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
[Guest]: a good student-to-bathroom ratio

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
[Guest]: and so on and so forth.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
[Guest]: And they are providing

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
[Guest]: a better service.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
[Guest]: We know that for a fact

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
[Guest]: because poor parents

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
[Guest]: are willing to pay

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
[Guest]: a few thousand rupees

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
[Guest]: in these budget private schools

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
[Guest]: rather than send their children

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
[Guest]: to a free school.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
[Guest]: that is damning evidence.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
[Guest]: I don't know what

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
[Guest]: could convince people more

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
[Guest]: that our public education system

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
[Guest]: is failing.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
[Guest]: So I think Part's episode

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
[Guest]: on how the right to education

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
[Guest]: is really denying education

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
[Guest]: and how we need

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
[Guest]: to bring in school choice,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
[Guest]: which is another one of the themes

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
[Guest]: you have spoken about

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
[Guest]: for more than a decade.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
[Guest]: I think that's

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
[Guest]: a very powerful episode.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
[Guest]: I think there is

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
[Guest]: an entire generation

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
[Guest]: which has been lost

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
[Guest]: and I think more generations

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
[Guest]: will be lost

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
[Guest]: unless we fix that.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
[Amit Varma]: I think, again,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
[Amit Varma]: there's a conceptual shift

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
[Amit Varma]: at the heart of what Part

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
[Amit Varma]: and people like Amit Chandra

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
[Amit Varma]: who also came on the show

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest]: talk about.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
[Guest]: Amit's podcast was excellent,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
[Amit Varma]: another one of my favorites.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that was excellent

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and this sort of

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
[Amit Varma]: conceptual breakthrough

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
[Amit Varma]: they're trying to get at

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
[Amit Varma]: is that, look,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
[Amit Varma]: the quality of education

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and the choices that is involved

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
[Amit Varma]: in where the kid goes to school

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
[Amit Varma]: should not be determined

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
[Amit Varma]: by a Maibab state

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
[Amit Varma]: but by the parents

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
[Amit Varma]: because they have

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
[Amit Varma]: the best incentives.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Every parent wants his kid

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
[Amit Varma]: to get the best possible education

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
[Amit Varma]: because they want to

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
[Amit Varma]: get a better life, right?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And one school vouchers,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
[Amit Varma]: which I'm no longer convinced about

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
[Amit Varma]: despite being an advocate

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
[Amit Varma]: at one point,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
[Amit Varma]: but I think there is,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
[Amit Varma]: anyway,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
[Amit Varma]: that's a different subject,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
[Amit Varma]: but they're certainly better

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[Amit Varma]: than the current system

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
[Amit Varma]: and what school vouchers do

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
[Amit Varma]: is they empower the parents

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's the parents

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
[Amit Varma]: who have the power

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
[Amit Varma]: of sending the kid

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
[Amit Varma]: wherever they want

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
[Amit Varma]: rather than the state.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
[Amit Varma]: It's interesting

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
[Amit Varma]: because the episode

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
[Amit Varma]: I did with Parth

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
[Amit Varma]: was in my 20-minute format.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
[Guest]: So it was really short.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it was short.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
[Amit Varma]: It was crisp.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
[Amit Varma]: He was great.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Very insightful.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Didn't get a chance

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
[Amit Varma]: to go too deep.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
[Unknown]: And the episode

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I did with Amit Chandra

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
[Amit Varma]: was more than an hour

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and that was great

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and he's been an activist.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
[Amit Varma]: He's got boots on the ground.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
[Amit Varma]: He's, you know,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
[Amit Varma]: he's been an activist

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
[Amit Varma]: for education.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
[Amit Varma]: He's someone

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
[Amit Varma]: who's actually got

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
[Amit Varma]: skin in the game.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
[Amit Varma]: He liaises with politicians

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
[Amit Varma]: and all of that

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
[Amit Varma]: and tries to make a difference

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
[Guest]: in the world.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
[Guest]: And the episode,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
[Guest]: again,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
[Guest]: when I was telling you

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
[Guest]: in the beginning,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
[Guest]: it brought in so much context

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
[Guest]: about how schools

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
[Guest]: actually function

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
[Guest]: which I don't have

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
[Guest]: as an academic

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
[Guest]: who's only reading

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
[Guest]: the Right to Education Act

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
[Guest]: or the literature

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: and Amit's episode

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
[Guest]: helps you

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
[Guest]: very vividly

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
[Guest]: imagine

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
[Guest]: what these schools

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[Guest]: look like,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
[Guest]: what these students

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
[Guest]: go through,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
[Guest]: what the parents

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
[Guest]: go through

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
[Guest]: and, you know,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
[Unknown]: he made a fantastic

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
[Guest]: bootleggers and Baptists point

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
[Guest]: which is the rich schools

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
[Guest]: are the ones

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
[Guest]: who are actually

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
[Guest]: trying to shut down

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
[Guest]: private schools

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
[Guest]: because they're

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
[Guest]: direct competition

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
[Guest]: for being in violation

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
[Guest]: of the right to education.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
[Guest]: So it's the teachers' unions

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
[Guest]: and the richer schools

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
[Guest]: or richer private schools

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
[Guest]: which are threatening

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
[Guest]: the poorer private schools

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
[Guest]: and the budget schools

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
[Guest]: and I think that was

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
[Guest]: a fantastic insight

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
[Guest]: that came out

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
[Guest]: in that episode.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Which shows how

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
[Amit Varma]: sometimes the capitalist

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
[Amit Varma]: is the biggest enemy

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
[Amit Varma]: of free markets,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
[Amit Varma]: cronyism,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Zindabad.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
[Guest]: Well,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
[Guest]: it's bad incentives.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
[Amit Varma]: We have empowered

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
[Guest]: better budget schools

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
[Guest]: or richer school

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
[Guest]: entrepreneurs

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
[Guest]: with a terrible tool

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
[Guest]: called the

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
[Guest]: Right to Education Act

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
[Guest]: and now we are upset

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
[Guest]: that they are using it.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
[Unknown]: So the problem is

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
[Guest]: with the regulation,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
[Guest]: they would have just

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
[Guest]: competed in the market.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
[Guest]: The very same people

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
[Guest]: would have competed

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
[Guest]: in the market

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
[Guest]: as they were

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
[Guest]: before the

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
[Guest]: Right to Education Act

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
[Guest]: instead of shutting down

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
[Guest]: their competition.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
[Guest]: They would have made

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
[Amit Varma]: their product better.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
[Amit Varma]: commercial break

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and we'll come back

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
[Amit Varma]: after the break

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
[Amit Varma]: not just to talk about

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
[Amit Varma]: the seen and the unseen

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
[Amit Varma]: but also to talk about

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
[Amit Varma]: what we have seen,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
[Amit Varma]: what were the broad

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of trends

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
[Amit Varma]: that took place,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
[Amit Varma]: what feelings do we

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
[Amit Varma]: have about it

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and also looking ahead

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
[Amit Varma]: at 2019

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
[Amit Varma]: which is just

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:26.000
[Unknown]: a few days from now.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:55.000
[Unknown]: Thank you

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
[Unknown]: everyone

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
[Unknown]: for sending in

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
[Unknown]: emails and voice notes

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
[Unknown]: talking about

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
[Unknown]: their favorite moments

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
[Unknown]: from the show.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
[Unknown]: We really appreciate that.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And with that,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
[Amit Varma]: let's continue

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
[Amit Varma]: with the show.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
[Amit Varma]: to the seen and the unseen.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm sitting here

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
[Amit Varma]: with my most frequent guest

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
[Amit Varma]: so much so that

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
[Guest]: she's got frequent

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Guest]: guest points now,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
[Guest]: Shruti Rajgopalan.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
[Amit Varma]: I think when he said

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
[Amit Varma]: frequent,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
[Amit Varma]: he meant favorite.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
[Guest]: Favorite too.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
[Amit Varma]: That's why

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
[Guest]: revealed preferences.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
[Amit Varma]: That is true.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Frequent is equal

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
[Amit Varma]: to favorite.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
[Amit Varma]: or no one else

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
[Amit Varma]: at this point

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
[Amit Varma]: that I have some

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
[Amit Varma]: really exciting episodes

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
[Amit Varma]: lined up.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Next week is

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Steven Pinker

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
[Amit Varma]: on why the world

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
[Amit Varma]: is getting better.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
[Amit Varma]: It's because 2018

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
[Amit Varma]: is finally getting over.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And apart from that,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I have Rebecca Goldstein,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
[Amit Varma]: the philosopher

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
[Amit Varma]: on why philosophy

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
[Amit Varma]: is relevant

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
[Amit Varma]: to modern life.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
[Amit Varma]: I have Gyan Prakash

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
[Amit Varma]: on the emergency

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
[Amit Varma]: of 1975

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and why it wasn't

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
[Amit Varma]: merely an aberration

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
[Amit Varma]: but written

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
[Amit Varma]: in the DNA

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
[Amit Varma]: of the Indian state.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic episode

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
[Amit Varma]: which I really enjoyed.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And finally,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Tyler Cowen

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
[Amit Varma]: of Marginal Revolution

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
[Amit Varma]: talking about

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
[Amit Varma]: his new book

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
[Amit Varma]: of moral philosophy

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Stubborn Attachments.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Again,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
[Amit Varma]: he was very generous,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
[Amit Varma]: gave me an hour

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
[Amit Varma]: to speak to me.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Lovely episode.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
[Amit Varma]: All those

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
[Amit Varma]: coming up,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
[Amit Varma]: any of them,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Shruti,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
[Amit Varma]: could have been

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
[Guest]: my hundredth episode.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
[Guest]: I'm flattered.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
[Guest]: I think at zero price,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
[Guest]: it's pretty easy

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
[Guest]: to be anybody's favorite.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
[Amit Varma]: What is zero price?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't understand it.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Explain your economic

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
[Guest]: funda to me.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
[Guest]: I'm not charging

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
[Guest]: high enough.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
[Unknown]: Okay.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
[Unknown]: So when you provide

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
[Guest]: something for free,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
[Amit Varma]: there seems to be

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
[Amit Varma]: a very large market

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
[Amit Varma]: for it.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Opportunity cost.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Nothing is free.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
[Amit Varma]: No such thing

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
[Amit Varma]: as a free lunch.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
[Unknown]: I said zero price.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
[Guest]: So,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
[Guest]: no,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
[Guest]: of all these,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
[Guest]: I am,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
[Guest]: I mean,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
[Guest]: I'm excited for all

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
[Guest]: the episodes

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
[Guest]: that you're talking about.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
[Guest]: And I,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
[Guest]: of the lot,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
[Amit Varma]: I've only read

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
[Amit Varma]: Stubborn Attachments

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and I mean,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
[Guest]: the book

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
[Guest]: is self-recommending.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
[Guest]: What did you think

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
[Guest]: of Stubborn Attachments?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
[Guest]: I thought it was

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
[Guest]: a really long view

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
[Guest]: on things,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
[Guest]: which is something

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
[Guest]: we don't get to do

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
[Guest]: on a daily basis

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
[Guest]: as academic economists,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
[Guest]: right?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
[Guest]: Not in the classroom,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
[Guest]: not outside.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
[Guest]: It's not like

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
[Guest]: academic publishing

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
[Guest]: has lent itself

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
[Guest]: very well to these

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
[Guest]: big long-term ideas.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
[Guest]: And I think

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
[Guest]: only when you think

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
[Guest]: long the way

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
[Guest]: Tyler has attempted

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
[Guest]: to wrestle with

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
[Guest]: the big ideas

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
[Guest]: in his book,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
[Guest]: that you get into

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
[Guest]: questions of ethics

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
[Guest]: and also what are

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
[Guest]: the trade-offs

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
[Guest]: you're willing

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
[Guest]: to make

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
[Guest]: in the long run.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: And one great insight

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
[Guest]: is that

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
[Guest]: we must not compromise

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: long-run economic growth

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
[Guest]: because that seems

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
[Guest]: to take care

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
[Guest]: of a lot of other things.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
[Guest]: So if there are

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
[Guest]: trade-offs to be made,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
[Guest]: then, you know,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
[Guest]: we really need

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
[Guest]: to think about

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
[Guest]: long-run economic growth

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
[Guest]: on the plus side

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
[Amit Varma]: of that trade-off.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Are you a consequentialist?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm a consequentialist.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
[Amit Varma]: We even discussed

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
[Amit Varma]: it at some point in time

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
[Amit Varma]: and I amend

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
[Amit Varma]: what I said in the intro.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
[Amit Varma]: We don't agree

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
[Amit Varma]: on everything.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
[Guest]: See?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Amit Varma]: I think that's

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
[Amit Varma]: refreshing.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
[Amit Varma]: That's refreshing.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
[Amit Varma]: So, I mean,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
[Amit Varma]: you know,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
[Amit Varma]: one thing that

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I point out to people

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
[Amit Varma]: whenever, like,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
[Amit Varma]: you often see that

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
[Amit Varma]: people will get

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
[Amit Varma]: infatuated with

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
[Amit Varma]: this new thinker

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
[Amit Varma]: or this new

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
[Amit Varma]: public intellectual

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
[Amit Varma]: and they'll quote

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
[Amit Varma]: all his works

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and they'll go crazy

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and they'll post

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
[Amit Varma]: like 10 posts

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
[Amit Varma]: on YouTube

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
[Amit Varma]: about that person

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and the way

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
[Amit Varma]: I look at it is

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
[Amit Varma]: that there isn't

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
[Amit Varma]: a single thinker

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
[Amit Varma]: in the world

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
[Amit Varma]: with whom I agree

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
[Amit Varma]: in total.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
[Amit Varma]: You name anyone,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
[Amit Varma]: all my favorites,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
[Amit Varma]: I have no other

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
[Amit Varma]: admiration.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And so,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
[Amit Varma]: therefore,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
[Amit Varma]: whenever someone

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
[Amit Varma]: tells me about

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
[Amit Varma]: someone who's

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
[Amit Varma]: an intellectual

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
[Amit Varma]: hero of theirs,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
[Amit Varma]: my question always

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
[Amit Varma]: is, okay,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
[Guest]: tell me where

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
[Guest]: you disagree

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
[Guest]: with them

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
[Guest]: because

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
[Guest]: otherwise

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
[Guest]: it's religious

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
[Guest]: faith.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
[Guest]: Where do I

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
[Guest]: disagree?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
[Guest]: Not too many

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
[Amit Varma]: places.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
[Guest]: I might disagree

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
[Guest]: in terms of

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
[Guest]: details.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
[Guest]: So, for instance,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
[Amit Varma]: right now…

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
[Guest]: I didn't actually

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
[Guest]: agree with

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
[Guest]: him.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
[Guest]: Because Tyler

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
[Guest]: is an intellectual

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
[Amit Varma]: hero.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
[Amit Varma]: But let's not

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
[Amit Varma]: get into this

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
[Amit Varma]: since this was

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
[Amit Varma]: a rhetorical point.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
[Amit Varma]: He's an intellectual

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
[Amit Varma]: hero of mine

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
[Amit Varma]: also in the sense

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
[Amit Varma]: that every time

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I read him,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I feel like

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
[Amit Varma]: my brain cells

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
[Guest]: are getting

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
[Guest]: activated and

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm getting

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
[Amit Varma]: smarter.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
[Amit Varma]: But a lot

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
[Amit Varma]: of places

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
[Amit Varma]: I can't

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
[Amit Varma]: quite agree.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I wouldn't

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
[Amit Varma]: say disagree

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
[Guest]: because

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
[Guest]: disagreement also

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
[Guest]: means it's

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
[Guest]: not so much

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
[Guest]: disagreement

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
[Guest]: but that my

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
[Guest]: ideas may not

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
[Guest]: fit particularly

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
[Unknown]: well in that

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
[Guest]: framework of

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
[Guest]: thinking.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
[Guest]: Or I might be

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
[Unknown]: trying to solve

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
[Guest]: a completely

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
[Guest]: different problem

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
[Guest]: than what is

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
[Guest]: being solved.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
[Guest]: This is not

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
[Guest]: just about

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
[Guest]: Tyler's book

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
[Guest]: but just

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
[Guest]: more generally

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
[Guest]: about the

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
[Guest]: people one

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
[Guest]: likes to

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
[Guest]: read and

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
[Guest]: is inspired

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
[Guest]: by.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
[Guest]: But I agree

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
[Guest]: with you.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
[Guest]: Or in terms

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
[Guest]: of point of

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
[Guest]: view, I think

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
[Guest]: we have a

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
[Guest]: very rich point

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
[Guest]: of view because

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
[Guest]: we've grown up

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
[Guest]: in India.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
[Guest]: It's a fundamentally

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
[Guest]: entangled system.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
[Guest]: We look at

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
[Guest]: problems which

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
[Guest]: are much more

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
[Guest]: naughty and

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
[Guest]: therefore much

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
[Amit Varma]: more delicious

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and interesting

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
[Amit Varma]: to solve.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
[Amit Varma]: By naughty

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
[Amit Varma]: you meant

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
[Amit Varma]: K-N-O-T-T-Y.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
[Guest]: A bunch of

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
[Guest]: listeners are

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
[Guest]: wondering what

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
[Guest]: is she talking

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
[Guest]: about?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
[Unknown]: It's

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
[Guest]: K-N-O-T-T-Y.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
[Unknown]: So yeah, I

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
[Guest]: think the

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
[Guest]: problems here

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
[Guest]: are much more

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
[Guest]: interesting and

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
[Guest]: we have sort

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
[Guest]: of grown up

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
[Guest]: with it.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
[Guest]: We take a lot

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
[Guest]: for granted.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
[Guest]: One thing I'm

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
[Guest]: really surprised

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
[Guest]: by in India is

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
[Guest]: actually that

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
[Unknown]: crime rates are

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
[Guest]: so low.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
[Guest]: India genuinely

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
[Guest]: makes me believe

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
[Guest]: in the goodness

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
[Guest]: of other people.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
[Guest]: Even such

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
[Guest]: low state

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
[Guest]: capacity and

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
[Guest]: such poor

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
[Guest]: enforcement of

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
[Amit Varma]: law.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
[Amit Varma]: It's

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
[Unknown]: emergent

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
[Unknown]: order.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
[Amit Varma]: In the

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
[Amit Varma]: sense that

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
[Amit Varma]: with India

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Amit Varma]: I've always

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
[Amit Varma]: felt that

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
[Amit Varma]: there is no

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
[Amit Varma]: rule of law

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
[Amit Varma]: per se.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
[Guest]: It's not

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
[Guest]: because of

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
[Guest]: the rule of

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
[Guest]: law enforced

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
[Guest]: by the state

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
[Guest]: that we are

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
[Guest]: largely a

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
[Guest]: law-abiding

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
[Guest]: society.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
[Guest]: This is

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
[Guest]: society

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
[Guest]: regulating

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
[Guest]: itself.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
[Guest]: Well it's

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
[Guest]: a society

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
[Guest]: regulating

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
[Guest]: itself but

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
[Guest]: when was

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
[Guest]: that

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
[Guest]: the

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
[Guest]: first

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
[Guest]: time

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
[Guest]: that

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
[Guest]: India

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
[Unknown]: was

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
[Guest]: a

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
[Guest]: law

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
[Guest]: abiding

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
[Guest]: society?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
[Guest]: I

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
[Guest]: don't

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
[Guest]: know.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
[Guest]: I

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
[Guest]: don't

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
[Guest]: know.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
[Guest]: I

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
[Guest]: don't

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
[Unknown]: know.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
[Guest]: I

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
[Guest]: don't

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
[Guest]: know.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
[Guest]: I

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
[Guest]: don't

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
[Guest]: know.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
[Guest]: I

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
[Guest]: don't

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
[Guest]: know.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
[Guest]: I

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
[Amit Varma]: don't

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
[Amit Varma]: know.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
[Amit Varma]: don't

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
[Amit Varma]: know.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
[Amit Varma]: have

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
[Amit Varma]: no

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
[Amit Varma]: clue.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
[Amit Varma]: don't

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
[Amit Varma]: know.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
[Amit Varma]: don't

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
[Amit Varma]: know.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
[Amit Varma]: don't

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
[Amit Varma]: know.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
[Amit Varma]: But

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
[Amit Varma]: really

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
[Amit Varma]: don't

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
[Amit Varma]: know.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
[Amit Varma]: don't

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
[Amit Varma]: know.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.240
[Amit Varma]: respect their consent and this applies to all your personal relationships.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.920
[Amit Varma]: So the way you behave to the world and relate to the world, you are broadly libertarian.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.480
[Amit Varma]: But then when you extrapolate it to an abstract level, you start thinking like an engineer

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.480
[Amit Varma]: and you want to put different things in place.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.640
[Guest]: Well, one is that and also I have very routinely heard people say, but I am good, what about

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.300
[Guest]: the other people who need to be controlled, right?

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.780
[Guest]: So we impose this, you know, that others are necessarily different from me.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.120
[Guest]: This goes back to the school choice issue, right?

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:41.260
[Guest]: I've heard so many Delhi elite policy types talk about, but poor people don't know better.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.260
[Amit Varma]: Right, which is just shocking.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.540
[Guest]: They don't know where to send their children to school.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.380
[Guest]: It's very condescending and patronizing.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:51.360
[Guest]: Poor people know much more than us about the world, I think, because they navigate a very

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.600
[Guest]: different world, which is much, much more difficult.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:40:00.360
[Guest]: But most importantly, they know about themselves, which is knowledge that we cannot have.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.240
[Guest]: That knowledge is so subjective and so contextual.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.200
[Guest]: It is not possible to replicate that.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.480
[Guest]: I'll tell you an interesting story.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.680
[Guest]: I read this in Dean Carlin's book.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:18.000
[Guest]: So Dean Carlin is an economist and a policy person who wrote this book with a co-author.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.800
[Guest]: The name is slipping my mind.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.640
[Guest]: The book is called More Than Good Intentions, right?

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.760
[Guest]: And he's basically talking about all the randomized control trials and other kinds of research

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.560
[Guest]: that they've conducted in developing areas and some of the broad lessons that they've

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.560
[Guest]: learned.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.000
[Guest]: There's a lovely story.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.960
[Guest]: I think it's about a flower seller.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.600
[Guest]: I think her name is Vijaya in the book.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.000
[Guest]: And they talk about how, you know, they go to Vijaya and they explain this whole micro

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.480
[Guest]: credit thing.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.520
[Guest]: And Vijaya's daily routine is as follows.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.640
[Guest]: She goes in the market, you know, she wakes up in the market at four in the morning.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.440
[Guest]: She'll go to the wholesale flower mandi.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:58.240
[Guest]: Before that, she will stop on the way to the money lender and she will borrow money on

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:04.680
[Guest]: daily interest, which as you and I know, can be extremely, it's a very expensive way of

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.680
[Guest]: raising money.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.480
[Guest]: So she will borrow money in the morning.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.480
[Guest]: She will go to the mandi.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.040
[Guest]: She will buy the flowers.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.560
[Guest]: She will sell the flowers through the day.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.880
[Guest]: Whatever additional money she makes, she will stop back.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.480
[Guest]: You know, the money lender's right there.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480
[Guest]: She'll go back.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.480
[Guest]: She will pay it back.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:24.240
[Guest]: And with the remaining money, she will, you know, buy her daily groceries and so on.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.960
[Guest]: And they did the math for her.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.600
[Guest]: They sat down, they explained everything and they said, you know, we will give you some

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.600
[Guest]: micro credit.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.320
[Guest]: But if you don't borrow every day, you save X percent in daily compounding interest, which

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.720
[Guest]: is very expensive way to do business.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.760
[Guest]: And before the end of the week, you will be putting away 50 rupees.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.760
[Guest]: By the end of three weeks, you will have 150 rupees.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.120
[Guest]: And then that is enough for you to buy the flowers in the mandi on a daily basis.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.440
[Guest]: So they laid it all out for her.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.640
[Guest]: And she said, all that's fine, but I can't keep any money at home because my husband's

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.840
[Guest]: a drunk.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:59.160
[Guest]: And the only way he can be disciplined is because he knows that the money lender's guys

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.760
[Guest]: will be after us if you don't pay the money lender back.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.400
[Guest]: So we think that she needs to optimize on how she does her flower business.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.320
[Guest]: But she's optimizing on three problems.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:17.520
[Guest]: How to run her house, how to control her husband's alcoholism, and how to run a successful small,

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.000
[Guest]: you know, sort of, I don't know if you can call this a business, but a small entrepreneurial

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
[Guest]: venture of selling flowers daily outside the temple.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.120
[Guest]: And we simply don't know what her optimizing function is, to use a typical economist term,

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120
[Guest]: right?

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.500
[Guest]: If you don't know what it is that they're trying to optimize, how can you tell them

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.160
[Guest]: how to do it?

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.040
[Guest]: And that's why a lot of these patronizing people who sort of typically say, but they

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.040
[Guest]: don't know better.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.320
[Guest]: You know, even if I had looked at Vijay, I'd be like, yeah, that's a terribly silly way

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.740
[Guest]: taking money on daily interest.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.640
[Guest]: And my first assumption would have also been, maybe she doesn't know that there are other

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.960
[Guest]: alternatives, right?

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.840
[Guest]: That's our natural inclination.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:59.120
[Guest]: All of us who have access to modern credit, we all have credit cards, we just paid for

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.080
[Guest]: our lunch with credit card and so on.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.160
[Guest]: So that would be our natural inclination.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:07.440
[Guest]: Our natural inclination is never to think that there is something about their circumstances

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:11.520
[Guest]: that they know so much more about that we can't possibly fathom.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.440
[Guest]: And they must be doing what is best for themselves.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.000
[Guest]: And this is not to say that we shouldn't have financial literacy or education programs and

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.440
[Guest]: so on, but they need to be the ones who apply the tools of financial literacy.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.920
[Amit Varma]: We cannot do it for them.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.720
[Amit Varma]: You empower them with the knowledge and don't stand in judgment and say, oh, what are they

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.720
[Amit Varma]: doing?

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.720
[Amit Varma]: That is, I get it.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.880
[Amit Varma]: It's a very poignant story though.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.200
[Guest]: I mean, what is a way out for Vijaya then?

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.120
[Guest]: Well, I think socially we need to change.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:43.320
[Guest]: I mean, one major problem for Vijaya, presumably, I don't know much about her life, but presumably

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:50.320
[Guest]: she can't get rid of her husband, which would be one way of solving the problem, right?

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:56.040
[Guest]: Another way is we need to have a better credit system, which is more competitive at that

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.640
[Guest]: level so that money lenders are not charging daily interest rates, right?

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:08.160
[Guest]: If we had banking penetration at that level, if we had more microcredit associations and

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.760
[Guest]: organizations who gave credit to women, which we've had, right?

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.480
[Guest]: We've had this in Ahmedabad, we've had this with SEWA, we've had this in Bangladesh, right?

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:20.120
[Guest]: He even won the Nobel Peace Prize for the microcredit work that he did in Bangladesh,

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.120
[Guest]: Eunice.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:27.720
[Guest]: So there are ways to make this happen to make this particular problem less of a problem.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:33.200
[Guest]: But I think what is happening with Vijaya is a lifelong problem of having her choices

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.520
[Guest]: taken away from her, right?

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.600
[Guest]: I'm not sure how much of a hand she had in whether she gets to choose whether she marries

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.960
[Guest]: or not, or who she marries or not.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.280
[Guest]: I don't know if she had much control over whether she can get educated or not.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:51.080
[Guest]: I don't know if her family skilled her in anything except household work, right?

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.720
[Guest]: So I really don't know enough about her life to actually think of every single thing that

00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:01.640
[Guest]: has gone wrong that could have had some intervention and been fixed for this to not be a problem.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.640
[Amit Varma]: Which also speaks to, you know, no matter, I mean, obviously, you and I both, I'm sure

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.640
[Amit Varma]: agree with Pinker.

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.680
[Amit Varma]: The fact is that the world is so much better and we're moving in the right direction, but,

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.120
[Amit Varma]: oh man, this shows you what a long way we still have to go.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:16.520
[Guest]: Well, I absolutely agree with Pinker, but also we need to recognize that the distribution

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.040
[Guest]: hasn't been even, right?

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.920
[Guest]: Some of us are at the top end of the ladder of the gains from this distribution.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:30.040
[Guest]: I mean, me in particular, I'm a post-colonial, close to post-liberalization child of India,

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040
[Guest]: right?

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.640
[Guest]: So I was there when liberalization happened.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.440
[Guest]: I remember going from two types of chocolate in the store to potentially 20 types of chocolate

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.560
[Guest]: in the store in a matter of a few years.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.520
[Amit Varma]: So I have really reaped the benefit.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.120
[Amit Varma]: Sugar is poison.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.080
[Amit Varma]: I had to put that in there.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.080
[Amit Varma]: Please don't have chocolate, except 95% dark, sorry, carry on.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.520
[Amit Varma]: As Amit said, there are many things we disagree on.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.620
[Guest]: This is one of them.

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:56.960
[Guest]: So I do like dark chocolate though.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.000
[Guest]: Just you know, a hint for future podcast freebies.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.240
[Amit Varma]: I just bought you lunch.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.240
[Amit Varma]: That's my quota for the year over.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.240
[Amit Varma]: The year is almost over.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.240
[Guest]: It's almost over.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.880
[Guest]: So maybe in January.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.200
[Guest]: So I have particularly, I think, benefited from this, right?

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:17.500
[Guest]: So you know, post-colonial, because you know, I've had many generations of English speakers

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:22.760
[Guest]: in the family, which made it very easy for me to get a PhD in economics in an English

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.880
[Guest]: speaking country in the United States.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.800
[Guest]: And you know, these things are terribly part dependent.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:32.080
[Guest]: I think it would have been hard to learn a new language and then go on to do my PhD in

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.080
[Guest]: that particular subject.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:37.600
[Guest]: So I think I really benefited from that, from liberalization, particularly because, you

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:43.680
[Guest]: know, all of us, all of our incomes got raised and all of our choices became better.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.600
[Guest]: And you know, especially with access to internet and the ability to actually find out about

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.480
[Guest]: simple things, universities, the kind of people you want to work with, what we were reading

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.760
[Guest]: at the time.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:00.560
[Guest]: I like to tell the story, my first copy of the road to serfdom was ordered by mail, like

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.920
[Unknown]: snail mail, right?

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:08.680
[Guest]: To fill out the copy and put in a banker's check, was $25 banker's check to the publisher.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Which year was this?

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.760
[Guest]: This was a while ago, must have been early 2000s or late 90s, something like early 2000s.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:21.000
[Guest]: And University of Chicago Press was the publisher in question and the bookstore that I'm talking

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
[Guest]: about helped me do it.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.880
[Guest]: They showed me the form and I filled it out and I sent it.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.960
[Guest]: And now the world has just changed.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.920
[Guest]: I mean, I can get any book that you tell me about in a matter of seconds.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.480
[Guest]: So I think some of us have really benefited.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:39.780
[Guest]: We were already educated enough or we came from wonderful families.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.280
[Guest]: We have never had financial insecurity in our lives.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:46.120
[Guest]: I mean, at least I haven't a genuine financial insecurity.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.120
[Guest]: So health insecurity, right?

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.640
[Guest]: So we have benefited from how wonderful the world is more than some of the others.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.960
[Guest]: So I think while I agree with the overall thesis that the world is far better, far safer,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.920
[Guest]: everything, I don't think that applies equally to everybody.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.800
[Amit Varma]: I think it's gotten better at different velocities for different kinds of people.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:12.600
[Amit Varma]: So the velocity for someone in Vijaya's position, for example, is far less, but it is still

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.080
[Guest]: moving in the right direction.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.080
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.720
[Guest]: I'll definitely agree with that.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.960
[Guest]: But I'm not sure how much the internet revolution has already helped Vijaya.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.760
[Guest]: It no doubt will in the future.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:26.200
[Guest]: If not anything, it will increase the size of her market.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:31.280
[Guest]: So there will be some benefits that come or accrue to everyone, even if they're not directly

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.240
[Guest]: participating in that economy.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.880
[Guest]: So if I take my grandfather to the temple, now that I'm wealthier, I'm more likely to

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.080
[Guest]: buy more expensive flowers or more flowers and so on and so forth.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:47.760
[Guest]: So I think just participating in this kind of modern world economy benefits Vijaya and

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.120
[Guest]: that's lovely.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:56.040
[Guest]: And yeah, I think, I think the rate at which we are able to partake in the gains or catapult

00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:02.120
[Guest]: ourselves to the next level, or the rate at which opportunities open up, right, those

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120
[Guest]: are all different.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.120
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, if our economy had been open from the start, or if it even opened up much

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:12.720
[Guest]: more than it did in 91, which would be true for a lot more people, better off.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:19.160
[Amit Varma]: So we should really be talking about what happened in 2018, if our listeners still want

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:24.160
[Amit Varma]: to go through that drudge, and what we're looking forward to in 2019.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.520
[Amit Varma]: But before that, is there something on your list you've left out?

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:30.600
[Guest]: Yeah, no, I mean, I was just thinking about what are the things that surprised me about

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600
[Guest]: the 100 episodes.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.800
[Guest]: And one of the things was the couple of episodes you did on cricket.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.680
[Guest]: I'm not really a cricket person, I actually call myself a cricket widow.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.760
[Guest]: Because my husband Nandu watches a lot of cricket and he watches test matches, which

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:51.280
[Guest]: he really enjoys, which go on sort of forever, for weeks and weeks, and so I think one of

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:56.040
[Guest]: the great disappointments in his life is that I'm not that excited about cricket.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.800
[Guest]: But I was genuinely surprised when I heard both those episodes, probably because they

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.240
[Guest]: were about so much more than cricket itself or cricket technique.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:08.440
[Guest]: And also, they were from cricket commentators or writers and not cricketers themselves.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.840
[Amit Varma]: That kind of put me to sleep.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.800
[Amit Varma]: One episode was with Gideon Haye and Prem Panekar, Prem being a very good friend of

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.920
[Amit Varma]: Boshruti and mine, hi Prem, if you're listening.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.640
[Guest]: And the other one was with Harsha Bhogle.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.720
[Guest]: Yeah, I thought both were wonderful.

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:26.880
[Guest]: I think Gideon and Prem's was more about the money in cricket and the financial aspect,

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.800
[Guest]: which also Harsha touched upon.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.240
[Guest]: But Harsha sort of placed the game in a particular context of the history of India in the last

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:40.240
[Guest]: 50 years and connected it to all the big events of post-colonialism, post-liberalization,

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:46.400
[Guest]: how the game has taken off, and also how being integrated to the modern world of cricket

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:52.440
[Guest]: where money plays a big role changes how dispensable the cricketers are and how they behave on

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:57.280
[Guest]: and off the field and how viewers think about them and what our relationship is with individuals

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.520
[Guest]: and the team.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:03.440
[Guest]: I thought it was really great, both the episodes were really great and very insightful.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:08.800
[Guest]: I was very surprised personally, because when I saw that episode, I was like, oh-ho, now

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.480
[Unknown]: I have to hear this too.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:16.520
[Guest]: So this was, yeah, so I think those were some of the surprises.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.240
[Guest]: I mean, while I've learned something from every episode, pretty much, and a lot of the

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.720
[Guest]: friends, you know, people you've had on the show are friends of ours in common or we've

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.160
[Guest]: known or we've come across in some professional or personal capacity, but, you know, these

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.160
[Guest]: were some of the highlights.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.800
[Guest]: I'm sorry if I missed anyone out.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure I'm going to get a few messages and tweets.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.800
[Amit Varma]: Thanks a lot.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.120
[Amit Varma]: Everyone who she's missed out, who's been a guest on the show and hasn't been mentioned

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.120
[Amit Varma]: already.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:43.320
[Amit Varma]: Please know that I love you, but there are listeners here who don't quite feel the same

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.320
[Guest]: way.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.320
[Guest]: I think I have to mention Vivek, my nemesis.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.320
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm kidding.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.320
[Unknown]: No, I'm kidding.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.320
[Unknown]: I love Vivek.

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.320
[Guest]: I've really enjoyed episodes with him, to be honest.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Vivek Kaul, which I'm sure all your listeners are familiar with, who I'm sure all your listeners

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
[Amit Varma]: are familiar with.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Who I hope is listening to this.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
[Guest]: He's wonderful.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.920
[Guest]: He has this incredible ability to just simplify what seems like a really big problem.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:09.840
[Guest]: You know, especially because I think most people just go to sleep when they hear about

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:14.200
[Guest]: a financial problem or a financial scandal, and he has this incredible ability to simplify

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.640
[Guest]: and make it accessible.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.340
[Amit Varma]: And simplify not in a negative sense of make it simplistic, but in a good sense of make

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.720
[Amit Varma]: it easy to understand.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.720
[Amit Varma]: So now you get it.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.720
[Amit Varma]: And then, yeah.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And then once you get it, you get it.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.280
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.280
[Guest]: The moment Vivek says it, it seems obvious, which I think is a great skill.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.520
[Guest]: It's a fantastic skill.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.040
[Guest]: So I've really enjoyed Vivek's episode.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:42.000
[Guest]: I have even been a guest with him once, while we discovered, yes, actually, I must say,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.400
[Guest]: I sort of elbowed myself into that episode.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.280
[Guest]: I heard that they were doing one that day about our famous prime minister's famous words

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:55.160
[Guest]: on pakodanomics, and I sort of elbowed my way in because I thought Vivek was getting

00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:01.280
[Guest]: ahead in the competition of not favorite, but frequent guest, apparently, right?

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.400
[Guest]: So yeah, Vivek's episodes I have really enjoyed.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.600
[Guest]: I think, you know, the last one I think was ILNFS.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.720
[Guest]: And that was, again, an area I didn't know that much about.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:17.780
[Guest]: And just, you know, Vivek's ability to take a lot of information, which may or may not

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:25.400
[Guest]: be out there, as he as he pointed out, there's so this opacity in how these NBFCs function.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.560
[Guest]: So his ability to take all that information and simplify and just sort of get to the root

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.000
[Amit Varma]: of the problem is quite amazing.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.080
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I'll tell my, I'll get my listeners into a secret and I don't know if you know

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.080
[Amit Varma]: this.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.080
[Amit Varma]: I wonder if I've told you.

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.960
[Amit Varma]: He said Vivek and I once got together and we said we'll do a joint podcast in Hindi.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.960
[Unknown]: And we called it...

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.960
[Amit Varma]: And your Hindi wasn't good enough?

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.360
[Amit Varma]: My Hindi is amazing.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.240
[Amit Varma]: And we called it Fande Wali Baat.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.640
[Amit Varma]: So every episode was like five minutes long.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.440
[Amit Varma]: And Vivek and I would talk about a funda from cognitive psychology, but related to normal

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.440
[Amit Varma]: life.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.920
[Amit Varma]: For example, you talk about the Sankhya's fallacy.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.400
[Amit Varma]: But you speak about how that is why people stay in bad marriages or why if you walk into

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.560
[Amit Varma]: a bad movie, you're like, oh, I've already paid so much, I might as well finish and blah,

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.560
[Amit Varma]: blah, blah.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.040
[Amit Varma]: And we recorded like nine episodes of that as a pilot.

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.040
[Guest]: You did?

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.400
[Guest]: I didn't know you recorded it.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.400
[Guest]: I knew it was an idea.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.440
[Amit Varma]: No, we recorded nine episodes as a pilot and we thought it sounded great.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.440
[Amit Varma]: But it really went nowhere.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.440
[Amit Varma]: And so if there are any...

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.720
[Guest]: Why have I been denied of hearing these nine episodes?

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.840
[Amit Varma]: If there are sponsors out there who are willing to put money behind this, kindly get in touch

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:30.200
[Amit Varma]: the brilliant Vivek Kaul and the barely possible Amit Verma.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:34.040
[Guest]: Well, I'm hoping Vivek did the Hindi speaking.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.040
[Amit Varma]: We both did.

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.040
[Amit Varma]: My Hindi is very good.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.040
[Amit Varma]: You are defaming me.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Verma only name.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.040
[Guest]: Let's talk for two minutes in Hindi.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.040
[Guest]: Come on.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.040
[Amit Varma]: Come on.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.040
[Amit Varma]: What do you want to talk about?

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.040
[Guest]: I want to talk about 2018.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:49.040
[Amit Varma]: But what do you call 2018 in Hindi?

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.040
[Amit Varma]: 2018.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.040
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.040
[Amit Varma]: In 2018, for you...

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.040
[Amit Varma]: For me...

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.040
[Amit Varma]: I think we'll switch to English.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Let's switch back to English.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.040
[Guest]: But why do you keep saying 2018 was a bad year?

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.040
[Unknown]: I mean, it might have been, but I want to know why you think it was so terrible.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.040
[Guest]: Actually, 2018 was a very good year for me.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.040
[Amit Varma]: I lost 15 kgs.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.040
[Amit Varma]: I didn't mean personally.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.040
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:13.720
[Amit Varma]: It was more of the same year.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:18.720
[Amit Varma]: It was more of Trump, more of Modi, more of Pappu being Pappu, which is what I will continue

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.000
[Amit Varma]: calling him.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.800
[Amit Varma]: And we can discuss that also.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.840
[Amit Varma]: But it was just in the sense that I don't think in all of the ways that we bemoan what

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.320
[Amit Varma]: has happened in the last three or four years, the world didn't really get much better.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:35.800
[Amit Varma]: We should perhaps be thankful that Modi didn't unleash another demonetization kind of monstrous

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.800
[Amit Varma]: blunder on us.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800
[Amit Varma]: But, well, there's always 2019 for that.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:42.400
[Guest]: I'll tell you why I think 2018 was an interesting year.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:47.920
[Guest]: I mean, you and I have always had this view that, you know, it's not about the individuals.

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.720
[Guest]: It's about the political rules of the game and the incentives.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.600
[Guest]: So you and I are not partisan at all.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.600
[Guest]: I mean, we've rarely...

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:58.320
[Guest]: We've discussed a lot of politics, but we never discuss it from a partisan point of

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.360
[Guest]: view, which is what most people talk about when they talk about politics, you know, in

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.400
[Guest]: most contexts.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:09.440
[Guest]: And I think in 2018, the penny might have dropped for many people that Modi is also

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.680
[Guest]: going to be more of the same.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:14.960
[Guest]: And this is not because there's something peculiar about him or something similar about

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:18.920
[Guest]: him to other dictators slash prime ministers that we've had.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.080
[Guest]: It's just simply the incentives are terrible.

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:27.360
[Guest]: The incentives lead one to rely more on centralization and more on control and more on statism.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.360
[Guest]: And that's what we got.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.160
[Guest]: And I think the penny might have dropped for many people this year that this was never

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.000
[Guest]: about Modi being able to change our lives dramatically.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.040
[Amit Varma]: I think that penny should have dropped in 2014.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.280
[Amit Varma]: And also the thing is, it irritates me when people keep talking about him as right wing

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:46.960
[Amit Varma]: neoliberal because whatever his social tendencies might be on economics, he's statist, he's

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.960
[Guest]: hardcore left wing.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:51.480
[Guest]: And his social tendencies are also not very liberal.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.120
[Amit Varma]: So he's the worst of both possible worlds.

00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll tell you my biggest disappointment this year is one, there was a laudable effort to

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.240
[Amit Varma]: recast Rahul Gandhi as someone who's got progressive ideas, who knows what he's talking about,

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:12.640
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, and who's not as stupid as he seems to be, and which is fine.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:20.280
[Amit Varma]: But the problem there is that a lot of the ways in which they've recast themselves is

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:25.720
[Amit Varma]: for me a step back, in the sense that there is a soft Hindutva, where instead of, you

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:30.480
[Amit Varma]: know, just speaking of individual rights, and so on, as they should finally do, despite

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.280
[Amit Varma]: not having done it for seven decades, he goes to Kedarnath and when, you know, there was

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.880
[Amit Varma]: this fuss where the BJP accused him of eating chicken.

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:44.360
[Amit Varma]: And instead of just mocking them, as he should have, he said, No, I had shudh veg and defended

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.360
[Amit Varma]: himself.

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:51.160
[Amit Varma]: And so this coating of the soft Hindutva vote, then getting into all of these populist areas,

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.760
[Amit Varma]: like now farm loan waivers have become the rega.

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.720
[Amit Varma]: And I understand that farm loan waivers might even be a necessary anesthetic.

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.960
[Amit Varma]: But there are deeper structural issues that you have to take on.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:04.360
[Amit Varma]: And those structural issues were actually caused by the Congress, but forget the past.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.640
[Amit Varma]: But Modi's done absolutely nothing about them.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.640
[Amit Varma]: Despite blaming Nehru for everything, he hasn't actually reversed anything Nehru did.

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.440
[Amit Varma]: So what are you blaming him for?

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.440
[Guest]: And no, you're absolutely right.

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.120
[Guest]: I mean, Modi has been a continuation, you know, as Arun Shourie famously put, he's Congress

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.120
[Amit Varma]: plus cow.

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120
[Amit Varma]: Actually, Congress is now Congress plus cow.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.920
[Guest]: You know something, I am not so sure about that.

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:29.040
[Guest]: I'm not sure how much of the soft Hindutva peddling was just campaign, sort of, you know,

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.160
[Guest]: people are following you, the media is following you, you're pandering in a particular way.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.240
[Guest]: I don't know how much of that is going to translate to policy.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.680
[Guest]: To be honest, I don't see Congress constituencies doing much of that.

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.480
[Amit Varma]: I could be wrong as I have been in the past.

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:45.960
[Amit Varma]: But when you talk about policy, for example, people said that, you know, people keep trying

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:50.440
[Amit Varma]: to, I guess, because of the understandable reason that they're anti Modi and something

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.580
[Amit Varma]: has to be done, which I agree with, they keep trying to recast Rahul Gandhi as someone who's

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:58.680
[Amit Varma]: actually not very stupid, which I think is silly, because, you know, the evidence is

00:58:58.680 --> 00:58:59.800
[Amit Varma]: out there on YouTube.

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:03.880
[Amit Varma]: And even when he's been asked questions this year in press conferences, he's been lauded

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:08.360
[Amit Varma]: for about Indira Gandhi's policies, he's defended bank nationalizations, he's defended the nonsense

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.360
[Amit Varma]: he did.

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.000
[Amit Varma]: He even said in a press conference recently, just three or four months ago, that the Congress

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.920
[Amit Varma]: was not involved in 1984.

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:20.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, I think what a lot of Congress supporters don't realize is that when I call him stupid,

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.320
[Amit Varma]: I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.780
[Amit Varma]: It's Hanlon's razor, never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity.

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.740
[Amit Varma]: Because if he's not stupid, he's an asshole.

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.740
[Guest]: These are the two options.

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:32.560
[Guest]: Well, I'll tell you the peculiar thing about Rahul Gandhi.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:38.520
[Guest]: You know, we all have family members who have really bizarre views, right?

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.640
[Guest]: They've just been fortunate enough that they haven't been Prime Minister.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.960
[Guest]: So we all have had the crazy Hindutva uncle or the crazy controlling aunt or, you know,

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.560
[Guest]: the crazy cousin who might have done something terrible.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:55.760
[Guest]: Now, the problem is, all of these are Rahul Gandhi's immediate relatives, right?

00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.240
[Guest]: And I can understand the personal problem of trying to distance yourself from a grandfather

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:07.080
[Guest]: who's beloved by hundreds of millions and your grandmother and your uncle, who's quite

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.800
[Guest]: frankly a monster, you know, at least based on the policies, I can understand.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Sorry for interrupting.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.040
[Amit Varma]: They brought out a tweet recently on Sanjay Gandhi's birth anniversary.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.040
[Guest]: I was horrified by that.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.320
[Guest]: Hailing him as a visionary leader who cared for the poor.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.320
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.320
[Guest]: So this is my thing.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.320
[Amit Varma]: Is this the alternative to Modi you're putting forward?

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.320
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.120
[Guest]: So my thing is, you know, I think what Congress has relied on in the past is the huge shadow

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.880
[Guest]: that is cast by Nehru and then Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, right?

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.960
[Guest]: And I think the fundamental misunderstanding with Rahul Gandhi is, I don't think he's stupid

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.960
[Guest]: or malicious.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:46.160
[Guest]: I think it's a lack of recognition that Congress can do without the past mistakes, that people

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:53.000
[Guest]: will actually vote for Congress, even if you distance yourself from the follies of your

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
[Guest]: family members for which you didn't contribute at all.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, he wasn't even around for most of this time.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840
[Amit Varma]: I would say it would be...

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.840
[Amit Varma]: I would respect him more.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.560
[Amit Varma]: It would be horrible to blame someone for the mistakes of his ancestors.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.620
[Amit Varma]: My issue with Rahul Gandhi is not whose son or grandson he is.

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.280
[Guest]: My issue with him is that he keeps defending those mistakes.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.880
[Guest]: I'm saying he needs to distance himself politically from them.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.120
[Guest]: Personally, your equation you have with your crazy uncle who forced sterilization upon

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.560
[Guest]: millions is a whole different question, right?

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.920
[Guest]: You might have been your favorite uncle despite all of it.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.240
[Guest]: But I think politically, I don't think he's recognized that he needs to distance himself

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.000
[Guest]: and actually come out with a clean platform of what it is that he stands for.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.320
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, I think a lot of Congress supporters behave as if history began in 2014.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.200
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, it's very easy to appear virtuous when you are in opposition.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.140
[Amit Varma]: The reason Modi is where he is, is because this party ruined this country and kept us

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.860
[Amit Varma]: poor for 70 years.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.860
[Guest]: That much is a fact.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.320
[Guest]: And that's why the rhetoric Modi gives when he blames Nehru and Indira Gandhi is so powerful.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.960
[Amit Varma]: Yes, but that rhetoric is kind of idiotic now, because for five years, Modi has himself

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.920
[Amit Varma]: done nothing to reverse any of that.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.920
[Guest]: In fact, he's done more of the same.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.400
[Amit Varma]: So I am losing my patience with the, oh, but 70 years they have done this and everything

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.640
[Amit Varma]: is Nehru's fault, which is rhetoric, which, you know, would have resonated in 2014.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.640
[Amit Varma]: But it doesn't.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.120
[Amit Varma]: And you see a lot of these young people who've come to political consciousness after 2014,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.560
[Amit Varma]: behaving as if the Congress is this great virtuous party.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.360
[Guest]: Yeah, we need to read more history.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360
[Guest]: We need to.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.680
[Guest]: Wait, you know, your episode with Gyan Prakash should solve that problem.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.720
[Amit Varma]: My episode with Gyan Prakash should solve some of that problem, certainly.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.880
[Amit Varma]: And none of this is to defend Modi in any way.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, Modi's just been a horrible Prime Minister.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.760
[Amit Varma]: Definitely worse since Indira Gandhi.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760
[Guest]: Whether he is...

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Maybe worse.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.760
[Guest]: Maybe worse because...

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.680
[Amit Varma]: She only demonetized 10,000 rupee notes.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.960
[Guest]: But if you leave aside demon, she did call the emergency ban nationalization.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, economic policies alone, even if you leave emergency aside...

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.720
[Guest]: Were really terrible.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.040
[Guest]: In fact, a lot of the farm loan waiver problem, I think you had an episode with this with

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.520
[Guest]: Kumar Anand and this with Kumar Anand also on public sector banks, right?

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.240
[Guest]: With Kumar and Vivek, I think those two did a...

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.200
[Guest]: And those were great, but the farm loan waiver problem is, as you said, it's just treating

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200
[Guest]: the symptom.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.040
[Guest]: It is not treating the actual problem.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.840
[Guest]: So you've done a bunch of episodes on the farming problem, right?

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:23.680
[Guest]: With Pawan, with Karthik Shashidharan, with Kumar, right?

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.600
[Guest]: And basic... and Gunwant Patil, of course, our favorite one.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.920
[Guest]: Basically, each one of those episodes talked about how farmers are shackled, right?

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:37.040
[Guest]: Whether it is they don't have access to futures market, which is what Karthik talked about,

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.200
[Guest]: or they don't have access to any markets, which is what Kumar talked about, right?

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.320
[Guest]: We've denied them markets and inputs.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.640
[Guest]: We've denied them market and outputs.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.920
[Guest]: And they don't have access to the latest innovation or to global technology, as Gunwant Patil

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
[Guest]: pointed out.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.720
[Guest]: We've basically made sure that our farmers remain poor and they have no choice but to

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:54.720
[Guest]: remain poor.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.960
[Guest]: And when our farmers are poor and unproductive, as I pointed out in the right to property

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.200
[Guest]: episode, we haven't even given them the exit option of exiting farming, because their most

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.400
[Amit Varma]: valuable asset is depressed, because they can only sell it to farmers.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.680
[Amit Varma]: Another thing I discussed with Vivek and why things are coming to a head now is that all

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:16.400
[Amit Varma]: the agitations you see recently from the Jats in Haryana, the Patidas, the Kapus in Andhra

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.200
[Guest]: Pradesh, the Kapus, I believe, and the Marathas here, they're all landowning cars.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.840
[Amit Varma]: And one of the reasons they're agitating is because with every generation, a farmer's

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.760
[Amit Varma]: land gets divided among his descendants, and they have a smaller and smaller parcel.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.960
[Amit Varma]: And it's completely unsustainable now, they don't have an exit.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.560
[Amit Varma]: And this is also one reason why, you know, while I would certainly like, I want Modi

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.760
[Amit Varma]: to lose 2019.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:43.240
[Amit Varma]: But the bottom line is that, you know, a change at the top of politics is not going to make

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.880
[Amit Varma]: a difference to the country because we are screwed, our jobs crisis on which I had a

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.960
[Amit Varma]: couple of episodes is, you know, is reaching horrendously bad proportions.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.160
[Amit Varma]: The agricultural crisis is crazy.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.800
[Guest]: Plus, there is this cow genie that has been let out of the bottle.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.800
[Guest]: And they're related, yeah.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800
[Guest]: And they're related.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:06.640
[Guest]: So I think the farmer's distress, I mean, farm loan waiver, just moves the guillotine

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640
[Guest]: away, right?

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.640
[Guest]: Sort of.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.720
[Guest]: Like right now, they have this extreme problem of having to pay back loans when they don't

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.720
[Guest]: have the money.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.980
[Guest]: And that solves that problem immediately.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.280
[Guest]: But it doesn't solve anything long term.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.800
[Guest]: And frankly, as Gunman Patilji pointed out, they don't want the waivers, they want empowerment,

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.480
[Guest]: they want access to markets, they want to control their own choices.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.000
[Guest]: Right now, they can't choose anything.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.800
[Guest]: They essentially have to keep doing what their great grandparents did, because that's how

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.920
[Guest]: the regulatory system is set up.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:43.240
[Guest]: And the modern world is simply not productive on such a small plot of land, doing what the

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.760
[Guest]: great grandparents did with a few subsidies and waivers here and there thrown in.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.440
[Guest]: It's not really going to make them rich.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440
[Amit Varma]: It's horrendous.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.640
[Amit Varma]: It's so depressing.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.280
[Amit Varma]: But we do have some positive.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, last year wasn't all bad.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.080
[Guest]: There was some very good news, especially when it comes to gender, for example.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:04.520
[Guest]: Yeah, I think I mean, before minority rights in general, including gender, but I think

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.600
[Guest]: the I'll start with decriminalization of 377.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.080
[Guest]: I mean, that is incredibly positive.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.120
[Guest]: This is something I mean, you have written a lot about the victimless crimes, right?

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:23.120
[Guest]: What are consensual relationships among adults which are being regulated for no reason and

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.560
[Guest]: horribly so criminalized in India?

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.880
[Guest]: And you know, I mean, you've had episodes where, you know, we've had first person accounts

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.760
[Guest]: of how the police harass you, right?

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:40.800
[Guest]: How people try to extort you by trying to out your sexuality or try to get money out

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.800
[Amit Varma]: of you.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.800
[Amit Varma]: There was a column called the Matunga racket many, many years ago about this.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.200
[Amit Varma]: So just go to IndiaUncut.com and search for the Matunga racket and you'll come across

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.200
[Guest]: it.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:58.640
[Guest]: And so in general, I think the idea that so many more people are liberated and can discuss

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.640
[Guest]: their own sexuality.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.000
[Guest]: I mean, if they wish to be private about it, that's, of course, their choice.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.960
[Guest]: But now they don't have to worry about state coercion.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.240
[Guest]: They don't have to worry about, you know, jail time and things like that.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.680
[Guest]: And they don't have to worry about things like the Matunga racket where people are extorting

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:19.680
[Guest]: money from them because something is, you know, makes them a criminal in the eyes of

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680
[Guest]: the law.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.200
[Guest]: So I think that is a huge step forward.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:27.080
[Amit Varma]: Like I read an episode about being gay in India with Navin Arora, who's a stand up comedian

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:31.360
[Amit Varma]: and who's also runs a show for IVM podcast called Keeping It Queer.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.360
[Guest]: He was amazing.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.840
[Guest]: I really loved him.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.240
[Guest]: And his first person account, it was just so poignant the way he talked about coming

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:44.080
[Guest]: out to his family, his experiences, it just like really brought tears to my eyes.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.720
[Amit Varma]: You know what was the most heartening thing is that when 377 was abolished, it was almost

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.600
[Amit Varma]: as if its time had come.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And all I heard, and obviously there's a selection bias from the kind of people I follow and

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960
[Amit Varma]: all that.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.640
[Amit Varma]: But all I heard was people very glad that it's been abolished.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.040
[Amit Varma]: 25 years back, I don't think that's all I would have heard.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.360
[Amit Varma]: 25 years back, you know, there would have been a lot more noise against it.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.680
[Amit Varma]: And now it was like, okay, everyone's accepted it was an anachronism and it's got to go.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's also a sign of how a society's norms evolve over time.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.760
[Guest]: Something Matt Ridley spoke about.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.760
[Guest]: Matt Ridley spoke about it.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.760
[Guest]: I was about to mention.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.200
[Unknown]: And law must follow society.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.200
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.320
[Guest]: Otherwise, if you're imposing something, I mean, in an ideal world, I would have liked

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.380
[Guest]: the constitution to include the third gender and sexual orientation, but it's really difficult

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:35.160
[Guest]: because social norms were different then and they may not even thought about it.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:38.800
[Guest]: It certainly didn't come up, you know, LGBTQ rights didn't come up in Constituent Assembly

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.880
[Guest]: debates.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:43.000
[Guest]: And this is the natural way in which we have evolved.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.720
[Guest]: Our minds have opened up.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.960
[Guest]: We are much more cognizant of both the third gender and also gender fluidity and also,

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.240
[Guest]: you know, different sexual orientation.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.400
[Guest]: And all of these three things, we see more of it in society around us because, you know,

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.400
[Amit Varma]: so much migration.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:04.240
[Amit Varma]: And I've actually argued that the constitution need not even have mentioned LGBTQ per se.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.800
[Amit Varma]: If you just protect individual rights strongly enough, then all minorities, if those rights

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.680
[Amit Varma]: are strong enough, all minorities get protected, all genders get protected, but sadly our constitution

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.680
[Guest]: doesn't do that.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.680
[Guest]: No.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.200
[Guest]: And also, you know, the Indian Penal Code did have this crazy Victorian morality, which

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.360
[Amit Varma]: could have been struck down if it was unconstitutional, but it wasn't unconstitutional.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.120
[Guest]: Well, it was struck down first and then it was reversed.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.920
[Guest]: And you know, there's also a crazy history to how it happened.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.240
[Guest]: I am so glad that the Supreme Court did the right thing.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.720
[Guest]: It's also, you know, I mean, these are small things, just the peace of mind for people

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.160
[Guest]: who have a different orientation, their ability to hold someone's hand.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.120
[Guest]: I mean, there's no way we can value these things as economists, right?

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:52.680
[Guest]: These are just really big milestones for regular folks in India.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.000
[Guest]: And I'm so thrilled it's happened.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.320
[Guest]: And all the people we know who belong to the LGBTQ community, we are relatively elite.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.880
[Guest]: You know, we have not known too many people who've been extorted or who've been harassed

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.160
[Guest]: by the police or molested even, you know, out of fear of being outed and so on.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:18.040
[Guest]: But this obviously, you know, the more powerless you are in India, that usually translates

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.760
[Guest]: into the less money you have, the more you face these things.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.400
[Guest]: So I think this judgment brings about equality, not just between the different genders and

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.240
[Guest]: different sexual orientation, but it also reduces the gap between people who are elite

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.080
[Guest]: and powerful and could have led these lives anyway, even with 377, which was a terrible

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:44.240
[Guest]: law versus, you know, poorer folks or people who don't have that kind of safety and security

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.360
[Guest]: in the environment that they inhabit.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.400
[Guest]: So I think it's just a really wonderful thing.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Couldn't agree with you more.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.680
[Amit Varma]: And plus there were other judgments, it was a triple talaq judgment, for example, which

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.800
[Amit Varma]: some have described as the right decision for the wrong reasons, but whatever, it's

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.800
[Guest]: the right decision.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.580
[Guest]: Yes and no.

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:05.880
[Guest]: You know, in the sense that if I just took my pure principle, you know, textbook kind

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.000
[Guest]: of opinion, I would say there are different kinds of contracts and they can have clauses

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.140
[Guest]: for different kinds of dissolution of contract, right?

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:20.800
[Guest]: So if I contract with you that if I say, you know, sugar, sugar, sugar three times and

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.880
[Guest]: you kick me out of the studio, it ought to be okay.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.840
[Guest]: I'm surprised you didn't already actually, but it ought to be okay.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.800
[Amit Varma]: Just don't say sugar again, you're triggering me.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.800
[Guest]: Sugar again?

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.800
[Guest]: Oh God.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:39.040
[Guest]: So, but that is not the, that doesn't take into account the social context, right?

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.760
[Guest]: Because that assumes that these women that we're talking about got into the contract

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.760
[Guest]: of their own volition and gave their genuine consent, which we know that the way marriage

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.460
[Guest]: works in India is not always the case, right?

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:57.020
[Guest]: So yes, technically it's a contract and technically one should be able to decide the terms on

01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:01.880
[Guest]: which you dissolve the contract and triple talaq is as good as any, right?

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.440
[Guest]: But that is not the case in India.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.760
[Guest]: Most of these women did not choose who they were married to.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.920
[Guest]: The circumstances are such that they don't have much control or much choice and they

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.240
[Guest]: are denied consent all the time in small and big things.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.500
[Guest]: And I think removing triple talaq just goes a long way towards mitigating one kind of

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:26.680
[Guest]: problem for Muslim women who are trapped in a particular social context.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.680
[Guest]: I agree with you.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.720
[Guest]: So I think, yeah, I mean, it may have been for the wrong reasons and it may not be something

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.040
[Guest]: I generally think is a problem, but it is a problem in India and it is definitely a

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.680
[Guest]: move in the right direction.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:43.920
[Guest]: And I think, I mean, speaking of the triple talaq, this has been a great year for sort

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.340
[Guest]: of like gender awakening and gender rights, right?

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.840
[Guest]: Not just minority rights.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.560
[Guest]: I think it's been amazing.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.880
[Guest]: You have done a great job, I must say.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:58.120
[Guest]: I have congratulated you privately in the past, but you have had so many women come

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:04.520
[Guest]: and actually talk about whether it's, you know, gender, female workforce participation

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.600
[Guest]: or whether it's the Me Too movement.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:12.560
[Guest]: I think you've really pushed the envelope and you were one of the early ones to wake

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.560
[Amit Varma]: up to what was happening.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.560
[Amit Varma]: So that is awesome.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Not really.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.560
[Guest]: I was just lucky I knew these people and they agreed to come on the show.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.840
[Guest]: You're not lucky you know these people.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.240
[Amit Varma]: You've cultivated these relationships with very smart women.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:26.080
[Amit Varma]: Listen, but you don't congratulate someone for doing something which should just be completely

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.080
[Amit Varma]: par for the course.

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is a burning issue at the time and if you're doing a podcast, you have to

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.320
[Guest]: call these people.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.600
[Guest]: Well, I'll tell you what I'm congratulating you for in particular.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.640
[Guest]: Most of the times when I spoke, you know, men would ask women, sometimes they would

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.680
[Guest]: ask me, what should they do?

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.200
[Guest]: I would say, just listen, right?

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.560
[Guest]: Let's start by listening because I think even though we're in the same room, half the times

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.760
[Guest]: we inhabit slightly different worlds, whether we're in the same bus compartment, same restaurant,

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.600
[Guest]: we just use physical space and we navigate it differently.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.880
[Guest]: And most men are simply not aware of it.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:03.080
[Guest]: Not because they are stupid or oblivious, but because they are not walking in our shoes,

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.680
[Guest]: however uncomfortable they might be.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.880
[Guest]: So I think that was one wonderful thing.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:14.440
[Guest]: You brought on these wonderful guests and you gave them a chance and a platform to express

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.440
[Guest]: the kind of problems.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:19.160
[Guest]: I love the show that you did with Nikita and Supriya.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.280
[Guest]: I'm a big fan of their work.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280
[Guest]: Both of theirs.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.320
[Guest]: I've read a lot of their writing.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.320
[Guest]: I think Nikita's story.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.120
[Amit Varma]: Nikita did a couple of really good feature stories for the next caravan issue after that

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.120
[Guest]: if you read them.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120
[Guest]: Yeah, the Pachauri one, right?

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.120
[Guest]: It was fantastic.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.120
[Guest]: The Pachauri one, not the Pachauri one.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.120
[Guest]: Oh, after that.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.560
[Amit Varma]: Right after I recorded with them, after the episode was out, the next month, I think Caravan

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.600
[Guest]: did a Me Too issue where they had four stories and she wrote two of them.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.440
[Unknown]: Yes, I read that one.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.320
[Guest]: And yeah, so her insight, you know, her insight is twofold, right?

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.920
[Guest]: One is her experience as a young female journalist.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.560
[Guest]: It's a world that is difficult to navigate.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:00.000
[Guest]: And the other is her experience covering, you know, both people who have been harassed

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.720
[Guest]: and the harassers, right?

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.440
[Guest]: She had a very unique perspective.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.880
[Guest]: It was, I think, a fantastic episode.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:11.800
[Guest]: I think the episode that you did with the very, very incredibly bright young women of

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Takshashila Institution and Pragati.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
[Amit Varma]: The Matrix of Empowerment.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
[Amit Varma]: The Matrix of Empowerment.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
[Amit Varma]: I think that's episode 90.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.360
[Amit Varma]: I really liked that episode and I like both the Me Too episodes, even the one I did with

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360
[Amit Varma]: you.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360
[Guest]: I thought you were great.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360
[Guest]: Even the one you did with me.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360
[Amit Varma]: Even, even.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.360
[Amit Varma]: Oh God, I'm getting into trouble now.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.920
[Guest]: No, I had a lot of fun doing that.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.040
[Guest]: It's another one of those things where the time for something like that had come and

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.640
[Guest]: it had just been bubbling for a long time.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:40.640
[Guest]: And I think you and I in particular just discussed the incentives part of it, but I also liked

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:46.120
[Guest]: listening to the social context that so many of your other guests talked about, especially

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.560
[Guest]: the metrics of female empowerment.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.120
[Guest]: I think that was a really great episode because these things are hard to measure.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.720
[Guest]: You can't just measure it as, you know, how much money the women are making or how much

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:00.360
[Guest]: distribution they have in, you know, household income or household wealth and so on.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.880
[Guest]: It's so many small, you know, one lovely thing that you mentioned in your episode with Vikram

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880
[Guest]: Doctor.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.880
[Amit Varma]: I really loved that episode.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.880
[Amit Varma]: That's a great episode.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.880
[Amit Varma]: He was amazing.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.480
[Guest]: And you, you guys were talking about, you know, the banana flower, which in Tamil we

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.480
[Guest]: call vaarappu.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:14.480
[Guest]: Right?

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm not even going to try to say that.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.960
[Guest]: I do a fair bit of South Indian cooking.

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.920
[Guest]: I'm very fond of that food.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.560
[Guest]: This is one thing I'm not touching, simply because as you mentioned, it is so labor intensive

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.640
[Guest]: and I could not be bothered.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.640
[Guest]: Right.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:32.360
[Guest]: And he talked about using steel utensils instead of brass ones and so on.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:37.440
[Guest]: And these are all metrics of how women have more space and more of a voice in the power

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.520
[Guest]: structure of families.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.520
[Amit Varma]: And they can say no.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.520
[Amit Varma]: No, it's very interesting.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Vikram's point there was that the rise of stainless steel utensils in India,

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.560
[Amit Varma]: which over a period of 10 years, that whole revolution happened where everything was stainless

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.440
[Amit Varma]: steel was a sign of the empowerment of women.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.800
[Guest]: I agree with him.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.800
[Amit Varma]: And now I think non-stick.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's interesting, this email group that we're both part of, which I started,

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:02.200
[Amit Varma]: Lucretius, there was a discussion about what do you get in the US, which you don't get

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.000
[Amit Varma]: here, which I refer to in my next episode as well, oddly enough.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.200
[Amit Varma]: And in the UK, you get all the cleaning liquids in the household fluids that you get are far

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.640
[Amit Varma]: better than the ones you get in India.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.320
[Amit Varma]: Because the women are using it themselves as opposed to having the maids use them.

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.320
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.320
[Amit Varma]: And over here, the household help uses them.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.800
[Guest]: So you don't give much attention to them.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.160
[Guest]: I completely agree.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.040
[Amit Varma]: And I've heard that a similar explanation given for why Indian kitchens are so lousy,

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.920
[Amit Varma]: like so small compared to in proportion to the rest of the house.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.920
[Amit Varma]: They don't even have a fan.

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.920
[Guest]: Yeah, don't even have a fan.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, typically, let alone air conditioning.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.680
[Amit Varma]: My kitchen has a fan.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.920
[Amit Varma]: But because the men don't cook and the men make all the decisions.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.000
[Amit Varma]: So it's either the domestic workers or is the wives who are a sort of domestic workers

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.080
[Amit Varma]: in so many Indian households, you know, who don't have agency and who are not.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.880
[Guest]: I must say I've revolutionized my parents' household.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.960
[Guest]: We broke it open and made it an open kitchen so that she can get my mom, who does a lot

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.960
[Guest]: of cooking.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:53.960
[Guest]: She really enjoys cooking.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.440
[Guest]: She's a wonderful cook, has access to air conditioning while she's in the kitchen and

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.720
[Guest]: she's not slaving away far away from us.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.920
[Guest]: So that I completely agree with you.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.320
[Guest]: I think, you know, this is funny you mentioned, what do you get in the US which you don't

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.320
[Guest]: get in India?

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.520
[Guest]: I was recently having this conversation in Bangalore with a few of our common friends,

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:18.240
[Guest]: everything in the sense that I get better banana chips in the US than I get in Delhi.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.240
[Guest]: Better banana chips?

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.240
[Guest]: And this is a major problem.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.680
[Guest]: I love bananas.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:23.680
[Guest]: I love banana chips.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.900
[Guest]: You can't get a decent banana chip in Delhi.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:29.480
[Guest]: And the reason is India has not become one single market yet.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.480
[Unknown]: Right.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.960
[Guest]: I find it hard to believe that Delhi people have such a terrible taste palette or we can't

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.960
[Guest]: find some people with a good enough taste palette out of the 18 million in the greater

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.720
[Guest]: NCR region that they would actually like banana chips.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.200
[Amit Varma]: Given all the pollution, can your tongues taste anything yet?

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.360
[Guest]: Yes, actually they can.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.600
[Guest]: I will attest to it.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.200
[Guest]: I was there last week.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:53.680
[Guest]: So, but the problem is that it is so costly to ship banana chips from Kerala or Tamil

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:59.000
[Guest]: Nadu to Delhi that at that price point, there is very little demand, right?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.080
[Guest]: We haven't become one market.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.080
[Guest]: It's baffling to me.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.920
[Guest]: I get Bhakarwadi in New York.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.820
[Guest]: In fact, you know, not in Delhi.

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.040
[Amit Varma]: In Meehir Sharma's book Restart, I think he has an anecdote.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.440
[Amit Varma]: I forget the two cities involved.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.920
[Amit Varma]: I think it's Bangalore and Chennai, but two cities like that in neighboring states.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.880
[Amit Varma]: And to send goods from one city to the other, it's cheaper to do it via France than directly.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.760
[Amit Varma]: But that was part of the friction GST was supposed to solve.

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.760
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.280
[Guest]: And I think it solved a little bit of it, but not exactly.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.000
[Guest]: One, because, you know, some of the checkpoints have opened up, but all of them haven't opened

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
[Guest]: up.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.200
[Guest]: And the second, you know, I mean, you've had some wonderful GST episodes with Didi, with

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:40.000
[Guest]: Vivek, Kaul and even me, but we've all touched on the same thing, right?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
[Guest]: I'm so sorry.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.640
[Guest]: Don't keep bringing it up now, now for the next five years, you're going to keep saying

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640
[Amit Varma]: even.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.640
[Unknown]: Are you sure you want me on your show?

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.640
[Unknown]: Even me?

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.640
[Unknown]: Are we in business for the next five years?

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.640
[Guest]: I don't know if I'm in business, but if I am, you're coming on my show.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.840
[Guest]: No, no, I'm going to come back for the 500th episode.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.840
[Amit Varma]: That's my hope.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Oh my God, I have to live till then.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.920
[Guest]: I think with your sugar-free diet, you might just make it.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.920
[Amit Varma]: That's true.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.200
[Amit Varma]: But you know, who knows what chocolate cravings can do in the middle of the night.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:11.440
[Guest]: But going back to the episodes that you did on GST, I think we all talked about the same

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:18.520
[Guest]: thing, which is the crazy number of classifications are adding a lot of friction, right?

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.200
[Guest]: And on a daily basis, people are trying to figure out, you know, Vivek talked about his

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.080
[Guest]: Kit Kat, a biscuit or a chocolate, right?

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.320
[Guest]: I talked about a few other examples like that.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.160
[Guest]: So it's the same problem over and over again.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.040
[Guest]: And I don't think we've become a single market, far from it.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.960
[Guest]: I mean, if we were a single market, I should be able to get banana chips in Delhi, which

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.200
[Guest]: I don't, right?

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:43.680
[Guest]: And I can get the same banana chips in New York, because at that price point, there are

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.440
[Guest]: enough New Yorkers or enough Indians in New York who are willing to pay for it, right?

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.660
[Guest]: Same for the very typical chivda that you get in Pune or the bhakarwadi that you get.

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.140
[Guest]: I can get all of this in New York.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.140
[Amit Varma]: It's not easy to get.

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:58.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the insights that came on this thread that we started on this group

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.920
[Amit Varma]: was that a lot of the stuff that you get in the US and not here is very specialized neat

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.920
[Amit Varma]: stuff.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.000
[Amit Varma]: So if you're a DJ, there'll be a particular kind of console which you have to get there

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.200
[Amit Varma]: and you don't get here.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.560
[Amit Varma]: But all the mainstream stuff which you get there, you get here also, except perhaps banana

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.560
[Guest]: chips.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:16.400
[Guest]: No, what I mean is, it's not like you don't get banana chips in Delhi, it's that you don't

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:21.520
[Guest]: get the same kind of banana chips that you get in Kerala, which I don't have a good reason.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.960
[Guest]: I mean, other than that, we are not one single market, or that the market has too many frictions,

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:26.960
[Guest]: right?

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.680
[Guest]: And I think that is another, I mean, since we're talking about 2018, I think that's a

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:35.560
[Guest]: huge missed opportunity of 2018, which is GST made such a mess of things and didn't

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.040
[Guest]: quite do what it was supposed to do, which was one country, one tax, one market, right?

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.920
[Guest]: And it's still one country, thankfully, right?

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.600
[Guest]: I don't think it's one tax or one market, right?

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:51.360
[Guest]: It's about five different rates and lots of classifications and nowhere close to a single

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.360
[Guest]: market.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:58.200
[Guest]: And to sort of, you know, unentangle a lot of other regulatory barriers to get closer

01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.200
[Guest]: to that.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.960
[Guest]: So I know that, you know, my banana chips is sort of a first world problem and, you

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.960
[Amit Varma]: know, to hell with me and my banana chips.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:06.960
[Guest]: Check your banana chip privilege.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.720
[Guest]: But there are a lot of things like this.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.320
[Guest]: And I mean, think of it from the point of view of someone who's making banana chips

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:17.240
[Guest]: in Calicut, he's denied access to my market.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.820
[Guest]: And I would have maybe bought a lot of banana chips, and maybe there are lots of people

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:21.820
[Guest]: like me.

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:25.160
[Guest]: But I've really denied him his prosperity, right?

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:30.360
[Guest]: Because the size of the market, as Adam Smith said, determines the degree of specialization,

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.360
[Guest]: right?

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.560
[Amit Varma]: It's too bad we've already done the caricature for this episode.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:42.400
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise we would have had a packet of banana chips, which anyway, moving on from banana

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.600
[Amit Varma]: chips, you know, at this point, since it's my hundredth episode, I should and thanks

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:51.080
[Amit Varma]: for thanking myself for reminding me that there are many people who work hard behind

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.400
[Amit Varma]: the scenes to make the scene in the unseen a success.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:58.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'll quickly give a shout out to them before we continue, which is Amit Doshi of

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.320
[Amit Varma]: IVM first came to me and his creative director, Thomas also sat together with me and we worked

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.320
[Amit Varma]: pretty hard.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:09.160
[Amit Varma]: And initially we did like five or six pilots, which was a disaster because we were not looking

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.320
[Amit Varma]: at it as a straight up interview show.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.920
[Amit Varma]: It was like a produced thing where I'll talk about something and there'll be soundbites

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:15.920
[Amit Varma]: from various people.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And I remember you also gave soundbites and it was a disaster.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.360
[Amit Varma]: And then one day I decided to hell with it, I'm just going to sit and talk with someone

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.520
[Amit Varma]: and that's the episode we'll put that.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.160
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of worked much better.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.680
[Amit Varma]: I have had three producers in the time that I've been here, first day was Joshua Thomas,

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.240
[Amit Varma]: who's now moved on and is heading the Indian Express podcast team, wonderful guy, who's

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.160
[Amit Varma]: also played the guitar a couple of times where I've tried out these little spoken word things

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:44.560
[Amit Varma]: in the intros, extremely embarrassing now that I think about it.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:49.720
[Amit Varma]: My next, my second producer was a gentleman named Abbas Momin, who's in the studio now,

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:54.840
[Amit Varma]: who at some point got bored and decided that I am not producing the show anymore.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.560
[Amit Varma]: I would rather produce Cyrus Says.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:05.080
[Amit Varma]: And he left me for Cyrus Says, at which point I'm funnier than Cyrus Says, if inadvertently,

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:10.000
[Amit Varma]: at which point my next producer was Swati Bakshi, who recently left to pursue further

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.400
[Amit Varma]: studies abroad and Abbas is now back reluctantly, though he tries to smile now and then.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.480
[Amit Varma]: All the illustrations that you see are done by Aleka Gupta, very quiet, unassuming person

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:27.240
[Amit Varma]: who just, you know, I'll give illustration ideas and she'll pick one of the ideas and

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.720
[Amit Varma]: she'll execute and it doesn't even need to come back to me to see it because she does

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.040
[Amit Varma]: such such an amazing job.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.280
[Amit Varma]: So I'm a big fan of that.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Vijay Doifode has been my editor for all 100 episodes and he is just incredible.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.320
[Amit Varma]: And now, of course, it's a straight up easy editing job.

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.440
[Amit Varma]: But at one point I would talk about dream sequences in my intros and there would be

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.360
[Guest]: sound effects and all that and Vijay was...

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:53.640
[Guest]: Which I believe Twitter sort of trolled you for and caused you to can it.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:59.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, they, let us just say the listener feedback was not very good, but I heard it and every

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.320
[Amit Varma]: once in a while some random guy will pop up and say that, yeah, I really like those dream

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.080
[Amit Varma]: sequences, bring them back.

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:10.680
[Amit Varma]: And I am like that, you know, it's very difficult for me to get people to like what I do, you

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.680
[Amit Varma]: know.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.420
[Amit Varma]: I'm not going to mess with that again.

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.960
[Amit Varma]: So those dream sequences and those spoken word poems with guitar in the background are

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.960
[Amit Varma]: all gone.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960
[Guest]: Our loss.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:24.840
[Amit Varma]: And my various sound engineers like Tejesh Sringarpure, like my good friend Mayur here

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:30.720
[Amit Varma]: sitting here, who's given me much investment advice in the past, yeah.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.720
[Guest]: And Mayur also plays the guitar among other things.

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.200
[Guest]: Mayur also plays the guitar?

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.800
[Amit Varma]: You never told me that, bro.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.080
[Amit Varma]: He's a full-time musician.

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:40.120
[Amit Varma]: He warned you not to tell me because I'll make you play.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:48.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to revive some spoken word plus guitar thing at some point in the future.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.400
[Amit Varma]: Moving on.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.400
[Amit Varma]: You should thank your guests.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:55.920
[Amit Varma]: That's actually a given and yeah, obviously, I mean, this show is, I mean, you know, a

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.160
[Amit Varma]: lot of people honestly have been so generous with their time just to come and sit with

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.360
[Amit Varma]: me and talk to me, not just the stars like Harsha Bhogle, obviously, who are like, you

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.880
[Amit Varma]: know, at a different level and it's so sweet of them to come and talk, but absolutely everyone.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.440
[Amit Varma]: Opportunity costs, like you say.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.560
[Guest]: So I don't know what the hell to get out of it.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:20.400
[Guest]: One big thing you bring to the table other than your radio looks and, you know, I think,

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:28.640
[Guest]: you know, really incredibly smart people and you have found a way to listen to them, right?

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.840
[Guest]: So you have expertise in a whole bunch of areas more than most people do, but you've

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.440
[Guest]: managed to find people who have very specific expertise and bring them on and actually help

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.920
[Guest]: them showcase what it is that they do.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.920
[Guest]: I think that's quite cool.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:45.320
[Amit Varma]: That's a continuing effort and we'll keep trying in good faith to make it work.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:53.760
[Amit Varma]: So if you don't like the odd episode, what to do, ask for a refund.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.920
[Guest]: You know, for all our cribbing about the government, the refund might be like a government system

01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:58.920
[Guest]: in this case.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I got to tell you, you know, so what happened is, as you know, I'm going to Hong

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.280
[Amit Varma]: Kong tonight.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280
[Amit Varma]: We're recording this on the 21st.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to Hong Kong for a week tonight.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:11.080
[Amit Varma]: And last Friday I suddenly realized that my passport had expired and I was like, oh shit,

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.080
[Amit Varma]: what do I do now?

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.320
[Unknown]: How do I get it done?

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.880
[Amit Varma]: So now I did not know about this Satkal thing.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:20.240
[Amit Varma]: The last this had happened to me, my father, who was then a working IAS officer in the

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.960
[Amit Varma]: late nineties, had used major government pull in the central government and I got it within

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:25.960
[Amit Varma]: a week.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.320
[Amit Varma]: And I thought, damn it, I don't have that kind of pull anymore because the old man has

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.320
[Amit Varma]: retired.

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.320
[Amit Varma]: So what's going to happen to me?

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.280
[Amit Varma]: So I went online, I did an application.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.800
[Amit Varma]: I got an appointment the next morning.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.640
[Amit Varma]: I went the next morning, gave the application.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Within 23 hours, the passport was in my hand and I was like, goodbye libertarian days.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.040
[Amit Varma]: Government works.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.040
[Amit Varma]: This is the future.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.160
[Amit Varma]: Of course, you're outsourced to TCS and all that.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.440
[Guest]: But no, but even before they had, I've got a Satkal passport and you know, there are

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.920
[Amit Varma]: some areas in which credit must be given when it's due.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:56.920
[Amit Varma]: Credit must be given.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.600
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of sad that we should feel so happy and ecstatic and overjoyed at the government

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.600
[Guest]: doing something that, hey, it's supposed to do.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.160
[Guest]: When anyone does something that they're supposed to do, I feel quite happy.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.160
[Guest]: Right.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.240
[Guest]: No, I mean, my Ola cab didn't show up on time today.

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.440
[Guest]: It took a really long time because Chembur is a bit complicated and he apparently got

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.920
[Guest]: lost and so on and so forth.

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.600
[Guest]: So when anyone does anything, you know, without creating uncertainty or confusion, it's pretty

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.600
[Amit Varma]: nice.

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.280
[Amit Varma]: Which is actually great because I think too many of us feel too entitled.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:31.360
[Amit Varma]: And this has happened to me also that I feel entitled to efficiency, that somewhere I am

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.160
[Amit Varma]: getting bad service and I will think that, damn it, I work so hard, I'm so efficient,

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.440
[Amit Varma]: which is not true, but whatever.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.440
[Amit Varma]: I work so hard.

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.440
[Amit Varma]: I'm so efficient.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.340
[Amit Varma]: Why can't I expect the same back when I'm paying for it?

01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:46.480
[Amit Varma]: But I think we should all be a little less entitled and we'll be happier.

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:49.960
[Guest]: I've learned gratitude living in America, to be very honest, which is also something

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.440
[Guest]: we've spoken about in the past.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.800
[Guest]: Which is in fact a point that Kumar brought up.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.560
[Guest]: I mean, I guess because I don't know exactly where the roots of this come from.

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:05.080
[Guest]: I haven't thought about it deeply enough, but I feel like when you grow up in a particular,

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.360
[Guest]: you know, economic and social strata in India, you're sort of born with everything and you're

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.360
[Guest]: very privileged.

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:14.280
[Guest]: And like you said, you know, your parents used to get you into the right school or to

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:18.520
[Guest]: get you a passport when the facility wasn't there and so on.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.520
[Guest]: And because things have been handed to you, you tend to feel like, oh, this should have

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:24.520
[Amit Varma]: happened.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And I'll share it with my listeners.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:29.400
[Amit Varma]: And I wonder what people think about that, you know, leave Twitter comments if you have

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.560
[Amit Varma]: any insights into this.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:35.240
[Amit Varma]: But so my friend Kumar Anand had sort of shared this insight with me that one of his friends

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:40.040
[Amit Varma]: who was visiting from the US, Andrew Humphries, in fact, whom you know, yeah, so I think Andrew

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.760
[Amit Varma]: made the point to him that, you know, that Indians don't seem to feel much gratitude.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.200
[Amit Varma]: Like whenever Andrew would be served at a restaurant or, you know, an auto driver would

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.560
[Amit Varma]: take him somewhere and he'd be like, thank you, and he'd mean it.

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:54.200
[Amit Varma]: But Indians, if they say thank you at all, say it in a very pro forma way.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.280
[Amit Varma]: And I don't know if this is a Protestant value or a Judeo Christian value or whatever it

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:03.240
[Amit Varma]: is, but people in the West just seem to say thank you and mean thank you, feel the gratitude

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.800
[Amit Varma]: more than people here do.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And we were trying to figure out why could that be?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, is it is it a cultural thing?

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:16.640
[Amit Varma]: Is it because Indians have, you know, grown up in this zero sum environment where everyone

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.480
[Amit Varma]: is just going grab what you can, or?

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.960
[Guest]: I think that's part of it.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.360
[Guest]: I think a very large part of it is the caste system.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:29.780
[Guest]: You know, we're all, I mean, if you go by the rules of the caste system, we're born

01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:32.440
[Unknown]: into the jobs we're supposed to be doing.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.480
[Unknown]: And it is our dharma to do it.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:35.840
[Guest]: So why should you be thanked for it?

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.840
[Guest]: Right?

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:39.440
[Guest]: So if the sweeper is sweeping well, that's what he was supposed to do.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.020
[Unknown]: Why was he born a sweeper?

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:43.040
[Guest]: Because he must have done something bad in his past life.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.840
[Guest]: So he was born in the low caste as a sweeper.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:49.920
[Guest]: And we have this whole mythology built around why every person has their place in society

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.880
[Guest]: and they're doing what they're supposed to do.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:54.840
[Guest]: And if they are not doing what they're supposed to do, they're not following their dharma.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:59.600
[Guest]: And you know, then God's wrath will be upon them and they will be born as a snail or something,

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.520
[Guest]: you know, something terrible.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:06.640
[Guest]: So the idea that people genuinely are doing you something, which is, you know, they're

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:12.260
[Guest]: being good to you, and you acknowledge that that is something wonderful, that was not

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:14.240
[Guest]: something that they were supposed to do anyway.

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.720
[Guest]: I think culturally is a little bit lacking in us.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, if that's the case, and that tells us that there's something very toxic about

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.160
[Amit Varma]: our culture.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:22.560
[Guest]: I think it's very toxic.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.880
[Guest]: You know, when I was talking about this just a couple of days ago, I can't remember with

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:32.960
[Guest]: whom, with Pranay Kothasthani, another common friend and a wonderful guest on your show.

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:39.520
[Guest]: I was in Bangalore with him, we were having breakfast at MTR, a meal I thoroughly enjoyed.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:43.160
[Guest]: We were talking about how there seems to be division of labor, right?

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:48.360
[Guest]: Lots of people working at MTR, but the division of labor is not the market division of labor.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.640
[Guest]: Person who takes your order is different from the person who serves you, and is different

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.640
[Guest]: from the person who cleans the table.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:59.160
[Guest]: And it's not because there is so much business that they need to divide.

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:03.880
[Guest]: It's because the person who takes your order will not touch the dirty dishes.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:04.880
[Guest]: Wow.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:05.880
[Guest]: Right?

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:10.880
[Guest]: There is a deep caste element to this, which is in front of us all the time, which we just

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.800
[Guest]: don't notice because we're so accustomed to it, right?

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:18.160
[Guest]: And because we're fortunate enough to be on the right side of that divide, so we can ignore

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.840
[Guest]: that and pretend it doesn't exist.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.680
[Guest]: There's a lovely Akhil Katyal poem on that, actually, which I can't remember the exact

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:31.120
[Guest]: verse, but it talks about how a young person doesn't know his caste and he's 12 years old,

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.160
[Amit Varma]: and someone says to him, then you must be upper caste, if you don't know your caste

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.160
[Amit Varma]: by the time you're 12.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.160
[Amit Varma]: That's a beautiful poem.

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.160
[Amit Varma]: I had retweeted that.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:41.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm giving a kudos to the Times of India for running his poems every Sunday on the Sunday

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:46.240
[Amit Varma]: Times of India, which is so fashionable to shit on the Times of India, but they do good

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.240
[Guest]: things.

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:48.240
[Guest]: No, they do some.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you have a column in there.

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.240
[Amit Varma]: I have a column in there.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:53.960
[Amit Varma]: All my anti-Modi columns have come in the Times of India and yet those guys are, you

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.440
[Amit Varma]: know, harangued for being whatever.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:01.680
[Amit Varma]: I think times really subsist in different silos and the silos act independently and

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:02.680
[Amit Varma]: they do their own thing.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And the Sunday Times of India is an awesome silo.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.400
[Guest]: Yeah, it really is.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:10.120
[Guest]: I mean, I have read the Times of India most of my life in India because of the RK Lakshman

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.120
[Amit Varma]: cartoon.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.120
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Shout out to my editor Neelam.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And moving on to happier things as it's getting time to wind up and we're running out of studio

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.520
[Amit Varma]: time.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.400
[Amit Varma]: What books have you read this year, which you really enjoyed?

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.120
[Guest]: I've read a bunch of books.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.600
[Guest]: I don't think I read as much as you.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:31.400
[Guest]: The last book I read, which was really fantastic was, it just came out, I think early December

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.400
[Guest]: it was released.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.560
[Guest]: It's called Order Without Design.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.480
[Guest]: It's by Alain Bertot.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.440
[Guest]: I'm not sure if I'm saying his name right.

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.160
[Guest]: He's at the Marion Institute at NYU.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:46.040
[Guest]: And he has a lot of experience in urban planning and policymaking.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:52.520
[Guest]: And he's basically talked about how cities are emergent orders and how we think we can

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:59.340
[Guest]: design cities top down, but it never works and usually has terrible consequences.

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:03.560
[Guest]: I am really trimming the inside of his book into a couple of sentences.

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.280
[Guest]: His book has great stories.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:10.280
[Guest]: It talks about the mill land, which was locked away, you know, because of industrial use

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:14.360
[Guest]: and, you know, prime Mumbai sort of real estate.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.600
[Guest]: He talks about Beijing.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.240
[Guest]: He talks about cities in Indonesia.

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.360
[Guest]: He talks about New York.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.080
[Guest]: He talks about a lot of cities.

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.640
[Guest]: He has such fantastic insight.

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.320
[Guest]: And I had the opportunity of interacting with him a couple of times.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:36.160
[Guest]: And his basic idea is that we need urban planning to sort of delineate what is a public space

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.920
[Guest]: and what is a private space.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:41.040
[Guest]: And that's where the job of the planner ends, in a sense.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:45.260
[Guest]: They shouldn't dictate what one must do with a private space, right?

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:46.760
[Guest]: This can only be a restaurant.

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.360
[Guest]: This can only be an art studio.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.200
[Guest]: This can only be a residence.

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:52.120
[Guest]: That is a really bad idea.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.840
[Guest]: And it also hampers cities from functioning the way they should function, which is as

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:01.160
[Guest]: in, you know, enormous labor markets and innovation markets.

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.880
[Guest]: So that book is really lovely.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:06.940
[Guest]: It provides a lot of context, very insightful.

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.920
[Guest]: Another book, though it came out last year, but I must mention that I've had a new appreciation

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:17.120
[Guest]: for it this year with all the elections, is Milan Vaishnav's When Crime Pays.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.560
[Guest]: I think it's an extraordinary book.

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:26.000
[Guest]: It basically talks about the nexus between criminality and politics, how Indians manage

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.800
[Guest]: to elect criminals and not criminals, you know, who are criminals like Gandhi and Nehru

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.560
[Guest]: were for protests or civil disobedience because of criminals.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:38.880
[Guest]: They have kidnapping, you know, extortion, murder cases against them.

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:43.940
[Guest]: And his idea is that, you know, it's more beneficial because of the way campaign finance

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:49.200
[Guest]: is set up for political parties to have criminals because criminals come with their own funding

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.000
[Guest]: and elections are an incredibly costly business.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.400
[Guest]: And the second part of it is individual citizens vote for criminals because they can get things

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.900
[Guest]: done because of state capacity being so low.

01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:05.240
[Guest]: You actually want to vote for the local dada or the local goon because they will be able

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:09.840
[Guest]: to get you your Tadkal passport or, you know, get something fixed or get you your ration

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.000
[Guest]: card and so on and so forth.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
[Guest]: Right.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
[Guest]: They are the problem solvers.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.960
[Guest]: So that book, exactly that book, I think, though it came out last year, I mean, it's

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.200
[Guest]: going to have relevance for a long time, but I think it was really this year's set of elections

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.040
[Guest]: really highlighted that book again.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.040
[Guest]: What about you?

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.040
[Amit Varma]: What are the books that you read?

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.400
[Amit Varma]: Well, when you were speaking about, you know, Order Without Design, that kind of reminded

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:37.320
[Amit Varma]: me of a very old book, which I read this year, The Power Broker by Robert Caro.

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.320
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:43.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, The Power Broker is a biography of a man called Robert Moses, who in a sense built

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:48.440
[Amit Varma]: modern New York over a period of 30 or 40 years, starting from the late 1920s.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.520
[Amit Varma]: And Caro's book was commissioned, if I remember correctly, in around 64, he was supposed to

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.000
[Amit Varma]: write it in a year.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.960
[Amit Varma]: Instead, he took 12 years to write it.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.940
[Amit Varma]: And it was more than a million words.

01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:05.880
[Amit Varma]: They eventually had to cut it down to 750,000 or something, which included an entire book

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.680
[Guest]: length section on the great Jane Jacobs.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.680
[Guest]: Oh, wow.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.680
[Guest]: She's fantastic.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:14.920
[Amit Varma]: She wrote that all time classic, The Death and Life of Great American Cities.

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:19.280
[Amit Varma]: And in the process of writing that book and doing all the things that she did, ran up

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.520
[Amit Varma]: against Robert Moses.

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.520
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:26.760
[Amit Varma]: And I found The Power Broker an absolutely mind blowing book because it wasn't just a

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.020
[Amit Varma]: biography of this one man.

01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:32.700
[Amit Varma]: It was also a biography of a city of New York City.

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:38.720
[Amit Varma]: It was a chronicle of a philosophy in top down design, which is that kind of high modernist

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:43.280
[Amit Varma]: planning where you plan everything and there is a restaurant and there is this and we need

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:49.160
[Amit Varma]: bridges and demolish all these neighborhoods because we need to do this there and so on

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160
[Amit Varma]: and so forth.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.760
[Amit Varma]: With Jane Jacobs fought against arguing for the organic growth of cities.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:59.520
[Amit Varma]: And it's also a fascinating character study of how power corrupts, of how someone who

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:05.260
[Amit Varma]: starts out as an idealistic young man wanting to make a difference can become this absolute

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.520
[Amit Varma]: immoral monster by the end of it.

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:13.360
[Guest]: And Robert Moses is alive and well in New York City in the sense that it is being regulated

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.920
[Guest]: more and more heavily in terms of land use with each passing year.

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:21.920
[Guest]: I live in not just a landmarked building, but a landmarked neighborhood.

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.760
[Guest]: So the door of my building is about a hundred pounds.

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:29.800
[Guest]: I had shoulder surgery last year and I asked them, I said, why is this door like this?

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.440
[Guest]: A lot of like elderly people in the building, why can't we just change it or fix it?

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.120
[Guest]: And they said, we can't touch it.

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.120
[Guest]: It's landmarked.

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.960
[Guest]: So, you know, the show, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, one of the outdoor shots is of my

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:40.960
[Guest]: building.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:41.960
[Guest]: Right.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.880
[Guest]: And my building is in no way exceptional.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.880
[Guest]: It's quite ordinary.

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.800
[Guest]: It's from a particular time, the early 1900s.

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.240
[Guest]: And there are plenty of those buildings, all of the neighborhood, and they are all landmarked,

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.400
[Guest]: which basically means that you can't change anything.

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.920
[Guest]: It's a privilege of the elite to enjoy historical landmarks.

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.120
[Guest]: These are not even that great.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:09.520
[Guest]: And it prevents incumbents and future innovators from building new and better buildings.

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.640
[Guest]: And this is a sort of like Moses thinking versus like Jacob's or Hayekian thinking.

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.120
[Guest]: And you're absolutely right.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.800
[Guest]: So yeah, I mean, Order Without Design also has a lot of Jacob's insights.

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:26.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm looking forward to reading that book and I have some really great guests lined up.

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:31.300
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to jinx it by naming them, but people I'm very excited about.

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.440
[Amit Varma]: So if those work out, we shall see.

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you shall always be a recurring presence on my show, I hope.

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.120
[Guest]: Yes, I would love to.

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.940
[Guest]: And here's to many more hundreds of episodes in the future.

01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:47.720
[Guest]: And congratulations to you and the whole IVM team.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.720
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:52.160
[Amit Varma]: And I don't know when you say many more hundreds of shows, I'm thinking is that a blessing

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.160
[Amit Varma]: or a curse?

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.160
[Guest]: What are you doing?

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:55.160
[Guest]: Shut up.

01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:59.280
[Guest]: And to all the listeners, you can continue your labor of love.

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.280

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.240
[Guest]: If that's where you put it, thank you so much.

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.840

[Unknown]: Family businesses get a bad rap.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.440
[Unknown]: At one time they were looked down on for getting rich, for being too ambitious.

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.480
[Unknown]: Today they're still looked down on, but for not being ambitious enough, not agile enough,

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.520
[Unknown]: not modern enough, too traditional in their mindset.

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.560

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.120
