00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.340
[Amit Varma]: How should we think about health? Well, here's how I think of my personal health. I don't

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.380
[Amit Varma]: sleep enough. I don't exercise enough. I eat the wrong food. In other words, just because

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.840
[Amit Varma]: I feel okay now, I act as if I don't need to do anything to make sure I feel okay later.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.620
[Amit Varma]: But one day, I'll fall ill and then I'll be at my doctor's clinic saying kindly give medicines.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.000
[Amit Varma]: I will be disciplined in taking them. I care about my health. This is the wrong approach.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.800
[Amit Varma]: My thinking about my personal health care is flawed, and I will only realize it when

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.080
[Amit Varma]: I fall ill. And then if I get better, I will forget it again. And that's our nation's attitude

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.060
[Amit Varma]: towards health care, especially if we are among the urbanized English speaking elites.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.960
[Amit Varma]: We feel okay most of the time. And when we don't, we have access to fancy doctors and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.980
[Amit Varma]: fancier hospitals. We don't spend time worrying about our health care system. And yet, we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.940
[Amit Varma]: are now in the middle of a crisis where we can't ignore it anymore. You could say as

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.840
[Amit Varma]: a nation, as a democracy, we are suffering the impact of a chronic disease that we had

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.200
[Amit Varma]: earlier normalized. And it is now making us suffer. COVID-19 has made it clear that our

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.320
[Amit Varma]: health care system is broken. As much as that, it has also revealed that our dysfunctional

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
[Amit Varma]: state is a greater crisis than COVID-19. In fact, our dysfunctional state is a chronic

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.960
[Amit Varma]: crisis that we have been suffering from for over 70 years. Now maybe fixing the state

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.020
[Amit Varma]: is beyond us. But we must ask ourselves, how can we fix our health care system? We need

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.520
[Amit Varma]: to do it. And we need to start now before COVID-19 recedes, and we slip back into our

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.880
[Amit Varma]: bubbles of denial. And before we fix it, we need to understand it.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.080
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.320
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.800
[Amit Varma]: today is a brilliant economist, Karthik Muralidharan. Karthik had last appeared on episode 185 of

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.040
[Amit Varma]: this show, which as of now is the third most downloaded episode of mine. It was a comprehensive

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.140
[Amit Varma]: discussion on our education system. And we had promised each other that we would one

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.180
[Amit Varma]: day have a similar long chat about our health care system, another subject that Karthik

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.520
[Amit Varma]: has studied deeply. Well, that day has come when the subject feels so immediate and visceral,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.600
[Amit Varma]: and not just something that academics and policy monks should care about. Now, just

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.980
[Amit Varma]: as that earlier episode was titled fixing Indian education, I thought of calling this

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.280
[Amit Varma]: one fixing Indian health care. But we both agreed that it seems almost arrogant to say

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.720
[Amit Varma]: that we know how to fix this. This is such a deep problem that we first need to try and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.280
[Amit Varma]: understand it. Thus this title, understanding Indian health care. Now it so happens that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.960
[Amit Varma]: Karthik is writing a book about fixing the Indian state. And he sent me the early draft

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.360
[Amit Varma]: of his chapter on health care. I can't share a chapter with you. But the show notes contain

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.080
[Amit Varma]: many, many of the papers that are mentioned there, which give a foundational understanding

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.160
[Amit Varma]: of our health care system. I encourage you don't just listen to this episode. Also go

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.360
[Amit Varma]: through those papers. We all have a stake in this thing. Karthik and I have also agreed

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.320
[Amit Varma]: in a few weeks from now to do another episode on federalism in India. Now one thing I found

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.920
[Amit Varma]: delightful about this particular conversation is that it felt like it was part of a larger

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.600
[Amit Varma]: ongoing conversation spanning many episodes of mine. Karthik wrote to me and offered to

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.520
[Amit Varma]: have this conversation after listening to my episode on vaccines with Ajay Shah. And

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.600
[Amit Varma]: during this conversation, he kept quoting previous guests such as Ashwin Mahesh and

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.640
[Amit Varma]: Anirban Mapatra, adding to their insights and carrying their arguments forward. This

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.140
[Amit Varma]: is the best thing about the seen and the unseen, as regular listeners would have realized.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.440
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, Karthik and I disagreed on quite a few things in this episode, such as

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.440
[Amit Varma]: a high petrol prices because of how much the government taxes, which I feel is a bad thing.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.880
[Amit Varma]: But Karthik feels is a good thing. And that actually illustrates another fundamental disagreement

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.060
[Amit Varma]: between us. He has faith that the dysfunctional state can be reformed. And while I would love

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.120
[Amit Varma]: all efforts towards that to continue, I feel that we must stop depending on the state and

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.840
[Amit Varma]: try to figure out how society can solve its own problems. But that's a larger ongoing

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.760
[Amit Varma]: conversation. And what we both agreed on is that we need to understand this problem first

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.360
[Amit Varma]: before we think about how to solve it. And some of Karthik's insights in this episode

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.480
[Amit Varma]: are just stunning. And so is the singing. Yes, my friends, we have a little Antakshari

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.280
[Amit Varma]: session at the end of this episode. And Karthik sings a couple of songs for us. And why not?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:40.120
[Amit Varma]: Karthik is the best medicine. But before we get there, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.440
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.920
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.400
[Amit Varma]: face is how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.480
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place for us? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.760
[Amit Varma]: of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.660
[Amit Varma]: to help people up level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.960
[Amit Varma]: of their programs called the Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.240
[Amit Varma]: form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.160
[Amit Varma]: mental models to even marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.000
[Amit Varma]: every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. So if you want to

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.440
[Amit Varma]: build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader.

[Amit Varma]: Up-level yourself.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.640
[Amit Varma]: care and hey that day has come in rather difficult times where health care has

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.720
[Amit Varma]: become not just some abstract issue but it's really touching everybody's lives

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.400
[Amit Varma]: here in intimate and sometimes really sad ways. Tell me how have the last few

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.560
[Amit Varma]: months been for you because you know we have of course faced this global pandemic

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.580
[Amit Varma]: and you are you know given what's happening in India you are a very close

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.040
[Amit Varma]: to it because so many people close to you must be here and getting affected at

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.560
[Amit Varma]: the same time you're far away at another intellectual level you're closer to it

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.080
[Amit Varma]: than most people because you understand all the fault lines in our health care

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.480
[Amit Varma]: system which we'll talk about as we go along and all the fault lines in the

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.900
[Amit Varma]: Indian state as we'll go along so just at a personal level how has it been for

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.920
[Amit Varma]: you you know emotionally and just in terms of your intellectual pursuits

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.520
[Amit Varma]: during this time you've also been writing this book which I can't wait to

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.920
[Amit Varma]: read on you know fixing the Indian state so just tell me a little bit about how

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.240
[Amit Varma]: it's been for you over the last few months. Yeah thanks Amit you know I think

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.640
[Guest]: the last month has been particularly difficult the most kind of difficult part

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.440
[Guest]: in some ways has been this is the longest 15 months I have not traveled to

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.960
[Guest]: India I mean normally I come every two to three months and I had gotten my

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.560
[Guest]: vaccines in early March and I was really looking forward to making a trip in fact

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.840
[Guest]: in late April early early May and that is clearly not feasible right now and

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.240
[Guest]: but more than that just seeing how this situation exploded in the past month I

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.320
[Guest]: think it's yeah it is very surreal to be kind of physically safe where I am in

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.040
[Guest]: the US but kind of mentally essentially facing as much if not all like you know

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.840
[Guest]: I mean of the stresses and turmoils of parents and friends and people who are

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.720
[Guest]: affected no it's been very very difficult I think there are obviously

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.240
[Guest]: things you can do from here in terms of donations and stuff but I'm also trying

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.040
[Guest]: to apply my mind to the few policy things that could be done and you know

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.360
[Guest]: we'll talk more about that going forward so yeah you know I think just applying

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.040
[Guest]: first principles to sensible design of healthcare systems and how do you kind

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.520
[Guest]: of use this moment of kind of reckoning almost about the weakness of our

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.680
[Guest]: healthcare systems to make the right investments going forward so you know

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.000
[Guest]: just like we say about the 91 reforms the crisis by itself was not enough to

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.160
[Guest]: have the reforms you also needed the blueprint to be ready of what you're

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.400
[Guest]: going to do and so my hope is that some of the analytical principles we'll talk

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.400
[Guest]: about today you know can be useful in kind of the nation's reactions to this

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.920
[Guest]: moment of crisis in terms of the kind of investments we'll make going forward so

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.240
[Amit Varma]: there are a couple of thoughts I have I mean obviously we want to talk about

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.960
[Amit Varma]: healthcare in general and really maybe talk a little bit about COVID at the end

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.240
[Amit Varma]: and I've had a few episodes on COVID already so I don't want to give my

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.600
[Amit Varma]: listeners too much more of that depressing subject right now but this

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of comes up as a pertinent question to ask you which is that there are two

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.280
[Amit Varma]: aspects of the pandemic that I've noted one the smaller one almost a trivial one

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.000
[Amit Varma]: that I chatted about with Anup Malani in the episode I did with him is that it

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
[Amit Varma]: inverted some of our values like some of the things which could otherwise be

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.120
[Amit Varma]: considered good suddenly worked against us like population density which we know

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.520
[Amit Varma]: is good which is why people go to cities you've got larger economic networks more

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.240
[Amit Varma]: people together more opportunities all of that but in the context of this

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.200
[Amit Varma]: pandemic that suddenly you know became a bit of a con but that's a trivial minor

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.960
[Amit Varma]: thing the larger thing that I noticed and I wrote a column about it last year

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.640
[Amit Varma]: in April when this first began stating that our greater crisis is not just

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.040
[Amit Varma]: COVID which will pass but the dysfunctional Indian state which has been in crisis

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.480
[Amit Varma]: for you know the last 70 years I think in that column I used to start I don't

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.440
[Amit Varma]: really remember it but something like 3,000 children in India die of

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.680
[Amit Varma]: starvation every day something like that I'm sure you have kind of better stats

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.120
[Amit Varma]: which to me is indicative of an ongoing disaster which we have completely

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.600
[Amit Varma]: normalized and if there's one thing that COVID has done it has shed light on a

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.840
[Amit Varma]: lot of things which we had normalized the apathy of politicians the

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.060
[Amit Varma]: dysfunctional state more than anything else the fact that the state simply

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.800
[Amit Varma]: doesn't work I mean I've always said that where the state is most required

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.000
[Amit Varma]: most justified it is absent there is effectively no rule of law in India and

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.760
[Amit Varma]: today we see that in the state of our healthcare where it was most required it

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.360
[Amit Varma]: was absent and we are see kind of seeing the consequences of that so do you think

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.840
[Amit Varma]: that there is also therefore a teachable moment in this that you can look at this

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:52.000
[Amit Varma]: moment and say that listen these things have been wrong forever right we haven't

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.440
[Amit Varma]: noticed them right now you are all looking at them because they are stuck

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.560
[Amit Varma]: they are in relief now this is a time where we have to therefore sit down and

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.840
[Amit Varma]: at an intellectual level analyze the problem because it's clear we can see it

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.120
[Amit Varma]: and and there is a will to do that and then think about what to do is this

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.080
[Amit Varma]: something that you've thought about and as someone who studied the inner workings

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.400
[Amit Varma]: of both the state and healthcare so deeply for so many years you know is

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.680
[Amit Varma]: that how you see it that these are things that were there and now these

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.440
[Guest]: fault lines are becoming stuck yeah no I think I've been rewriting many parts of

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.960
[Guest]: the introduction of the book I started the first chapters two years ago right

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.400
[Guest]: well before the pandemic yeah I think those of us who have been studying the

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.280
[Guest]: state have kind of known about these weaknesses and known that there was kind

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.320
[Guest]: of a gradual atrophy right I think Ajay also talked a little bit about why state

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.880
[Guest]: capacity is weaker now than it was like you know 30 40 50 years ago and frankly

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.560
[Guest]: you know I think as with all of these things it's multi-causal right and we

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.360
[Guest]: can get into that but I think in terms of the the book it almost feels like in

00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.200
[Guest]: a macabre way right mean that it is kind of you know it is hopefully rises to the

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.080
[Guest]: moment right because the book is called fixing the Indian state but it you know

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.560
[Guest]: hopefully the one silver lining from all of this disaster is that people realize

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.600
[Guest]: that this is no longer something that we can allow to kind of rest so coming to

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.800
[Guest]: the different reasons for why I think we've under invested the state one of

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.720
[Guest]: the downsides of liberalization I think it was positive in almost every way

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.120
[Guest]: frightening but is it has also led to a complete seceding of the elite right mean

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.040
[Guest]: from being recipients of public services right so the Indian elites and

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.880
[Guest]: policy-making classes middle any taxpayer it pretty much avails a private

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.760
[Guest]: health care private education private security you know and private whatever

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.320
[Guest]: you can right I mean and so one way to characterize the current moment it's

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.840
[Guest]: almost like the elites and middle classes have been flying first in

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.840
[Guest]: business class in the plane that is India right mean and kind of surrounding

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.700
[Guest]: them with creature comforts but now is the moment when you realize when the

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.160
[Guest]: plane crashes it takes you all down like you know I mean regardless of what class

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.000
[Guest]: you're flying in I mean there is obviously the hyper rich or the private

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.880
[Guest]: jet types who are leaving the country right like you know but except for that

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.080
[Guest]: type I mean I think the rest of us are kind of in this plane together and

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.520
[Guest]: sometimes physically not but emotionally we are at least that's my case

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.480
[Guest]: hopefully this is one of those wake-up calls as we you know we would have

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.960
[Guest]: wanted to approach a 75th year of independence in a moment of kind of you

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.120
[Guest]: know feeling great pride at what we've achieved but you know sometimes you need

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.600
[Guest]: these kind of rude wake-up calls to really look at how hollow the state is

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.720
[Guest]: inside and build and start working on the systematic project of building up

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.440
[Guest]: you know as academics and intellectuals you know we can contribute to this

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.040
[Guest]: public discourse with a certain amount of conceptual clarity and analysis and

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.600
[Guest]: then in terms of taking it forward it's obviously the larger community of state

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.360
[Guest]: citizens and civil society so you know in that way I hope yeah so timing wise I

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.960
[Guest]: think I'm about 95% done with the first complete draft of the book so it's

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.480
[Guest]: almost done but the problem of course is that as an academic the default first

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.480
[Guest]: drafts tend to be very defensive because academic writing you write every

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.280
[Guest]: sentence assuming a peer reviewer is going to come pounce on you and saying

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.240
[Guest]: how did you say this how did you say that and so you know so in that sense

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.960
[Guest]: there's still substantial editing needed I think the first draft you've seen in

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.600
[Guest]: the chapter I've sent you has a lot of content but it's still very terse and so

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.360
[Guest]: I it'll probably another six eight months of like serious editing but I'm

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.160
[Guest]: hoping the book will be able to hit the stand sometime next year you know and

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.920
[Guest]: coincidentally leading into the 75th year of independence and hopefully like

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.920
[Guest]: you know can be part of the national conversation at that time about what we

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.400
[Amit Varma]: need to do and hopefully will remain part of the national conversation

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.400
[Amit Varma]: because I'm really looking forward to it I think it's an important book I'll come

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.600
[Amit Varma]: back to the book in a moment because I do want to talk a bit more about the

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.080
[Amit Varma]: book the process of writing it editing it almost workshopping it with your

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.200
[Amit Varma]: students as you kind of discussed before we started but another sort of question

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.040
[Amit Varma]: which is something that I've been thinking about over the last few days

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.560
[Amit Varma]: but before that a little story I'd like to share with you and my listeners and

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.800
[Amit Varma]: and this concerns a dear friend of mine both his parents got COVID and were in

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:59.560
[Amit Varma]: different ICUs in different hospitals in Delhi and his dad was in a hospital

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.880
[Amit Varma]: called Jaipur Golden there were 21 beds in the surgery ICU there and he was in

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.480
[Amit Varma]: that particular ICU and one night oxygen ran out 20 people died so only his dad

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.120
[Amit Varma]: survived the other 20 died and his dad was devastated because the next day

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.920
[Amit Varma]: everybody else who was a patient in the ward with him was taken away in a body

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.240
[Amit Varma]: bag and and even and his dad is still struggling in fighting it out and my

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.120
[Amit Varma]: friend's mom died a few days later though she was getting better he thought

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.360
[Amit Varma]: that she'll get better he was worried about his dad and the failure of the

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.000
[Amit Varma]: state the failure of everything our politics the state everything was so

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.120
[Amit Varma]: stark and he called me and he said that everything is broken you know it's

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.720
[Amit Varma]: up to us to fix it we have to do something and his first thought in his

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.760
[Amit Varma]: deeply emotional state was that let's do something in politics and me being the

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.640
[Amit Varma]: cynic that I am I said that nothing will happen with that because politics is a

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.400
[Amit Varma]: supply end of the political marketplace till there is nothing in demand end

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.480
[Amit Varma]: politics my question yoga and also what will happen if you become a successful

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.040
[Amit Varma]: politician you'll take charge of the state the state is dysfunctional the

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.400
[Amit Varma]: state will remain dysfunctional right that's my negative view which I've

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.640
[Amit Varma]: always held which you're kind of aware of so I said keen a year

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.920
[Amit Varma]: who's a question yoga you can't have hopes from the state what you have to do

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.560
[Amit Varma]: if these problems are to be solved they have to be solved by private individuals

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.900
[Amit Varma]: you've got to figure out ways to solve it and and like you've pointed out the

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.560
[Amit Varma]: rich and the elite and I loved your metaphor of the plane called India and

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.280
[Amit Varma]: these people are flying first in business but it's gonna crash I love

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.400
[Amit Varma]: that metaphor it's stunning but the thing is how the rich and the elite have

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.120
[Amit Varma]: been getting so far is that they've insulated themselves from the state

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.560
[Amit Varma]: right they've done their job and they've got everything worked out and now they

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.840
[Amit Varma]: realize damn it we're in the same plane together so just as they've insulated

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.480
[Amit Varma]: themselves a lot of these problems it seems to me of the state I don't have

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.720
[Amit Varma]: much hope for much happening from the state at most you make incremental

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.920
[Amit Varma]: marginal improvements now you had spoken to me in the episode where you

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.560
[Amit Varma]: give so much insight on education you said that at the level of the state when

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.040
[Amit Varma]: you're talking of that kind of scale even a marginal improvement can touch

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.800
[Amit Varma]: hundreds of thousands of millions of people in fact and therefore it's worth

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.480
[Amit Varma]: it but you know it kind of strikes me in this dark moment that we can't have hope

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.800
[Amit Varma]: from the state anymore if things get better with the state that's fine it

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.960
[Amit Varma]: will happen over time it's a long game but private individuals have to kind of

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.880
[Amit Varma]: step in and therefore the larger question which perhaps I should have

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.520
[Amit Varma]: asked after we discussed all our health care problems and so on but it seems

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.280
[Amit Varma]: like an opposite time to ask it is that when we talk of the problems in the

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.720
[Amit Varma]: Indian state in our health care for example you know and we say that of

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.960
[Amit Varma]: course the state has to do it and I agree with you there that you know the

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.160
[Amit Varma]: positive externalities if everyone is healthy are so huge that of course the

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.960
[Amit Varma]: state has to do it especially in a poor country like India but if the problem is

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.840
[Amit Varma]: not getting solved from there then private people have to step in and find

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.880
[Amit Varma]: ways to do it what are your thoughts on this I'm sorry if I rambled a bit

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.680
[Guest]: the question is absolutely spot-on and see the book for the most part is

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.080
[Guest]: addressed to senior policymakers right because that's kind of the that's the

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.280
[Guest]: audience that has the capacity in the locus standi to actually fix the state

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:11.000
[Guest]: but my final chapter on making it happen right mean is essentially about state

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.720
[Guest]: citizen and civil society that's kind of speaking to some of these points that

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.320
[Guest]: you're talking about and in fact that's the one chapter that's not yet written I

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.720
[Guest]: have an outline but precisely because I think it's evolving so much as we see

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.440
[Guest]: right so India does have an incredible tradition of civil society yeah you know

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.120
[Guest]: there's no shortage of very very well-minded well-motivated sincere

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.600
[Guest]: organizations trying to do a lot of good and I do think there's a lot to be a lot

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.280
[Guest]: to be said now I think the challenge is what I've seen in the space is that

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:44.640
[Guest]: there is a lot of distributed subscale initiatives right mean that people do in

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:50.520
[Guest]: different places and thinking about how do you leverage that general angst that

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.720
[Guest]: citizens have that they want to shape their surroundings for the common good

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.120
[Guest]: how do you take that and channel that enthusiasm and desire in some in a

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.080
[Guest]: constructive way so one of the big things that's happened between the last

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.120
[Guest]: podcast and this is like I have gone back and heard so many more of your

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.200
[Guest]: episodes and the lockdown has helped me in the sense that the only exercise I

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.120
[Guest]: have is long walks and you know so just as an academic always makes cross

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.640
[Guest]: references the first time I came on the show I hadn't really heard many of the

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.840
[Guest]: past ones now I have heard said make connections to a lot more of your

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.280
[Guest]: previous episodes here right but I think Ashwin had multiple episodes has said

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.240
[Guest]: this incredibly I think powerfully right so start local but instead of saying

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.280
[Guest]: that I am going to go and create some organization that does something if you

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.400
[Guest]: go sit with your local municipal council if you go sit like you know with your

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.640
[Guest]: local public health guys the guys are doing the sewage and then understand how

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.560
[Guest]: can you leverage their existence as opposed to try to do something in

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.200
[Guest]: parallel right because the thing when you do something in parallel is you have

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.000
[Guest]: so I mean this is a complete digression but I guess we've done a one-hour

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.320
[Guest]: digression in the past but you know and one of the things I'll talk about in

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.960
[Guest]: that last chapter is the there is a range of what philanthropic civil

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.960
[Guest]: society actions right there are organizations like say the Red Cross and

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.920
[Guest]: Doctors Without Borders and you know organizations and you had a show on

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.760
[Guest]: feeding the hungry right mean during the pandemic right so the the organizations

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.160
[Guest]: that do what I call immediate humanitarian relief right mean

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.840
[Guest]: alleviating human suffering okay and that's incredibly important in the

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.360
[Guest]: moment because if you can't survive that moment in the long run you're dead okay

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: so but that's very very important that's one kind of civil society right then

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.400
[Guest]: there are civil society actions that say let me come and build a school or build

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.680
[Guest]: a hospital or build something where I want to build a certain center of

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.760
[Guest]: excellence and I will cross subsidize access to the poor and you know maybe I

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.200
[Guest]: will create something that the rich are willing to pay for and there are

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.920
[Guest]: different models of that and the reason people do that is because you're

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.840
[Guest]: well-minded you want to do something institutional as opposed to just give

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.160
[Guest]: immediate relief but you know that if you were to just fund the state then you

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.560
[Guest]: have it goes into the morass of the bureaucracy and so you want to preserve

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.040
[Guest]: a certain amount of operational autonomy on your school or your hospital and that

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.000
[Guest]: you can run into high standards okay like you know so that's another model of

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.680
[Guest]: civil society right then there are models of civil society action that

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.360
[Guest]: focus a lot more on citizen awareness and building rights okay and which I

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.920
[Guest]: think is again very very important and this has to the extent that a big part

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.280
[Guest]: of the dysfunctional state is that the people it is meant to serve are often

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.240
[Guest]: not empowered enough to hold it accountable right I mean that there are

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.600
[Guest]: you know a lots to be said for that okay but I think here is the problem with

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.600
[Guest]: that again the problem with this book right now is that each chapter could

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.760
[Guest]: well be a book in itself right I mean and I have this longish academic

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.880
[Guest]: discussion of why has democracy right I mean per se not delivered for India in

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.200
[Guest]: the way that we would think it should right I mean and and and the argument is

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.080
[Guest]: quite subtle right because it's basically democracy has helped in terms

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.760
[Guest]: of expanding the ability of people to make claims on the state okay but what

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.400
[Guest]: it has not done is expand the capacity of the state to deliver on those claims

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.800
[Guest]: right I mean so when you go in in activist mode and saying I'm going to

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.240
[Guest]: kind of teach people their rights and go and ask them to kind of you know and

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.280
[Guest]: mobilize better that's useful but it very quickly hits the capacity

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.080
[Guest]: constraint of the state itself right because essentially the state has so

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.080
[Guest]: limited resources in terms of budget and bandwidth that you're just kind of

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.720
[Guest]: moving the attention from the place that's shouting less to the place that's

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.160
[Guest]: shouting more okay like I mean so the real impact will come when you can

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.560
[Guest]: expand the supply and kind of enhance the capacity of the state to deliver and

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.480
[Guest]: the state is a metaphor really for all of us right so then and again I'll

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.040
[Guest]: elaborate on this a lot more in terms of both what individuals and civil society

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.880
[Guest]: can do but my broad thinking right now is that ways in which we can leverage

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.360
[Guest]: the existing state and help it work better are going to give you the highest

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.120
[Guest]: ROI and not everybody is going to go sit at the state level and start changing

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.920
[Guest]: policy but in your local in your city council you know to the extent that that

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.920
[Guest]: itself is a collective good right I mean that could be a very very good place to

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.640
[Guest]: start so again you know this was unplanned I thought we're going to talk

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.800
[Guest]: about health and but we always have this habit of doing digressions but hopefully

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.660
[Amit Varma]: some of the digressions are great I mean my my whole modus operandi of learning

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.560
[Amit Varma]: about the world is thinking aloud and having people either you know fill in

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.600
[Amit Varma]: the gaps in my knowledge and or add to it and so on so I'll take another

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.640
[Amit Varma]: digression from this digressive digression which is that you mentioned

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.400
[Amit Varma]: that our democracy has worked in terms of making people feel empowered enough

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.240
[Amit Varma]: to make demands of the state but it hasn't worked in the other way of the

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.200
[Amit Varma]: state having capacity to actually deliver on those demands so my question

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.920
[Amit Varma]: is that the reason the state hasn't developed that capacity is also a

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.240
[Amit Varma]: question of incentives because our government is not local enough that if

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.560
[Amit Varma]: our government was incredibly local that if you know I had done an episode on I

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.600
[Amit Varma]: think a very old episode with Shruti Rajgopalan on local governance and all

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.320
[Amit Varma]: of that and she pointed out that if you just look at Maharashtra right the

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.280
[Amit Varma]: person that you vote for your municipal councillor or whoever has practically no

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.040
[Amit Varma]: power to do anything to improve your life and the person who does have all

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.720
[Amit Varma]: that power the state government and all that they don't want your vote their

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.000
[Amit Varma]: vote bank is something else so there is a disconnect between power and

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.960
[Amit Varma]: accountability and the more local that government gets the more accountability

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.680
[Amit Varma]: there is and therefore if they were accountable to you they would build the

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.840
[Guest]: capacity to serve you so what I'm going to do is I'm going to punt on this to

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:11.160
[Guest]: our future episode on federalism and because I think last time we said you

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:16.000
[Guest]: know we put teasers of multiple future episodes so we'll do health today but I

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.560
[Amit Varma]: will come back to federalism some other time okay but before we get to health

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.920
[Amit Varma]: let's kind of get to your book tell me a little bit about your book the process

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.360
[Amit Varma]: of writing it the process of kind of workshopping it and also the interesting

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:31.760
[Amit Varma]: the other interesting aspect which is that does teaching teach you in the sense

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.800
[Amit Varma]: that if you think about there being like I think in an earlier episode with me

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Krish Ashok had spoken about this pyramid of learning where you know your

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.440
[Amit Varma]: learning is more shallow if you just listen to something it's a little deeper

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.840
[Amit Varma]: if you read it and so on down the way and it's deepest if you teach it I think

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.420
[Amit Varma]: so in your case you mentioned that one of the ways you workshop the book was

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.120
[Amit Varma]: you also taught bits of it did the process of teaching it having to pare

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.840
[Amit Varma]: everything down to a systematic structure explain it in simple language

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.640
[Amit Varma]: answer questions on it did that deepen your understanding and in general does

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.960
[Amit Varma]: you know through your career you've obviously been an incredible

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.760
[Amit Varma]: researcher that's a matter of public record but you've also taught so what's

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.880
[Amit Varma]: the relationship there between teaching and learning there's a reason why top

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.640
[Guest]: research universities have this positive feedback loop between research and

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.320
[Guest]: teaching right so there's no question about it that the act of putting

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.920
[Guest]: together a lecture and teaching forces you to distill both what you want your

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.600
[Guest]: audience to understand and how do we know what we know I'm forgetting his

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.800
[Guest]: name now because his handle is Bhalo Manush right but like you know four

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.080
[Guest]: episodes but what Anirban mentioned right like you know that when he got to

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.080
[Guest]: the US his first exam he bombed it because all his life he'd been taught

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.080
[Guest]: how to spit out the facts as opposed to kind of ask where do those facts come

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.720
[Guest]: from right means so and I think one of the first things I say is like you know

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.040
[Guest]: the your typical rote learning system teaches you to answer questions it

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.440
[Guest]: doesn't teach you to question the answers but good teaching is all about

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.480
[Guest]: not just teaching you something but teaching you principles teaching you how

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.760
[Guest]: to think right and I remember I think in my first class one of my freshman year

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.480
[Guest]: classes I think it was a chemistry class I think being taught by I can't remember

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.400
[Guest]: it was yeah it was either a Nobel Laureate or somebody of similar

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.760
[Guest]: eminence where he kind of said he said listen you know you've gotten here

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.800
[Guest]: essentially by solving exams but you know when you get into the lab right I

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.560
[Guest]: mean there is no script right there is no script because you're by construction

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.680
[Guest]: facing a new problem right I mean and so what you're going to get is just a set

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.880
[Guest]: of principles of how you're going to approach and navigate when you're in

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.120
[Guest]: uncharted territory so I think coming back to good teaching what I did with

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.880
[Guest]: this particular book teaching was to be honest the first draft which I taught it

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.520
[Guest]: was I committed to teaching a seminar class mainly as a commitment device to

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.680
[Guest]: myself to force myself to get that first draft done because I needed to give the

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.200
[Guest]: chapters to the students while teaching it so it was a seminar class of about 16

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.160
[Guest]: to 18 students and book has 18 chapters and the class at 20 lectures so one

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.440
[Guest]: intro one conclusion and then for each lecture I would basically assign them a

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.920
[Guest]: chapter 72 hours in advance and then students would read it and submit a

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.320
[Guest]: two-page response paper before the class and I just wanted them to basically have

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.360
[Guest]: three categories of notes first is the three to five things that they learn the

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.000
[Guest]: most important things they learn from the chapter the second is what are the

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.760
[Guest]: things they're still confused about or unclear about and third is you know what

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.320
[Guest]: are the so ideas they have for strengthening the chapter whether it's

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.960
[Guest]: with facts or some students had some ideas for cartoons which you know I

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.800
[Guest]: think will be great when I get a chance or just you know other ways of making

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.960
[Guest]: the points come across better so I required that before the class so that

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.480
[Guest]: was a commitment device that the students had to do the reading so then

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.320
[Guest]: coming to effective teaching you know you the best teaching is not when you're

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.120
[Guest]: repeating the lecture but if people have done the reading and then you come from

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.920
[Guest]: the beginning with a set of questions and you're engaging in the discussion so

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.800
[Guest]: I think so that was a lot of fun now like I said the first draft of the book

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.480
[Guest]: is still very very very terse because essentially you know I'm just trying to

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.840
[Guest]: synthesize a huge body of research and get it across but what's going to take

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.960
[Guest]: a lot of time in the editing and where the student feedback will help is to say

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.160
[Guest]: okay now how do you simplify simplify simplify because my hope is that this is

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:02.280
[Guest]: a book that is both essentially readable for your you know airport reader and is

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.860
[Guest]: viable as a textbook in any class in kind of public policy so the challenge

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.720
[Guest]: is of course there's lots and lots and lots of books in India written kind of

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.480
[Guest]: in a more experiential way right and I think what hopefully makes this book

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.400
[Guest]: different is just how much research there is so you kind of want to convey

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.120
[Guest]: the depth of the research without necessarily getting people bogged down

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.920
[Guest]: in the details so the challenge is to then put those in footnotes perhaps

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.680
[Guest]: create like an online appendix to the entire book that will then have the

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.000
[Guest]: studies and some of the more detailed technical pieces there so that that

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.160
[Guest]: becomes an accompaniment to people who want to teach with it but that's kind of

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.800
[Guest]: where I am right now so I think I'm about 95% of the way done but like we

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.680
[Guest]: said last time you know the podcast is so much fun because I can jump and make

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.160
[Guest]: connections right because the way the book is structured is set up around a

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.000
[Guest]: set of teams and then a set of sectors and the hardest part is there is so many

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.720
[Guest]: cross connections across everything in the book but the book by construction is

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.520
[Guest]: linear right so how do you make each chapter fully self-contained while at

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.480
[Guest]: the same time not repeat what's in other places right so so in writing say an

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.760
[Guest]: education chapter health chapter right I mean if I say go back and look at this

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.600
[Guest]: chapter and state in the market about how do you regulate go back and look at

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.560
[Guest]: this chapter on measurement go back and look at this chapter on federalism you

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.160
[Guest]: know then it's kind of that's I think the hardest part I think somebody

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.160
[Guest]: transcribed our education podcast and came to about 40,000 words and so

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.760
[Guest]: sometimes I really wonder why am I wasting three years writing a book when

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.400
[Amit Varma]: I can do four podcasts with you and be done in like half a day you know no it's

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.400
[Amit Varma]: not a waste because I've read one chapter of it and I cannot wait to read

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.960
[Amit Varma]: the full book I think you know one of the things on a very serious note I'm

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.120
[Amit Varma]: glad that you're writing this book that Ajay and Vijay Kelkar wrote in service

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.320
[Amit Varma]: of the Republic I think you know these books together and hopefully there'll be

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.800
[Amit Varma]: many more like them will form a body of work which a student of public policy in

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.320
[Amit Varma]: India will or anywhere for that matter will be able to look at to get different

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.920
[Amit Varma]: sort of foundational understandings which are really important and I'm just

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.520
[Amit Varma]: thinking aloud you spoke about how you know the book is so interconnected and

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.800
[Amit Varma]: how do you express those interconnections and I've been taking

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.080
[Amit Varma]: all my notes for my episodes recently in this app called Rome research which has

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.320
[Amit Varma]: something called bi-directional linking where you know within the category of

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.280
[Amit Varma]: health I could be talking about say regulation but regulation itself is a

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.200
[Amit Varma]: massive category which has five subcategories so somewhere a subcategory

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.080
[Amit Varma]: becomes a super category and all of that shit happens and the software kind of

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.560
[Amit Varma]: allows for that but you feel like that maybe there are even more refined

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.040
[Amit Varma]: versions that are kind of happening in the future and a book is really old

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:34.000
[Guest]: technology I think what I like about reading books and Kindles these days is

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.760
[Guest]: because you can click to the references right so I think because the academic

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.760
[Guest]: part of me when I read something you know half the time I want to click the

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.920
[Guest]: reference and kind of you know check that so yes so having more digital books

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.200
[Guest]: that are able to just hyperlink back right mm-hmm and so in fact sometimes I

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:54.320
[Guest]: remember a piece of advice I got when I was in the academic job market right the

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.800
[Guest]: faculty job market is when you go for a faculty job you kind of get these half

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.640
[Guest]: an hour interviews where people ask you all kinds of questions and you have no

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.240
[Guest]: idea what they're gonna ask you so one of the things was what you train your

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.240
[Guest]: students in terms of preparing for a job interview is to kind of think about

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.760
[Guest]: their first three to five minute spiel as the front page of a web page right and

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.440
[Guest]: then but there are hyperlinks based on what people questions they're gonna ask

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.800
[Guest]: you right and so you need to be able to drill one two three four five levels

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.480
[Guest]: below so you know if you're say an econometrics candidate and you're being

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.560
[Guest]: interviewed by faculty members one is in macro one is a micro one is

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.300
[Guest]: econometrics one is in development the people outside your field will ask some

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.200
[Guest]: interesting applied questions but that might be one level deep right the people

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.080
[Guest]: in your field will go five levels deep and your challenge is not just to answer

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.560
[Guest]: but once you finish the answer to come back to the front page and kind of

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.760
[Guest]: continue the narrative without kind of getting lost in the weeds right so again

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.440
[Guest]: when you have the experience each year you read more and more and more that

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.520
[Guest]: mental filing system expands in a way that you make more and more and more of

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.280
[Guest]: the connections which is why I think after 20 years of this work I felt ready

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.240
[Guest]: to write this book right because till now most of the work as an academic is

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.160
[Guest]: writing deep individual papers and but those papers don't really make the

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.380
[Guest]: connections across what's happening and so the book is a chance to make those

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.200
[Guest]: connections now that being said the linearity of the written word is still

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:10.920
[Guest]: quite vexing right I mean but you know it is it is it is what it is that's

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.000
[Amit Varma]: that's absolutely kind of fascinating now tell me about how healthcare because

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.520
[Amit Varma]: you know if one goes on YouTube and searches for Karthik Muralitharan you

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.760
[Amit Varma]: know besides of course our episode together you'll also find a lot of talks

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.180
[Amit Varma]: you've given on education and that makes sense so I was trying to kind of make

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.560
[Amit Varma]: sense of this right okay he's an expert in education everyone knows this how has

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.440
[Amit Varma]: he also gotten into healthcare and then I remembered something that you told me

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.160
[Amit Varma]: in our last episode where in the introduction you spoke about how the

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.000
[Amit Varma]: first person you named as an intellectual influence on you was Amartya Sen and

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.920
[Amit Varma]: Amartya Sen of course built this capabilities framework about what

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.760
[Amit Varma]: individuals kind of need to reach their full potential and that had two prongs

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.680
[Amit Varma]: to it and one was education and one was health so it was like voila okay that's

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.760
[Amit Varma]: why so I hope I'm not being too flippant but tell me a little bit more about how

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.880
[Amit Varma]: you got into it why you got into it what your journey doing health economics was

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.320
[Amit Varma]: like because one of the things that I've kind of noticed is that the body of work

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.720
[Amit Varma]: that you have is exciting the body of work all of these other economists who

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.360
[Amit Varma]: have done all of these papers when seen as a cumulative whole is is exciting but

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:23.020
[Amit Varma]: each individual paper seems to be you know like a lot of kind of stodgy leg

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.720
[Amit Varma]: work and a lot of just gathering data gathering data gathering data just to

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.800
[Amit Varma]: say that you know so many people are absent you are doing such a long study

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.020
[Amit Varma]: over such a period of time when you are it's common sense they are absent only

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:40.800
[Amit Varma]: no so how does that process work out and in a sense you just described your

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.560
[Amit Varma]: mental process where you do a lot of little concrete micro things and then

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.560
[Amit Varma]: they begin to form a bigger picture and it's to illuminate that bigger picture

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.400
[Amit Varma]: that you know you're writing the book but how has that process of being a

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.320
[Amit Varma]: health economist been like for you why did you get into it like if you are

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.540
[Amit Varma]: interested in the big questions and how do you figure out which are the small

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.440
[Amit Varma]: things to dive into first or is it happenstance take me through a little

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.520
[Amit Varma]: bit of this because the world of academics you know both fascinates me

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.960
[Amit Varma]: and intimidates me especially now when you talk about at an interview you have

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.640
[Amit Varma]: to go five level deep and come back up and I'm like what is this you know I'm

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.640
[Amit Varma]: just a person so you would have noticed I just go deep there's no front page so

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.480
[Guest]: they tell me yeah and thanks for asking that question because the truth is I'm not

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.520
[Guest]: a health economist and I shouldn't pretend to be one right but health

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.800
[Guest]: thinking about health permeates a lot of you know my larger thinking and teaching

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.480
[Guest]: and and and some of my research as well so I think one of the things I want to

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.160
[Guest]: do for your listeners is partly because I see you know I really liked Ajay's

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.680
[Guest]: episode and I see this almost is building off on that but he said you

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.480
[Guest]: know one of the things we need is really building a community of young

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.360
[Guest]: researchers and scholars in health research community so I see part of my

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.720
[Guest]: goal here is almost excite say college goers or master students to say what a

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.640
[Guest]: wonderful you know amazing field health economics is and how much there is to do

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.600
[Guest]: so I think in terms of my own personal entry points into health they come from

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.800
[Guest]: three angles right so the first is public finance right so at heart I'm a

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.280
[Guest]: public finance economist right so my core fields are public finance and

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:11.600
[Guest]: development and in public finance right health ends up accounting for over 20-25

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.520
[Guest]: percent of public spending in in developed countries and which is you

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.000
[Guest]: know where I've studied and so when you take public finance in the US a big part

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.760
[Guest]: of your coursework is in fact health economics it almost becomes like a

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.120
[Guest]: subset because that's where the government's money is going this will

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.800
[Guest]: follow the money right you know so if and in fact one of my advisors so

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.880
[Guest]: Michael Kramer was one of them but the other one had three of them but the

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.880
[Guest]: other one was Marty Feldstein who's one of the you know the giants of US public

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.120
[Guest]: finance and also one of the people who kind of almost created the modern field

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.600
[Guest]: of health economics right because I think just like I was saying there used

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.160
[Guest]: to be a tradition where health was left to doctors and education was left to

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.920
[Guest]: educators but policy is fundamentally about allocating scarce resources and so

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.920
[Guest]: you kind of need an economic lens in this right so the public finance aspects

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:59.520
[Guest]: of why healthcare is you know occupies a large share of my mind space is a that

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.640
[Guest]: there are fundamental questions about how much public expenditure should they

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.880
[Guest]: be right I mean what should we be spending this on given that there are

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.320
[Guest]: other competing claims on public resources you know how do you increase

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.000
[Guest]: and optimize the effectiveness of your public expenditure so the unifying thread

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.080
[Guest]: in all of my research is really improving effectiveness of public

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.560
[Guest]: expenditure and like I said last time the sectors I work on our sectors where

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.480
[Guest]: the government spends over 10,000 crores a year right so education health and

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.840
[Guest]: rega PDS now ICDS so essentially improving then the effectiveness of that

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.440
[Guest]: by even 1% is going to give you a huge bang for the buck right so my first kind

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.000
[Guest]: of entry point into health economics is to public finance and I'll come back and

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.880
[Guest]: talk about what we've learned from that approach the second one is development

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.080
[Guest]: economics right so that is my core field I teach both undergrad and PhD classes

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.860
[Guest]: in development economics and you know health is a substantial part of what you

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:51.000
[Guest]: teach and you know going back to Amartya Sen so both health and education have

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.600
[Guest]: this unique place because they are both what we call intrinsically important and

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.520
[Guest]: instrumentally important right so the traditional economist Chicago view of

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.840
[Guest]: health and education is human capital right it's human capital because these

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.680
[Guest]: are investments that make you more productive so a healthy worker is more

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.800
[Guest]: productive a more educated worker is more productive right whereas the

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.280
[Guest]: Sennian inversion so to speak right mean is that health and education are not

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.680
[Guest]: just about making you more productive but these are the intrinsic goals of

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.880
[Guest]: development right I mean that because people care about living healthy lives

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.640
[Guest]: regardless of whether you're productive it is good to be educated and be a more

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.800
[Guest]: sophisticated consumer of the world around you regardless of whether it

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.320
[Guest]: makes you more productive right so in that sense health and education occupy

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.440
[Guest]: like a special place in development because of both this instrumental and

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.800
[Guest]: intrinsic importance so if you go look at say the Human Development Index you

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.600
[Guest]: know with Senn inspired essentially what it's doing is saying the traditional

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.320
[Guest]: measures of development are just GDP per capita but the GDP you can't eat GDP in

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.800
[Guest]: the whole point of GDP is to kind of live a better life and health and

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.880
[Guest]: education are intrinsically so important that the HDI then has a one-third weight

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.000
[Guest]: on health a one-third weight on education and a one-third weight on on

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.520
[Guest]: GDP per capita so health becomes central in development economics that way but

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.720
[Guest]: also in two other very important ways I think when you think about development

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.760
[Guest]: economics what is development economics right I mean how is development

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.680
[Guest]: economics different from just being about reducing poverty right and so the

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.040
[Guest]: conceptual key point about development economics is the idea of poverty traps

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.540
[Guest]: right the idea that people can be in initial conditions that make them so

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.200
[Guest]: vulnerable that they cannot bootstrap their way out of that initial condition

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.640
[Guest]: okay so one of the contrasts I would say between public finance and and

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.280
[Guest]: development is when you do public finance in the US or in any developed

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.000
[Guest]: country the de facto understanding you have is that there is almost always a

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.280
[Guest]: trade-off between equity and efficiency that you want to do some redistribution

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:49.080
[Guest]: because you want to support the poor but that redistribution will almost always

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.160
[Guest]: reduce efficiency in the economy and why is that it's because to redistribute I

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.000
[Guest]: need to raise taxes on the rich and that's going to reduce incentives to

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.940
[Guest]: work I'm going to give out something for free which may reduce incentives to work

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.440
[Guest]: and then the most kind of I think important but underappreciated part is

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.920
[Guest]: that if I'm targeting something to the poor okay then by construction I need to

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.800
[Guest]: phase out that benefit as you get richer right because I'm giving it to the poor

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.840
[Guest]: so at some point as you earn more I have to phase it out correct but that phase

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.200
[Guest]: out often creates a very high marginal tax rate for the poor right so often for

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:26.040
[Guest]: every dollar I earn I might be losing 50 cents in benefits okay so suppose at

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.360
[Guest]: $20,000 or less you're getting free health insurance okay through Medicaid

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.280
[Guest]: and then you earn 30,000 you become ineligible let's say this benefit is

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.720
[Guest]: worth $5,000 okay so effectively when I'm going from 20,000 to 30,000 I have a

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.600
[Guest]: marginal tax rate of 50% because I'm losing a dollar of benefits every 50

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.840
[Guest]: cents of benefits every dollar I'm earning and then in a funny way that can

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.520
[Guest]: actually create a poverty trap by itself because now you've reduced the

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.840
[Guest]: incentives to work out of that you know out of that place of poverty so the

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.760
[Guest]: general thinking in a lot of public finance and public economics is that

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.960
[Guest]: there is this inevitable trade-off but because we care about equity

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.960
[Guest]: intrinsically right I mean as a society you care about some redistribution but

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.600
[Guest]: what is I think very nice in development is that we have a whole class of models

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.720
[Guest]: where you show that when people are close to subsistence poverty that there

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.780
[Guest]: is often no trade-off between equity and efficiency that a well-designed social

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.560
[Guest]: welfare program a well-designed intervention can not only improve

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.360
[Guest]: equity but also improve efficiency that you're making people more productive and

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.000
[Guest]: therefore able to pay back so for example there's a brand new paper which

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.440
[Guest]: I just released this week on the ICDS which is the integrated child

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.280
[Guest]: development services and at one level it's a very simple paper it's a very

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.680
[Guest]: simple paper because we're just looking at what is the impact of adding an extra

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.300
[Guest]: worker okay focused on preschool education and in fact some people said

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:46.000
[Guest]: you really need an RCT to go study this the point is not does it have an impact

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.280
[Guest]: the point is to quantify the impact and show that their public rate of return on

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.880
[Guest]: this is about 12 to 20 times the cost and therefore if you would invest in

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.800
[Guest]: this you will increase productivity enough that your future discounted tax

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.520
[Guest]: revenue increases will more than pay for the program so I think the point is in a

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.720
[Guest]: world of limited resources when everybody wants funding for everything

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.920
[Guest]: the holy grail for a policymaker or policy analyst is saying can I find a

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.160
[Guest]: class of policies that improve both equity and efficiency so that I am both

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.520
[Guest]: supporting redistributive justice but doing this in a way that is not just

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.640
[Guest]: about distributing a fixed pie but doing this in a way that expands the size of

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.220
[Guest]: the pie right there are a class of policies that do that but you need to do

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.360
[Guest]: a lot of heavy kind of lifting in terms of both thinking and empirics to kind of

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.480
[Guest]: design and implement those programs right see but again the point is that's

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.400
[Guest]: why it plays such a big role in development economics thinking about

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.440
[Guest]: health because the idea of a nutrition based poverty trap or health based

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.400
[Guest]: poverty trap are some of the oldest ideas in development economics now there

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.320
[Guest]: is a third strand in development which is very very kind of exciting which is

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.360
[Guest]: when you think about development economics in general you expect poor

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.080
[Guest]: countries to be able to grow faster than rich countries and there's basically two

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:58.040
[Guest]: reasons for that one is you start with a much lower capital stock okay and so the

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.480
[Guest]: returns to marginal returns to capital are higher okay so the the US Treasury

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.160
[Guest]: may be giving you 1% 2% because this is a capital rich society you don't have

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.760
[Guest]: those same high return opportunities whereas the returns to capital investment

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.640
[Guest]: are much much higher so automatically you would expect poor countries to grow

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.440
[Guest]: faster but the other big reason why you would expect poor countries to grow

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:21.720
[Guest]: faster is that it's much easier to adopt an existing technology than to invent

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.600
[Guest]: new technologies at the frontier okay so if you think about just this corona

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.080
[Guest]: crisis right I mean the reason we are even in this place of talking about

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.240
[Guest]: vaccinations is because you've had the entire research infrastructure of the

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.840
[Guest]: developed world right like I mean go after this kind of this virus and crack

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.160
[Guest]: this in about a year right so so in that sense for a development economist in a

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.440
[Guest]: way the advantage of being away from the frontier is that you just have to focus

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.680
[Guest]: on adoption but then the big question is why are there so many kind of free

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.480
[Guest]: lunches left on the sidewalk why do people not adopt existing technologies

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.480
[Guest]: so if you look at health you know you can talk about how do I manage a

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.680
[Guest]: healthcare system but the lowest hanging fruit is why are people not taking the

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.960
[Guest]: vaccinations why are people not taking their ORS these things that are

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.480
[Guest]: incredibly inexpensive incredibly like you know high returns and that's kind of

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.080
[Guest]: free money that you're leaving behind and so that's kind of created a lot of

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.240
[Guest]: kind of you know growing interest in behavioral development economics and

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.360
[Guest]: behavioral economics and particularly I think health seeking behaviors has been

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.000
[Guest]: a very very active area for you know behavioral economics to come in so in

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.520
[Guest]: terms of my own journey in health there's the public finance piece there's

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.360
[Guest]: the development piece and then there's the service delivery piece right which

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.400
[Guest]: is kind of how my first research project in in this area was what I did in 2003

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.400
[Guest]: in this nationwide study of both teacher and doctor absence right means it was a

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.800
[Guest]: study on public service delivery and so I also got into health partly thinking

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.880
[Guest]: about how do you kind of design public delivery systems across both health and

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.240
[Guest]: education now so that's in terms of the pieces of the puzzle which I have direct

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.560
[Guest]: research experience in but then there's many other parts of the puzzle right

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.000
[Guest]: mean where we can talk about again in the interest of just exciting your

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.640
[Guest]: listeners about this as an area of study right of future study we can talk about

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.360
[Guest]: health in kind of the of labor economics of economics of innovation economics of

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.240
[Guest]: regulation market failures market structure you know industrial

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.760
[Guest]: organization there's help everywhere okay so I can take a quick pause here

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.120
[Guest]: and then I'll come but I do want to give you listeners maybe one or two really

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.760
[Guest]: exciting papers in each of these subfields to give you a sense of you

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.200
[Guest]: know just how much fun people are having in kind of research and how much good

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.600
[Amit Varma]: stuff that is to be done so I'll ask you for those papers and by the way the show

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.800
[Amit Varma]: notes will contain enormous amounts of masala so kindly do check out the show

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.160
[Amit Varma]: notes after the show not during it because just concentrate and you know I

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.320
[Amit Varma]: loved your line you can't eat GDP so if some listener of the show would like to

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.760
[Amit Varma]: make t-shirts out of that or whatever you know feel free to do so you know

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.440
[Guest]: maybe you can put Karthik's face on it I think the show is I think the meme from

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.000
[Guest]: last show I mean if there's one thing which maybe I would like a little bit of

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.080
[Guest]: copyright too is this line on consultants having confidence and

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.000
[Guest]: academics having confidence intervals I think enough people like that like you

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.200
[Amit Varma]: know so maybe that's a remarkable line that's a that's a classic t-shirt line

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.480
[Amit Varma]: and now you can't eat GDP is like an incredible line I'll just quickly go

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.960
[Guest]: over a coming back to popular coming back to popular culture right like you

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.960
[Guest]: know in Godfather it's like throw the gun keep the cannoli right like you know

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:18.200
[Amit Varma]: so it's the food wonderful yeah so I'll quickly go over a couple of the concepts

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.160
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned thinking aloud you can tell me if I'm stating it correctly or

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.560
[Amit Varma]: not first of all you know Karthik mentioned the term poverty trap and the

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.720
[Amit Varma]: classic example of a health poverty trap is let's say that you are poor because

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:34.760
[Amit Varma]: you're poor you are malnourished and you are stunted right and because you're

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.160
[Amit Varma]: malnourished and stunted and you're not getting enough nutrition you don't have

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.760
[Amit Varma]: the kind of cognitive development you would otherwise have you don't get have

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.120
[Amit Varma]: the kind of energy you would otherwise have to do stuff and therefore you stay

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.560
[Amit Varma]: poor because you can't work you can't get ahead and it becomes a vicious cycle

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:54.040
[Amit Varma]: you can't get out of now there is tremendous value to society in getting

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.960
[Amit Varma]: you out of this vicious cycle and that is because of you know my mind goes back

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.320
[Amit Varma]: to this term that the economist Julian Simon once used he wrote a book called

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:05.120
[Amit Varma]: the ultimate resource where he spoke to the human being as the ultimate resource

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.280
[Amit Varma]: and this again argues against this you know false Indian notion of our

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.440
[Amit Varma]: population being a problem Simon's point was our population is our

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.720
[Amit Varma]: greatest strength all the things that we ascribe to overpopulation are actually

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.640
[Amit Varma]: issues of bad governance that every individual has a potential to give more

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:26.360
[Amit Varma]: to the world than she takes out but for that you have to cross a minimum level

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.280
[Amit Varma]: of subsistence where you can actually do that you know if you're caught in a

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.360
[Amit Varma]: poverty trap of any kind such as this health based vicious circle where you

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.920
[Amit Varma]: just can't get out of it then you can't reach your true potential and if you

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.760
[Amit Varma]: reach your true potential it helps everybody it's like a positive

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:45.240
[Amit Varma]: externality so in that sense you know the trade-off between redistribution and

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.560
[Amit Varma]: growth doesn't come into the picture because this kind of redistribution

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.960
[Amit Varma]: actually aids in growth because people are reaching their potential and helping

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.160
[Amit Varma]: everybody else also as they do that because it's a positive sum game we all

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.440
[Amit Varma]: sort of grow together now we can get to the papers that you'd like to recommend

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.960
[Guest]: that's exactly right and in fact you know let me take a slight tangent so let

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.840
[Guest]: me pose a quiz to you okay so the definition of the poverty line in India

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:17.000
[Guest]: okay so the definition back in the day used to be do you have the income needed

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.600
[Guest]: to consume a minimum amount of calories okay so that's it it was just the

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.600
[Guest]: minimum caloric content of say 2,000 calories a day okay now so the question

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.680
[Guest]: I have for you this is the puzzle is when you have a poverty rate at

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.560
[Guest]: independence of over 50% or 60% or even now of say 20% that means by

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.280
[Guest]: definition these are people who are earning less than the minimum amount of

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.240
[Guest]: calories needed to survive right so the question is how do people survive if the

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.720
[Guest]: definition is the minimum amount of food needed to survive is then how do you

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:50.800
[Amit Varma]: survive below the poverty line that's a good puzzle I mean one could just argue

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.400
[Amit Varma]: that you're not surviving as a human should that you're you're being forced

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.640
[Amit Varma]: by circumstances to operate on some on a level below what a human can operate at

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.680
[Guest]: and so you're starting to get warm right because you know people will often say

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.400
[Guest]: okay maybe they're getting transfers from others and stuff like that and even

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.280
[Guest]: that doesn't fully work because the NSS measures based on consumption and not

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.640
[Guest]: income okay and it also includes home production so the food you produce but

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.800
[Guest]: the answer is broadly what you allure it to right which is the caloric minimum is

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:23.720
[Guest]: the caloric minimum for a person with a healthy BMI right mean but what the body

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:28.040
[Guest]: does when you don't have that nutritional inputs early on is you just

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.200
[Guest]: don't grow to potential right mean and so by reducing the size of the body you

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.200
[Guest]: reduce kind of the caloric needs needed to maintain it but that comes at

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.600
[Guest]: enormous long-term cost in terms of both the cognitive development as well as you

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.840
[Guest]: know other aspects of higher likelihood of physical morbidity right mean and so

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.800
[Guest]: yeah we'll talk about nutrition if we have time in a way because that's

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.920
[Guest]: slightly different from health care but you know in some ways I would say that's

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.080
[Guest]: almost one of the most important kind of health investments we need to make so

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.120
[Guest]: yeah I think you know just stepping back about health economics as a field more

00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.160
[Guest]: broadly is not just in terms of papers right but just to give your listeners a

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.200
[Guest]: sense of and again building off and some of the things I talked about about you

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.800
[Guest]: know what makes health one of the most vexing areas of kind of economics and

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:15.200
[Guest]: policy is it goes back to the fact that your basic market accountability

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.200
[Guest]: mechanisms often break down right mean and Ken Arrow you know who's one of the

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.000
[Guest]: most brilliant economists of the of the 20th century I think has this famous

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.520
[Guest]: paper basis you know the lesser fair solution for health care is terrible

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.280
[Guest]: okay and that's essentially because you're in a situation of what's called a

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.080
[Guest]: credence code where you don't know what you need and the doctor has to both tell

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.320
[Guest]: you what you need and prescribe so there's all of these asymmetries of

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.480
[Guest]: information there is the fact that comparison shopping doesn't work when

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.120
[Guest]: you've had an accident and like you know you're looking for a hospital you don't

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.840
[Guest]: go there and bargain like you know and saying you know what the price of your

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.000
[Guest]: life-saving treatment should be and so which means your your standard market

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.680
[Guest]: metaphors you know break down okay so and then pricing okay so pricing in any

00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:00.560
[Guest]: market is as we know it can sit anywhere between cost and value right so there's

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.840
[Guest]: this huge wedge but if you are in a moment of very inelastic demand right

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:09.160
[Guest]: mean the ability to charge essentially your last living penny right mean is

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.480
[Guest]: very very high right so there are a whole bunch of reasons for why unbridled

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:17.600
[Guest]: market kind of you know conditions don't work which again makes this a very very

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.960
[Guest]: very active area of thinking about what would be the right kind of policy

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.880
[Guest]: frameworks to allow you to mitigate some of this because there are problems with

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.240
[Guest]: everything that's I think the really hard part about health right so which is

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:32.760
[Guest]: why I wouldn't even pretend to say we have solutions so in fact I'm reminded

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:37.240
[Guest]: of my first PhD lecture I attended in macroeconomics right so this is by Greg

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.080
[Guest]: Mankiw who I think you know who later went on to be CEA to the president and

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.760
[Guest]: he started his lecture by saying you know macro is a difficult subject he

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.240
[Guest]: say you are confused and I am confused okay the only difference is you are

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:54.360
[Guest]: naively confused and I'm profoundly confused so so so my goal perhaps at the

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.680
[Guest]: end of just the discussion and health is to make people profoundly confused okay

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.240
[Guest]: so that you're at least asking the right questions but coming back to you know

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.880
[Guest]: other areas of what makes health economics both so interesting and so

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.120
[Guest]: vexing is let's think about the economics of innovation all right like

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.280
[Guest]: you know so and you're seeing this battle play out right now which is how

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.800
[Guest]: much what kind of patenting regime should you have right to both servers

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.440
[Guest]: and incentive for the people who are innovating but then conditional or

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:24.640
[Guest]: having the innovation it is massive deadweight loss to then charge these

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.640
[Guest]: high prices because the marginal cost is obviously very very low right means so

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.840
[Guest]: how do you kind of both set up structures to get the innovation and

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.320
[Guest]: conditional on the innovation make that access you know to everybody right and I

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:39.680
[Guest]: can give you an example of specific solutions right mean that that are

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.720
[Guest]: worth thinking about then you can think about the economics of regulation so I

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.480
[Guest]: have a student today like you know we'll be presenting in our lunch workshop in

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.600
[Guest]: about four hours on asking about is the FDA too conservative in its regulatory

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.200
[Guest]: protocols because there's this trade-off of type 1 and type 2 error right mean

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.600
[Guest]: and so because bureaucrats tend to be risk averse that one adverse event is

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:05.360
[Guest]: much more costly than the potential cost of not allowing a positive drug to enter

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.840
[Guest]: the market because people don't see that so you know he's got some very nice

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.520
[Guest]: evidence now in the context of a certain class of therapeutics to then show that

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.640
[Guest]: it looks like they may be getting too conservative and then he's got another

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:20.320
[Guest]: paper looking at you know regulation versus litigation as a way of enforcing

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.600
[Guest]: good behavior so again you know these are just huge areas of research in fact

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.200
[Guest]: coming to economics of innovation there's a very nice paper and this is

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:34.240
[Guest]: these are tangents but I think it's it's fun to think about so one of the big

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.800
[Guest]: misallocation of public expenditure in my view okay say in the US is that how

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:43.600
[Guest]: much more money we spend on end-of-life care in the last year of life okay

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.240
[Guest]: compared to how little we spend on say early childhood care right when you have

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.680
[Guest]: an entire life of 80 years to get the returns to that investment okay now for

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:56.320
[Guest]: the longest time I used to think that there's a very simple political economy

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:00.000
[Guest]: explanation for this right which is that children don't vote okay whereas your

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.780
[Guest]: retirees are incredibly like a reliable voting block and so the American

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.920
[Guest]: Association of Retired Persons is an incredibly powerful political lobby and

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.200
[Guest]: so you know by construction you've created political incentives right mean

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.680
[Guest]: to spend much more in the ending phase of life like you know than than for

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.080
[Guest]: young children though as a society you would benefit much much more from those

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.280
[Guest]: early life investments okay but it turns out that there's this very very nice

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:28.200
[Guest]: paper that is asking this question about why do we have so much more medical

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:34.560
[Guest]: innovation in end-of-life care okay than medical innovations that say at the life

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.080
[Guest]: of 20 or 30 that if you got this new medication or new drug would

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.960
[Guest]: dramatically improve your life for 60 years okay but we still get much more

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:47.120
[Guest]: innovation on end-of-life drugs so why do you think this might be happening

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:52.640
[Amit Varma]: because the the end-of-life people would be a more powerful lobby okay so that

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:56.840
[Guest]: was my initial initial hypothesis and that is certainly part of the story but

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.000
[Guest]: it turns out that there's a much more basic scientific explanation that has

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.160
[Guest]: nothing to do with the incentives in terms of the political incentives of

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:08.760
[Amit Varma]: lobbying so so let's think more well there is also the seen in the unseen in

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:14.480
[Amit Varma]: the sense that if you create say drugs at 20 which make me you know live 10

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.240
[Amit Varma]: years more at the end of my life the effects are unseen whereas if you create

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.320
[Amit Varma]: something which will make someone who's 79 go to 80 the effects are more seen

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.600
[Guest]: so yeah so you're starting to get very very warm okay and so again this I'm

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.920
[Guest]: very impressed because I didn't give you any hint that I was going to talk about

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:33.360
[Guest]: this or this paper okay but but yes so the basic point is this right that if

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:37.520
[Guest]: you look at any clinical trial clinical trials have to designate what they call

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.920
[Guest]: an endpoint and saying what is the outcome we are looking at right so for

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.000
[Guest]: some of so one of the reasons these different vaccine trials are not

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.200
[Guest]: strictly comparable is that the designated endpoint was different right

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.400
[Guest]: so for some of them that the outcome they were looking at was symptomatic

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.720
[Guest]: cases others they were looking at hospitalizations but if you think about a

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:58.000
[Guest]: pharmaceutical company that's coming up with a new drug right the holy grail of

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.240
[Guest]: efficacy of your drug is if you can show impact on mortality okay if you can show

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.480
[Guest]: that this had an impact on reducing increasing life expectancy by even three

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.440
[Guest]: months you're golden because the value of a statistical life is kind of several

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.440
[Guest]: hundreds of thousands of dollars and if you show that I extend this by three

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:17.440
[Guest]: years three months then you have the ability to price accordingly okay but

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.480
[Guest]: here's the point if I have an intervention at age 20 that's going to

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.920
[Guest]: increase your life expectancy I have to wait 60 years like you know for the

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:29.480
[Guest]: study to be completed because essentially people you know you're not

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:34.200
[Guest]: dying at the same rate okay but like if you have a universe of 85 year olds in

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.160
[Guest]: your study you will reach your endpoint in your study within five years so

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.040
[Guest]: ironically one of the reasons the vaccine trials got done much faster with

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.640
[Guest]: Pfizer Moderna was because the case rates were exploding so which meant that

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.960
[Guest]: the endpoint was being reached faster in the control group relative to the

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:52.280
[Guest]: treatment so it's an example of how subtle and this is a lovely paper by

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.960
[Guest]: Eric Budish at Chicago and Heidi Williams who used to be at MIT and is

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.520
[Guest]: now at Stanford so you know and it's kind of discusses these time horizon

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:02.280
[Guest]: aspects of what determines incentives for innovation but the reason I'm

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.880
[Guest]: mentioning this is that as you've said in previous podcasts one of the great

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:09.680
[Guest]: miracles despite the pains of this pandemic has been how science has kind

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:14.280
[Guest]: of stepped up to the field but the point is what are the institutional incentive

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:18.160
[Guest]: structures for science right mean what determines research what determines what

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.520
[Guest]: gets research what determines what gets funded so all of those are also

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.880
[Guest]: questions where economists can come in like I mean and think about the

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:28.160
[Guest]: incentives because essentially economists the two core concepts I would

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.400
[Guest]: say there's three core concepts right one is scarce resources like I mean and

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.840
[Guest]: how do you kind of optimize and maximize value for money second is incentives

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:38.320
[Guest]: incentives incentives right anytime you something doesn't make sense you unpeel

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:42.120
[Guest]: the onion and seeing okay why are these incentives of the individual agents not

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:46.560
[Guest]: aligned with the macro good and then the third is you know empirics and data and

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:50.880
[Guest]: causal analysis and causal inference which is in the problem particularly in

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.440
[Guest]: things like health is theoretically I can argue any issue both left and right

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.440
[Guest]: okay so and which is why I think the empirical turn of economics in the past

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.160
[Guest]: 20 years or 30 years has been such a good thing because we're now able to

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.200
[Guest]: take a lot more of this abstract theorizing and come down to brass tacks

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.960
[Guest]: and saying okay now let's look at the actual data and seeing which side do

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.520
[Guest]: these trade-offs go off okay so and that's kind of why economics in any

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.480
[Guest]: policy area right I mean in fact Marty Feldstein you know in my last few years

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.440
[Guest]: before he retired like was trying to create a whole new field of the

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.480
[Guest]: economics of national security okay so an even bigger black box of public

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:29.280
[Guest]: funding is what we spend on defense okay so one very very very simple metric of

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:33.320
[Guest]: how little accountability there is or efficiency there is in defense spending

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:37.600
[Guest]: is if you look at the budget share of the Army Navy and Air Force in the US

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.400
[Guest]: okay this is basically for the most part been unchanged since World War two okay

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:46.360
[Guest]: and it is impossible to believe that the marginal product of your offensive

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.400
[Guest]: capacity has stayed the same across these kind of land air in me but no the

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.240
[Guest]: budgets will go lockstep because it has to be proportional to keep the

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:58.560
[Guest]: balance between the powers and the forces right so in education and health

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.080
[Guest]: we've economists have started you know doing a lot more in terms of analyzing

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.560
[Guest]: and understanding the outcomes for something like defense is obviously much

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.160
[Guest]: much harder but I would conjecture that there is such an incredible amount of

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.800
[Guest]: waste and inefficiency like I mean in how we spend inside the black box of

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.960
[Guest]: kind of defense ministries and that it is ripe for kind of you know more value

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.480
[Guest]: for money type analysis but this is just a way of saying why economics is and

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.120
[Guest]: should be everywhere now of course you know sometimes the field gets a little

00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.520
[Guest]: bit of a bad rep because it is it can be imperialistic it can be a little

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.640
[Guest]: hubristic but I think these three core principles of economics applied to

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.960
[Guest]: almost any area of policy which is resources are scarce and so there's

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.120
[Guest]: opportunity costs and how do you maximize value for money second is

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.840
[Guest]: incentives matter and third you know let's look at the data look at the

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.360
[Guest]: empirics look at causal inference and then try to you know optimize given all

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:52.760
[Amit Varma]: of these constraints we have fantastic and this is also why economics is so

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.280
[Amit Varma]: fascinating that it's a lens through which you can look at all of life and

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.480
[Amit Varma]: every little bit of the world and it's incredible now you've said so many

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.000
[Amit Varma]: things and I have so many asides to make which I have been noting down that I

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.800
[Amit Varma]: will quickly go through the asides and now we will go back to that prehistoric

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:11.280
[Amit Varma]: time almost 20 minutes ago when you were talking about nutrition and my aside

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:15.720
[Amit Varma]: there about how the body adapts to the nutrition is getting is that I remember

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:19.760
[Amit Varma]: I made an observation in the 1990s which when I first made it I thought wait a

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.600
[Amit Varma]: minute it's just today it can't be right and then I saw it again and then I was

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.160
[Amit Varma]: like oh shit and and the observation was when I came to Bombay in the 90s mid

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:31.440
[Amit Varma]: 90s I used to commute by local train and in local trains I noticed that the

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.880
[Amit Varma]: people in first class were taller than the people in second class always

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.220
[Amit Varma]: without exception the first day I noticed that like whatever and then you

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.920
[Amit Varma]: notice it again and then you notice it again and and the difference at that

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:47.080
[Amit Varma]: time was actually stark and it's almost like the visibility of luck you know

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:50.800
[Amit Varma]: because it's basically your luck yeah wherever people have ended up and and

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.360
[Amit Varma]: it's it's almost as if it's it's visible you can see it you don't need to

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.480
[Amit Varma]: theorize about it the other aspect which you pointed out and you know you you

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.880
[Amit Varma]: cited arrow saying you know laser fair doesn't work in healthcare for all those

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.120
[Amit Varma]: excellent reasons you gave a symmetry of information and all of that and at the

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.580
[Amit Varma]: same time you know it is such a vexed subject that in one of your papers you

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.080
[Amit Varma]: actually demonstrate why it doesn't apply to India so we're going to talk

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.760
[Amit Varma]: more about that as we go along then you spoke about your student who's giving a

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.480
[Amit Varma]: presentation on the FDA and I'm quickly going to make a book recommendation for

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.940
[Amit Varma]: my readers which is a book called fortress and frontier in American

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:30.920
[Amit Varma]: healthcare by a dude called Robert Grebois who in fact won the Basia prize

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.080
[Amit Varma]: in 2014 the year before I got it for the second time an excellent book which kind

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.360
[Amit Varma]: of conceptually you know if you read the book and the concepts of the fortress in

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.320
[Amit Varma]: the frontier is one way to think about it were sort of quite eye-opening for me

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.460
[Amit Varma]: and I would agree with whatever your student is about to say in his

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.520
[Amit Varma]: presentation in the sense that I think the FDA is way too conservative and the

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.400
[Amit Varma]: lives that could have been saved had they not been conservative or what is

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.760
[Amit Varma]: the unseen but that is a subject for another episode and and and then you

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.080
[Amit Varma]: spoke about you know the whole patent and intellectual property debate and we

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.400
[Amit Varma]: won't get into that but what I will put in the show notes and recommend at my

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: readers checkout is Alex Tabarrok who's a frequent guest on the show wrote a

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.920
[Amit Varma]: post recently about why patents are not a constraint in this current situation

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.880
[Amit Varma]: and I absolutely agree they are not a constraint it's just in Alex's words you

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.640
[Amit Varma]: know virtue signaling for a certain sort of people they don't solve a problem but

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.480
[Amit Varma]: at the same time what I'd like to also point my readers to is something called

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: the Tabarrok curve which is about eight years ago Alex showed this beautiful

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.080
[Amit Varma]: curve which demonstrated his point of that even though patents are necessary

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.600
[Amit Varma]: if you make them too strong too stringent they actually affect innovation

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and innovation goes down and Alex's point is that they are too stringent and

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.800
[Amit Varma]: they are a problem and he demonstrates this with a beautiful graph and and this

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.920
[Amit Varma]: is where I love the elegance of economics and math and all of that so

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.440
[Amit Varma]: I'll put up all of those links let's go back now and talk about at the level of

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.840
[Amit Varma]: concept I'm gonna ask you to get a little meta here and and and here I'm

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.640
[Amit Varma]: sure at some level it mirrors your intellectual journey of understanding

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.880
[Amit Varma]: healthcare as well and my broad question is this that how should we think of

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.240
[Amit Varma]: healthcare like in the sense if you imagine India when it becomes

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.280
[Amit Varma]: independent and in you know in one of the papers you gave there was a

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.520
[Amit Varma]: startling figure that our life expectancy in 1961 was something like

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.960
[Amit Varma]: 41 years old you know which means we'd both be dead by now so we've clearly

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.920
[Amit Varma]: come a long way now in that poverty-stricken state that we were in

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:35.920
[Amit Varma]: then at that design stage you know how should we think about healthcare how did

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.800
[Amit Varma]: we think about healthcare you know what did we get wrong and who got it right

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.280
[Amit Varma]: what is a model to follow because everybody's poor there's no market as

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.280
[Amit Varma]: such and yet so it's in a sense it's the state's responsibility everybody

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.440
[Amit Varma]: benefits how should one think about healthcare and in your own journey what

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.320
[Amit Varma]: were the priors you started with that this is how healthcare should be

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.320
[Amit Varma]: organized and how did those priors changed over time as you got deeper and

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.400
[Guest]: deeper into the field the good news is you know like Sherlock Holmes famously

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.680
[Guest]: said right it's a capital mistake to theorize without data right you know so

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.720
[Guest]: I don't even think I came in with very strong priors right mean I started my

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.560
[Guest]: journey in this field just by wanting to figure out what's going on right means

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.480
[Guest]: are going back to that dirty shoes kind of analogy right just like I was doing

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.400
[Guest]: the work in hell in education I was also visiting PhC's around the country like

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.840
[Guest]: you know as part of that original fieldwork we did for that absence study

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.920
[Guest]: and just kind of seeing the state of the land so I've had less priors in this so

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.840
[Guest]: there's two separate questions okay one is let me talk a little bit about my

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.000
[Guest]: journey in healthcare research in India and the things that I know from my own

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.560
[Guest]: work as well as you know people like Jishnu in particular and Jeff Hammer

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.440
[Guest]: have done a lot more work in fact in this area so I'll draw a fair bit on

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.960
[Guest]: their work and of course a lot of others too but these are kind of you know the

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.160
[Guest]: economists who I feel are thinking about these systemic incentives design

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:59.280
[Guest]: challenges in the right way so taking a step back to the origins of the Indian

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.800
[Guest]: healthcare system so there was this committee called the Bhoray committee

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.280
[Guest]: okay so the Bhoray committee was set up in 1943 and this was a Maharashtrian

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.680
[Guest]: gentleman who was in the ICS and you know I think had held multiple senior

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.560
[Guest]: positions and the Bhoray committee took about two years to submit its report on

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.440
[Guest]: the structure of healthcare 1946 is when they submitted the report and you know a

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.520
[Guest]: lot of this follows what would one I would call is a broad WHO template for

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.240
[Guest]: the building of health systems in developing countries and the general

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.360
[Guest]: sense is that the market doesn't work for a variety of reasons and you know

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.280
[Guest]: market doesn't work not just in terms of the asymmetric information but also

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.480
[Guest]: simply in terms of locating providers in remote areas or rural areas right mean

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.160
[Guest]: that you just people don't want to be in those places and so unless the

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.560
[Guest]: government comes actively and builds out a network of clinics and staffs them

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.080
[Guest]: with public doctors and nurses there is no way you're going to get health care

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.720
[Guest]: into you know remote areas okay and this kind of structure follows a very well

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:00.240
[Guest]: established template of saying that you will have you know a sub center so

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.680
[Guest]: there's the district hospitals community health centers primary health centers

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.480
[Guest]: sub centers okay so you're supposed to have a sub center for about 5,000

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.600
[Guest]: population a primary health center for about 25,000 so sub centers supposed to

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.560
[Guest]: be staffed with a nurse you know one and one male multi-purpose worker and they

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.640
[Guest]: are supposed to be like the first line of primary care in in a village the

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.080
[Guest]: primary health center serves about 20 to 30,000 and is supposed to have at

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.800
[Guest]: least one fully qualified doctor I mean one MBBS doctor and you know has

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.280
[Guest]: oversight over these sub centers and then you're supposed to have the

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.320
[Guest]: community health center that caters to about 100 to 120,000 with a larger number

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.960
[Guest]: of beds you know more specialty doctors and then you've got the district

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:43.760
[Guest]: hospital that's supposed to be like your primary point of care in the district

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.480
[Guest]: okay so so on paper this is a perfectly sensible structure right I don't think

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.840
[Guest]: it was different from kind of the structures envisaged for many countries

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.440
[Guest]: right but the larger problem over time has been one that and I don't think this

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.960
[Guest]: is unique to health right I think the fundamental problem for India and this

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.120
[Guest]: is again something I discuss in the book in some detail because again historical

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.640
[Guest]: political economy is a massive field in fact there's a new handbook coming out

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.120
[Guest]: of like 52 chapters okay so I'm trying to synthesize that entire literature in

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.120
[Guest]: like half a chapter one section of one chapter right but but I think if you one

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.880
[Guest]: important piece of perspective to have is that when you say that people are

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.840
[Guest]: poor therefore the government has to do it that's not obvious because when the

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.920
[Guest]: people are poor the government is also poor okay so because the government is

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.760
[Guest]: nothing but the sum of the people right I mean and what is your tax base okay so

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.880
[Guest]: when people are poor in fact the government has less ability so coming

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.160
[Guest]: back to state capacity and that's because the tax to GDP ratio usually

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:46.720
[Guest]: increases as you get richer okay and that's because you it's a as people are

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.040
[Guest]: super poor like you can't even morally tax them okay like I mean because you

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.120
[Guest]: need the basics you have just to survive and institutionally it's much much

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.800
[Guest]: harder to tax informal workers and so you know the formalization of the

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:03.240
[Guest]: workforce is then very strongly correlated with the rising of a tax GDP

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.600
[Guest]: ratio okay so so I think the first slight nuance in what he said is when

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.640
[Guest]: the people are poor doesn't automatically mean the government can do

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.120
[Guest]: something because the government is also poor and in fact relatively the

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.280
[Guest]: government is more poor when the people are poor you see because the tax to GDP

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:25.120
[Guest]: ratio is lower in a poorer country okay so that's I think a first very important

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.640
[Guest]: point like you know for listeners to understand because you know it is just

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:34.480
[Guest]: so natural you go out to rural India you just see kind of how you know abysmal

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.160
[Guest]: the conditions of say health facilities are and it's just very very normal and

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.960
[Guest]: natural to come back and say oh the government should do this okay and and I

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.120
[Guest]: think the single most important problem what we don't if you want to make sense

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:50.280
[Guest]: of why the Indian state seems to flounder at everything the simple answer

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.080
[Guest]: is we're trying to do too much okay and and the and if you go look at the long

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.280
[Guest]: arc of the state over a 500 year period right I mean so I characterize the

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.040
[Guest]: evolution of the state into what three broad phases okay there is what I call

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.240
[Guest]: the security state right which is the primary goal of initial states was

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.000
[Guest]: national security right mean save your borders and do law and order and because

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.720
[Guest]: the biggest existential threat was you were going to be run over and enslaved

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.640
[Guest]: and slaughtered okay so and one simple way of seeing this is that in ancient

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.960
[Guest]: states even medieval Europe you were spending somewhere from 70 to 80 percent

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.280
[Guest]: of the public budget on defense 70 to 80 percent okay like you know of money was

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.240
[Guest]: essentially going on defense right so then it's in the 18th and 19th century

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.320
[Guest]: that you kind of get the second phase of the state of what I call the industrial

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.840
[Guest]: state of the developmental state where for the first time now the state

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:45.440
[Guest]: realizes that hey let me take tax revenue and build public goods and build

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.000
[Guest]: public infrastructure whether it's roads or railways or ports or public sewage

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.400
[Guest]: systems and that these are things that will dramatically increase productivity

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.600
[Guest]: and so the return on investment in these public investments is way way way higher

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.120
[Guest]: okay than simply going and fighting wars I still need a military so that I'm not

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.400
[Guest]: taken over but my ROI in terms of growing my productive capacity is now

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.640
[Guest]: going to be higher than going and taking over somebody else okay and and and it's

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.520
[Guest]: not like the older states didn't build roads right but the Industrial Revolution

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.320
[Guest]: dramatically increases the complementarity with the physical

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.600
[Guest]: infrastructure because now you have at scale production and so then the

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.120
[Guest]: investments in the logistics and the transport and the storage and all of

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.000
[Guest]: that starts paying off like you know once the scale of production starts

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.480
[Guest]: going up okay so and it is that period of the industrial state and massive

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.400
[Guest]: investments and public goods that is associated then with the escape from the

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.720
[Guest]: Malthusian trap right where for the first time you start seeing this massive

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.000
[Guest]: increase in GDP per capita because till then the 3,000 year history of humanity

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.440
[Guest]: is essentially GDP per capita stayed mostly flat right so because the

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.160
[Guest]: productivity went up but population also went up so coming back to your old point

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.080
[Guest]: about our human beings are you brains or are you stomachs right I mean I think is

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.320
[Guest]: how you had you know classified it at the Malthusian view is that humans are

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.000
[Guest]: stomachs and therefore like you know there is this trap and you need to

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.920
[Guest]: reduce population whereas the Romer view which is what he won his Nobel Prize for

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.440
[Guest]: and it's also in Kramer's famous 93 Oring paper right and can mean is that

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.440
[Guest]: people are brains and if the innovation is a function of the right tail of your

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.280
[Guest]: distribution then having more people automatically means you'll be more

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.240
[Guest]: innovative but that requires a certain minimum kind of capacity of the brain

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.760
[Guest]: and so it is related because the demographic transition where you move

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.920
[Guest]: from high fertility high mortality to low fertility low mortality is very very

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.800
[Guest]: important in giving parents the resources to invest in the human capital

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.120
[Guest]: of the children right so in that sense it's a bit more subtle right that you

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.080
[Guest]: can't just say I will expand the population and get the innovation if

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.000
[Guest]: that expansion is coming at the cost of being able to invest in the human

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
[Guest]: capital right so but anyway but coming back to the state itself so you get this

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.120
[Guest]: massive increase in GDP per capita both because you're increasing the numerator

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.320
[Guest]: from the Industrial Revolution and because reducing the denominator like

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.720
[Guest]: you know through the demographic transition and investing in the human

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.440
[Guest]: capital right I mean and so that's why that all those three pieces go together

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.760
[Guest]: right in terms of because GDP per capita is about making people more productive

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.200
[Guest]: and people get more productive and they have more human capital right so that is

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.720
[Guest]: this big transition that happens in kind of the 19th century mainly in the

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.120
[Guest]: Western states right I mean but I think the important point we need to

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.840
[Guest]: understand is that the modern welfare state right I mean has only been in

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.680
[Guest]: existence for less than 100 years okay so if you look at the data on kind of

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.520
[Guest]: the fraction of GDP that is spent on welfare programs okay so whether it's

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:32.760
[Guest]: food assistance, healthcare, unemployment insurance, old age insurance all of these

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.480
[Guest]: major welfare programs have only showed up in the world in the last 70-80 years

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.880
[Guest]: right after the Great Depression and particularly after World War 2 okay so

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.960
[Guest]: which means that again I think informally Arvind Subramanian and I have

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.400
[Guest]: talked about this others have talked about this but we are just putting a lot

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.400
[Guest]: of data in the book and documenting this in a comparative way and then showing

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:54.480
[Guest]: that listen a bulk of this explosion the welfare state that we kind of now expect

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.440
[Guest]: that a state should do really happens only after today's Western countries

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.800
[Guest]: reach a middle-income status right I mean so a simple example of say food

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.840
[Guest]: security is that the US launches food stamps at a GDP per capita of $8,000

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.640
[Guest]: PPP okay like you know which is when you're trying to do food security India

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:17.080
[Guest]: does PDS at a GDP per capita of $800 okay at one-tenth of that GDP per capita so

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.280
[Guest]: now and so at one level this is a great moral triumph okay so and then the but

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.560
[Guest]: the other important point to realize is that these three phases of the state are

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.520
[Guest]: also very strongly correlated with the amount of democracy you have okay so the

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:34.840
[Guest]: security state is essentially associated even today with non-democratic regimes

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.840
[Guest]: right you know you go to Pyongyang like I mean that's your modern security state

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.560
[Guest]: or you you know you go to so in that sense that serves the interests of just

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.840
[Guest]: the pure ruling class now what is subtle and underappreciated about this phase of

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.960
[Guest]: the industrial state okay is that it is not just that you know people decided to

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.600
[Guest]: do this it reflected a political arrangement of expanded but not

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:03.500
[Guest]: universal franchise right being so the extent of the vote in that period is you

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.000
[Guest]: know you're still restricting the vote to the property delete to the educated

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.640
[Guest]: elite right mean so yes it's more than kings and nobles so maybe 20-25% have

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.800
[Guest]: the vote but no women no minorities right and so what that means is that so

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.200
[Guest]: over time infrastructure investments are going to benefit everyone right it

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.560
[Guest]: benefits the poor through integrating markets and reducing prices okay but in

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.680
[Guest]: the short term the returns to those infrastructure investments are mainly

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.280
[Guest]: going to be capitalized by the property owners in the first place right I mean

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.360
[Guest]: because the property price so which means that that is the class that then

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.880
[Guest]: has an incentive to invest in those public goods okay and it is not a

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.000
[Guest]: coincidence that the welfare state is strongly correlated with expansion of

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.200
[Guest]: the franchise right so when you start getting to universal adult democracy you

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.560
[Guest]: automatically then create the political pressures for welfare okay now this is a

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.800
[Guest]: wonderful thing okay so we have study after study after study that just show

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.360
[Guest]: listen because in a way it's easy to look at this industrial state and saying

01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.000
[Guest]: like I see they managed to do all of this because of limited democracy but

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.080
[Guest]: that's coming at a huge moral cost right it's coming at the moral cost of being

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.440
[Guest]: built in the backs of either slavery domestically the US or a colonial empire

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.760
[Guest]: in the case of the British right mean so and which is why the democracy before

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.480
[Guest]: development which is what makes India so uniquely different is a great moral

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.840
[Guest]: triumph okay and at no point of this discourse should it be suggested that

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.520
[Guest]: that was in any way responsible for weaknesses but like I said the moral

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:29.160
[Guest]: triumph of democracy then increases our aspirations of the claims we make on the

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.720
[Guest]: state but we are trying to satisfy those claims at a GDP per capita that's 10

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.240
[Guest]: times or 20 times lower than what today's West had when they try to do

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.160
[Guest]: their welfare states right so essentially this is a long-winded way of

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.880
[Guest]: coming back to your starting point of saying that how should we think about

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.560
[Guest]: healthcare in a world like you know when people are poor it is that much as you

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.000
[Guest]: may want to do healthcare right like you know you often simply don't have the

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.840
[Guest]: money right I mean because you're starting at such a low base and so what

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.840
[Guest]: it does is it raises enormously the premium on cost-effectiveness so it's

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.840
[Guest]: not that the state should not be doing things the state needs to do things

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.600
[Guest]: right but the premium on cost-effectiveness and hard-headed

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.040
[Guest]: attention to evidence is even higher when you're trying to do this right mean

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.280
[Guest]: of such a low base okay so that is more as a matter of kind of framing the

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.140
[Guest]: context but I haven't really started answering your question in terms of how

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.200
[Guest]: should you design health care in that setting but like I said like you know

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.440
[Guest]: it's just good to frame that historical context before we start getting into

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.360
[Guest]: what we should do and that's relevant even today right because yes our tax to

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.120
[Guest]: GDP ratio is now at about 18% but that's still half of what the OECD is so you

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.720
[Guest]: know every sector specific activist education Wallace won 6% of GDP health

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.480
[Guest]: Wallace won 3% of GDP everybody says like you know like we just need more

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.480
[Guest]: money but boss you're not allowed to ask me for more money till you tell me what

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.880
[Guest]: you're cutting okay like you know so which is why a big part of the book is

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.600
[Guest]: to say that given how much inefficiency we have in public spending today rather

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.100
[Guest]: than spending arguing about increasing the size of the budget and fighting

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.320
[Guest]: battles with other ministries if every minister and secretary would turn their

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.480
[Guest]: attention inwards to say how do I improve the effectiveness of my existing

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.240
[Guest]: budget we will be way way better off as a country right like I mean than

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:08.200
[Guest]: fighting the political fights of who gets to control bigger budgets so before

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:13.280
[Amit Varma]: you get to answering my question and I loved your side a long aside a couple of

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.100
[Amit Varma]: asides taking off from the aside which is that you know first of all for

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.800
[Amit Varma]: someone who is so much into empirics and data it is obviously the Sennian

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.000
[Amit Varma]: influence that you mentioned the word moral triumph and morally wrong and you

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.040
[Amit Varma]: know you're using these phrases while sort of chatting about all the things

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.280
[Amit Varma]: you chatted about so I'll go to a couple of them first of all you spoke about how

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:36.460
[Amit Varma]: democracy is a moral triumph and I agree but except that I'm not sure the

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:40.680
[Amit Varma]: democracy in India is actually a democracy in his fullest sense like one

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.880
[Amit Varma]: of the things that we really did was that we took over the colonial state

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.080
[Amit Varma]: apparatus you know this the oppressive state remains the oppressive state you

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.620
[Amit Varma]: know the tax on salt is more than what the British were charging when Gandhi

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:58.200
[Amit Varma]: went on the Dandi salt March so where is like the modern-day Gandhi and that

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:03.400
[Amit Varma]: leads me to your other use of you know the word moral when you said that it is

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.440
[Amit Varma]: morally wrong to tax the poorest which of course it is but of course we do tax

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.320
[Amit Varma]: them in terms of indirect taxes you know even the beggar at the traffic signal

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.400
[Amit Varma]: will buy salt somewhere will buy soap will buy all of those things those are

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.000
[Amit Varma]: taxed you look at the price of petrol today where it has gone you know

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.960
[Amit Varma]: completely sort of bizarre it's equal to theft and there I disagree I think the

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.400
[Guest]: petrol tax actually good but I'll come back in a moment and talk about why like

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.800
[Guest]: you know but it with a few caveats and how it is used but all else being equal

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.240
[Guest]: given that you need a certain amount of revenue I still think that's a good tax

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.480
[Guest]: but I'll come back to that in a moment yeah we'll come back to that I mean I

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:42.600
[Amit Varma]: think because a rising price of petrol affects everything else and therefore I

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.360
[Amit Varma]: think that is slightly problematic and also what we saw with you know the Modi

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:51.160
[Amit Varma]: government in 2014 is that global oil oil prices crashed but our oil prices

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.880
[Amit Varma]: didn't they weren't passed on to the consumer they were you know kept by the

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.600
[Amit Varma]: predatory state and apart from that obviously I couldn't agree with you

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.560
[Amit Varma]: more I've said it repeatedly so often that it's almost become a cliche of mind

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.840
[Amit Varma]: that we have a state that you know doesn't do the things it should do like

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.720
[Amit Varma]: rule of law and like you know what we'll be discussing today but it does a lot of

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:17.560
[Amit Varma]: things that it should not do and and those are not just you know wastages

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.880
[Amit Varma]: like all the areas of rent-seeking and building statues and grand buildings for

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.440
[Amit Varma]: our rulers and all of that but also in in the many different ways that it comes

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:31.160
[Amit Varma]: in the way of society solving its own problems like you know one reason as I

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.760
[Amit Varma]: think Ajay and I discussed or Gautam and I discussed I forget who I discussed it

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.820
[Amit Varma]: with but I think everyone would agree that one reason this second wave came so

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:42.480
[Amit Varma]: hard is that we didn't have good enough data about how bad the first wave really

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.760
[Amit Varma]: was and one of the reasons we didn't have good enough data is a government

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.560
[Amit Varma]: monopolized testing in the early part of when COVID-19 struck and said only we

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.520
[Amit Varma]: will test and it got in the way of private sector solving his problems and

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.240
[Amit Varma]: of course as Ajay and I discussed in our you know vaccines episode you know the

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:00.840
[Amit Varma]: government has to do what it has to do go on a war footing and try to vaccinate

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.400
[Amit Varma]: people but also allow private people to get Pfizer, Moderna, J&J whatever from

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.240
[Amit Varma]: outside but not only does it not do the few things it should do properly it gets

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:15.320
[Amit Varma]: in the way of our solving our own problems but having done with my aside I

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:20.120
[Amit Varma]: will let you talk about the petrol aspect of it and and then we can then

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.720
[Amit Varma]: you can get to answering the question which in case you've forgotten I'll

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.920
[Amit Varma]: remind you is how should we think at a meta level of our healthcare system like

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.320
[Amit Varma]: what kind of what were the design mistakes we made and is there someone

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.360
[Guest]: who got it right in an equivalent condition. Yeah so let me save the petrol

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.960
[Guest]: tax question when I come back and talk about pollution okay like you know haha

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.360
[Guest]: and and why I think it's a good tax but the so but coming back to systems of

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.880
[Guest]: healthcare I think that I would say the cardinal mistake right I mean and this

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.880
[Guest]: is not just India the cardinal mistake is prioritizing curative over preventive

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.480
[Guest]: public health okay so if you were in a world of scarce resources if you have to

01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:01.640
[Guest]: say I need highest ROI on my limited spending where am I going to spend that

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:08.720
[Guest]: money it is it is really is in water right air quality so water quality air

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.320
[Guest]: quality are you know just these are the ways through which most diseases kind of

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.480
[Guest]: pass right mean so and things like surveillance right mean and prevention

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.200
[Guest]: now there are some things we've done well vaccination is something we've done

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.600
[Guest]: well and I'll come back and talk about the micro incentives and why it works

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:27.920
[Guest]: well right but this problem of prioritizing curative versus preventive

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.320
[Guest]: is not unique to India right I mean it is the nature of politics it's the

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.560
[Guest]: nature of the fact that people it just responds to the fact that people

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.040
[Guest]: viscerally you know think about health only when you don't have it right means

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.200
[Guest]: so when you're healthy you don't think about it you don't do your exercise in

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.440
[Guest]: my case I don't sleep enough you know so we all have our own kind of ways in

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.480
[Guest]: which we under invest in our health in a preventive way right but the moment

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:53.160
[Guest]: something goes wrong is when it becomes salient okay so that I think is

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:58.760
[Guest]: unfortunately it is I would say a government reflecting what people's

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:04.080
[Guest]: revealed preference is now ideally this is where leadership matters right

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:08.200
[Guest]: because a good politician gives his voters what they want a good leader like

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.640
[Guest]: I mean takes his or her voters to where we should go right I mean in the public

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.960
[Guest]: interest and so and this is why public health and health policy in particular

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.840
[Guest]: requires serious scientific expertise and serious economic expertise in terms

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.480
[Guest]: of cost-effectiveness and making the public case and saying this is what we

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:28.080
[Guest]: need to be doing okay so I think on in terms of the structure you can't argue

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.120
[Guest]: with the core of the system that was set up I think the reason is weakened so

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.480
[Guest]: much over time frankly again is it goes back to these resource constraints right

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:38.720
[Guest]: mean that you're understaffed and under equipped but also the incentive

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.840
[Guest]: constraints right so part of the problem that I was documenting in the absence

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.440
[Guest]: work is that you have these clinics with about 40% absence rates of doctors and

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.520
[Guest]: nurses and again you can't even necessarily blame the doctors and I'll

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:52.760
[Guest]: come back to that in a second but I think where the system fails is the

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:57.760
[Guest]: system still primarily thinks of itself as a logistics operation and doesn't

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.600
[Guest]: think about you know the incentives and how this plays out in the last mile okay

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:05.240
[Guest]: so so when we come talk about policy because I think my broad hope is that

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:08.920
[Guest]: you know given our three-hour rough track record is to use the first hour to

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:12.080
[Guest]: just talk principles the second hour to talk research in India and what we've

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.080
[Guest]: learned and the last hour to talk about policy but you know when I come back to

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.760
[Guest]: policy I'll talk about both kind of investments we can and should make on in

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:22.560
[Guest]: terms of public health and also in terms of of the curative health system itself

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.440
[Guest]: now but let me give you an aside in a fun joke you know which you really like

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:30.640
[Guest]: this problem about prioritizing curative as opposed to fundamental things that

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.200
[Guest]: give you deeper returns so you see this in the US right schools of medicine are

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:39.520
[Guest]: much much better funded than schools of public health okay so medical school

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:43.160
[Guest]: professor will have like tons of endowed professorships tons of huge research

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.280
[Guest]: grants so much money that is the public health guys are always kind of you know

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:52.080
[Guest]: scrounging for resources because it's kind of seen as not as urgent right so

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.360
[Guest]: that problem is that even in the US so one of my apocryphal I don't know if

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.280
[Guest]: this is a legend but I've definitely heard this but I've forgotten who I

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.280
[Guest]: heard it from so I can't source this okay but this is wonderful apocryphal

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.600
[Guest]: story about the director of the National Science Foundation and the director of

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.080
[Guest]: the National Institute of Health okay so these are the two biggest funders of

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.120
[Guest]: research in the US and and they are both testifying in front of the Senate okay

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.320
[Guest]: making the case for their budget and so the NSF guy you know apparently shows up

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.880
[Guest]: with like all of these files and like tens of thousands of papers right saying

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.640
[Guest]: here is all the amazing research that's been produced here's the citation count

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:27.560
[Guest]: here is how much you know this research is changing XYZ and all of these sectors

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:33.320
[Guest]: okay and the NIH guy has like a very very thin folder he has one thin folder with just

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.400
[Guest]: hundred sheets of paper okay and this guy has about ten thousand but at the

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.280
[Guest]: end of these hearings the NIH guy walks out with a budget that's ten times the

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.880
[Guest]: size of the NSF okay like you know so with his hundred page binder so the NSF

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.680
[Guest]: guy apparently asked him, hey boss like you know how did you do this like here I

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.920
[Guest]: have all of this evidence all of this stuff and you're walking away with a ten

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:56.120
[Guest]: times bigger budget what is in that folder of yours so he says aha what I

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.400
[Guest]: have in these hundred sheets of paper are the personal medical histories of

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:05.600
[Guest]: every one of the hundred senators like you know in this room so you know the

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.840
[Guest]: point is that we are just much more viscerally connected to things that we

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.400
[Guest]: have experienced and ill health is you know the need for curative stuff is

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.000
[Guest]: something we see in the moment of having fallen sick right but the need for

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.800
[Guest]: preventive stuff that has much higher returns is the seen and the unseen right

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.480
[Guest]: means so everything almost like my book should have a subtitle seen and unseen

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:28.560
[Guest]: for like every chapter right like you know and I'll give you some copyright

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:33.000
[Guest]: royalties of the title but yeah I mean it is it underpins everything but

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.240
[Guest]: therefore I think it's easy to kind of blame the leadership but in a way it

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:41.200
[Guest]: reflects what the population wants right population wants tertiary care in a way

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.320
[Guest]: more than primary care so part of the point of a moment like this is for

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.960
[Guest]: scientific leadership and kind of economic policy leadership to explain

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.080
[Guest]: to the political leadership and teach them how to explain to the people right

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.000
[Guest]: I mean that this is what we need as a country and why we need to do this right

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.600
[Guest]: mean but yeah so that's that's what we need to do yeah firstly I mean the seen

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:04.520
[Amit Varma]: and the unseen you should you know give the credit to Frederick Bastia because

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:08.200
[Amit Varma]: obviously the title is taken from his famous essay that which is seen and that

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:12.880
[Amit Varma]: which is not seen though that appears to me to be a clumsy English translation of

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.360
[Amit Varma]: whatever the French original title was a couple of asides and one is an anecdote

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:21.440
[Amit Varma]: and it's almost a circular anecdote because you sent me a paper by Das and

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:27.040
[Amit Varma]: Hammer from which I posted an anecdote on Twitter which I'll repeat later when

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.800
[Amit Varma]: we get to kind of that section of this episode but in response to that there is

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:36.920
[Amit Varma]: this excellent doctor in Mumbai called Lancelot Pinto and he shared this

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.640
[Amit Varma]: anecdote you know he gets asthma patients all the time who come to him

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.200
[Amit Varma]: when they have an asthma attack and they want medicine for it and all of that and

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.320
[Amit Varma]: each time he tells him that hey I gave you an inhaler for preventive use why

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.120
[Amit Varma]: don't you use that but they don't they don't care about preventive it's almost

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:57.320
[Amit Varma]: like there's an illusion of eternal good health and immortality until you know

01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.320
[Amit Varma]: disease strikes you or something strikes you you don't care and then you want it

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:07.480
[Amit Varma]: to be cured and this sort of brings one to the question of incentives again you

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.640
[Amit Varma]: know in the sense that look for a politician why should he invest in

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.960
[Amit Varma]: preventive care or public health you know when the results of that are not

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.440
[Amit Varma]: seen you know and and will be seen like way beyond whatever the election cycle

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.720
[Amit Varma]: is and one answer as to how those incentives will be different is you know

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.200
[Amit Varma]: I'm just thinking aloud because you were mentioning pollution earlier and if you

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.600
[Amit Varma]: sort of think about the history of London London is an excellent city to

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.400
[Amit Varma]: live in today in terms of livability but at the turn of the 19th century it was a

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.520
[Amit Varma]: hellhole it was way more polluted than it is today right at the turn of the

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.640
[Amit Varma]: 20th century rather way more polluted than it is today but what typically

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:47.880
[Amit Varma]: happens and has happened in all the great western cities is that once people

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.720
[Amit Varma]: reach a certain level of wealth and empowerment they demand better

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.040
[Amit Varma]: governance a demand better air and then the state has no option but to give it

01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:00.000
[Amit Varma]: to them but I would imagine and I'm thinking aloud that the condition which

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.880
[Amit Varma]: you know makes that possible is that there is empowered local government

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:09.000
[Amit Varma]: where it can actually happen and that's not really the case in India again I

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.640
[Amit Varma]: mean I know these are all old laments and we will no doubt discuss the episode

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:19.000
[Amit Varma]: on federalism yeah we'll talk about it in the episode to federalism so great

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.920
[Amit Varma]: point so now is the time to kind of get into the research part of the episode

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.360
[Amit Varma]: and into the nitty-gritties but before that let's take a quick commercial break

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.760
[Amit Varma]: long before I was a podcaster I was a writer in fact chances are that many of

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:39.040
[Amit Varma]: you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut which was active between

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.920
[Amit Varma]: 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time I love the freedom

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.280
[Amit Varma]: the form gave me and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways I exercise my writing

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.280
[Amit Varma]: muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things because I

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:57.440
[Amit Varma]: wrote about many different things well that phase in my life ended for various

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:02.040
[Amit Varma]: reasons and now it is time to revive it only now I'm doing it through a

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:07.320
[Amit Varma]: newsletter I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.920
[Amit Varma]: where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy I'll write

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.680
[Amit Varma]: about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else so please do

[Amit Varma]: at indiancut.substack.com thank you

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.600
[Amit Varma]: welcome back to the scene in the unseen I'm chatting with Karthik Mullidharan on

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.360
[Amit Varma]: the state of Indian health care like let's understand the problem before we

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.760
[Amit Varma]: begin thinking about solving it because right now it seems almost unsolvable but

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.920
[Amit Varma]: no but let's I mean understanding the problem is good enough and at least we'll

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:58.240
[Amit Varma]: have profound confusion instead of naive confusion as Greg Mankiw once told

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.320
[Amit Varma]: Karthik so Karthik let's let's get down to the nitty-gritties one of the sort of

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.920
[Amit Varma]: delightful thing and you send me a bunch of papers which I link from the show

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.160
[Amit Varma]: notes and one of the delightful things about them was that one they were full

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.360
[Amit Varma]: of data so they confirmed a lot of my intuitions and two a lot of the data

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.400
[Amit Varma]: also you know felt counterintuitive at times and you know gave me a more

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.760
[Amit Varma]: nuanced understanding just by virtue of being what they are just the figures

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:30.000
[Amit Varma]: themselves without any interpretation necessarily and I found it fascinating

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.560
[Amit Varma]: and in the chapter in your book in fact you know you've structured it very well

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.520
[Amit Varma]: where you begin talking about outcomes so I'll ask you about our health care

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.800
[Amit Varma]: system you've spoken about different metrics like infant mortality life

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.960
[Amit Varma]: expectancy stunting and malnutrition and so on by which we can get a sense of how

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:53.000
[Amit Varma]: far we have come and the point is it's a mixed picture we've come quite far but

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.040
[Amit Varma]: we should have been much further along so tell me a little bit about sort of

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:01.680
[Amit Varma]: what these measures are and which ones of them were sort of revelatory to you

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.920
[Guest]: or spoke a lot or surprised you one of the points I wanted to come back to is

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.080
[Guest]: remember the thing I said which is it should be on t-shirt you can't eat GDP

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:13.160
[Guest]: now that's not fully right because you can eat GDP right you can use the GDP to

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.320
[Guest]: buy food to buy like better medicines buy a bunch of things right so I think

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:20.880
[Guest]: and we'll see here that GDP really does matter okay so that systematically

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.040
[Guest]: countries and states with higher incomes will have better health outcomes right

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:28.960
[Guest]: the point is more to say that GDP is not an end in itself and you know it's what

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:33.200
[Amit Varma]: it allows you to do so with that little caveat quick aside there it's this is a

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.240
[Amit Varma]: modification on the t-shirt for fat people like me on the back the t-shirt

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.480
[Amit Varma]: should say you can't eat GDP but on the front where the poncho is it should say

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:50.240
[Guest]: you can eat GDP so I think you know the yeah so like I've done the book with the

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.840
[Guest]: draft of the book chapter I've sent you is that if you want to assess a health

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:58.040
[Guest]: system overall you want to kind of pick a few key indicators that speaks to the

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:03.680
[Guest]: larger status of your population health so life expectancy is usually a good

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:08.680
[Guest]: statement of population health overall right and infant mortality is a good

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:12.920
[Guest]: measure of your health system and the reason I say that is that infant

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.560
[Guest]: mortality is something that for the most part we know what to do about okay for

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:20.200
[Guest]: the most part like you know the biggest causes whether it's diarrhea or whether

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.120
[Guest]: it's you know diseases that you can address with vaccinations or with very

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.800
[Guest]: targeted you know institutional deliveries neonatal health so we kind of

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:31.960
[Guest]: know what to do and so which is why it's a good measure of your health systems

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.280
[Guest]: because you're not at the frontier of your ignorance you are well within kind

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.160
[Guest]: of your knowledge frontier and you just have to learn how to do it okay so that's

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.960
[Guest]: why infant mortality is like a good measure of your health systems but life

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.960
[Guest]: expectancy is a good measure of your population health now there is an

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.000
[Guest]: important modification to this which the WHO uses called the HALE which is the

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.480
[Guest]: health adjusted life expectancy right so you can have a long life but have a

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:58.240
[Guest]: lower quality of life particularly because of things like pollution where

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.000
[Guest]: you know you're just having higher morbidity even though you may kind of

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.120
[Guest]: continue to live so that's I think an important additional metric to look at

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:10.680
[Guest]: and then I think the other really important metric of future population

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:15.360
[Guest]: health is child malnutrition okay so the mortality is can I keep the children

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:21.640
[Guest]: alive but if you keep them alive so in a way in a perverse way actually reducing

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:25.200
[Guest]: child mortality can worsen child malnutrition and that's because you're

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.080
[Guest]: keeping the left tail of the distribution alive right you know that

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.560
[Guest]: may otherwise have passed away so you know so the first step is to make sure

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.320
[Guest]: children stay alive the second part is to then make sure that by age 2 or by

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.240
[Guest]: age 5 which are kind of these key develop particularly age 2 right I mean

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:43.200
[Guest]: these first thousand days of life as they call them the nine months in utero

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.800
[Guest]: and the first two years of life are kind of the critical developmental period

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:50.680
[Guest]: where you kind of want to make sure that the children are getting these right

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.840
[Guest]: inputs in terms of you know cognitive developments and brain development and

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:58.520
[Guest]: other overall physiological development so that would be another key metric to

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.960
[Guest]: look at okay so I think the glass half-full story as with most things in

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:05.320
[Guest]: India is that we've actually made remarkable progress on many of these

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:09.920
[Guest]: indications in the last like you know 40-50 years right so in particular you

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.560
[Guest]: know life expectancy has gone up infant mortality has gone down almost every

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:16.640
[Guest]: metric has has improved but the question is like you know like they say in the

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.680
[Guest]: old grading of students like you know my teacher most of the time like you know

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.680
[Guest]: if you get a hundred great for anything else it'll be can do better right like

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:27.640
[Guest]: you know I mean so and so you know I think the overall grade for India right

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:31.440
[Guest]: mean is can do better now but before we get sanguine right it's we can also get

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.280
[Guest]: much worse okay so we can also do much worse and so and sometimes I think

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:39.120
[Guest]: there's a little bit of a naive push to criticize everything we've done as a

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:42.200
[Guest]: country and that's also incorrect right you know we have done a bunch of things

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.760
[Guest]: that are correct and that we are laboring under monumental other

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:51.840
[Guest]: institutional weaknesses which we can talk about so overall my net net

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.600
[Guest]: assessment of India over 75 years is that of most metrics I think we have a

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.600
[Guest]: lot to be proud of we really do at the time of independence nobody predicted

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.960
[Guest]: like you know we'd stay united or kind of stay mostly democratic so there are

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.800
[Guest]: basic sign of successes that we've had as a state and even on development

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.440
[Guest]: outcomes I think we've actually not done badly okay the question is what should

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.880
[Guest]: our benchmarks be okay and now unlike say people in education who go and study

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.440
[Guest]: education systems in Finland or Singapore and that kind of really

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.840
[Guest]: irritates the hell out of me because I'm like you know you're going in studying

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.200
[Guest]: places with 20 times the per capita income but I think if you think about

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.720
[Guest]: what would be three relevant comparisons for India okay three countries I think

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:30.040
[Guest]: we need to benchmark ourselves against would be China Vietnam and Bangladesh

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:34.320
[Guest]: okay and China because it's the only other large country of similar

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.080
[Guest]: population in terms of just the sheer size of what they're trying to manage

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:42.000
[Guest]: Vietnam because it has similar per capita income as India but does much

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.360
[Guest]: much better on health education and other social indicators and Bangladesh

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.680
[Guest]: because they had the same initial conditions as us right mean and in many

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.520
[Guest]: ways were actually worse than India and 71 because you know the devastation of

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:57.040
[Guest]: the war kind of kept them at a lower place but Bangladesh has now steadily

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.440
[Guest]: improved and is now like you know far ahead of Bengal and even ahead of like

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:03.040
[Guest]: all in the averages like you know I mean on a bunch of human development measure

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:07.640
[Guest]: okay so again so these are the three benchmarks I want us to look at when we

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.800
[Guest]: are trying to make a sense of can do better so it is not like you know I'm

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:16.360
[Guest]: taking a student and saying up 100% Lani I'm saying like you know look at these

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.800
[Guest]: three other comparable students who are comparable in their own way and saying

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:23.520
[Guest]: how can you get slightly better okay then the other big part about health in

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.000
[Guest]: India that's worth reflecting on is just how much variation that is within the

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.840
[Guest]: country right mean so you know we have this paper which I'll talk about but the

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:34.640
[Guest]: title of that paper is to India's okay it's to India's and in the sense that

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.680
[Guest]: the the quality of health care that you have in the southern states particularly

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:43.760
[Guest]: Tamil Nadu Kerala right and I mean there are some other states too is essentially

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.440
[Guest]: like a couple of standard deviations about like you know what you would get

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.840
[Guest]: in the north so I'll talk a little bit more about this measurement paper later

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:52.360
[Guest]: but for example we find that you know even like unqualified providers and

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:55.520
[Guest]: nurses in Tamil Nadu and Kerala do better than like you know fully trained

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.720
[Guest]: doctors in UP and Bihar okay so that's a separate and we'll come back to that in

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.880
[Guest]: a moment but you know there's obviously a lot to learn from the within country

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:07.040
[Guest]: variation right mean and what did some of these states do right the the way I

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:11.280
[Guest]: like to think about health systems is what I've done in the book is to just

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:14.760
[Guest]: have a set of graphs where I put outcomes graphed against GDP per capita

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.000
[Guest]: right so because in general more income allows you to buy more health it means

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.640
[Guest]: your parents are richer the system is richer everything's richer so I expect

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.440
[Guest]: in outcomes to improve with income but the real lesson comes from looking at

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.960
[Guest]: which are the states that are positive outliers conditional on income right so

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.360
[Guest]: holding your income constant which are the states that are doing much better so

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.420
[Guest]: to give you a simple example of how that flips results around in absolute levels

01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.960
[Guest]: outcomes in Bihar look worse than Haryana okay but Haryana is actually

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:45.800
[Guest]: much richer than Bihar and so if you kind of control for GDP and look at

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.160
[Guest]: health outcomes actually Bihar ends up doing slightly better than expected for

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.440
[Guest]: its very very low GDP and Haryana ends up doing much worse okay now but then

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:57.080
[Guest]: that starts getting not just into policy issues but also into social and

01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.880
[Guest]: cultural issues into empowerment of women in particular so in fact

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:03.280
[Guest]: ironically it turns out that women in Bihar end up being much more empowered

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:06.320
[Guest]: partly because there are so many more migrant workers who leave the state

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.840
[Guest]: right mean and so which means that the women are running the show like you know

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:12.760
[Guest]: much more than they are in some of the other states because essentially the men

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:16.880
[Guest]: are migrating and gone out so there are some indirect positive gender spillovers

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.360
[Guest]: like you know that you see in Bihar as a result of the structure of the economy

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.600
[Guest]: but I think the larger point when we think about how do we get better as a

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.720
[Guest]: country is to say that we've done well we have a lot to be proud of and I'll

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.960
[Guest]: talk about the specific pieces of the system that have worked well but we can

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.320
[Guest]: obviously do better okay and then you know that's how I frame that whole

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:37.200
[Guest]: discussion so that's kind of overall health right but we can then start

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.360
[Guest]: looking at the health care system itself in terms of the structure of the health

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:44.480
[Guest]: care system what does it look like I mean is there stuff you I'll pause for a

01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.680
[Amit Varma]: second before I start talking about that what I'll do is everything that you said

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.720
[Amit Varma]: I'll fill in some figures which I've got from papers partly written by you and

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.040
[Amit Varma]: from the chapter in your book itself because I found them very illustrative

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:00.680
[Amit Varma]: like one what is the glass half-full the glass half-full is that infant mortality

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:07.200
[Amit Varma]: in India has declined from 142.6 per thousand live births in 1970 to 28.3 in

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:12.920
[Amit Varma]: 2019 and you think 28.3 is good but it's still four times more kids dying here

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:18.680
[Amit Varma]: than in China which is 6.3 Vietnam is 15.9 even Bangladesh is you know less

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:23.840
[Amit Varma]: kids die 25.6 you know again you talk about how life expectancy and at birth

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:29.480
[Amit Varma]: was you know 41.4 in 1960 which is mind-blowing if we were like the median

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:35.120
[Amit Varma]: person we'd be dead if we were in 1960 and it's gone to 69.4 today but the

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.560
[Amit Varma]: point that you made about health adjusted life expectancy was that India's

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.200
[Amit Varma]: health adjusted life expectancy what are the healthy years of your life that you

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:49.760
[Amit Varma]: can expect that's 59.3 so there are 10 years of the 69.4 which you're losing to

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.160
[Amit Varma]: ill health and you know when you're full potential again this number is you know

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.600
[Amit Varma]: worse than China Vietnam or Bangladesh and you give various reasons for this

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:03.720
[Amit Varma]: similarly you talk about sort of stunting where I'll quote from your book

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.840
[Amit Varma]: quote India has reduced a fraction of stunted children under 5 from a

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:15.000
[Amit Varma]: shockingly high 62.7 percent in 1989 to 34.7 percent in 2017 stop quote which is

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.280
[Amit Varma]: also shockingly high and as you point out quote India's stunting rate is 4.3

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:25.640
[Amit Varma]: times greater than that in China you know 34.7 versus 8.1 46 percent greater

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:29.920
[Amit Varma]: than Vietnam even 13 percent greater than Bangladesh which are you know the

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.800
[Amit Varma]: glass half empty therefore does seem to be quite empty then you pointed you know

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:38.440
[Amit Varma]: figures that reflect the variation that you gave within India you point out how

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:45.640
[Amit Varma]: infant mortality rates in states like MP MP is 47 Odisha is 44 Assam is 44 UP is

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:51.120
[Amit Varma]: 43 and you have Goa which is 8 Kerala which is 10 Puducherry which is 10 you

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:55.520
[Amit Varma]: know Tamil Nadu is 17 Maharashtra is 19 you know the figures kind of speak for

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.840
[Amit Varma]: themselves and about those outliers also I found that fascinating how you know in

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.440
[Amit Varma]: absolute terms Bihar seems to be worse than Haryana but when you adjust for

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.760
[Amit Varma]: per capita income it's actually much better and one you gave the Bihar side

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.360
[Amit Varma]: of the reason that so many migrants are there so women are running the show you

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.120
[Amit Varma]: know I'll again give a brief aside I once wrote a feature story on Sakshi

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Malik after she won the bronze medal at the Olympics I think she won bronze

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.040
[Amit Varma]: right but one of the things I was trying to investigate during that is how the

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.640
[Amit Varma]: hell does a state which is known for his misogyny in other words Haryana and the

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:31.200
[Amit Varma]: way it treats his women how the hell are they getting so many female wrestlers

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:34.880
[Amit Varma]: and all of that and the answer actually does lie in patriarchy where in the

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:38.920
[Amit Varma]: 1970s there was this dude who was a wrestling coach called Chandigiram and

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:44.240
[Amit Varma]: Chandigiram didn't have sons and in 77 or 78 the Olympic Committee announced

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:48.880
[Amit Varma]: that you know that they'd have a women's category in wrestling so he made his

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.640
[Amit Varma]: daughter I think Soneka Kalikaraman this is the dungal story

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:56.640
[Amit Varma]: but he's the the dungal coach Mahavir Singh Phogat was Chandigiram's

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.400
[Amit Varma]: assistant yeah so Chandigiram got his daughter into it I think her name was Soneka Kalikaraman

01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:05.080
[Amit Varma]: or whatever and then Mahavir Phogat who was his assistant got his

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.720
[Amit Varma]: daughters into it so this whole thing was these men who don't have sons who

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.520
[Amit Varma]: want to vicariously achieve something they couldn't see the Olympics as a

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.480
[Amit Varma]: this thing and therefore they push their daughters into it but that doesn't mean

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:21.160
[Amit Varma]: that women are empowered in the state overall and of course women's

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.920
[Amit Varma]: empowerment is actually as you have pointed out you know one of the key

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:28.640
[Amit Varma]: indicators of health the kind of food that they're getting and even the

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.840
[Amit Varma]: spillover effects because a mother who's not getting enough nutrition will you

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.080
[Amit Varma]: know affect her the childbirth it will affect what happens to the kid after

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.080
[Amit Varma]: that all these massive spillover effects so I've you know everything that you

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.560
[Amit Varma]: said I've kind of taken data from your chapter and sort of put it there and I

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.880
[Amit Varma]: think it was important to give this data because it just speaks for itself it is

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.360
[Amit Varma]: so powerful that yes glass half full yeah we're not dying at 41 we're dying

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.320
[Amit Varma]: at 69 that's great but look at all these other countries what have they achieved

01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:00.480
[Amit Varma]: and one of the things in the last episode that we did on education you

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:04.720
[Amit Varma]: told me what really stuck you was to look at say was to compare India and

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.840
[Amit Varma]: Indonesia and say okay we were here at you know we were at a comparable level

01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.120
[Amit Varma]: once upon a time and now look at them and now look at us and where did we go

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:17.800
[Amit Varma]: wrong and so on having added to this this small story I'll kind of let you

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.320
[Guest]: let you continue and thanks because I think you know yeah I didn't give the

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.920
[Guest]: numbers partly because I felt you know that's a part of the chapter that's a

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:27.560
[Guest]: little dry but you're right the numbers are very important so I'm glad you fill

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:31.240
[Guest]: that in like you know so then I can talk about you know the concept so coming

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:35.520
[Guest]: back to the research that I want to talk about right I think what most of your

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.600
[Guest]: listeners probably have very little idea of is just the landscape of health care

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:43.840
[Guest]: provision particularly in rural India okay so and and this is something that

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:46.560
[Guest]: not just your listeners but the government frankly has no idea okay and

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.400
[Guest]: that's because you know the majority of health is provided by completely

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.560
[Guest]: unqualified quacks okay now we know that they exist because in household survey

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:58.280
[Guest]: data we know people are going to the private guys but we have no data because

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:01.280
[Guest]: they are technically illegal and so that means they don't show up in any official

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.000
[Guest]: database about you know who these people are okay let me give you a little bit of

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.800
[Guest]: my journey into kind of just the three major health studies I have done like

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:10.600
[Guest]: you know so I can speak in a little bit more detail about my own work but also

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.480
[Guest]: draw in on some of the work by Jishnu and Jeff in particular to give your

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.560
[Guest]: listeners a little bit of a capsule of what we've learned about the functioning

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.880
[Guest]: of the health care system you know overall so like I said you know I

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.800
[Guest]: started this journey with kind of this project and looking at quality of public

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:28.480
[Guest]: service delivery right and this was part of a project that was done for the World

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.560
[Guest]: Bank's World Development Report in 2004 on making services work for the poor or

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.360
[Guest]: 2003 and so it had kind of a cross-country component and part of the

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.960
[Guest]: challenge was coming up with metrics of quality that were measurable in

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:45.480
[Guest]: identical ways across context okay so and the reason we picked up provider

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.880
[Guest]: absence is it's a very blunt measure obviously the doctor being there is

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:53.160
[Guest]: necessary but not sufficient right I mean he could be there and still not do

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.760
[Guest]: anything but it's a very very basic blunt measure we said okay you know like

01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:00.400
[Guest]: Woody Allen I think famously said right that 80% of success in life is just

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:05.360
[Guest]: showing up right I mean so so you know we started that very very basic measure

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.640
[Guest]: and just like we did for education we also did for health clinics where

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:13.200
[Guest]: essentially trained enumerators made surprise visits to over close to 1500

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.120
[Guest]: clinics across the country about 18 every state and just measured okay and

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.160
[Guest]: so what we got out of that was this estimate in 2003 that about 40% of

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.160
[Guest]: doctors and roughly the same fraction of health personnel in general were absent

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:28.920
[Guest]: on any given day okay that's a shocking number because once you take away the

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.080
[Guest]: vacancies right I mean the fact that these were conditional in the positions

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.480
[Guest]: being filled right you've also got vacancies that you can see how abysmal

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:40.960
[Guest]: that is in terms of the amount of services being offered okay now one of

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.760
[Guest]: the limitations of our all India study is we could not check because the

01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:48.880
[Guest]: doctors could potentially be working but just be on site okay and field visits

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.440
[Guest]: they could be in villages they were they're supposed to be they're supposed

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.080
[Guest]: to be doing rounds so there was a complementary study in fact done then

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.760
[Guest]: nobody had them but three Nobel laureates right so Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.160
[Guest]: and Angus Deaton and though they fight on RCTs they actually work together on

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.940
[Guest]: that project right I mean in Rajasthan in Udaipur and they but there because it

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:11.360
[Guest]: was one district they were able to do much more detailed work of actually

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:15.320
[Guest]: following to to the village where the doctor or nurse could have plausibly

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.960
[Guest]: been okay and they find that in only 10% of the cases could they find them in in

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:23.760
[Guest]: the field and and that the story was worse than just absence right the story

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:27.720
[Guest]: was also one of unpredictable absence so if I know that the doctors is

01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:31.600
[Guest]: predictably absent two days a week okay then that could be absence of 40% but I

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.360
[Guest]: know he's there on Mondays Thursdays and Fridays and so as a patient I optimize

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:39.800
[Guest]: around that and that's completely fine the problem is that they found that you

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.520
[Guest]: could run a regression of all the observable data and you would have zero

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.680
[Guest]: predictive power of when this guy is going to be absent okay so and that

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.960
[Guest]: makes it much much more painful for the poor beneficiary who kind of has to both

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:54.600
[Guest]: forego a day of earnings and pay the transport to go to one of these clinics

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.200
[Guest]: right mean and then if you go there and find that the doctor may not even be

01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:02.040
[Guest]: there you know that becomes much you know much more problematic in terms of

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:06.680
[Guest]: access to public health okay so those two studies I think basically focus the

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.080
[Guest]: challenge on governance right mean that the basic governance challenges we have

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.120
[Guest]: in the public system now after that I started working much more in education

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.960
[Guest]: right and it's Jishnu and Jeff Jishnu was then the World Bank of both of the

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:20.680
[Guest]: World Bank then Jeff went to Princeton Jishnu is now Georgetown you know so

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:24.640
[Guest]: they led a lot of the work on improving measurement of how do you just measure

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.760
[Guest]: health care quality and this turns out to be a really hard problem because

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:32.440
[Guest]: measuring requires there is a possibility of undertreatment as a possibility of

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.640
[Guest]: overtreatment there's you know what the quality of care is going to vary by

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:39.680
[Guest]: protocol so long story short the method that is most commonly used in the

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:43.240
[Guest]: literature to assess kind of doctor competence is what is called the method

01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:48.320
[Guest]: of medical vignettes okay so and the vignettes are the form that doctor

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:51.700
[Guest]: qualifying exams will look like where you say you know you give the doctor a

01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:55.200
[Guest]: hypothetical case and you say a patient is walking into your clinic and report

01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:00.400
[Guest]: symptom XYZ okay so what do you do next so the whole point of kind of

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:05.160
[Guest]: good medical education is that you have a treatment protocol or a diagnosis

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:08.160
[Guest]: protocol right so it's what is called a checklist of essential items saying

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:12.120
[Guest]: somebody walks in with the following symptoms then you know here are the

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:15.160
[Guest]: first four things you do right you take the basic vital statistics you measure

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.280
[Guest]: temperature you take a little bit of history and you know the patterns of the

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.540
[Guest]: fever you know so you try to ask questions so the whole point of being an

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:27.440
[Guest]: effective medical provider is the patient walks in with some random

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:32.240
[Guest]: symptom and mapping that symptom into an underlying diagnosis and then treating

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:36.280
[Guest]: only that and not overtreating right is the core of what you want a good doctor

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.180
[Guest]: to do okay so the first step of assessing is this provider able to do

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:43.540
[Guest]: that is to then assess provider knowledge okay so that's what they do

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:48.000
[Guest]: with these vignettes and they measure doctor knowledge in a bunch of studies

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.400
[Guest]: okay and this is kind of being used in multiple settings now the problem with

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.720
[Guest]: the vignettes is that the vignette only gives you a measure of doctor knowledge

01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.520
[Guest]: okay it doesn't tell you anything about doctor practice right I mean what does

01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:04.760
[Guest]: the guy actually do like I mean when a patient walks in right so you know you

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:08.680
[Guest]: might know a lot but choose to not exert effort and this goes back to again

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:13.320
[Guest]: something Ajay said which is health care is not a public good health care is an

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.100
[Guest]: inherently private good right because I give it to you and not to others it is

01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:21.760
[Guest]: rival because if I spend time on you I have less time for others so I can both

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:25.840
[Guest]: exclude and it is rival so it is not a public good at all right it is a classic

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:30.360
[Guest]: private good and the amount of effort you put in is costly right so effort is

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.640
[Guest]: costly and coming back the the historical anecdote which I wanted to

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.320
[Guest]: talk about which people may not realize is that the British colonial health care

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.960
[Guest]: system the medical system that was set up it was not set up to take care of the

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:44.160
[Guest]: population it was set up to take care of the collector and the superintendent of

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.560
[Guest]: police right like so it and it was a completely excludable good right it was

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.200
[Guest]: the doctor the medical officer in the district's job was to make sure that the

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:57.360
[Guest]: ruling employees were healthy right like I mean population to do it right like

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.120
[Guest]: you know that would come maybe in times of some major pandemics or something but

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:04.680
[Guest]: for the most part it was a private good that was allocated to the elite okay so

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.320
[Guest]: what they then was like listen knowledge is not enough because when people walk

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.000
[Guest]: into a clinic and you know you've seen those papers so what they started doing

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.640
[Guest]: was then measuring what they call participant observations okay where you

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:17.960
[Guest]: have people sitting in the clinic almost like you know anthropology type you're

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:21.400
[Guest]: sitting as and you're just coding every interaction between the doctor and the

01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:25.080
[Guest]: patient okay so patient walks in and you just observe now for the first half day

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:27.760
[Guest]: one day you might get some what I call Hawthorne effects that they work a

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:30.920
[Guest]: little harder because somebody's watching them but after some time we now

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:33.920
[Guest]: have evidence to say that it just goes back to normal practice okay so that

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.120
[Guest]: gives you a measure of effort right so what they were finding and the main kind

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:41.640
[Guest]: of insight from bunch of these papers now of course this level of measurement

01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.320
[Guest]: could only be done in smaller samples right so they had samples in Delhi that

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:48.320
[Guest]: you know other samples but the punchline that was coming out of all of this was

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:54.140
[Guest]: that the doctors a the knowledge was low but even conditional knowledge the

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:57.880
[Guest]: effort in the public system was incredibly weak okay so they kind of

01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.240
[Guest]: came up with this terminology what they call the no-do gap right the gap between

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.160
[Guest]: kind of knowledge and practice was so large that it kind of highlights again

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.080
[Guest]: the importance of incentives because you can hire people based on competence and

01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:13.040
[Guest]: knowledge but that doesn't kind of ensure that they will exert effort when

01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:17.300
[Unknown]: they actually see a patient now and this is a very difficult problem right it's a

01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:21.640
[Guest]: difficult problem and I also sympathize with the doctors in some way because in

01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:25.080
[Guest]: a funny way you almost have negative incentives for effort right because if

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.860
[Guest]: you put in a lot of effort you get a reputation as a good doctor and you get

01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:31.440
[Guest]: more work right and you get more patients but your compensation is not

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:34.480
[Guest]: going up your resources are not going up there is nothing in the system that is

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:38.360
[Guest]: actually variably increasing with the amount of patients you see okay so and

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.440
[Guest]: I'll come back to the separating equilibrium of how these incentives

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.720
[Guest]: work out and then they also looked at the private doctors and see that the

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:47.880
[Guest]: private doctors in general have less knowledge okay but they actually work

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.800
[Guest]: harder because they function closer to the frontier of their lower

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:56.000
[Guest]: knowledge right so if quality is knowledge times effort the public guys

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.120
[Guest]: have more knowledge because you're recruiting based on more formal

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:02.960
[Guest]: credentials the private guys are much less qualified on average but they work

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:06.000
[Guest]: harder and they function closer to the frontier of knowledge okay so that was

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.560
[Guest]: kind of the broad message that was coming out of that work okay now the

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:16.200
[Guest]: limitation with that is in the participant observation when I'm sitting

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:20.960
[Guest]: in the clinic and coding the interaction I don't know what is the underlying

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:25.280
[Guest]: ailment the patient is coming with okay so I can observe your bedside manner I

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:28.400
[Guest]: can observe how many questions you ask I can observe how many medicines you give

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:32.320
[Guest]: but I have no idea if what you've done is correct right because I don't know

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:36.280
[Guest]: what the underlying disease is that this random patient is walking in with now in

01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.640
[Guest]: the vignette I know that right in the vignette I know what the underlying case

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.360
[Guest]: is and I'm structuring the whole case so that a good doctor will find his or her

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:48.160
[Guest]: way to the correct case and the correct diagnosis right so the problem in the

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:51.440
[Guest]: POPO measures effort vignette measures knowledge but I want to measure both in

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.200
[Guest]: the same case to then really get a sense of is the doctor getting the right

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:59.880
[Guest]: protocol of care okay and so then the big innovation and this is you know it's

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:04.600
[Guest]: been used in medical studies before but just for your listeners is a detour into

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.360
[Guest]: the wonderful world of research right like you know is the so the the closest

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.200
[Guest]: to a Bollywood operation like you know we've had in any of our recent studies

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.320
[Guest]: is if you truly want to understand both doctor knowledge and doctor practice the

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:19.680
[Guest]: only way to do this is with what are called standardized patients okay so

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:23.480
[Guest]: these are essentially actors like I mean who are trained to be fake patients

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:28.520
[Guest]: right mean who go in and present a set of symptoms now because you know the

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:32.960
[Guest]: underlying case okay so now you can actually assess whether the quality and

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:36.680
[Guest]: the protocols the doctor is doing are correct as per the medical checklist for

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:41.240
[Guest]: that case so you both see knowledge and you effectively see the real practice of

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:44.800
[Guest]: what this person is doing okay and then at the end of the transaction you kind

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:48.440
[Guest]: of observe the medication so you get to observe both over medication and under

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:52.600
[Guest]: medication and you observe the fees charged so then you can kind of analyze

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:56.720
[Guest]: what our market prices what are these prices reflecting okay now and again

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:59.680
[Guest]: this is not something we came up with right so standardized patients are a

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.360
[Guest]: well-established tool for medical education in the US and Canada so if

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.360
[Guest]: you're a medical student at some point in your life you will see a standardized

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:09.600
[Guest]: patient right I mean so it is part of your training and part of your testing

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.920
[Guest]: okay that a random person will walk in and like you know you're going to be

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:16.640
[Guest]: assessed on how you do so the only thing is we adapted that same method for

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:19.960
[Guest]: assessing the quality of actual care okay so this is a little bit of the

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:23.080
[Guest]: research journey in terms of just the methods in the measurement so I think

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:26.440
[Guest]: Ajay last time was talking about you know how little we know you know and one

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:29.360
[Guest]: of the reasons I thought is a good time to do the episode is it builds up on

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:33.280
[Guest]: that you know that we actually do know a lot but not much not as systematically

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:36.320
[Guest]: as we would like to because these were these one-off studies and we need to do

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:39.960
[Guest]: a lot more of them so you know and then there was this last kind of study so the

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.960
[Guest]: two studies which I did then after so Jishnu and Jeff did a bunch of these

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:46.960
[Guest]: things and then we got together in about 2010 and worked together on two major

01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:52.400
[Guest]: studies so one was an all India study looking at the availability and

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:56.600
[Guest]: landscape of providers in rural India so it was a representative sample of

01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:00.680
[Guest]: villages and all we did was we just went and did a census of providers okay like

01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:03.880
[Guest]: you know so who is here right like you know and where are people going to and

01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:07.640
[Guest]: then on an all India basis there was no way you could do standardized patients

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:11.120
[Guest]: and so there we measured quality just using the vignettes okay so that was a

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:14.920
[Guest]: measure of doctor knowledge but then in one study in Madhya Pradesh in a second

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:19.160
[Guest]: study in MP we went did a much much deeper dive right I mean where we had

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.320
[Guest]: these standardized patients then go and present to both public and private

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:27.920
[Guest]: clinics to go present to the same doctor in his public and private practice okay

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:31.320
[Guest]: and we'll come back and tell you a bunch of stories about that but you know from

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:34.840
[Guest]: a research perspective those were some of the studies that were done and yeah

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:37.200
[Guest]: I'll take a little pause and come and give you the insight so maybe I'll give

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:40.200
[Guest]: you the insights you know I'll I'll start with the all India one maybe right

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:44.240
[Guest]: and then take a pause and come in with the MP one after that unless you want to

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:48.920
[Amit Varma]: come in right now no I think I'll come in right now because there is so much

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:52.520
[Amit Varma]: that you mentioned to unpack I think let's kind of unpack them one by one and

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:56.520
[Amit Varma]: come to this and I'll get to the rural part of it and absenteeism and all of

01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:01.600
[Amit Varma]: that later but very quickly to just sort of elaborate on what you said about a

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:06.080
[Amit Varma]: vignette for the sake of my listeners what that in real terms would be that

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:11.560
[Amit Varma]: say I go to what I go to the doctor and I'm the sort of actor as it were acting

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:14.760
[Amit Varma]: as if I have something and I will say I have diarrhea and then what we are

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:19.440
[Amit Varma]: measuring is what are the questions that person asked me how relevant are they to

01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:23.480
[Amit Varma]: my problem so you know these are the five questions that a good doctor would

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:28.240
[Amit Varma]: ask these are the six things that a good doctor would check in the last of them

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:31.440
[Amit Varma]: apparently being some indentation in the temple or the head or something which

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.480
[Amit Varma]: has something to do with diarrhea and so on and and you grade them based on how

01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:39.720
[Amit Varma]: many of these they actually ask which I kind of found fascinating now there's

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:44.520
[Amit Varma]: this extremely interesting conversation you know in the 2007 study Jishnu Das

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.360
[Amit Varma]: and Jeffrey Hammer where you know Das had a conversation with this doctor in

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.760
[Amit Varma]: a slum and I love this conversation so I'm just gonna read it out because it is

01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:56.400
[Amit Varma]: I think so relevant to present times also where this doctor says yes there is

01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.400
[Amit Varma]: a lot of diarrhea and dysentery in this locality what can they do as well the

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.640
[Amit Varma]: water is dirty people don't know how to boil it that's why the children are

01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.040
[Amit Varma]: always falling sick so Jishnu asks so what do you do for

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:10.520
[Amit Varma]: children with diarrhea so the doctor says what can we do the usual things we

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.720
[Amit Varma]: tell the mother to give water with salt and sugar to the baby and then also give

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:18.880
[Amit Varma]: some medicines so Jishnu asks such as so the doctor says the usual metrogel

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:23.480
[Amit Varma]: loperamide furoxone forgive me for the pronunciations young doctors I forgive

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:28.560
[Amit Varma]: you for your handwriting and then Jishnu says but isn't ORS enough ORS being

01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:33.320
[Amit Varma]: oral rehydration basically salt only and the doctor says of course the who and

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:36.560
[Amit Varma]: the others keep saying we should only give ORS but if I tell the mother she

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:40.240
[Amit Varma]: should go home and only give the child water with salt and sugar she will never

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:43.440
[Amit Varma]: come back to me she will only go to the next doctor who will give her all the

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:47.040
[Amit Varma]: medicines and then she will think that he is better than me stop quote and this

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:51.240
[Amit Varma]: of course speaks to a classic problem that you point out about how private

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:55.520
[Amit Varma]: doctors often tend to over prescribe for different kinds of incentives and we'll

01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:00.840
[Amit Varma]: discuss that in detail and and I in fact reproduced I took a screen grab of this

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:03.920
[Amit Varma]: and put it on Twitter today because it spoke to me because yesterday there was

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.240
[Amit Varma]: an interview with dr. Lancelot Pinto and another doctor and I link it from the

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:10.480
[Amit Varma]: show notes where they were talking about how one of the things that is making

01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:14.520
[Amit Varma]: kovat worse among the many things making kovat worse one of the things that is

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:19.280
[Amit Varma]: making it worse is that people are just over medicating where dr. Pinto's point

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:23.600
[Amit Varma]: is that even we know all the things that don't work like plasma and ivermectin

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:27.600
[Amit Varma]: and hydroxychloroquine and even remdesivir is only in particular

01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:31.320
[Amit Varma]: clinical situations is recommended but one of the things that does work is

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:35.800
[Amit Varma]: dexamethasone which is a corticosteroid but even that should only be prescribed

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.480
[Amit Varma]: at a particular stage of the illness and what doctors are doing it is that when

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:43.920
[Amit Varma]: young people are reporting fever they are giving steroids from then only and

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.920
[Amit Varma]: what the steroid will do is it will reliably take the fever down but it will

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.120
[Amit Varma]: also suppress the immune system reaction and then you will be hit harder with

01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:56.360
[Amit Varma]: kovat and so people are getting over that fever and then just falling apart

01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:01.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's because of this over medication that is happening so what is required at

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:06.320
[Amit Varma]: the start is that that initial fever of four or five days you just have to live

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:10.320
[Amit Varma]: through it that's a body's immune system unless your oxygen level levels go down

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.040
[Amit Varma]: you don't really need to do anything you know that's that that's a natural

01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:17.640
[Amit Varma]: response of the body if you over medicate at that point you only make it

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:21.280
[Amit Varma]: worse and one of the things that is happening is patients are asking for all

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:25.480
[Amit Varma]: of these because they will read that array my uncle got ill and he was given

01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:29.840
[Amit Varma]: these five medicines and remdesivir and plasma and all of that and doctors under

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:33.760
[Amit Varma]: that pressure just because it the workload is so insane anyway they'll say

01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:37.240
[Amit Varma]: fine you know you can also have that and then these people will put out calls on

01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Twitter plasma remdesivir and all of that so I thought that in these current

01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:45.720
[Amit Varma]: times that's sort of an important aside that one should make I think the

01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:51.000
[Amit Varma]: technical term for it is polypharmacy and and that this seems to be a tendency

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.240
[Amit Varma]: that Indians have ki kuch bhi ho gaya chalo antibiotic de do yeh de do and they

01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:59.800
[Amit Varma]: feel a doctor is competent if that kind of happens yeah no I think you know

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:03.440
[Guest]: you're just speaking to what makes healthcare so so vexing right because

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:06.400
[Guest]: there is kind of both you know what you're describing which is patient

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:10.400
[Guest]: induced demand like you know for things that are suboptimal and doctor induced

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.040
[Guest]: demand you know in other cases right mean where you're kind of you know all

01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:17.720
[Guest]: else being equal you recommend procedures where you make you know where

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:21.960
[Guest]: the revenue is you know is more lucrative and so that is a very very

01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:25.440
[Guest]: difficult problem and this is why if you go back to look at the core of doctor

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:29.440
[Guest]: training right why is why do they spend so much time on medical ethics why did

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.920
[Guest]: they spend so much time on the Hippocratic Oath why do they spend so

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:36.160
[Guest]: much time on do no harm it's precisely because the founders of the modern

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:41.680
[Guest]: medical profession recognized just how powerful a doctor is and that the only

01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:46.720
[Guest]: way to kind of even attempt this problem of kind of how much asymmetric

01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:51.280
[Guest]: information and power there is is to actually build a more noble doctor right

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:57.240
[Guest]: mean and so you know if I can inculcate in you a certain intrinsic identity that

01:59:57.240 --> 02:00:01.400
[Guest]: says deviating from my intrinsic identity is costly right that's the one

02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:05.560
[Guest]: hope we have in the long term of actually building a better medical

02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.720
[Guest]: system and this has to do both with doctors in terms of what they do and

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:13.680
[Guest]: also doctors ability to resist right mean patient demand and saying that you

02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:18.760
[Guest]: know so and this is why customer satisfaction that we normally use okay

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:21.840
[Guest]: is not even a always a good measure here I think Jishnu gave me this wonderful

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:24.600
[Guest]: quote once I forget I think it's from Kenneth Prendergast as a paper it says

02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:29.440
[Guest]: you know doctor's satisfaction from drug addicted client who's assessing the

02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.160
[Guest]: doctor based on is he getting his next dose like you know I mean is not a good

02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.720
[Guest]: measure of doctor quality right so in that sense the measure of doctor quality

02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:42.240
[Guest]: is like I said to diagnose precisely and give you exactly what is needed and

02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:46.080
[Guest]: nothing more and I remember an old conversation with Siddharth Mukherjee he

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.720
[Guest]: may not even remember I think I met him once in Boston he's at least five or six

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.320
[Guest]: years older than me but and I remember very distinctly he told me that is it a

02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:56.680
[Guest]: good doctor recognizes that every medication is a poison right mean

02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:01.160
[Guest]: because it is being given to kill something okay like a mean the body so

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:05.480
[Guest]: you kind of want to absolutely minimize what you do to just go after what the

02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.640
[Guest]: ailment is and nothing more right now but the flip side of that is now if you

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:13.960
[Guest]: take that medical ideal into the practical situation of kind of the poor

02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:19.160
[Guest]: in India is that you cannot blame them like I mean for wanting more medicines

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:23.800
[Guest]: because essentially if you are poor and you've fallen sick you are on the verge

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:27.440
[Guest]: of starvation because you don't have income right so the single most

02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:31.640
[Guest]: important kind of thing that is driving the demand for health care for the rural

02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:36.120
[Guest]: poor is how do I get back to work it's not like I mean they're looking for all

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:39.040
[Guest]: these medicines to say I want the steroids to give me a high no it is

02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:44.920
[Guest]: essentially every day I don't work is a day closer to destitution and so there's

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:48.920
[Guest]: no unemployment insurance there's no safety net and so which means that

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:53.160
[Guest]: coming back to basic economics of kind of the time discounting right mean the

02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:56.560
[Guest]: discounting calculation you're doing is very simple it says yes if I take over

02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:00.600
[Guest]: medication there might be some adverse side effects in the future but I need to

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:04.160
[Guest]: survive to the get to that future right I mean so which means that the discount

02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:09.120
[Guest]: rate is very very high and so what may seem medically optimal right I mean is

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:12.200
[Guest]: often not what is optimal for the patient and one of the things we

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:17.400
[Guest]: document in our MP study is that there is a ton of over prescription but the

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:21.760
[Guest]: over prescription is not only driven by the incentives of the doctor to make

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:24.840
[Guest]: more money when I give you more medicines right the over prescription is

02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:29.080
[Guest]: driven by the need for the patient to want to get symptomatic relief so that

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:32.680
[Guest]: he or she is able to go back to work and so then in a world where the doctor

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:35.560
[Guest]: actually doesn't know what's going on with you right like I mean he gives you

02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:38.240
[Guest]: a cocktail hoping that something will have an effect right like I mean and

02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:42.880
[Guest]: that you'll feel better so in that sense the over medication is not it's kind of

02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:46.720
[Guest]: an ethically much more murky area right like you know because he's not just

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.160
[Guest]: doing it to make money he's doing it because he wants to help you and what

02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:54.760
[Guest]: you want more than anything else is to get better enough to go back to work

02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:59.560
[Guest]: right and that's what makes the ethics of this so kind of complicated and

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:03.800
[Guest]: fraught right so yeah so it's like I said there's only more and more profound

02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.240
[Guest]: confusion right I mean that if you ask me today what should the policy response

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:10.520
[Guest]: to this be I frankly don't have a good answer right I mean it is it would be

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:14.360
[Guest]: more along the lines and I'll come back and talk more about training and

02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:20.080
[Guest]: education and how you can kind of see in a way what you want to do is improve the

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.640
[Guest]: doctor's ability to diagnose and credibly communicate that to the patient

02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:28.720
[Guest]: right so that the doctor can act as this trusted filter of both what you need and

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:33.040
[Guest]: what you don't need in a world where like you know there isn't this immediate

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:36.400
[Guest]: competitive pressure or the sense of saying okay I got the wine idea to

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:40.200
[Guest]: dr. Cheney right like I mean so yeah injection a data dr. Cheney right like

02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:43.600
[Guest]: you know so there are these you know tropes that people have and these you

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:48.400
[Guest]: know these are very very very complicated issues to solve it's really

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:52.600
[Amit Varma]: fascinating I mean in in fact this is a classic example where real medicine

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:56.880
[Amit Varma]: might have a placebo effect because a patient you know feels that if they are

02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.760
[Amit Varma]: given an actual you know medicine instead of just being told that go home

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:04.320
[Amit Varma]: and you know put some salt in your water and drink that and like come on yeah I

02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:07.960
[Amit Varma]: mean if I'm paying good money to see a doctor how can you tell me to drink salt

02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:12.200
[Amit Varma]: water costo though the other sort of observation that you made before I come

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.200
[Amit Varma]: to my question and I found this like so fascinating and and so telling is this

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:21.200
[Amit Varma]: rule of three this is from the Das and Hammer study where Das and Hammer

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:24.840
[Amit Varma]: write that quote the average interaction with a doctor in our sample is governed

02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:28.040
[Amit Varma]: by the rule of three stop quote and then they write the patient arrives three

02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:33.640
[Amit Varma]: days after becoming sick the doctor spends 3.8 minutes and asked 3.2

02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:39.280
[Amit Varma]: questions after which the patient leaves with 2.6 different medicines 0.5 of which

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:44.980
[Amit Varma]: are antibiotics stop quote and such a fantastic illustration now question

02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:50.800
[Amit Varma]: number one what does this tell us this rule of three and question number two in

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:55.560
[Amit Varma]: a larger sense and this goes across multiple studies which you'd shared with

02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:02.960
[Amit Varma]: me what do we know about the difference between private and public doctors both

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:08.360
[Amit Varma]: in terms of their competence in terms of their effort is there a sort of a

02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:12.720
[Amit Varma]: distinction depending on you know the locality they are in if they're in a

02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.280
[Amit Varma]: rich locality or a poor locality is there a distinction between some you

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:21.960
[Amit Varma]: know a doctor in a hospital and a doctor with his private clinic and is there a

02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:26.920
[Amit Varma]: distinction with with a doctor who is both by day he's you know a doctor in a

02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:30.360
[Amit Varma]: public clinic but also has his own private practice outside now all of

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:35.520
[Amit Varma]: these are nuances you have explored so give us a dope yeah so I think the let

02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.720
[Guest]: me just start with some basic facts right I think the that's the easiest

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:43.560
[Guest]: place to start right so what did we do in this kind of all India study that you

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:46.800
[Guest]: know just was published in social science and medicine last year and this

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:50.040
[Guest]: is the paper that's called the two India's right so what we did was had a

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:53.560
[Guest]: representative sample of villages where we just went and first counted right

02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:57.160
[Guest]: mean who are all the providers and then did a random sample where we went and

02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:00.440
[Guest]: administered these vignettes so I think the goal is just to characterize the

02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:05.160
[Guest]: landscape right who are these providers how can I write I mean and so the the

02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:09.280
[Guest]: main punch line that comes out of this is that over 70% of the overall

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:13.000
[Guest]: provision of health care in rural India is coming from the private sector and

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:17.600
[Guest]: the majority of these private providers have no formal qualifications whatsoever

02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:22.120
[Guest]: okay so these are what you would call quacks okay but we need to kind of put a

02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:25.560
[Guest]: lot of nuance into this term quack okay which I'll come to in a second okay

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:30.240
[Guest]: about who are these quote-unquote doctors okay so that's fact number one

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:34.440
[Guest]: okay about the the structure of the health care system is that 70% is

02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:38.640
[Guest]: private most of them are quacks and this is not even including people with

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:41.560
[Guest]: legitimate qualifications who are practicing outside the area of training

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:44.000
[Guest]: so you have the traditional Indian medicine people who have Ayurveda and

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.440
[Guest]: Unani and homeopathy kind of degrees but are actually practicing allopathy right

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:52.200
[Guest]: mean and that's again reflects the fact that you know these alternative systems

02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:57.080
[Guest]: are meant to be more about wellness rather than cure but the patient is not

02:06:57.080 --> 02:07:00.280
[Guest]: interested in wellness patient goes for cure and so they end up kind of

02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:03.360
[Guest]: dispensing the same allopathic medicine that gives you the symptomatic relief so

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:07.040
[Guest]: that is fact number one okay the the share is major mainly private and more

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:10.840
[Guest]: than 50% are unqualified the other important fact is that this is above 50%

02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:15.320
[Guest]: in literally every state in India okay so except Kerala which is about 45 47%

02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:20.520
[Guest]: even there so the private share is very very big okay so it's not the fact and

02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:24.800
[Guest]: this is a little subtle okay it's not the fact that but Tamil Nadu and Kerala

02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:28.200
[Guest]: that have better public systems have less private okay they also have more

02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:32.880
[Guest]: private but their private is much better okay so and this is a very deep and

02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.920
[Guest]: subtle point I want to make which is coming back to your story about when the

02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:40.160
[Guest]: elites have exited from the private sector why do we care about improving

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:44.360
[Guest]: the public okay and the subtle point is that the reason I care about state

02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:48.680
[Guest]: capacity and improving public systems is that not only does it directly benefit

02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:52.680
[Guest]: those who use the public system it also indirectly benefits everybody uses the

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:55.680
[Guest]: private system because the private is forced to compete with the improving

02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:59.800
[Guest]: public so when the public option gets better you are also automatically

02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:03.000
[Guest]: forcing out the left tail of the distribution of the private providers

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.800
[Guest]: and forcing the private distribution up correct so there's that overall spill

02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:10.840
[Guest]: over in the economy that is not being accounted for in terms of the value of

02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:15.640
[Guest]: investing in strong public systems okay so the so the second key fact is that as

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:19.240
[Guest]: your systems get better it is not that the private goes away but the private

02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:23.680
[Guest]: gets better okay so the so the public is pushing up the base and it's that that

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:27.400
[Guest]: is in fact a tide that lifts all the boats okay so that's the second key fact

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:31.080
[Guest]: the third is just how much variation that is across the country right mean

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:34.440
[Guest]: and so if you look at these vignettes and look at the quality what you'll see

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:38.720
[Guest]: is that nurses and sometimes even the unqualified providers in Tamil Nadu and

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:42.920
[Guest]: Kerala do better on these vignettes than even people notionally with MBBS

02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:46.680
[Guest]: degrees in UP and Bihar okay like you know now and again this is not to malign

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:49.920
[Guest]: UP and Bihar but I suspect it speaks to the quality of medical education or the

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.400
[Guest]: fact that you can get through there are probably more kind of fake colleges I

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:57.480
[Guest]: don't know enough about this right mean but you know it certainly highlights I

02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.880
[Guest]: would say the value of say some of these national systems like neat and next okay

02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:04.760
[Guest]: like you know that says let's have a standardized entrance test a standardized

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:08.320
[Guest]: exit test so that regardless of what your kind of training program is that

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:11.400
[Guest]: you have to show on a certain common standard right mean that you've achieved

02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:14.800
[Guest]: so the other key fact which I want people to understand and this is more

02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:18.080
[Guest]: from my fieldwork rather than systematic data collection is a little bit more

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:21.800
[Guest]: about who these quacks are okay like you know so how have they become so

02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:25.000
[Guest]: prevalent and why are they all over the place so two things one that the state

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.680
[Guest]: is often not there and second even if the state is there the state is not

02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:32.360
[Guest]: accountable right so one of the striking findings we have in our MP study is that

02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:37.000
[Guest]: the share of the private guys is above 60 or 70 percent even when you have a

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.220
[Guest]: public MBBS doctor posted in the village okay so it's not just a question of have

02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:44.760
[Guest]: you posted a public doctor because the public doctor is often not there so

02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:50.000
[Guest]: coming back to who these private quacks are see most of them are have done what

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.400
[Guest]: you would call an informal apprenticeship okay that they have

02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:55.800
[Guest]: shadowed a regular doctor like you know and kind of been in this guy's clinic

02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:58.920
[Guest]: for a year or two observed a bunch of what he does and then they say okay I'm

02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:03.000
[Guest]: ready to go off and kind of do my own thing okay now and as with any skilling

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.480
[Guest]: program or apprenticeship program in India there is so much variation in the

02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:10.120
[Guest]: quality of who you shadowed that that automatically then means that there are

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:13.200
[Guest]: some of these guys were not bad at all because they've actually informally

02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:16.480
[Guest]: imbibed some pretty good practices and then there are others were abysmal okay

02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.840
[Guest]: so that's one part about who these people are now but the second thing

02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:25.240
[Guest]: that's important to understand about why they are not these evil kind you know

02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:28.360
[Guest]: there's a sense that oh there these evil profiteering quacks okay but that I

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:32.240
[Guest]: think is far from the case because they are often highly embedded and very very

02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:35.320
[Guest]: respected in their communities because they are the only people providing care

02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.160
[Guest]: and they have to live in that community right so in fact the best incentive for

02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:42.800
[Guest]: them not to do something wrong is if something bad happens on their watch

02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:45.320
[Guest]: they're going to get beaten up okay like I mean and that's often a better

02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.000
[Guest]: incentive so Jishnu has sent me stories about like you know people getting

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.680
[Guest]: beaten up like you know if the community feels that the doctor has done something

02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:58.160
[Guest]: bad so in that sense that they are not formally qualified but they are embedded

02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:02.000
[Guest]: in their communities they have kind of some experience some practice and then

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.280
[Guest]: the other source by which they learn things is the informal education and

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:10.880
[Guest]: again this is not in the data set but it comes from my field conversations with

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:14.800
[Guest]: these guys is they actually get a fair bit of continuing medical education from

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.960
[Guest]: pharmacy representatives okay because the pharmacy guys the government might

02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:20.920
[Guest]: not know who these guys are but every pharmacy rep knows them because that's

02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:24.360
[Guest]: where the medicines are being pulled through so the pharmacy reps will have

02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:27.200
[Guest]: in their beat the data of all of these informal providers and they will make

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:30.320
[Guest]: sure they've gone and visited them and so that becomes like a source of now of

02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:33.800
[Guest]: course it's petrifying to think about then how much influence a pharmacy rep

02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:36.720
[Guest]: has in terms of like you know over medication because these guys then have

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:40.000
[Guest]: incentives to push more medicine so but it's just giving you some sense of the

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.440
[Guest]: lay of the land right I mean about who these guys are and that they that they

02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:48.040
[Guest]: account for the lion's share of health care in the country now then coming back

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:52.200
[Guest]: to the research about the quality right so it is one thing to say that they

02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:55.840
[Guest]: exist and this is what they look like on paper okay but what can I say about that

02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.880
[Guest]: actual quality and that is what the MP study does right because what the MP

02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:04.800
[Guest]: study does is it takes measurement very very seriously and this is a paper in

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:09.360
[Guest]: the American Economic Review and what we do is we have these standardized patients

02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:13.120
[Guest]: and we draw a random sample of villages and we make a census of all of the

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.080
[Guest]: providers and then we randomly draw samples of public and private clinics

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:20.880
[Guest]: and then we send these SPs over a period of time to go present their cases right

02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:24.280
[Guest]: so then we can observe exactly the quality of care that's happening in the

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:28.760
[Guest]: public and the private the qualified the unqualified and then just understand that

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:34.280
[Guest]: broad gamut so again this is one state it's you know about 160 villages

02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:37.060
[Guest]: actually but it's better data than we have anywhere else so it's the best we

02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:42.880
[Guest]: have right now but the key kind of big picture messages are the private guys

02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:47.240
[Guest]: know less okay because they're less qualified but they systematically work

02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:50.720
[Guest]: harder okay and now by work harder it means they're spending more time they're

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:54.220
[Guest]: asking more questions they're getting more of the items on the checklist okay

02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:58.920
[Guest]: and so when you put that picture together the overall quality of care

02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.720
[Guest]: that you get from these quacks is not different from what you get from the

02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:07.120
[Guest]: public health clinic and now this is because when you go into the PHC most of

02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:10.060
[Guest]: the time the doctor is not seeing you because the doctor is not there so even

02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:12.960
[Guest]: in the public system you're being seen by a ward boy or a compounder or

02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.080
[Guest]: somebody who is not actually formally qualified but who just happens to be

02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:20.600
[Guest]: there like you know minding the store so in that way the private guy who's less

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:24.800
[Guest]: qualified like you know is not giving you any inferior care now but going back

02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:28.720
[Guest]: to something we said in the education episode the absolute quality of care is

02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:32.760
[Guest]: abysmal right I mean so it's just like those two bears I talked about last time

02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:36.220
[Guest]: right you the private guy just has to be slightly better than the public guy

02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:39.640
[Guest]: that's why improving public is so important right because it forces the

02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:43.440
[Guest]: private guy to up his game as well so what you have today is overall the

02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:47.760
[Guest]: public system hires more qualified people but because it doesn't have its

02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.360
[Guest]: governance act together right I mean and you can't get accountability for a

02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:55.640
[Guest]: variety of reasons that the effort is really low the private guys have lower

02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:00.240
[Guest]: knowledge but much higher effort okay and so put together the composite result

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:03.720
[Guest]: of that is that the private guy is at least no worse okay slightly better but

02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:08.080
[Guest]: at least no worse and just like education right so just like my school

02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:11.120
[Guest]: voucher study we found exactly the same thing right that the private school

02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:15.760
[Guest]: teachers are much less qualified but they work much harder so the net net

02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:19.480
[Guest]: result is that the value-added is comparable but they do it at a much lower

02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:22.680
[Guest]: cost per child and that's because the salaries of the private school teachers

02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:26.600
[Guest]: are about one-fifth and so similarly here what you'll see is that the cost

02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:30.040
[Guest]: per patient in the private sector is substantially lower because most of

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:33.200
[Guest]: these guys you know they charge visas once you add all the salary costs in

02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:37.720
[Guest]: the public system and divide that by kind of the the utilization you get a

02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:41.880
[Guest]: much much higher cost per patient for comparable quality so I'll stop there

02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:45.160
[Guest]: and then come back to this other even more cool study where we then look at

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:48.600
[Guest]: the dual sample of the same doctor in his public and private practice but let

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:51.880
[Guest]: me just pause for a moment on this representative sample and get you in

02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:57.720
[Amit Varma]: there yeah like first of all as an aside again like one of the statistics that we

02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.160
[Amit Varma]: know about education is also true of healthcare I found out while reading a

02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:05.120
[Amit Varma]: chapter in these papers which is that even though people have free public

02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:09.280
[Amit Varma]: options available they still prefer to go by and large to private doctors and

02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:13.520
[Amit Varma]: that in itself is telling now I'll quickly summarize in a sort of two

02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:17.600
[Amit Varma]: separate buckets a bunch of insights that really struck me and you can tell

02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:21.360
[Amit Varma]: me where I'm making a mistake or you'd like to add something to that and one is

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.560
[Amit Varma]: the urban bucket which is what these DAS and hammer studies look at

02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:28.000
[Amit Varma]: specifically in Delhi and all of that where they kind of point out that look

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.800
[Amit Varma]: there is a stark difference between the private guys and the public guys but

02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:35.280
[Amit Varma]: there are nuances within that like number one the private guys always show

02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:39.080
[Amit Varma]: more competence and more effort but then within the private guys there are two

02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:42.840
[Amit Varma]: categories one is the MBBS guys who are actually trained and the other is the

02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:47.240
[Amit Varma]: untrained guys within the untrained guys there will be the Ayush guys who you

02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:50.560
[Amit Varma]: could argue have been trained wrongly and the apprentice type people who are

02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:54.800
[Amit Varma]: you know picking it up from a proper doctor and kind of taking that and

02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:59.200
[Amit Varma]: everywhere you find that not only does private outperform public but in

02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:03.040
[Amit Varma]: different localities you know private and public will both rise so the

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:06.520
[Amit Varma]: difference between them will be there and in poorer localities whether it is

02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:10.560
[Amit Varma]: private or public it will be much worse than in a richer locality so the

02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:15.800
[Amit Varma]: locality matters a hell of a lot now that is the urban India card the little

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:21.160
[Amit Varma]: snapshots that we got in rural India what I kind of found fascinating was how

02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:25.520
[Amit Varma]: in your paper on two India's you've described how people travel for medical

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:29.400
[Amit Varma]: care where you write quote people may visit the clinic in their village but if

02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:32.160
[Amit Varma]: they have something more serious they will go to the highway and if they have

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:35.480
[Amit Varma]: something really major they will take a bus and go to the city but people will

02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:40.240
[Amit Varma]: almost never travel from one village to another stop quote you also point out

02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:44.240
[Amit Varma]: that quote a high quality provider who is posted to a village will spend a much

02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:47.820
[Amit Varma]: smaller portion of the day seeing patients compared to a provider in a

02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:51.560
[Amit Varma]: district hospital stop quote and then you make a point that you also made in

02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:55.280
[Amit Varma]: the education episode in that context that sometimes better roads are more

02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:59.160
[Amit Varma]: useful than more rural clinics that you want to connect a patient with a

02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:02.040
[Amit Varma]: healthcare and if you can't take Mohammed to the mountain you get the

02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:06.680
[Amit Varma]: mountain to him you know so if you can't provide that excellent medical service

02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:10.480
[Amit Varma]: at his village if you just provide better roads better maybe mobile

02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.480
[Amit Varma]: connectivity or whatever then he can access that better care but here I have

02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:19.960
[Amit Varma]: a question like the vast majority of the care that is kind of being accessed is

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:23.320
[Amit Varma]: private here and you've pointed out that you know in your study you find that

02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:28.280
[Amit Varma]: there are 3.2 doctors per village and only 2.8 percent of them have an MBBS

02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:32.080
[Amit Varma]: right and while there is variation between states the state of affairs is

02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:37.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of ubiquitous so now when I connect this with how you describe the travel

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.800
[Amit Varma]: that if it's something immediate like if I have diarrhea or a cold I'll go to the

02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:43.680
[Amit Varma]: local guy and if it's something a little more serious I'll go to the highway and

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.480
[Amit Varma]: if it's something really really serious I'll take a bus to the nearby town if

02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:53.040
[Amit Varma]: it's possible now what this therefore would imply is that even if the so-called

02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:57.840
[Amit Varma]: doctor is not that trained doesn't have a degree the point is that you know a

02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:01.400
[Amit Varma]: common cold gets better on its own it's a reversion to the mean kind of thing

02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:04.960
[Amit Varma]: many of these common things that they would go for like even diarrhea will

02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:08.560
[Amit Varma]: kind of get better and it'll almost be folk wisdom that have you know salt in

02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:13.360
[Amit Varma]: water and all of that by now so you know is that's what playing out there that

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.240
[Amit Varma]: they're going out to a private doctor in a situation where it's not serious to

02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:21.400
[Amit Varma]: begin with and it doesn't really matter if the doctor is good or not I mean if

02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:26.160
[Amit Varma]: you have 3.2 per village and only 2.8 per have MBBS they obviously can't treat

02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:30.480
[Amit Varma]: anything serious for the serious stuff you're going elsewhere anyway so it's

02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:34.920
[Amit Varma]: almost like placebo doctors I mean the reason a lot of quackery appears to work

02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:39.080
[Amit Varma]: to people and I have written frequently on this in various places the reason a

02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:42.400
[Amit Varma]: lot of quackery appears to work is two reasons one is of course a placebo

02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:46.520
[Amit Varma]: effect which is far more powerful than we realize which is why every proper

02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:51.360
[Amit Varma]: piece of medicine has to pass a double blind placebo test and by the way no

02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:55.240
[Amit Varma]: homeopathic medication has ever passed something like that and the other reason

02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:59.160
[Amit Varma]: is reversion to the mean in the sense that many diseases just happen and get

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.480
[Amit Varma]: better on its own including in the vast majority of cases even COVID where you

02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:06.440
[Amit Varma]: will get fever for a week or you'll be asymptomatic and it will just get better

02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:10.680
[Amit Varma]: and if at the peak of your symptoms you take some medicine you will ascribe it

02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:14.920
[Amit Varma]: to that correlation and causation and you will imagine that's what is causing

02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:19.520
[Amit Varma]: the problem so is this part of the situation that the fact is at one level

02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:23.560
[Amit Varma]: I get it that Indian Medical Association now keeps protesting that there are so

02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:26.880
[Amit Varma]: many quacks now at one level I get the argument that listen the state is in

02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:30.240
[Amit Varma]: there proper doctors aren't there but these are people who might be able to

02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:33.960
[Amit Varma]: help in some way so let's not demonize them I get that argument but at the same

02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:36.880
[Amit Varma]: time could these just be placebo doctors in the sense they're not doctors at all

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:40.320
[Amit Varma]: and these are not you know you feel good that you're going to someone and he's

02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:44.080
[Guest]: giving you medicine but you were gonna get better anyway I don't know the full

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:47.160
[Guest]: answer to that question right because we didn't do a study on placebos now what I

02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:52.500
[Guest]: can say is that because we are codifying the quality of treatment right because

02:19:52.500 --> 02:19:56.640
[Guest]: in these SP cases we know right we know the underlying ailment and see you're

02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:00.240
[Guest]: absolutely right that in the majority of the case you actually don't need

02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:04.760
[Guest]: medication right but the truth is the reason you want the doctor is not for

02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:09.120
[Guest]: your average case but to be able to say are you in that 5% of cases where you

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:14.280
[Guest]: actually need the attention right so in fact the SP case that we have is a case

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:19.720
[Guest]: where people the patient walks in and says I have had some pain in my chest

02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:24.600
[Guest]: okay and now this could be anything from a heart attack on the extreme or it

02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:27.600
[Guest]: could just be that I had a slight sprain and that I slept in the wrong posture

02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:31.240
[Guest]: and like 9 times out of 10 it'll turn out to be completely benign correct but

02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:36.040
[Guest]: the reason you go to the doctor is not to get the treatment but to kind of get

02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:39.560
[Guest]: the pathway of questioning to say is there so which is why the right

02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:42.760
[Guest]: questions you ask are you know what is the nature of the pain is that a

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:47.240
[Guest]: throbbing pain is a vibrating pain like it is a repulsating pain right so the

02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:52.440
[Guest]: point of the doctor is not to cure you but to then identify whether you need

02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:56.960
[Guest]: referral to something more right I mean so the which is why the cases are

02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:01.320
[Guest]: designed you know precisely right I mean to reflect symptoms that I think in one

02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:04.600
[Guest]: of the cases it's like I have a hard time breathing okay so now it could be

02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:08.040
[Guest]: asthma which needs training or it could be just an allergy or it could be you

02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:11.760
[Guest]: know some short-term adverse reaction to something so again the cases are

02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:16.440
[Guest]: designed in a way as to be cases where you can measure both omission and

02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:21.120
[Guest]: commission the bottom line is coming back to the absolute quality of care in

02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:25.840
[Guest]: our data right if you say what fraction of these providers correctly give you

02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:30.720
[Guest]: the correct treatment it is abysmally low okay it is only about 15% in the

02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:33.520
[Guest]: public sector and about 22% in the private so that's why I said the private

02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:37.720
[Guest]: is better it's 50% better but in absolute levels it's still abysmally low

02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:41.480
[Guest]: okay now but these guys are mostly unqualified but where it gets very

02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:45.240
[Guest]: interesting if you look at public versus private is because the problem here is

02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:48.120
[Guest]: the qualifications of these guys are different right so if you want to really

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:52.560
[Guest]: isolate the effect of private sector incentives so the really cool part of

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:56.240
[Guest]: the study is then we found the same doctors right so the same guy in his

02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:59.960
[Guest]: public practice and private practice so now the knowledge is constant and what

02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:03.760
[Guest]: we did it over a period of time he got the same case in both his public and

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:06.000
[Guest]: private practice obviously with different actors like you know it's not

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.440
[Guest]: Amit going to both the practices like you know I mean but the same case and

02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:13.960
[Guest]: what you saw was that the quality of care was better in the private practice

02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:18.320
[Guest]: on every measure right so there is higher effort there is more likely to be

02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:21.480
[Guest]: a correct treatment you know there's less likely to be unnecessary treatment

02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:25.880
[Guest]: so in every way that there is more effort being put in okay so to answer

02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:30.680
[Guest]: your question about the larger gamut of rural health care and saying how much of

02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:34.960
[Guest]: this is just placebo I think you know my view on this is that yes only about 15

02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:38.000
[Guest]: to 20 percent of the cases actually got it correct now does that mean the

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.120
[Guest]: remaining 80 percent are placebo possibly no because a lot of what they

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:45.440
[Guest]: are giving is also what we call palliative relief right like I mean so

02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:49.600
[Guest]: it may not cure your underlying symptom but it is still giving you some utility

02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:54.160
[Guest]: in terms of you know making you able to go back to work okay now the question of

02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:58.000
[Guest]: course is that steroid or whatever thing they're giving you as a painkiller what

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:02.040
[Guest]: long-term cost is it coming at and then it goes into this very complicated issue

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:06.560
[Guest]: of what is the patient's discount rate right so if this is a patient who says I

02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:10.000
[Guest]: need to get better today because if I don't work I don't have food to put on

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.960
[Guest]: the table then can you really blame the doctor or the patient like you know I

02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:17.120
[Guest]: mean for over medicating on the palliative stuff if that's what allows

02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:19.900
[Guest]: the patient to get back to work okay so I think that's what makes this so

02:23:19.900 --> 02:23:23.480
[Guest]: difficult now maybe I'll pause here and then we can come back and talk maybe we

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:27.160
[Guest]: should switch to talking about policy right because I think it's very very

02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:29.920
[Guest]: very difficult I think Ajay's view on this was we just don't even know enough

02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:32.120
[Guest]: that we just need to spend time collecting data like you know I have

02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:36.440
[Guest]: some views at least on principles of how I would structure policy based on kind

02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:39.880
[Guest]: of the work in the evidence we have and you know maybe we should switch to that

02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:44.120
[Guest]: and that way we can you know bring all these facts together to say because right

02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:49.360
[Guest]: now it almost feels like I've given you this you know broad smorgasbord of facts

02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:53.360
[Guest]: but organizing this into saying how do we take this understanding into thinking

02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:56.240
[Guest]: about policy is then something that I need to spend some time on you know

02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:00.680
[Amit Varma]: which we can do next so a couple of things I want to double-click into and

02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:03.600
[Amit Varma]: this might take us into the realm of policy but even if it doesn't we'll talk

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.440
[Amit Varma]: about policy anyway after this and here are the two things I want to double

02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:09.880
[Amit Varma]: click into one is talking about public incentives and the other is private

02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:14.920
[Amit Varma]: competence and when we speak about the public health system right we've got the

02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:19.640
[Amit Varma]: five-tier system we've notionally got all these doctors in every village in

02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:23.760
[Amit Varma]: every town in every district whatever but there is high absenteeism right now

02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:27.000
[Amit Varma]: the classical explanation for why private always performs better than

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.460
[Amit Varma]: public is incentives because in public you've got a tenured job there's no

02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:34.520
[Amit Varma]: accountability and you know those are your incentives and that's how it

02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:40.960
[Amit Varma]: functions so first question what are the ways to improve these incentives like

02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:44.640
[Amit Varma]: once we take it for grant because you know the public reflects is there

02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.200
[Amit Varma]: repeatedly like an education they will ignore the free option and they'll go to

02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:52.360
[Amit Varma]: a paid private guy clearly something is seriously wrong now if we accept that

02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:56.360
[Amit Varma]: the market can't take care of everything in something like health care then in

02:24:56.360 --> 02:25:00.440
[Amit Varma]: that case we have to focus on this and we have to figure out better incentives

02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:03.800
[Amit Varma]: one way like we discussed is more local government but that isn't going to

02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:07.440
[Amit Varma]: happen anytime soon and that in any case we will discuss in our episode on

02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:13.120
[Amit Varma]: federalism so what are the sort of ways of improving these public incentives for

02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:18.000
[Guest]: public health care workers yeah so this is a great question and maybe I will

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:21.320
[Guest]: park it for the policy piece but let me say one other important thing right that

02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:25.920
[Guest]: what is really interesting about why we call the paper to India's is like if you

02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:28.760
[Guest]: look and say Tamil Nadu Kerala and some of the better performing states it's

02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:33.440
[Guest]: that not only do they deliver better care but they also deliver it at a much

02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:36.920
[Guest]: lower cost per patient okay so how are they achieving higher quality and lower

02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:41.280
[Guest]: cost it's because the utilization of the doctor is higher okay because the

02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:44.680
[Guest]: biggest cost in the system is your doctor's salary right but if people have

02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:48.440
[Guest]: confidence in the public system that everybody is coming right then your cost

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:52.240
[Guest]: per patient is actually lower and the equilibrium has unraveled where you know

02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.920
[Guest]: not only are they not that good but if you don't know if they are there you're

02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:57.520
[Guest]: not even going to show up okay so the patient doesn't go and then you kind of

02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:00.720
[Guest]: the whole thing unravels into a low level equilibrium right so I think it

02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:04.300
[Guest]: just highlights the broader value of investing in public systems okay now

02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:08.080
[Guest]: this is spoken from as somebody who has documented that the private incentives

02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:12.600
[Guest]: do better but my overall view in terms of architecting systems of service

02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:16.760
[Guest]: delivery is that the public and private both have their weaknesses they have

02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:22.320
[Guest]: different pathologies right so at one level a public provider should be able

02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:26.560
[Guest]: to do better why because there is no profit motive and therefore you don't

02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.080
[Guest]: have to kind of charge more to make the fat cat salaries of your corporate

02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:33.360
[Guest]: executives who are running the private firms at another level they have scale

02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:36.760
[Guest]: in procurement okay so it gives you volume discounts whether it's on your

02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.440
[Guest]: medication or your supplies you have scale in terms of cost of capital if you

02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:44.840
[Guest]: need to borrow for infrastructure and you have the the natural scale that

02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:48.280
[Guest]: comes from being so combination of lack of profit motive and combination of

02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.980
[Guest]: economies of scale all else being equal should make the public a potentially

02:26:52.980 --> 02:26:57.040
[Guest]: better provider right like of value for money in than the private guy but the

02:26:57.040 --> 02:26:59.920
[Guest]: elephant in the room of course is incentives right so what the private guy

02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:03.960
[Guest]: has is much better incentives right so essentially he doesn't get paid if he

02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:08.000
[Guest]: doesn't show up right I mean whereas the the public guy once you have the salary

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.560
[Guest]: so you know one very interesting way of thinking about public versus private in

02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:16.360
[Guest]: the covert context is like you know is the public unions fight to stay shut the

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:20.920
[Guest]: private guys fight to open right mean and that itself is a very telling this

02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:24.080
[Guest]: thing about you know the distinction of the incentives because these you only

02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:29.680
[Guest]: get paid right if you're there okay so now and which is why I think the public

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:33.880
[Guest]: versus private debate itself is so different and should be different in

02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.920
[Guest]: different parts of the way okay so I think if you and part of the nuance in

02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:41.220
[Guest]: that AR paper right where we kind of allude to the fact that can arrow was

02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:44.360
[Guest]: not fully right it's always a dangerous proposition to start a paper saying that

02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:48.520
[Guest]: can arrow was wrong so you know because like the most brilliant economists of

02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:52.120
[Guest]: the 20th century but you know the caveat is not that he's wrong but that he was

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:55.600
[Guest]: right only in the setting he had seen like you know he had not actually seen

02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:59.320
[Guest]: what the Wild West of kind of health care in rural India looks like right so

02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:03.200
[Guest]: in fact as an aside sometimes it's interesting right how some of the great

02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:07.480
[Guest]: ideas and modern applied microeconomics that won Nobel Prizes like you know for

02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:11.280
[Guest]: people like Stiglitz and Akerlof actually came when they spent a year in

02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:14.560
[Guest]: developing countries right so Joe Stiglitz spent a year in Kenya Akerlof

02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:18.720
[Guest]: wrote his lemons paper from his time in India when you know it's like studying

02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:22.280
[Guest]: development economics is a little bit like studying pathology in medicine so

02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.560
[Guest]: pathology is you look at the dead patient and saying what did not work

02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:28.920
[Guest]: right so when something is working you don't see how beautiful it is that all

02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:31.840
[Guest]: parts of the system are working right so it's only when something is

02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:34.720
[Guest]: dysfunctional that you then go and understand the importance of things you

02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:38.840
[Guest]: took for granted institutionally right I mean and so similarly for kind of

02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:43.680
[Guest]: Western educated economists who kind of model the world in a certain way you

02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:46.400
[Guest]: know you put them in a developing country where these kind of markets

02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:49.320
[Guest]: don't exist and then you kind of say oh my god wait like you know there is all

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:52.320
[Guest]: of these problems of asymmetric information and then they kind of

02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:55.600
[Guest]: embellish their models for this you know work that then went and won a Nobel

02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:58.760
[Guest]: Prize but anyway so maybe my point here is if Arrow had spent time in rural India

02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:01.160
[Guest]: like you know he would have modified like you know some of his his his

02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:05.120
[Guest]: theorems as well but what we are basically showing we have this theoretical

02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:09.000
[Guest]: model in that AR paper right where we say that listen market incentives are

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:14.040
[Guest]: both good and bad okay because what we see in the pricing equation is that the

02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:19.200
[Guest]: price a doctor charges is correlated with observable measures of effort right

02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:23.440
[Guest]: so the price is higher if I spend more time the price is higher if I do more

02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:26.560
[Guest]: checklist items and the price is higher if I give you more medication okay

02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:30.080
[Guest]: because those are things that the patient can see now what is really

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:34.000
[Guest]: ironic is that there is no price premium for giving the correct treatment because

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.920
[Guest]: the patient doesn't know the treatment is correct okay but unconditionally you

02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:40.880
[Guest]: are paid more if you give the correct treatment because when you give more

02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:43.720
[Guest]: medicines you are mechanically more likely to also give a correct treatment

02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:46.360
[Guest]: okay so it's like you know you throw the kitchen sink at it and something will

02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:50.800
[Guest]: stick okay so but the subtle point is this that doctor incentives of say

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:55.160
[Guest]: private incentives are good because it gives you incentives to work harder for

02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:59.200
[Guest]: the patient to come back to you but it also gives you negative incentives for

02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:02.400
[Guest]: over prescribing right I mean and so the question is how do you find the right

02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:07.160
[Guest]: balance between having enough incentives for effort but not enough incentives for

02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:10.120
[Guest]: overtreatment right and that's the delicate balance we're trying to find

02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:15.320
[Guest]: now the traditional modern Western medicine approach for this is you train

02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:19.160
[Guest]: a medical ethics you know you try to train with say Hippocratic Oath and you

02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:23.160
[Guest]: kind of have a group of peers and you have a strong liability regime that says

02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:26.720
[Guest]: if you're found to have violated what is kind of standard practice you so there

02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:31.840
[Guest]: are other institutional ways of kind of checking this right but the general

02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:36.440
[Guest]: sense in the US is that the better working health systems are ones that

02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:40.080
[Guest]: don't give doctors too much incentives but you want to weaken their incentives

02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:44.000
[Guest]: and focus more on kind of intrinsic motivation of quality of care so if you

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.160
[Guest]: look at say a Mayo Clinic where the doctors are paid on a flat salary with

02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:51.480
[Guest]: not that much kind of you know bonuses based on procedures the sense is that

02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:54.600
[Guest]: you get better care there what Ajay was saying what a CMC Velo does like you

02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:59.160
[Guest]: know I mean so at the high end of kind of the healthcare system the best

02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:04.760
[Guest]: systems are where you have well-trained doctors who have a strong sense of

02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:09.360
[Guest]: ethics and who are practicing in a community of peers whereby you kind of

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:13.800
[Guest]: reinforce good practice because of the norms that are built around you okay now

02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:17.720
[Guest]: the problem is like you know when you come to India we are at the opposite end

02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:22.040
[Guest]: of that right which is that the effort in the public sector is so low that the

02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:25.440
[Guest]: marginal incentives so here's what happens right when I increase your

02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:28.360
[Guest]: incentives I'm increasing incentives for diagnostic effort but I'm also

02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:32.360
[Guest]: increasing incentives for overtreatment right but the returns to that diagnostic

02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:36.040
[Guest]: effort is diminishing in how much time I'm spending right so in the US if my

02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:39.920
[Guest]: default interaction is 20 minutes with the patient then the marginal returns to

02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:42.840
[Guest]: more diagnostic effort is not that high but in India if it's two minutes right

02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:46.480
[Guest]: then the marginal return to that extra diagnostic effort is high so part of

02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:49.720
[Guest]: what we argue in that model is there's a crossing property that if you're at a

02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:53.720
[Guest]: very low level of baseline effort then having more incentives is actually

02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:57.360
[Guest]: better because those benefits outweigh the costs right I mean whereas if you

02:31:57.360 --> 02:32:01.560
[Guest]: are at a point where the baseline effort is already high now putting incentives

02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:05.520
[Guest]: backfires because now I'm incentivizing overtreatment okay so it just kind of

02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:08.960
[Guest]: highlights how difficult these issues are but coming back to the Indian

02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:11.720
[Guest]: setting and policy and maybe we'll take a short break and come back is that

02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:17.200
[Guest]: that architecting systems where so that you have some incentives but not too

02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:21.280
[Guest]: much is kind of what is the really delicate balance of this and hopefully

02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:25.800
[Guest]: we can talk I'll I'll talk through some ideas for that when we get there and and

02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:29.080
[Amit Varma]: my other sort of double-click question before we get there one of course was

02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:32.880
[Amit Varma]: about incentives in the public sector but the other is about the competence of

02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:35.360
[Amit Varma]: the private sector in the sense you pointed out that look most people are

02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:39.240
[Amit Varma]: going to private providers a very small percentage of these are properly trained

02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:43.320
[Amit Varma]: MBBS guys and even a large percentage of the MBBS guys aren't particularly

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:47.040
[Amit Varma]: competent when it comes to all these checklist vignettes and all that so

02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:50.080
[Amit Varma]: then the question is how do we solve for this because like Ajay pointed out in

02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:53.880
[Amit Varma]: his episode he used a telling phrase that look it's expensive to manufacture

02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:57.800
[Amit Varma]: a doctor which is true and there are supply constraints like the Indian

02:32:57.800 --> 02:33:01.800
[Amit Varma]: Medical Council had run an episode on this once you know the group of doctors

02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:05.080
[Amit Varma]: and they act like they kind of cartelize the whole thing there they you know

02:33:05.080 --> 02:33:09.040
[Amit Varma]: restrict the supply of doctors and that's a separate problem and assume for

02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:12.280
[Amit Varma]: a moment that that that is just there it is how it is it is expensive to

02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:16.080
[Amit Varma]: manufacture a doctor so can something like AI play a part in this like Ajay

02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:20.400
[Amit Varma]: spoke about AI plus nurse now that seems an interesting formulation to me because

02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:24.320
[Amit Varma]: one AI has come a long way like Eric Topol has this great book called deep

02:33:24.320 --> 02:33:28.600
[Amit Varma]: medicine for example about how AI and doctors can work together and two when I

02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:32.160
[Amit Varma]: think of this vignetting for example you you have a chest pain or you have a

02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:35.360
[Amit Varma]: diarrhea and you go to a doctor and there's a checklist now a checklist can

02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:40.040
[Amit Varma]: easily be encoded in an app where you know it doesn't have diagnostic

02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:43.920
[Amit Varma]: authority or whatever but you can go through the checklist and at the end of

02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:47.000
[Amit Varma]: it you can say okay I don't need to go to a doc I'll just drink some salt water

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:50.640
[Amit Varma]: and I'll see if I'm better tomorrow or it's not pulsating so I don't really

02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:54.000
[Amit Varma]: need to worry I probably slept in the wrong position or whatever I'm just

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:00.240
[Amit Varma]: thinking aloud I mean that's this is by no means a medical this thing so you

02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:05.000
[Amit Varma]: know can technology in a sense save us not as you know not in terms of

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.960
[Amit Varma]: replacing doctors but maybe as a tool to doctors maybe as a tool for these

02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:13.880
[Amit Varma]: informal doctors where you know it serve with them. No absolutely and you know I think the

02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:18.200
[Guest]: most of the policy solutions I'll talk about will have a technology layer right

02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:22.760
[Guest]: and I think one way to think about this is that technology in any sector okay

02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:25.640
[Guest]: whether it's education whether it's health and you know other examples

02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:30.160
[Guest]: technology is a force multiplier but again for the technology to be effective

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:34.640
[Guest]: you need to first understand what the binding constraint is and then make sure

02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:38.000
[Guest]: the technology is targeting that binding constraint and one of the things we did

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.600
[Guest]: not talk about in our education episode is we didn't talk about education

02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:44.800
[Guest]: technology right I mean and so since I haven't done research on technology in

02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:47.800
[Guest]: health but I have done research on technology in education let me give you

02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:51.920
[Guest]: this quick analogy right which is in theory the technology can do amazing

02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:55.520
[Guest]: things okay it can help give you high quality content with the best professors

02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:59.160
[Guest]: for everybody it can help you know make the material more interactive more

02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:03.000
[Guest]: engaging it can customize the learning it can shorten the feedback loop it can

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.200
[Guest]: do all of these great things okay so and therefore you have a lot of tech

02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:10.160
[Guest]: evangelism in education till you go look at the data if you go look at the actual

02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:13.360
[Guest]: RCT evidence on technology in education you'll find that the results are all

02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:16.440
[Guest]: over the place okay there are cases where the impacts on learning are

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.560
[Guest]: negative there are cases where there are zero and there are cases where it is

02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:23.080
[Guest]: positive right so you know and it is negative in cases where people are

02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:25.600
[Guest]: blindly giving computers to teenagers and who are then spending a lot more

02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:29.840
[Guest]: time playing games you know it's neutral in cases where I just give you a laptop

02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:35.180
[Guest]: okay and it is positive when I take the effort to integrate pedagogy with the

02:35:35.180 --> 02:35:38.680
[Guest]: technology right so I think my quick answer to this is technology can be a

02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:42.720
[Guest]: huge force multiplier but there are two or three key caveats one is kind of

02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:46.880
[Guest]: making sure that it is designed to address the binding constraints and

02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:51.920
[Guest]: making sure that we are designing the incentives for the innovation to solve

02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:55.760
[Guest]: at scale for populations without purchasing power right because the

02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:59.780
[Guest]: problem is if you look at innovation innovation is typical and this is true

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:03.560
[Guest]: in edtech as well right that innovation is driven at the right tail of the

02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:06.920
[Guest]: distribution where there is the paying customer that is what you really want is

02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.360
[Guest]: to direct that innovation like you know at the bottom of the pyramid and that

02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:14.440
[Guest]: that's where again you need the government to kind of play a little bit

02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:18.160
[Guest]: of an enabling role and maybe that's a good place to start right like you know

02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:22.960
[Guest]: when we get into the detailed discussion on policy so let's talk about policy now

02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:27.600
[Amit Varma]: you know we know the problems I we know some of the problems we in fact we think

02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:31.540
[Amit Varma]: we know the problems and then they like you said is very vexatious where do we

02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:37.680
[Amit Varma]: begin to think in terms of fixing these problems you know so let me start first

02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:43.320
[Guest]: with some core principles of public finance right which is so Indian health

02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:48.160
[Guest]: expenditure is overall health expenditure is comparable to other say

02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.060
[Guest]: South Asian countries but public health expenditure is lower okay so there's a

02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:55.320
[Guest]: lot more out-of-pocket spending so I think there's definitely room for

02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:00.360
[Guest]: increase in public spending on health now but it is incredibly important to

02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.840
[Guest]: think about the cost-effectiveness of that spending because again a big part

02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:08.000
[Guest]: of the research is how much variation there is in different ways of spending

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.960
[Guest]: that money right so first let's start with the first principles of public

02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:15.720
[Guest]: finance of saying if I were to have a marginal increase in health expenditure

02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:20.240
[Guest]: where should that go okay and where it should first and foremost go are in the

02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:23.840
[Guest]: public goods right mean and that is public health preventive health that

02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.640
[Guest]: works at a population level and again as I said this but this is so important

02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:31.040
[Guest]: it's worth reinforcing again and again and again right I mean that you know

02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:35.200
[Guest]: oxygen cylinders and ventilators are not public health right I mean so the mind

02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:39.360
[Guest]: gets concentrated on the immediate life-saving device and the constraint

02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:43.960
[Guest]: okay but that is still essentially a private good that provides health care

02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:48.520
[Guest]: to one person okay and it is rival it is excludable okay now what is public

02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:51.920
[Guest]: health say in the COVID context public health would be things like and I'll

02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:55.520
[Guest]: talk specifically about COVID later would be things like universal masking

02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:58.400
[Guest]: right that can mean where there are public goods and externalities and we'll

02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:02.560
[Guest]: talk about that but even more basically things like air pollution okay so my

02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:06.880
[Guest]: first and almost counterintuitive message on health policy is that

02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:11.760
[Guest]: sometimes the most effective return on investments may lie completely outside

02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:15.400
[Guest]: the health department okay so when we think about health policy we think about

02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:19.160
[Guest]: what is the Ministry of Health do but the Ministry of Health basically again

02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:22.480
[Guest]: like I just said thinks of itself mainly as a PSU running the public health care

02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:25.760
[Guest]: system okay but that is not health that is not well-being that's not quality of

02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:29.440
[Guest]: life okay so for example I would say the single most important thing we could do

02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:32.760
[Guest]: for population health is actually fix air pollution in North India okay and so

02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:37.360
[Guest]: the calculations on this just show that the costs are of the orders of you know

02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:41.200
[Guest]: just several hundreds of billions of dollars right I mean and whether it's

02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:44.800
[Guest]: the life expectancy whether it's the health is adjusted life expectancy the

02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:51.120
[Guest]: returns on fixing that are huge now the problem is that we have boxed our

02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:56.480
[Guest]: environmental discourse in two ways okay one it has been framed as a trade-off

02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.400
[Guest]: between kind of industrialization and economic activity versus environmental

02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.740
[Guest]: regulation okay so the greens are essentially pitched as presented as

02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:08.400
[Guest]: being anti growth okay and so somehow there is this trade-off and then you

02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:10.920
[Guest]: know and there's also obviously virtue signaling sometimes from the

02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:14.600
[Guest]: environmental folks and so that's one kind of trap we get stuck in okay of

02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:18.440
[Guest]: green versus growth okay which is mistake number one second mistake we

02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:22.000
[Guest]: make is we kind of get caught in the politics of kind of global climate

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.320
[Guest]: change negotiations right I mean where we say that listen the West has done its

02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:29.360
[Guest]: and has polluted and so now like you know we need our space to pollute okay

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:33.160
[Guest]: like you know for us to grow but you know but that is like cutting your nose

02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:37.080
[Guest]: to spite your face because forget the global externalities right just the

02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:41.600
[Guest]: domestic health externalities alone like you know make this a first-order crisis

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:45.440
[Guest]: that you want to work on right so now and that brings me back to why I

02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:50.120
[Guest]: actually think the high petrol taxes are a good thing okay and that's because see

02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:54.640
[Guest]: holding as a government when you need to raise revenue any government needs

02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:58.600
[Guest]: revenue for its core operations right now so what is public finance 101 again

02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:02.000
[Guest]: it's very obvious but we don't really think about it this way because most

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.880
[Guest]: governments in the revenue department thinks about their target for how much

02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.000
[Guest]: revenue I'm raising okay but there is a separate point of not quantity of

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.760
[Guest]: revenue but quality of revenue right what is the quality of your revenue and

02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:17.920
[Guest]: there the public finance 101 is to say that you want to tax bags and not goods

02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.440
[Guest]: correct so if I tax labor supply I am reducing your incentives to work and

02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:27.520
[Guest]: that is bad okay but if I tax alcohol or if I tax pollution right mean then I'm

02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:32.360
[Guest]: raising my revenue but I'm also getting the price right or closer to what is

02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:36.760
[Guest]: socially optimal okay so just like those first principles right now of course you

02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:40.800
[Guest]: could argue that with say high petrol taxes there is inflationary pressures

02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:44.720
[Guest]: across the economy and all of this kind of stuff but overall right like I mean

02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:48.600
[Guest]: my meta view is given that the government has certain revenue requiring

02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:52.760
[Guest]: you know revenue needs that you're much better off right like I mean taxing

02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:55.920
[Guest]: carbon right mean through the form of high gasoline taxes now it's a separate

02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:00.160
[Guest]: matter that that is being used to hide and cover a bunch of other fiscal

02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:06.240
[Guest]: mismanagement but my preferred way of communicating the health value of the

02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.160
[Guest]: petrol taxes would be to say that you justify this and saying we are doing

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:13.520
[Guest]: this because we're going to take these taxes and reinvest in public transport

02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:17.320
[Guest]: reinvest in you know public health so one of the chapters in the whole book is

02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:20.680
[Guest]: on the revenue side of public finance right so I think one of the other

02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:25.200
[Guest]: problems of state capacity we have in India is that the fiscal compact between

02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.840
[Guest]: the state and the citizen is broken okay which is because the taxpaying classes

02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:33.640
[Guest]: have completely seceded from being recipients of services you kind of see

02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:36.920
[Guest]: that the tax is going into this black hole called the government that wastes

02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:40.560
[Guest]: all your money which means that's evasion almost becomes all you know

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:44.120
[Guest]: quasi justified in the evasion evading classes saying area like you know anyway

02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:47.480
[Guest]: the government is going to waste this money okay so part of state capacity is

02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:51.360
[Guest]: also reestablishing the fiscal compact right mean that as citizens when you pay

02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:54.800
[Guest]: taxes you can expect a certain amount of public goods and services and this takes

02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:58.160
[Guest]: me back to urban right so one of the I talk much more about property taxes and

02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.080
[Guest]: why I think we need more decentralization property taxes is it

02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:05.360
[Guest]: allows you to build a better connection in the taxpayers mind between the taxes

02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:08.600
[Guest]: that are being paid in the services that are being received as opposed to taxes

02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:11.560
[Guest]: going into this black hole called the government right so if you did the same

02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:15.040
[Guest]: thing with the carbon taxes and saying yes I am charging this for petrol but

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:18.480
[Guest]: there is a reason and that's because here are all the environmental costs

02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:21.240
[Guest]: here at all the congestion costs and we are going to take this money and they're

02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:25.040
[Guest]: going to you know I think government of Delhi got pilloried a little bit for

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:28.560
[Guest]: saying like you know free bus tickets for women or something but you know you

02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:32.480
[Guest]: know it subsidizing mass public transit is actually a wonderful thing like you

02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:36.120
[Guest]: know because you're also cross subsidizing that from the car owning class so they

02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:40.480
[Guest]: might cry you know from the rooftops but that is good policy it's good policy to

02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:44.480
[Guest]: increase the cost of carbon like you mean and use that for you know higher

02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:49.240
[Guest]: density more efficient mass transport and if you were able to make that ring

02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:52.360
[Guest]: fencing so that the taxpayer understands that I think that's actually a good

02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:57.080
[Guest]: policy okay so that's you know just one aside on that now the other places where

02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:00.480
[Guest]: the highest returns to public spending may happen outside the health ministry

02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:03.600
[Guest]: we already talked about this is in the context of infrastructure like you know

02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:07.920
[Guest]: so Rhodes was one piece but a broadband is another okay so then coming back to

02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:12.440
[Guest]: how do you get quality of care to remote areas right because the problem today we

02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:16.120
[Guest]: talk about doctor absence but frankly you know I remember presenting this

02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:19.320
[Guest]: doctor absence paper in 2004 some at the World Bank and I think somebody from

02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:22.760
[Guest]: Russia had this very insightful comment when he said you know even Stalin could

02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:25.840
[Guest]: not get his doctors to go to remote areas okay like you know now maybe the

02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:29.800
[Guest]: Tamil Nadu Stalin will succeed because it's you know it's different but you

02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:33.040
[Guest]: know even the Russian Stalin could not get doctors in remote rural areas

02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:36.600
[Guest]: because you know they're just they're too educated to want to live in the rural

02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:41.880
[Guest]: areas and the utilization is too low okay so one of the ways technology or

02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:45.440
[Guest]: broadband or these things can help is them leveraging that kind of higher

02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:50.240
[Guest]: qualified doctor to be able to cater to larger populations so now the question

02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:53.080
[Guest]: is when we look at the infrastructure budget the health ministry is not even

02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:57.640
[Guest]: thinking about this right so at the very least what I would like is to a finance

02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:00.800
[Guest]: department is thinking about these allocations find a way to quantify say

02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:04.360
[Guest]: the health benefits or something like this and you know and therefore put

02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:07.280
[Guest]: correspondingly more money in some of those broader public goods that will

02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:10.720
[Guest]: have higher return so that's one principle okay a public goods now the

02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:13.520
[Guest]: other piece which I'll then come to is public health preventive health primary

02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:17.440
[Guest]: care and I'll come to that in a moment but I'll pause and let you come in no I

02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:20.720
[Amit Varma]: will just sort of express my disagreement about the petrol thing

02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:24.280
[Amit Varma]: because number of reasons number one even this government I hope they don't

02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:27.120
[Amit Varma]: get the idea from listening to this podcast but even this government hasn't

02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:32.120
[Amit Varma]: presented it as a syntax or a carbon tax or as equivalent to oh we are taxing

02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:36.200
[Amit Varma]: alcohol so the guy won't go and beat up his wife secondly I think you think of

02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:39.280
[Amit Varma]: it only as something that emits carbon and pollutes the air and is bad for

02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.760
[Amit Varma]: health is a problem because I think the positive externalities are far greater

02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:47.480
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that I don't see how you can argue for building roads at one end

02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:51.920
[Amit Varma]: and at the same time for taxing petrol more at the other I think you should

02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:57.000
[Amit Varma]: build roads and not tax petrol or keep the taxes as low as possible for the

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:02.160
[Amit Varma]: same damn reason because people getting around becomes you know so much easier

02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:05.520
[Amit Varma]: and that's so much better for the economy that's so much better for

02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:10.760
[Guest]: everybody's overall well you build the roads and kind of you subsidize the mass

02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:13.560
[Guest]: transit right like you know so you do the buses and not the cars you see

02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:17.520
[Guest]: that's the basic point so it's not so there is still higher density transport

02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:21.320
[Guest]: right all else being equal higher density is going to sure but my point is

02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:26.080
[Amit Varma]: that after you fix that public transit then you do whatever when people are

02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:31.360
[Amit Varma]: using that see what is happening here is that the state is failing in all these

02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:35.320
[Amit Varma]: ways and then it is and this is a common story in India the state will fail

02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:39.280
[Amit Varma]: completely and it will tell private guys you also can't do and this seems similar

02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:42.000
[Amit Varma]: to that we don't have that public transit which brings me to my other

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.000
[Amit Varma]: objection where you speak about how it's a good idea if you tax carbon because

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.560
[Amit Varma]: then you can reinvest some money in public transport and this and that and

02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:54.240
[Amit Varma]: all of that but no yeah the money is going into statues and Central Vista and

02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:57.560
[Guest]: all of these other things but you can't have it both ways right you can't say I

02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:01.440
[Guest]: want state capacity and you can't so I think but this is the challenge right so

02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:04.800
[Guest]: there's the public choice view that says listen like politicians are venal and

02:46:04.800 --> 02:46:07.240
[Guest]: they're gonna take our tax money and they essentially kind of do their vanity

02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:10.360
[Guest]: projects in which case you should shrink the state and just kind of get away you

02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:13.520
[Guest]: know just forget then why are we talking about state capacity right because we

02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:18.640
[Guest]: don't trust the state okay now the flip side of that is that this goes back to

02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:23.440
[Guest]: my point about the plane that is India right I mean and so the private option

02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:26.920
[Guest]: essentially has worked for the people who are flying first in business class

02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:30.840
[Guest]: right I mean who have kind of seceded from the state but the reason there is

02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:35.000
[Guest]: no question of kind of giving up on the state is multiple things right so one is

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.480
[Guest]: there are certain core functions like justice and law that the state has a

02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:42.480
[Guest]: natural monopoly in okay second in terms of actual public goods public health

02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:46.400
[Guest]: environment vector control you know again private for all the private

02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:50.000
[Guest]: philanthropy and initiative there is no substitute for the sheer scale and

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:53.080
[Guest]: coordination that comes from getting the government to do its job okay I think

02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:57.280
[Guest]: the answer is just more engagement by the elites right I mean so in the end so

02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:00.400
[Guest]: in this way I think I'm more you know on the Ashwin Mahesh side of things right I

02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:03.320
[Guest]: think you guys had the same back and forth right where Ashwin was talking

02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:06.080
[Guest]: about you know what we need to do to take back the government right I mean so

02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:10.400
[Amit Varma]: there is no no I I agree with that aspect of it my my problem here is that

02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:16.120
[Amit Varma]: you are proposing a real-world action which is tax patrol more based on a

02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:20.480
[Amit Varma]: utopian argument that the you know that it will be okay to tax patrol more more

02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:25.240
[Amit Varma]: if the state can do all of these things the state is not doing any of those

02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:27.840
[Amit Varma]: things and the other point I want to make is that when you talk about the

02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:31.640
[Amit Varma]: India plane and the rich can buy private goods and all of that the point is roads

02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:35.640
[Amit Varma]: are good for everyone including the poor and I would argue that keeping petrol

02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:39.640
[Guest]: prices low are also good for everyone including the poor so I think let's put

02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:43.760
[Guest]: it this way right there are two separate questions okay one is what does the

02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:48.360
[Guest]: government do with any amount of money okay the second is saying that that we

02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:53.440
[Guest]: want the government to make certain core investments right means so suppose there

02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:57.560
[Guest]: is a menu of investments post COVID right that we say these are clearly high

02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:03.200
[Guest]: return public investments okay now there is always a possibility of saying we

02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:07.280
[Guest]: will not raise taxes let's cut down all of our inefficient spending okay and

02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:10.400
[Guest]: then move it to the more efficient ones okay which would be my preferred outcome

02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:15.800
[Guest]: okay now the political reality of reforms and expenditure is that it's

02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:19.760
[Guest]: very very hard to change existing patterns of spending what you can do is

02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:23.600
[Guest]: when there is additional money you can use that in a better way okay now one

02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:27.320
[Guest]: way is to say that along with growth as the budgets grow you know you use that

02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:30.840
[Guest]: marginal extra money to do better things and don't raise taxes but on the other

02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:35.840
[Guest]: hand if the Department of Revenue is given a target and saying like I want

02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:39.080
[Guest]: you to raise so much money okay and that is coming from the political bosses now

02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:42.240
[Guest]: the revenue department then has a choice of saying am I going to raise income

02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:46.200
[Guest]: taxes am I going to raise GST or am I going to raise petrol taxes or am I going

02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:49.920
[Guest]: to raise alcohol taxes my submission is very simple that conditional on the

02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:55.080
[Guest]: given target of revenue the petrol tax and the alcohol tax are better forms of

02:48:55.080 --> 02:49:00.000
[Guest]: tax than income tax and GST because this is disincentivizing a good and that is

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.800
[Guest]: disincentivizing all else equal something that is generating negative

02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:06.720
[Guest]: externality right so that's all so for example look at the Tamil Nadu versus

02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:09.800
[Guest]: Bihar right I mean the Bihar model of prohibition is like fiscal folly

02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:13.080
[Guest]: written all over it right like I mean whereas the Tamil Nadu model is saying

02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:16.160
[Guest]: like you know people are going to drink so instead of taking that underground

02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:20.280
[Guest]: like I mean you know the TASMAC system is responsible for a very large part of

02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:22.880
[Guest]: kind of state revenue in Tamil Nadu but then they send it back into welfare

02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:25.400
[Guest]: programs and put money into women's accounts which is I think overall a

02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:28.080
[Guest]: much much better way of doing things like you know I mean in the Bihar model

02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:31.160
[Guest]: so anyway I think there is a meta discussion about the size of the state

02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:35.560
[Guest]: and the fact that the state is this and this is classic Musgrave Buchanan right

02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:39.400
[Guest]: public economics versus public choice and I think here's the other problem

02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:44.200
[Guest]: right the other problem is where you are in India is again because of the

02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:48.120
[Guest]: political pressures the pressure on the government doing things is always going

02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:51.560
[Guest]: to be there so you and I can sit and have a hypothetical discussion of saying

02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:55.280
[Guest]: government should not be doing this but pressure to I a revenue to the taxman is

02:49:55.280 --> 02:49:58.760
[Guest]: coming after you you like it or not okay so all I'm saying is that holding a

02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:02.240
[Guest]: revenue envelope constant the revenue the the petrol tax is a better way of

02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:06.360
[Guest]: hitting that than something else right so that's fair enough I'm but what it

02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:10.240
[Amit Varma]: really amounts to is see I think a tax on petrol is a tax on the poor because

02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:13.360
[Amit Varma]: it will have an inflationary effect on everything else the prices of everything

02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:16.120
[Guest]: goes up including the salt and the so it depends on what you're doing with that

02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:20.920
[Guest]: right so if that revenue is then being coming back into funding say like you

02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:24.200
[Guest]: know the primary health care the poor use if the revenue is coming back to

02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:28.880
[Guest]: fund say an extra worker in the ICDS system then it in net net ends up being

02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:33.720
[Amit Varma]: much more progressive so again yeah but you know the thing is if my aunt was my

02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:40.400
[Amit Varma]: uncle she'd be a man this is like that only my point is that what what is

02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:44.100
[Amit Varma]: really happening here is that the rich sitting in their first class in the

02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:49.200
[Amit Varma]: plane are saying fine tax the poor you know so anyway but we can discuss this

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:52.880
[Guest]: some other time but it goes back to kind of saying all I'm saying is yes we have

02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:56.480
[Guest]: a real problem right we have so and some what is interesting is I get attacked

02:50:56.480 --> 02:50:59.000
[Guest]: from both the left and the right right like you know so the left things like

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:05.320
[Amit Varma]: you know sorry I get attacked from the left for pushing so much in terms of

02:51:05.320 --> 02:51:08.040
[Guest]: cost-effectiveness cost-effectiveness cost-effectiveness right like you know

02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:11.440
[Guest]: and I get attacked from the right like you know for feeling that I have this

02:51:11.440 --> 02:51:15.600
[Guest]: naive kind of optimism in the state right mean and so I guess the middle

02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:19.520
[Guest]: ground I'm trying to occupy is to say at one level the state needs to do more

02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:22.520
[Guest]: things at another level it is so inefficient right like you mean that

02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:26.520
[Guest]: let's push it to kind of increase on the things that are cost-effective that have

02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:30.880
[Guest]: high ROI and then conditional on doing that like I mean is it worth funding it

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:33.280
[Guest]: the answer is yes but just like I just said in the context of the book with

02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:37.800
[Guest]: Kelkar if the marginal cost of raising every rupee of tax revenue is in fact

02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:41.920
[Guest]: three rupees then the ROI threshold of what you do with tax revenue needs to be

02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:46.080
[Guest]: over 3x for you to actually do the tax so that I'm fully agreed that we should

02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:49.920
[Guest]: resist kind of a blind expansion of the state because the default quality of

02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:53.600
[Guest]: expenditure is so bad now you may come back and say that listen in fact I was

02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:56.480
[Guest]: talking to finance minister last year who wanted to raise tax revenue I told

02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:00.800
[Guest]: him I said in good conscience I cannot you know I cannot just commit to raising

02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:03.720
[Guest]: revenue unless you commit to me that you're going to do good things with it

02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:06.520
[Guest]: because otherwise you're just kind of attacking the poor taxpayer right like

02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:09.640
[Guest]: I mean for your next vanity but this was a government that had some commitment to

02:52:09.640 --> 02:52:13.400
[Guest]: you know service delivery right so that but that was a side conversation right

02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:16.800
[Guest]: in which we did have so anyway so I think coming back to where we are in

02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:19.960
[Amit Varma]: health policy and yeah I'll put a final aside because you mentioned Ajay's

02:52:19.960 --> 02:52:23.640
[Amit Varma]: episode and I'll again point out that Ajay and Vijay Kelkar wrote this great

02:52:23.640 --> 02:52:27.240
[Amit Varma]: book called in service of the Republic and we've discussed this concept of how

02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:32.040
[Amit Varma]: every rupee spent by the government has an opportunity cost as it were of three

02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:35.680
[Amit Varma]: rupees from the economy three rupees of growth so we discussed that in an

02:52:35.680 --> 02:52:39.320
[Amit Varma]: episode which I will link from the show notes and finally I will just you know

02:52:39.320 --> 02:52:44.400
[Amit Varma]: make one little point that it is not that I am criticizing your optimism of

02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:49.740
[Amit Varma]: what the state can do I am saying that yes I admire the effort to make the

02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:53.800
[Amit Varma]: state more responsive and to make it do better things but that should not take

02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:57.760
[Amit Varma]: the shape of the assumption that the government will do everything right

02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:03.560
[Unknown]: which then becomes a justification for all kinds of nonsense you know just as

02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:07.080
[Amit Varma]: we talk about market failure we never talk about government failure we compare

02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:10.800
[Amit Varma]: market failure with a European idea of what the state will do but the point is

02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:13.760
[Guest]: government failure is more ubiquitous I'm not making that case at all right

02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:17.080
[Guest]: most of my research has in fact been about documenting the government waste

02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:20.960
[Guest]: right so so I think in that way again my view is closer to Ashwin right I mean

02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:25.520
[Guest]: that you can't say that listen the state does bad things because we are the state

02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:29.720
[Guest]: right I mean so to somehow I think to assume that at some level take a state

02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:32.520
[Amit Varma]: you know but you know why I started to interrupt you but I'll object to that

02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:36.000
[Amit Varma]: that saying that we are the state because you could have made the same

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:39.200
[Amit Varma]: argument during the British times I would argue that the state that we are

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:45.440
[Amit Varma]: saddled with today is the same colonial state with a different set you know how

02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:49.160
[Amit Varma]: would that argument have gone down if you were to tell Gandhi or Nehru that or

02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:54.600
[Guest]: Savarkar or whoever that listen that you know this is the big difference and I

02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:57.080
[Guest]: can't remember which I think it was Ajay again who said this right because you

02:53:57.080 --> 02:54:00.640
[Guest]: keep saying state coercion I mean the whole point of a democratic state is

02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:04.640
[Guest]: that any coercion that happens happens at the willingness of the people in fact

02:54:04.640 --> 02:54:08.360
[Guest]: one of the sections of my final chapter is on making democracy work better right

02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:11.280
[Guest]: and some of this has to do with institutional rules reforms whatever so

02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:14.960
[Guest]: essentially when I'm saying we are the state I'm just saying that in a

02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:19.600
[Guest]: democracy right if people will not engage right you can't then expect that

02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:22.800
[Guest]: you know magically good things are going to happen right so that's all so you

02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:25.840
[Guest]: know a different way of saying this is if the competent refuse to participate

02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:28.640
[Guest]: then competent will take over right I mean so you can't sit and then complain

02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:33.080
[Guest]: about what the state is and which is why my steer to people in civil society who

02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:37.880
[Guest]: care about improving the public good is yes you see in a way competent people

02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:42.900
[Guest]: want to kind of be in a setting with their locus of control is high right so

02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:46.140
[Guest]: you don't want to take on the state because it's this beast that is so far

02:54:46.140 --> 02:54:51.800
[Guest]: outside kind of your your grasp so to speak right but again given that that is

02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:54.520
[Guest]: the beast that is spending these hundreds of thousands of crores right

02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:58.200
[Guest]: the returns to fixing that beast or tweaking that beast to start getting

02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:01.360
[Guest]: more effective and like Ashwin said like starting to engage with local

02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:04.480
[Guest]: government starting to engage with like you know the public sphere in your

02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:08.280
[Guest]: immediate vicinity is in fact a good thing so in fact in the education

02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:11.800
[Guest]: episode I didn't mention this but you know Howard Gardner at Harvard I think

02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:16.240
[Guest]: had you know recognizing that education is the needs of an education system are

02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:19.040
[Guest]: different different parts of the socio-economic distribution I think had

02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:22.160
[Guest]: this wonderful quote once where he said that listen first-generation learners

02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:27.120
[Guest]: need like functional skills right middle classes need more engagement and that's

02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:30.480
[Guest]: because you're all caught in your own treadmills of you know meeting your

02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:34.560
[Guest]: whatever private deadlines and kind of oblivious to the public and elites need

02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:38.400
[Guest]: more ethics right because the elites kind of have the luxury of kind of not

02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:42.120
[Guest]: being on a daily treadmill but like I mean if you have kind of created a

02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:45.800
[Guest]: culture where the elites are more about how do I park my money in tax havens now

02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:49.200
[Guest]: at an individual level you don't blame them because they're like okay this

02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:52.640
[Guest]: beast of the state is going to waste my money so but then you're starting to see

02:55:52.640 --> 02:55:55.600
[Guest]: at least in India a lot of philanthropy a lot of kind of elites really starting

02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:59.880
[Guest]: to engage in shaping kind of the larger public ecosystem in which we live in and

02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:03.760
[Guest]: so that's my plea my plea then is to the middle classes to say that we need more

02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:07.120
[Guest]: engagement right I mean you can't step aside and somehow think because if you

02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:09.880
[Guest]: step aside then your only option is to shrink the state because if you're

02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:13.240
[Guest]: stepping aside you're basically saying listen the state is unredeemable and it

02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:16.000
[Guest]: is kind of good no downward spiral and then we want to shrink the state and

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.920
[Guest]: then give up on state capacity altogether right so let's move on but

02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:22.160
[Amit Varma]: before you move on one final statement that you know I think you're being a

02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:26.360
[Amit Varma]: little totalitarian when you speak of the people as if it's a monolithic whole

02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:30.240
[Amit Varma]: and the people voted these people in or the the people keep the state

02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:33.240
[Amit Varma]: accountable and all of that you know that's not true we have to think at the

02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:36.880
[Amit Varma]: level of individuals you know there have been tens of thousands if not hundreds

02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:39.680
[Amit Varma]: of thousands of deaths that have been caused in India that are needless

02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:43.720
[Amit Varma]: because of the apathy and neglect of the dysfunctional state and I'm sorry I'm

02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:47.160
[Amit Varma]: not responsible for that right you can say hey the people are the state and all

02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:50.840
[Amit Varma]: of that but I am simply not because I have at a personal level been warning

02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:54.700
[Amit Varma]: that there will be a second wave been saying vaccinate everyone been railing

02:56:54.700 --> 02:56:57.920
[Amit Varma]: against the dysfunctional state ever since I started writing or possibly

02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:03.080
[Amit Varma]: since I was in the womb because that's just what it is but anyway as you and I

02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:07.120
[Guest]: are going to have a continuing discussion I don't even think we deeply

02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:10.200
[Guest]: you know fundamentally disagree in terms of the facts right I think we actually

02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:13.600
[Guest]: agree remarkably in the what the facts are and then I think you know the

02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:17.160
[Guest]: creative tension is more in terms of how do you move forward like you know I mean

02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:20.080
[Guest]: from this morass like you know of where we are so you know I don't think I

02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:24.720
[Guest]: disagree I don't think we disagree on the core diagnosis at all so yeah no I'm

02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:28.520
[Amit Varma]: with you on the the effort that we have to make in reforming the state but I

02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:33.880
[Amit Varma]: also sort of anyway let's leave it for some other discussion as in my whole

02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:37.280
[Amit Varma]: podcast is a continuing evolving discussion over hundreds of episodes

02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:41.320
[Amit Varma]: with different people so God knows which guest will next contribute to this

02:57:41.320 --> 02:57:46.080
[Amit Varma]: discussion let's move on to sort of the policy yeah so coming back to the policy

02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:48.440
[Guest]: on healthcare right I think so we've talked a little bit about public

02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:51.920
[Guest]: finance public expenditure and value for money right now but thinking about the

02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:55.880
[Guest]: creation of you know so I'm gonna say two or three I'm gonna say a few things

02:57:55.880 --> 02:57:58.960
[Guest]: on strengthening public systems and then I'm gonna say a few on the private

02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:02.560
[Guest]: system given that the private is 75% of actually the distribution of health care

02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:05.960
[Guest]: in the country right so on the public side I think the single most important

02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:11.680
[Guest]: insight is the following okay which is we have the most expensive part of the

02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:14.400
[Guest]: health care system is the doctor right both in terms of the cost of the

02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:18.800
[Guest]: training and in terms of the scarcity of supply okay and we are living in this

02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:22.640
[Guest]: model of saying we're going to provide universal health care by staffing rural

02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:25.920
[Guest]: places with these highly qualified doctors and that has just not worked and

02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:29.880
[Guest]: it is not going to work okay so the way we need to think about building our

02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:33.640
[Guest]: human resources for health care instead of saying I'm going to take a talented

02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:37.800
[Guest]: urban doctor and put them in a rural area it's like can I take a talented

02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:42.120
[Guest]: motivated rural person and upskill this person in a way that allows them to be

02:58:42.120 --> 02:58:46.080
[Guest]: effective in their communities okay so I think that's like the core mental shift

02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:50.040
[Guest]: we need to make and we have and this is not just me right we now have good data

02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:53.120
[Guest]: and evidence if you look at what is the part of the health care system in India

02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:57.200
[Guest]: that works best okay what works best is we do well on vaccinations we're doing

02:58:57.200 --> 02:59:01.500
[Guest]: well on institutional deliveries okay so these key metrics of and vaccinations we

02:59:01.500 --> 02:59:04.560
[Guest]: managed to do this year after year with kid after kid now why are we succeeding

02:59:04.560 --> 02:59:08.760
[Guest]: is because the most successful part of the health care system right now I would

02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:12.520
[Guest]: argue at the ASHA workers okay so the ASHA workers are hired locally in the

02:59:12.520 --> 02:59:16.360
[Guest]: village they are typically 8, 10, or 12th pass like you know they're in that range

02:59:16.360 --> 02:59:20.880
[Guest]: of education they provided a modest amount of training and importantly that

02:59:20.880 --> 02:59:25.160
[Guest]: they are paid on a piece rate basis right so they get a modest stipend but

02:59:25.160 --> 02:59:28.360
[Guest]: they are paid for every institutional delivery they are paid for every

02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:32.360
[Guest]: vaccination okay so which means that you have taken the local talent you have

02:59:32.360 --> 02:59:37.080
[Guest]: upskilled them and you have put them in an overall incentive regime whereby like

02:59:37.080 --> 02:59:40.960
[Guest]: I mean there is some continuous reward for ongoing performance okay you know

02:59:40.960 --> 02:59:44.040
[Guest]: this model was developed by Dr. Abhay Bang and Rani Bang like you know in

02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:47.320
[Guest]: Gachiroli district in Maharashtra you know they have searched and they've done

02:59:47.320 --> 02:59:51.720
[Guest]: tons of work over the years of building health systems and capacity in the back

02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:56.680
[Guest]: of the beyond so taking that insight into how do we build human resources for

02:59:56.680 --> 03:00:00.200
[Guest]: kind of the public health care system my most important push would be something

03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:04.480
[Guest]: very similar to what I said for teachers right mean which is you know think about

03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:08.880
[Guest]: aggressively expanding nurse training programs right mean but where the nurse

03:00:08.880 --> 03:00:13.200
[Guest]: training programs should be heavily practicum based okay so specifically the

03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:16.560
[Guest]: model that I have in mind whether it's for education of a nursing is to say

03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:20.720
[Guest]: that imagine at every district level you create a district nursing college right

03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:24.800
[Guest]: mean that is equipped to train a few hundred nurses a year and you say that

03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:28.520
[Guest]: you're going to admit students the top candidates from every panchayat okay and

03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:32.240
[Guest]: you will prioritize panchayats where they currently don't have staff okay in

03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:37.040
[Guest]: their health system so you are getting an inflow of the top talent 10th pass or

03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:40.400
[Guest]: 12th pass as the case might be and the one good news from expanding school

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:44.180
[Guest]: education over the years is now you kind of have at the panchayat level like you

03:00:44.180 --> 03:00:47.840
[Guest]: know candidates who have passed 12th and particularly for girls this is really

03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:51.680
[Guest]: important because the the cultural barriers to working outside the village

03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:55.200
[Guest]: means that the labor force participation falls sharply and you kind of get

03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:59.240
[Guest]: married and have kids at some 16 or 18 partly because of that barrier right so

03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:03.040
[Guest]: being able to create the structure whereby you say this is a prestigious

03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:06.080
[Guest]: program that you're admitted to where the government is paying your fees okay

03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:08.720
[Guest]: so you're not actually paying out of pocket but what you're doing over a

03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:11.720
[Guest]: three-year or four-year period is you're saying I'm going to get three months of

03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:15.600
[Guest]: modular nurse training okay that teaches me in terms of the basics and then nine

03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:19.160
[Guest]: months I'm back in my community attached to the subcenter like reporting into the

03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:23.360
[Guest]: PHC so there's a regular nurse and doctor I'm reporting into so this then

03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:26.920
[Guest]: becomes part of your practicum training where you are starting to provide

03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:30.600
[Guest]: primary care okay and you do this for two years or three years and then at the

03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:33.680
[Guest]: end of three years in fact I can literally imagine right that they have

03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:37.760
[Guest]: their own uniforms and they kind of you know sort of in a quasi official way you

03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:40.760
[Guest]: get like one stripe and two stripes and three stripes based on how many years of

03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:44.040
[Guest]: your training you're finished right so it also these little subtle markers of

03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:47.000
[Guest]: status right mean that it gives you certain official recognition in your

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:50.080
[Guest]: community in your village and so what you're doing and this is where then

03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:52.680
[Guest]: technology comes in right because what you're doing is not just doing the three

03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:57.040
[Guest]: months training but you're then creating these kind of smartphone based apps as

03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:01.560
[Guest]: well as say peer groups okay so that you are constantly exposed and have access

03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:04.600
[Guest]: to a community of peers as well as your teachers right so when you're in

03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:08.280
[Guest]: practice you can refer both to your immediate supervisor as well as have

03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:12.000
[Guest]: access to a virtual network of inputs for how you deal with this the

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:15.120
[Guest]: technology can become incredibly effective as a way of supporting

03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:19.520
[Guest]: continuing education okay so today you have to pass an exam and you come in but

03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:22.160
[Guest]: once you're in the government service for 30 years or 35 years there is no

03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:26.000
[Guest]: kind of ongoing test of whether you're current in your knowledge okay so again

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:30.240
[Guest]: what the US does is saying doctors have to be recertified every 10 years okay

03:02:30.240 --> 03:02:34.480
[Guest]: now we don't have the apparatus to do that but imagine that now every

03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:38.480
[Guest]: nurse in your government system right has a unique ID and they are expected to

03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:42.360
[Guest]: do a certain say 10 or 15 days of training a year but now the training is

03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:46.960
[Guest]: essentially on an app where you have curated content and then at the end of

03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:50.440
[Guest]: every module of the content you have a test okay so you can take this on your

03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:53.720
[Guest]: own time and in fact my chapter on police I talk about the same thing right

03:02:53.720 --> 03:02:57.800
[Guest]: that one of the reasons of a police are so horrendously under trained is because

03:02:57.800 --> 03:03:02.000
[Guest]: the nature of their job is they have to be on call okay so they have to be

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:05.240
[Guest]: available and they are so understaffed the system cannot spare these poor cops

03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:08.400
[Guest]: like I mean to attend a training workshop right but if you can modularize

03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:11.440
[Guest]: the training to fit it into the downtime during the day when they're sitting in

03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:14.200
[Guest]: the Thana like you know just waiting for things to happen right like I mean so

03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:17.880
[Guest]: and that's the same for nurses is the same for a lot of service delivery staff

03:03:17.880 --> 03:03:21.200
[Guest]: that there's a lot of downtime right when you're just sitting there waiting

03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:23.840
[Guest]: for a patient to come in there are some times when you have a lot of load

03:03:23.840 --> 03:03:26.800
[Guest]: sometimes when you're just sitting twiddling your thumbs okay so how do you

03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:30.520
[Guest]: use that time efficiently by kind of having modular training that you can

03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:33.920
[Guest]: take and you take an exam that you show you have this done so and then once

03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:37.240
[Guest]: you've done this kind of modular nurse training you give them a nursing

03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:40.840
[Guest]: credential and the good thing about this is this is then valuable in both the

03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:43.840
[Guest]: public sector and the private sector right so because the private sector is

03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:49.040
[Guest]: 70% of the system you can say that you are creating the human capital the human

03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:52.640
[Guest]: resources to absorb into the public system and post them in the sub centers

03:03:52.640 --> 03:03:56.960
[Guest]: and areas that are underserved but at a point you are also creating the talent

03:03:56.960 --> 03:04:00.400
[Guest]: that allows the private sector to absorb them as well right so coming back to

03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:03.400
[Guest]: what the government can do something that Ajay said again is that the

03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:06.640
[Guest]: short-run elasticity of medical workers is basically zero right you can't

03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:10.160
[Guest]: manufacture a doctor in a crisis you can't manifest so the most important

03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:13.520
[Guest]: lesson from all of this is like how do we build the pipeline of human resources

03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:17.280
[Guest]: for the healthcare sector but do this in a way that doesn't make the mistake of

03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:20.840
[Guest]: saying that I need super fancy qualified doctors everywhere what you really need

03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:26.200
[Guest]: is kind of the locally connected public health worker who is then trained and

03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:30.360
[Guest]: leveraged with technology like you know to kind of have access to and then this

03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:33.400
[Guest]: is a person who knows when they need to refer a complicated case right so coming

03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:36.240
[Guest]: back to doing your diagnostics doing your checklist doing a bunch of things

03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:39.600
[Guest]: that technology then becomes a force multiplier that you put on top of the

03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:42.960
[Guest]: human resource over there right so that would probably be the single most

03:04:42.960 --> 03:04:47.440
[Guest]: important thing I would do is to kind of massively expand so going back to your

03:04:47.440 --> 03:04:50.000
[Guest]: question of a philanthropist with a hundred million dollars you know so I

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:53.760
[Guest]: would actually say creating these modular training programs and the

03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:56.640
[Guest]: templates for this and working particularly in states like UP and Bihar

03:04:56.640 --> 03:05:00.120
[Guest]: like I mean to say how do you make these things happen and in the beginning you

03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:03.760
[Guest]: will need to bring you know you need to import your trainers you'll need to have

03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:06.600
[Guest]: some high quality people creating the content and the modules and stuff like

03:05:06.600 --> 03:05:11.800
[Guest]: that but fundamentally right 90% of our problems in India are about supply

03:05:11.800 --> 03:05:16.160
[Guest]: constraints right you expand supply and then you know the prices will fall and

03:05:16.160 --> 03:05:20.080
[Guest]: things will take care of themselves so I think that's one core point now a

03:05:20.080 --> 03:05:24.520
[Guest]: similar point with regard to doctors okay is what Chhattisgarh did with kind

03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:28.120
[Guest]: of their rural medical assistant program and I sent you that paper as well so

03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:31.200
[Guest]: this they had done for two or three years where you say again you don't need

03:05:31.200 --> 03:05:34.680
[Guest]: like this fully trained doctor sitting in the rural area twiddling their thumbs

03:05:34.680 --> 03:05:39.600
[Guest]: but can you modularize the training and provide enough medical training that

03:05:39.600 --> 03:05:43.200
[Guest]: they can be more effective yeah and I think you know coming to doctor

03:05:43.200 --> 03:05:47.160
[Guest]: training I think the same thing applies in the Chhattisgarh experiment which was

03:05:47.160 --> 03:05:51.160
[Guest]: unfortunately stopped after two or three years for I think complex political

03:05:51.160 --> 03:05:55.320
[Guest]: reasons but the core idea was very very simple that you don't need this fancy

03:05:55.320 --> 03:05:58.480
[Guest]: six years of training and put an MBBS in a remote rural area where this person

03:05:58.480 --> 03:06:02.500
[Guest]: has no inclination to be and is not being effectively utilized right so they

03:06:02.500 --> 03:06:06.080
[Guest]: had this rural medical assistant program where you had people trained for about

03:06:06.080 --> 03:06:10.380
[Guest]: three years and then were eligible to practice in the rural areas right so you

03:06:10.380 --> 03:06:15.480
[Guest]: have to start thinking creatively about expanding the supply in a way that the

03:06:15.480 --> 03:06:18.540
[Guest]: most important mistake let me repeat again and again and this is true with

03:06:18.540 --> 03:06:22.040
[Guest]: all of our public sector recruitment okay and that's because we recruit on

03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:26.000
[Guest]: the basis of a test and the basis of knowledge the people who will get this

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:31.560
[Guest]: pass the exam will almost invariably be from urban areas and even like those who

03:06:31.560 --> 03:06:34.600
[Guest]: get in from other areas the salaries will be so high that their aspirations

03:06:34.600 --> 03:06:37.400
[Guest]: will be urban so a big part of the absence problem is not that people are

03:06:37.400 --> 03:06:40.000
[Guest]: bad is that they're just completely disconnected from the communities they

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:43.880
[Guest]: are serving right so to kind of take what we've learned from the ASHA model

03:06:43.880 --> 03:06:47.440
[Guest]: to say take local talent that is connected to the community and invest

03:06:47.440 --> 03:06:51.120
[Guest]: in upskilling them in a way that there's a pipeline from the skilling to the

03:06:51.120 --> 03:06:54.560
[Guest]: employment I think is one of the most important structural points like you

03:06:54.560 --> 03:06:57.720
[Guest]: know we need to do in terms of building our healthcare capacity again these are

03:06:57.720 --> 03:07:01.200
[Guest]: more complex kind of reforms now the other thing that is immediately

03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:04.560
[Guest]: actionable for a government okay given that at the end of the day governments

03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:08.360
[Guest]: they know how to build things okay they know how to kind of just you know do

03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:11.800
[Guest]: more of the same okay what the one thing I would say which Abhijit Banerjee is

03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:15.840
[Guest]: also written about is particularly in UP, Bihar and places where the population

03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:20.080
[Guest]: has grown so much over the past kind of 20-30 years that there is a strong case

03:07:20.080 --> 03:07:23.360
[Guest]: for building a second district hospital right because right now you have one

03:07:23.360 --> 03:07:26.880
[Guest]: district hospital but there's been this in the 70s and the population has

03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:30.440
[Guest]: doubled okay now the nice thing about a district hospital is you have scale and

03:07:30.440 --> 03:07:34.260
[Guest]: when you have scale you can have kind of the community of practice the absence is

03:07:34.260 --> 03:07:37.320
[Guest]: typically much much lower in these district hospitals compared to the

03:07:37.320 --> 03:07:42.200
[Guest]: remote rural areas the utilization is higher and it also becomes possible to

03:07:42.200 --> 03:07:45.640
[Guest]: then do my third idea which is kind of attach medical colleges right because

03:07:45.640 --> 03:07:48.720
[Guest]: the medical education problem so I'll come back to that right so the second

03:07:48.720 --> 03:07:50.640
[Guest]: thing is build district hospitals this is something the government knows how to

03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:53.720
[Guest]: do like you know I mean just do it build a second district hospital in kind of

03:07:53.720 --> 03:07:57.260
[Guest]: the second nodal area and given the investment in roads and people's

03:07:57.260 --> 03:08:00.760
[Guest]: willingness to travel that's a case where concentrating your resources in a

03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:03.720
[Guest]: scale facility makes more sense than saying I'm going to build these itsy

03:08:03.720 --> 03:08:07.880
[Guest]: bitsy little PHCs that nobody goes to okay so that's the second point the

03:08:07.880 --> 03:08:11.720
[Guest]: third then coming to medical education itself and if you go back to the two

03:08:11.720 --> 03:08:15.600
[Guest]: India's paper I think one of the big reasons for why you see this massive

03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:19.400
[Guest]: gradient in health care quality is the substantial investment in medical

03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:23.120
[Guest]: education I mean in the southern states now some of this is driven by private

03:08:23.120 --> 03:08:26.200
[Guest]: investment which reflects the fact that it's expensive and the southern states

03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:30.400
[Guest]: are richer and so people are just able to pay more okay but from a policy

03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:34.040
[Guest]: perspective medical education is controlled pretty much by the government

03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:36.200
[Guest]: now of course there's a ton of rent-seeking there and like you know and

03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:39.760
[Guest]: that's been you know the tragedy but hopefully this is a crisis where the

03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:42.920
[Guest]: chief minister says k boss I'm not going to allow rent-seeking here because this

03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:47.240
[Guest]: is now really important and then the three things that determine kind of your

03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:51.600
[Guest]: medical education capacities you know there's the facilities there is the you

03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:54.520
[Guest]: know there's the actual human capital right mean the you know who are the

03:08:54.520 --> 03:08:58.080
[Guest]: people available to do the training and typically these have been attached to

03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:01.440
[Guest]: district hospitals partly because that's where you have the doctors available so

03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:04.400
[Guest]: yeah so I think on the public system those would be kind of the three things

03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:07.160
[Guest]: I would do as far as health care is concerned now there is obviously the

03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:11.080
[Guest]: technology piece of this and there is a question about does the public system

03:09:11.080 --> 03:09:16.320
[Guest]: have the dexterity and the speed to kind of really leverage technology the way

03:09:16.320 --> 03:09:20.080
[Guest]: you want to at scale so I think one thing which I haven't discussed in the

03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:23.160
[Guest]: book but just like I had done in the case of charter schools in the private

03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:28.360
[Guest]: school there may well be a case to kind of partner with public spirited

03:09:28.360 --> 03:09:32.320
[Guest]: foundations to come and say that if you were to kind of take over a management

03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:36.640
[Guest]: contract okay for running a public health system in one district right so

03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:39.520
[Guest]: it would still be public in the sense that you wouldn't turn away patients you

03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:45.040
[Guest]: wouldn't charge fees but you would basically bring in a publicly motivated

03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:48.360
[Guest]: person to come and look at their technology and innovation landscape and

03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:51.880
[Guest]: saying how would I re-architect the system with modern principles of

03:09:51.880 --> 03:09:55.560
[Guest]: technology and private sector right so and I don't think we've done enough of

03:09:55.560 --> 03:09:59.960
[Guest]: that I think we've done PPP's in terms of outsourcing tertiary care and

03:09:59.960 --> 03:10:03.880
[Guest]: saying in Ayushman Bharat or Arogya Shree that we will reimburse private

03:10:03.880 --> 03:10:08.120
[Guest]: hospitals what we have not done enough of is saying can I bring real private

03:10:08.120 --> 03:10:11.440
[Guest]: sector management expertise and horsepower into re-engineering the

03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:15.760
[Guest]: public system to leverage technology and do things at scale right so I think that

03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:19.520
[Amit Varma]: might be something else that's really really worth thinking about. So many

03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:22.320
[Amit Varma]: things to unpack there but I won't unpack too many of them because you've

03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:26.160
[Amit Varma]: been so sort of clear and concise but I will point out that one thing that

03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:30.240
[Amit Varma]: delighted me was that I asked Ajay a question in the last episode about

03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:33.760
[Amit Varma]: philanthropist and hundred million and you picked up on it in this episode and

03:10:33.760 --> 03:10:37.640
[Amit Varma]: answered it without my asking it which is which I find delightful which is you

03:10:37.640 --> 03:10:40.840
[Amit Varma]: know that's how I like to see the scene in the unseen a conversation that goes

03:10:40.840 --> 03:10:45.040
[Amit Varma]: across time and across episode and across guests so I wonder what question

03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:49.200
[Amit Varma]: that I asked you will be answered by some other guest who knows maybe we

03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:52.840
[Amit Varma]: could have an answer next week. I also want to quote a little bit from your

03:10:52.840 --> 03:10:58.280
[Amit Varma]: two India's paper because just for the listeners to clarify that there's a lot

03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:02.860
[Amit Varma]: of activity happening at the local level which isn't exactly the same that the

03:11:02.860 --> 03:11:06.840
[Amit Varma]: state also is not a monolithic beast just as individuals aren't. So you speak

03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:10.080
[Amit Varma]: about the different views of primary health care and you say quote one view

03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:13.560
[Amit Varma]: of primary care in rural India is that it is available mainly through publicly

03:11:13.560 --> 03:11:17.600
[Amit Varma]: operated private health care centers or sub centers which are sparsely located

03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:21.760
[Amit Varma]: and understaffed. According to this view qualified doctors in India are mostly

03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:25.640
[Amit Varma]: located in urban locations and access to quality care in India is poor. Stop

03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:29.100
[Amit Varma]: quote and the other view is quote an alternate view agrees that even though

03:11:29.100 --> 03:11:33.040
[Amit Varma]: access to qualified providers in rural India is low a wide variety of health

03:11:33.040 --> 03:11:35.920
[Amit Varma]: care providers with diverse qualifications has arisen to fill this

03:11:35.920 --> 03:11:40.120
[Amit Varma]: gap stop quote and where what I found interesting was how you detailed out how

03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:45.760
[Amit Varma]: different states are treating this differently this situation in the sense

03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:49.120
[Amit Varma]: that you know West Bengal is trying to train them Chhattisgarh like you said is

03:11:49.120 --> 03:11:52.800
[Amit Varma]: reducing requirements making it modular and saying okay you don't have to do all

03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:56.620
[Amit Varma]: six years you can just do three years or whatever you talk about how UP and MP

03:11:56.620 --> 03:12:00.400
[Amit Varma]: are increasing transportation so that's how your access goes up you don't need a

03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:03.740
[Amit Varma]: doctor there immediately and how the government of India is allowing

03:12:03.740 --> 03:12:07.920
[Amit Varma]: alternate medicine docs and wellness centers and I love this quote that you

03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:10.760
[Amit Varma]: know you quoted the Indian Medical Association which is resisting this

03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:14.920
[Amit Varma]: obviously because it you know they want to keep it supply as restricted as

03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:18.860
[Amit Varma]: possible and you've written quote in their view for instance training

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:24.280
[Amit Varma]: informal sector providers is like teaching burglars to steal better I love

03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:30.000
[Amit Varma]: that good teaching burglars to steal better isn't this what the IAS Academy

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:41.000
[Amit Varma]: in Missouri does but never mind this is my distrust of the dysfunctional state

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:44.820
[Amit Varma]: has also become a kind of for me my guess of sorts you know there's lots to

03:12:44.820 --> 03:12:48.000
[Amit Varma]: think about and once again what I will say from having read these papers and

03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:51.160
[Amit Varma]: having read the chapter in your book but even the papers itself even your to

03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:54.560
[Amit Varma]: India's paper is that there's a lot of depth and nuance there and so I would

03:12:54.560 --> 03:12:59.120
[Amit Varma]: just encourage listeners to get into the weeds because this is a problem I think

03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:03.680
[Amit Varma]: that is not just a problem for academics and policymakers it concerns all of us

03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:08.160
[Amit Varma]: we've seen that in this specific season all our lives are affected the quality

03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:12.440
[Amit Varma]: of our lives and sometimes our very lives themselves so do check out those

03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:15.920
[Amit Varma]: papers and go a little bit into the weeds it's it's worth it there are a lot

03:13:15.920 --> 03:13:20.720
[Amit Varma]: of insights there for me let me turn your attention now to the current crisis

03:13:20.720 --> 03:13:25.800
[Amit Varma]: to COVID and of course I have done many episodes on this and there are just like

03:13:25.800 --> 03:13:30.800
[Amit Varma]: so many aspects of this to talk about but I have spoken about the economics

03:13:30.800 --> 03:13:35.160
[Amit Varma]: aspects of this a policymaking aspects of this you know all the different

03:13:35.160 --> 03:13:38.840
[Guest]: before COVID because I had finished the public part of the policy I maybe I'll

03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:42.080
[Unknown]: take five minutes to talk about the private part of policy let's go let's

03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:47.440
[Unknown]: come back yeah because I think that and again see in many ways the the episodes

03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:51.080
[Guest]: that I'm doing in education and health are kind of mirroring the structure of

03:13:51.080 --> 03:13:54.480
[Guest]: the book in the sense that the book has these six thematic chapters and the

03:13:54.480 --> 03:13:58.120
[Guest]: themes then cut across six different sectors so in that way you'll see the

03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:02.040
[Guest]: parallels that are happening here and one of the most important kind of points

03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:05.200
[Guest]: I want to make is and this is to any health minister or health secretary

03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:09.360
[Guest]: anywhere who may be listening to this at some point is that the biggest kind of I

03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:13.280
[Guest]: would say myopia we have in health policy is that the government for the

03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:17.360
[Guest]: most part only thinks about its job is running the public system okay whereas

03:14:17.360 --> 03:14:21.040
[Guest]: we need the clarity again that the government plays three different very

03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:25.000
[Guest]: different roles in the ecosystem right as a policymaker as a regulator and as a

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:29.320
[Guest]: provider and the way you see the private sector is very different in these three

03:14:29.320 --> 03:14:33.880
[Guest]: lenses right so as a policymaker the private sector is your ally because your

03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:38.400
[Guest]: job is to improve outcomes for everybody regardless of who provides it as a

03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:42.080
[Guest]: regulator the private sector is equal to the public because you want to treat

03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:47.360
[Guest]: them equally and as a provider they are your competitor okay now the problem is

03:14:47.360 --> 03:14:51.680
[Guest]: that the government the majority of its staff and human resources are thinking

03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:55.200
[Guest]: and functioning as government as provider right and so which means you

03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:59.000
[Guest]: automatically distrust the private sector you automatically want to kind of

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.840
[Guest]: cramp them in multiple ways and you know and sometimes justify because of course

03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:06.000
[Guest]: these are profit you know for every good private guy there's a equally bad

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:09.560
[Guest]: private guy so and the policymaking by anecdote me you can do whatever you want

03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:12.920
[Guest]: right because you can find you can find any story to justify what you want to do

03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:19.360
[Guest]: okay so but coming back to the stark reality that 75% of health care in this

03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:23.040
[Guest]: country is delivered by the private sector okay if you are a thinking health

03:15:23.040 --> 03:15:26.560
[Guest]: minister or health secretary tomorrow who says that I care about improving my

03:15:26.560 --> 03:15:30.800
[Guest]: health systems the elephant in the room are these private guys okay so what are

03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:34.880
[Guest]: you going to do about them okay now yeah so the default approach to the private

03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:38.280
[Guest]: sector is basically to pretend that they don't exist okay because they're illegal

03:15:38.280 --> 03:15:40.960
[Guest]: they're not supposed to be practicing and every once in a while you'll have

03:15:40.960 --> 03:15:45.000
[Guest]: these drives of going and shutting down these clinics okay but the problem is

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:48.120
[Guest]: they will come back a week later or two weeks later because they're in the

03:15:48.120 --> 03:15:51.680
[Guest]: community they are highly respected they are the only source of care and so there

03:15:51.680 --> 03:15:56.600
[Guest]: is demand right I mean so you know and I think the denial we are in is really

03:15:56.600 --> 03:15:59.720
[Guest]: really counterproductive given that if we care about population health the

03:15:59.720 --> 03:16:04.120
[Guest]: largest segment are these folks okay so what would I do and this is where again

03:16:04.120 --> 03:16:08.280
[Guest]: we have evidence okay so there's this lovely paper again by Jishnu and and

03:16:08.280 --> 03:16:12.280
[Guest]: Abhijit Banerjee and co-authors in Bengal right I mean where they partnered

03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:17.280
[Guest]: with the liver foundation and they ran this program again it was a randomized

03:16:17.280 --> 03:16:21.960
[Guest]: control trial of basically training these unqualified providers okay so they

03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:25.240
[Guest]: ran a modular training over about a nine-month period and the whole point

03:16:25.240 --> 03:16:28.880
[Guest]: was to say listen you know you are in the community you care about doing well

03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:33.760
[Guest]: so can we give you some basic training and just does that make you better okay

03:16:33.760 --> 03:16:38.000
[Guest]: and what they found was that this modest training had a substantial positive

03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:42.080
[Guest]: impact right on their effectiveness as measured by standardized patients and it

03:16:42.080 --> 03:16:45.720
[Guest]: almost halved the gap between the completely unqualified and the fully

03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:49.560
[Guest]: qualified in about nine months of training okay so coming back therefore

03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:53.920
[Guest]: to this core point that I made that quality is a function of knowledge and

03:16:53.920 --> 03:16:58.880
[Guest]: effort right public sector has high knowledge low effort private sector has

03:16:58.880 --> 03:17:03.440
[Guest]: low knowledge high effort okay so if you do a simple partial derivative I'll ask

03:17:03.440 --> 03:17:07.200
[Guest]: your audience to do in their heads right the partial derivative of quality with

03:17:07.200 --> 03:17:11.520
[Guest]: respect to effort is knowledge right and vice versa so which means the returns to

03:17:11.520 --> 03:17:14.960
[Guest]: knowledge is actually higher in the private sector because the effort is

03:17:14.960 --> 03:17:18.640
[Guest]: high whereas the returns effort is higher in the public sector because the

03:17:18.640 --> 03:17:22.360
[Guest]: knowledge is high right so if you want to think about system architecture we

03:17:22.360 --> 03:17:25.200
[Guest]: need to be thinking about how do you improve the incentives and

03:17:25.200 --> 03:17:28.440
[Guest]: accountability in the public sector and how do you improve the knowledge in the

03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:31.880
[Guest]: private sector whereas in practice we do exactly the opposite right I mean because

03:17:31.880 --> 03:17:35.600
[Guest]: we say the private guys we ignore them and we keep doing trainings of various

03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:39.640
[Guest]: sorts right I can mean in the public sector okay so now of course this is

03:17:39.640 --> 03:17:43.240
[Guest]: politically fraught right because it will obviously be like opposed by

03:17:43.240 --> 03:17:46.560
[Guest]: different kind of interest groups and so it's very important to be very clear

03:17:46.560 --> 03:17:50.520
[Guest]: that then I'm not talking about training these guys and calling them doctors okay

03:17:50.520 --> 03:17:54.320
[Guest]: like I mean it is going back to the spirit of modular training recognizing

03:17:54.320 --> 03:17:57.520
[Guest]: that listen these guys are in the community they are respected they don't

03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:01.160
[Guest]: want to do bad right I mean the last thing they want is to hurt their

03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:05.080
[Guest]: patients because they're living in the community correct so giving them the

03:18:05.080 --> 03:18:10.920
[Guest]: ability to kind of be better and be able to refer complex cases almost says that

03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:15.320
[Guest]: listen you these private guys exist anyway okay so why not leverage them to

03:18:15.320 --> 03:18:19.680
[Guest]: be like the first point of kind of a structure of care whereby I train them

03:18:19.680 --> 03:18:22.680
[Guest]: to say okay don't do this don't do this don't do this and now here are things

03:18:22.680 --> 03:18:26.120
[Guest]: that you can do now there is a question about what credential you give them like

03:18:26.120 --> 03:18:29.320
[Guest]: you know maybe you create a cadre of paramedics or a cadre of like you know

03:18:29.320 --> 03:18:33.480
[Guest]: something that provides a certain legitimacy but doesn't say like you know

03:18:33.480 --> 03:18:35.920
[Guest]: that but then you say if you call yourself doctor like you know then I'll

03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:40.400
[Guest]: penalize you so again I can just give you principles right now the details of

03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:43.680
[Guest]: this will then have to be worked out in specific states specific context now one

03:18:43.680 --> 03:18:47.080
[Guest]: way to hybridize the two ideas I talked about was to say suppose we have a

03:18:47.080 --> 03:18:51.880
[Guest]: modular training program for nurses or we have this RMA training program okay

03:18:51.880 --> 03:18:54.640
[Guest]: whereby say we are going to create these two-year programs or diplomas for these

03:18:54.640 --> 03:18:58.440
[Guest]: rural medical assistants then in terms of who gets admission into that program

03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:02.360
[Guest]: one route could be to say you do well in a 12th standard exam the other route

03:19:02.360 --> 03:19:06.560
[Guest]: could be that if you are one of these unqualified but registered medical

03:19:06.560 --> 03:19:09.800
[Guest]: practitioners who's been in your community for 10 years that maybe will

03:19:09.800 --> 03:19:13.160
[Guest]: give you some preferential access into this two-year training program okay so

03:19:13.160 --> 03:19:17.640
[Guest]: that we are able to take that informal workforce and start giving them some

03:19:17.640 --> 03:19:23.040
[Guest]: formal skills okay so that would be one piece of how you may take this private

03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:26.840
[Guest]: system and make it function better okay in a way that is constructive as opposed

03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:30.080
[Guest]: to saying I'm going to play whack-a-mole with you and shut you down shut you down

03:19:30.080 --> 03:19:34.400
[Guest]: but then you'll pop up in another place okay so that's one idea then I think the

03:19:34.400 --> 03:19:37.880
[Guest]: other things in the private sector you know one is obviously I think something

03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:42.440
[Guest]: Ajay alluded to you see the biggest challenge in designing health care

03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:47.200
[Guest]: systems is at one level you want some incentives for good care at another

03:19:47.200 --> 03:19:50.800
[Guest]: level you don't want the incentives to be too strong for over medication right

03:19:50.800 --> 03:19:57.240
[Guest]: so so structurally one way to do this is if you have insurance companies that are

03:19:57.240 --> 03:20:01.320
[Guest]: essentially signing agreements with providers okay and saying that you are

03:20:01.320 --> 03:20:06.080
[Guest]: my designated provider now what happens is the members of the policy at the

03:20:06.080 --> 03:20:09.720
[Guest]: beginning of every year have a chance to choose their provider but the good news

03:20:09.720 --> 03:20:14.080
[Guest]: is you're now choosing not when you are sick and need to be hospitalized when

03:20:14.080 --> 03:20:18.080
[Guest]: you have very little bargaining power and very little time you are choosing at

03:20:18.080 --> 03:20:22.240
[Guest]: a time when you have kind of the ability to think about a year away so the

03:20:22.240 --> 03:20:26.240
[Guest]: practice then has an incentive to have a reputation for providing a certain

03:20:26.240 --> 03:20:28.920
[Guest]: standard of care because if you are somebody who's seen as crimping then

03:20:28.920 --> 03:20:34.320
[Guest]: people will not choose you but the way you compensate the practice is not by

03:20:34.320 --> 03:20:38.160
[Guest]: saying I'm gonna pay you for procedure you say I pay you a certain amount for

03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:42.480
[Guest]: every patient you enroll in the course of a year so that you are not

03:20:42.480 --> 03:20:46.360
[Guest]: incentivized to overtreat right so again if you think about say the British

03:20:46.360 --> 03:20:50.280
[Guest]: National Health System the NHS has a similar so as a doctor as a primary care

03:20:50.280 --> 03:20:53.440
[Guest]: practitioner you get paid a certain piece rate for every patient who signs

03:20:53.440 --> 03:20:56.520
[Guest]: up with your practice but then your reimbursements are relatively flat right

03:20:56.520 --> 03:21:00.440
[Guest]: so you don't get a steep gradient for doing too many procedures so again going

03:21:00.440 --> 03:21:03.400
[Guest]: back to what I just said these are incredibly complex issues and you know

03:21:03.400 --> 03:21:06.200
[Guest]: Western countries have entire communities of health economists like

03:21:06.200 --> 03:21:09.520
[Guest]: who are you know working with common data sets and starting to these are

03:21:09.520 --> 03:21:13.160
[Guest]: incredibly deep complex design detail questions right but the broad

03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:16.960
[Guest]: architecture would take that form that you say you one of the ways to solve

03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:20.440
[Guest]: this asymmetry problem is you put a kind of a bigger buyer on the other side and

03:21:20.440 --> 03:21:25.080
[Guest]: over time you create the right incentives for the overall ecosystem and

03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:28.120
[Guest]: the last thing I would do going back to ideas for your hypothetical

03:21:28.120 --> 03:21:30.760
[Guest]: philanthropist with hundred million dollars like you know I mean is that

03:21:30.760 --> 03:21:35.400
[Guest]: there are a lot of light touch investments we can make that allow

03:21:35.400 --> 03:21:39.760
[Guest]: markets to function better okay I mean even without being directly in the

03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:43.040
[Guest]: business of provision or insurance or reimbursement okay so part of the

03:21:43.040 --> 03:21:47.960
[Guest]: problem today is we have no transparent source of data on who the providers are

03:21:47.960 --> 03:21:50.600
[Guest]: so if you're sitting in your city you have no idea who's practicing around you

03:21:50.600 --> 03:21:54.920
[Guest]: right I mean and so now there are companies obviously information is

03:21:54.920 --> 03:21:58.040
[Guest]: valuable right so there are companies that have tried to set up a business say

03:21:58.040 --> 03:22:01.480
[Guest]: I think in education I was looking for some schools and then you get these

03:22:01.480 --> 03:22:04.800
[Guest]: private companies that say school ratings but then the revenue model for

03:22:04.800 --> 03:22:08.800
[Guest]: them is either the school or the hospital is paying to get rated and then

03:22:08.800 --> 03:22:13.160
[Guest]: you have the agency problem that you had with say credit ratings or the user is

03:22:13.160 --> 03:22:16.480
[Guest]: paying to access that which means it is restricted in the user base and as

03:22:16.480 --> 03:22:19.660
[Guest]: information is fundamentally a public good so as in public good in the sense

03:22:19.660 --> 03:22:23.120
[Guest]: that once you've created it the marginal cost of spreading it is zero right so if

03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:26.280
[Guest]: a government won't do this which they should but don't have the capacity of

03:22:26.280 --> 03:22:30.040
[Guest]: the money to do one incredibly leveraged thing philanthropy can do is just come

03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:33.400
[Guest]: and create kind of open source information platforms like I mean that

03:22:33.400 --> 03:22:37.280
[Guest]: allows you to just crowdsource over time think who are all the providers in a

03:22:37.280 --> 03:22:42.880
[Guest]: given market right I mean now and then over time you could have like a small

03:22:42.880 --> 03:22:46.080
[Guest]: cadre of dedicated staff who will then go and do field verification of each of

03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:50.080
[Guest]: these guys right like I mean so make it a positive revelation game for people to

03:22:50.080 --> 03:22:52.880
[Guest]: want to be listed in the portal as somebody who's providing services with a

03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:56.280
[Guest]: certain level of kind of qualifications or basic details of what their practice

03:22:56.280 --> 03:23:01.920
[Guest]: is but I think we underestimate the value of just good information okay so

03:23:01.920 --> 03:23:05.800
[Guest]: Jishnu has a series of very nice papers in Pakistan looking at information on

03:23:05.800 --> 03:23:08.960
[Guest]: school quality right I mean and what they find is just providing better

03:23:08.960 --> 03:23:13.640
[Guest]: information on school quality without any additional money right leads to huge

03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:18.000
[Guest]: downstream positive impacts over time because it just you know it makes the

03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:22.080
[Guest]: market much more transparent and it forces you to react to kind of what is

03:23:22.080 --> 03:23:25.280
[Guest]: possible and what you see in the market so let me stop there I mean I have even

03:23:25.280 --> 03:23:28.760
[Guest]: more ideas but I think these are enough to kind of I think you know clarifying

03:23:28.760 --> 03:23:32.480
[Guest]: some of these conceptual issues and hopefully providing some direction of

03:23:32.480 --> 03:23:35.720
[Amit Varma]: where we need to go. These are stimulating ideas and I hope young

03:23:35.720 --> 03:23:39.920
[Amit Varma]: entrepreneurs listening to this can take inspiration from this I mean why do you

03:23:39.920 --> 03:23:44.200
[Amit Varma]: need a philanthropist necessarily throwing a hundred million dollars or a or the evil

03:23:44.200 --> 03:23:47.400
[Amit Varma]: dysfunctional state coming in and say yeah we can do it we'll show Amit that

03:23:47.400 --> 03:23:51.180
[Amit Varma]: we can also do some work you know where is a private enterprise you know there

03:23:51.180 --> 03:23:55.640
[Amit Varma]: are so many areas to fix here these are the problems worth solving so kindly

03:23:55.640 --> 03:23:59.400
[Amit Varma]: come in and try that is my message to all young entrepreneurs listening to

03:23:59.400 --> 03:24:02.800
[Amit Varma]: this you are giving messages to health minister through my show boss what are

03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:07.520
[Amit Varma]: you even thinking you know right but never mind you know maybe maybe the

03:24:07.520 --> 03:24:11.920
[Amit Varma]: person who will be health minister of India in 2035 is listening to this now

03:24:11.920 --> 03:24:17.720
[Amit Varma]: so kindly I hope your attention is good let's talk about the podcast will still

03:24:17.720 --> 03:24:21.160
[Guest]: be available I think you know I mean one of the things I think you mentioned in

03:24:21.160 --> 03:24:24.880
[Guest]: your chat with Milan Vaishnav I think after the first episode with Pratap is

03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:28.640
[Guest]: that you know the point in some ways yes I think it makes sense to discuss health

03:24:28.640 --> 03:24:33.080
[Guest]: right now when we're in the COVID moment but it's almost more effective I think

03:24:33.080 --> 03:24:37.400
[Guest]: rather than making prognosis in the fog of war to kind of focus on the first

03:24:37.400 --> 03:24:42.000
[Guest]: principles of just the largest structure and these things will then you know play

03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:46.880
[Amit Varma]: through regardless yeah like my my conceit was that I am making episodes

03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:50.680
[Amit Varma]: for 30 years later so I don't want to go across space I won't also want to go

03:24:50.680 --> 03:24:55.160
[Amit Varma]: across time and of course it is possible one reason I came up with that

03:24:55.160 --> 03:24:58.680
[Amit Varma]: highfalutin idea was because I thought no one will listen to me in the present

03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:02.600
[Amit Varma]: time but clearly that is not the case people listen I think the idea to create

03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:06.840
[Amit Varma]: timeless content is great and that's also why it's it's so wonderful that

03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:10.880
[Amit Varma]: you've come on the show twice because I think both of these episodes education

03:25:10.880 --> 03:25:15.720
[Amit Varma]: and healthcare are almost so useful in terms of providing foundational

03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:20.040
[Amit Varma]: understanding while we aim for the timeless we also have to address the

03:25:20.040 --> 03:25:24.240
[Amit Varma]: times so let's let's kind of get to COVID now on COVID I've done episodes

03:25:24.240 --> 03:25:27.960
[Amit Varma]: with economists of various types I've done you know episodes on it with

03:25:27.960 --> 03:25:31.920
[Amit Varma]: relief workers who are out there feeding people with data journalists with

03:25:31.920 --> 03:25:36.080
[Amit Varma]: epidemiologists with scientists who are you know good at describing what the

03:25:36.080 --> 03:25:40.480
[Amit Varma]: virus is but even though you don't call yourself a healthcare economist you

03:25:40.480 --> 03:25:44.360
[Amit Varma]: you're probably the closest to that definition with whom I guess Ajay also

03:25:44.360 --> 03:25:48.680
[Amit Varma]: to a fair extent because you're both economists interested in who have looked

03:25:48.680 --> 03:25:54.240
[Amit Varma]: deeply into healthcare so what's what's your sense like what could we have done

03:25:54.240 --> 03:25:58.720
[Amit Varma]: differently which is not obvious in hindsight yes I think I don't want to do

03:25:58.720 --> 03:26:02.040
[Guest]: Monday morning quarterbacking because I think while there is a space for

03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:05.760
[Guest]: accountability in our public discourse I think the problem when you kind of

03:26:05.760 --> 03:26:09.080
[Guest]: and that's important right this is not to say that there shouldn't be

03:26:09.080 --> 03:26:12.880
[Guest]: accountability for people who were asleep at the wheel but when in this

03:26:12.880 --> 03:26:17.040
[Guest]: moment right mean when you go down that road you essentially create

03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:21.360
[Guest]: defensiveness right like I mean and so I would like to kind of unapologetically

03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:25.360
[Guest]: focus on what do we do today and going forward right I mean what has happened

03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:28.640
[Guest]: has happened right so I think they're really just three points right mean

03:26:28.640 --> 03:26:32.840
[Guest]: which is the last year we thought about ventilators this year we are focusing on

03:26:32.840 --> 03:26:36.400
[Guest]: oxygen okay like I mean which is visceral because you see people dying

03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:39.640
[Guest]: and you kind of immediately see that I need to get oxygen that's important

03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:44.800
[Guest]: right but I think the most important message again is what is the public

03:26:44.800 --> 03:26:47.640
[Guest]: health and what are the things that the government should be doing that and

03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:52.240
[Guest]: again optimizing the cost see one of I remember reading somewhere right that in

03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:56.880
[Guest]: in a war any decision you make is going to have some casualties okay because

03:26:56.880 --> 03:27:01.840
[Guest]: there are only bad choices right so the point of leadership in a fog of war is

03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:06.040
[Guest]: to assess the risks and kind of be able to take a reasonable decision that is

03:27:06.040 --> 03:27:09.720
[Guest]: informed by the best information available with a certain amount of

03:27:09.720 --> 03:27:12.720
[Guest]: transparency so that the public continues to have confidence in the

03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:15.480
[Guest]: leadership right mean and I think that is something which I will definitely say

03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:19.120
[Guest]: has been lacking and consistency of communication and transparency to the

03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:21.880
[Guest]: public about where we are and where we are going I think is incredibly

03:27:21.880 --> 03:27:25.080
[Guest]: important so that being said I would really just say three things okay so

03:27:25.080 --> 03:27:28.560
[Guest]: there is obviously a piece of what we need to do that is just on the sheer

03:27:28.560 --> 03:27:32.520
[Guest]: logistics of hospital beds or oxygen and stuff like that and even there I think

03:27:32.520 --> 03:27:35.840
[Guest]: the important things are not so much getting somebody oxygen Twitter like you

03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:37.840
[Guest]: said because like I was saying that means somebody else is not getting it

03:27:37.840 --> 03:27:41.760
[Guest]: it's really intervening to reduce the frictions right is there excess oxygen

03:27:41.760 --> 03:27:44.880
[Guest]: somewhere and somebody needing it somewhere else is that oxygen going to

03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:49.080
[Guest]: places where there is no trained operator to use it right so we need kind

03:27:49.080 --> 03:27:52.440
[Guest]: of mindful interventions because there's complementarities across these different

03:27:52.440 --> 03:27:56.760
[Guest]: pieces and so that I think is important but I would say the single most

03:27:56.760 --> 03:27:59.520
[Guest]: important thing we need to do see the end game is vaccines okay there's no

03:27:59.520 --> 03:28:02.440
[Guest]: question but the vaccines are going to take a minimum of six to nine months to

03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:06.520
[Guest]: roll out across the population okay so what do we have evidence on today is the

03:28:06.520 --> 03:28:09.680
[Guest]: one thing that the country should just be doing in a war footing is masking

03:28:09.680 --> 03:28:14.240
[Guest]: okay because we know a lot more about this disease in the past year we spent a

03:28:14.240 --> 03:28:17.440
[Guest]: lot of time cleaning surfaces we spent a lot of time doing other things what we

03:28:17.440 --> 03:28:21.520
[Guest]: now know is that the vast majority of transmission is airborne this is

03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:26.080
[Guest]: fundamentally an airborne disease and it is completely you know unglamorous

03:28:26.080 --> 03:28:31.360
[Guest]: simple but it works okay and so the surgical masks they just work now and

03:28:31.360 --> 03:28:34.240
[Guest]: again this is a case where unfortunately I think the public messaging was a

03:28:34.240 --> 03:28:37.160
[Guest]: little mixed in the beginning because WHO in the beginning said masks are not

03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:39.960
[Guest]: needed but that's because they were trying to save masks for the health care

03:28:39.960 --> 03:28:43.760
[Guest]: workers so that was a case where I think the communication was actually wrong

03:28:43.760 --> 03:28:47.200
[Guest]: because it gave the sense it was not needed it is unambiguously clear that

03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:50.960
[Guest]: you need the masks that they work okay and we now have the supply elasticity of

03:28:50.960 --> 03:28:54.980
[Guest]: that is basically infinite you can get those masks at scale okay so what we

03:28:54.980 --> 03:28:59.080
[Guest]: need is just a very simple public communication to the nation and maybe by

03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:01.700
[Guest]: chief ministers if not at the national level to just say the following three

03:29:01.700 --> 03:29:07.240
[Guest]: things right which is saying that the lockdown is an incredibly costly last

03:29:07.240 --> 03:29:10.400
[Guest]: option the big cities are doing this because we have no choice for two weeks

03:29:10.400 --> 03:29:14.560
[Guest]: but the end game is going to come when everybody's vaccinated and between now

03:29:14.560 --> 03:29:18.360
[Guest]: and everybody being vaccinated we need everybody to essentially take the

03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:21.680
[Guest]: masking seriously I would say the government should spend the money it

03:29:21.680 --> 03:29:25.840
[Guest]: takes to procure masks like you know so my contemporary Mushfiq Mubarak who's

03:29:25.840 --> 03:29:29.680
[Guest]: basically my batchmate was a professor of economics at Yale from Bangladesh in

03:29:29.680 --> 03:29:33.960
[Guest]: the past one year he has put together a consortium of kind of engineers medical

03:29:33.960 --> 03:29:36.600
[Guest]: experts from Stanford across universities and they've really been

03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:40.340
[Guest]: doing a lot of research on masking and both in terms of you know what is the

03:29:40.340 --> 03:29:43.120
[Guest]: most effective type of mask right you know the surgical mask what kind of

03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:46.520
[Guest]: filters and they've been doing a lot of work on testing different models of

03:29:46.520 --> 03:29:49.640
[Guest]: behavior change communication so they've done randomized control trials now in

03:29:49.640 --> 03:29:53.200
[Guest]: Bangladesh with different villages doing different models and they now have

03:29:53.200 --> 03:29:56.000
[Guest]: enough results from this I think that paper will be forthcoming in science

03:29:56.000 --> 03:30:00.940
[Guest]: soon and they've done a series of kind of webinars I think in India but the

03:30:00.940 --> 03:30:04.120
[Guest]: steps are very very clear right literally go door-to-door in every

03:30:04.120 --> 03:30:07.520
[Guest]: village right mean procure four masks per family like give them the mask and

03:30:07.520 --> 03:30:11.360
[Guest]: now why does the giving the mask matter it matters because not only are you

03:30:11.360 --> 03:30:14.520
[Guest]: signaling to every citizen that this is important that the government is doing

03:30:14.520 --> 03:30:18.680
[Guest]: this but you are also making it common knowledge that everybody has gotten the

03:30:18.680 --> 03:30:21.880
[Guest]: mask okay so it's no longer acceptable to be around without the mask because

03:30:21.880 --> 03:30:24.680
[Guest]: you know the government has come and hand-delivered this at your door right

03:30:24.680 --> 03:30:28.400
[Guest]: so they have procured a washable mask and so this is washable but a set of

03:30:28.400 --> 03:30:31.160
[Guest]: four means you wear a different one like every week you wash them and wear that

03:30:31.160 --> 03:30:35.080
[Guest]: then there is this piece about you need an all-of-government approach on this

03:30:35.080 --> 03:30:38.300
[Guest]: that it's not just the health workers but it's the gram you know it's the

03:30:38.300 --> 03:30:41.280
[Guest]: panchayat and in a way the rural areas are even more important right because

03:30:41.280 --> 03:30:43.760
[Guest]: the health care infrastructure in the urban areas at least you can do

03:30:43.760 --> 03:30:46.400
[Guest]: something about in the rural areas you don't even have the health

03:30:46.400 --> 03:30:50.320
[Guest]: infrastructure so prevention is your only game in town okay so you need an

03:30:50.320 --> 03:30:54.200
[Guest]: all-hands-on-government approach saying between the health workers, the ASHA

03:30:54.200 --> 03:30:59.240
[Guest]: workers, the Anganwadi workers, the ANMs, the village sarpanch, all of the ward

03:30:59.240 --> 03:31:04.080
[Guest]: members, the panchayati raj officials all hands on deck right I mean this is an

03:31:04.080 --> 03:31:06.960
[Guest]: all-of-government approach to saying you're going to get you the masks and

03:31:06.960 --> 03:31:10.320
[Guest]: this is going to happen get the communication going in a standardized

03:31:10.320 --> 03:31:13.480
[Guest]: way use your film stars use your cricketers use whatever to just kind of

03:31:13.480 --> 03:31:17.240
[Guest]: reinforce again and again and again that there's the basics of the disease right

03:31:17.240 --> 03:31:21.680
[Guest]: and sometimes repetition is good that have the simple graph that says this is

03:31:21.680 --> 03:31:25.640
[Guest]: fundamentally airborne so you know we obviously the epidemiologists need to

03:31:25.640 --> 03:31:28.840
[Guest]: worry a lot about variants and sequencing and what is happening but for

03:31:28.840 --> 03:31:32.040
[Guest]: the arm janta that is irrelevant right what is relevant is that this is an

03:31:32.040 --> 03:31:36.400
[Guest]: airborne disease and the way you kind of contain spread is making universal

03:31:36.400 --> 03:31:39.760
[Guest]: masking till everybody's vaccinated that's it and a simple way of saying

03:31:39.760 --> 03:31:43.800
[Guest]: this you know one thing I feel strongly about is that the 35,000 crore cost of

03:31:43.800 --> 03:31:46.840
[Guest]: universal vaccination I mean it's rounding error right like I mean

03:31:46.840 --> 03:31:49.880
[Guest]: compared to the cost of the disease of the cost of a lockdown I think of a

03:31:49.880 --> 03:31:54.680
[Guest]: nationwide lockdown costs about 200,000 crores a week okay and if vaccinating

03:31:54.680 --> 03:31:58.080
[Guest]: everybody cost 35,000 crores like you know you should just write a check from

03:31:58.080 --> 03:32:00.840
[Guest]: the government of India not even ask a question and just get it done right so

03:32:00.840 --> 03:32:05.040
[Guest]: similarly at a state level if it's I think our estimate and the masking right

03:32:05.040 --> 03:32:07.800
[Guest]: now is that it'll cost maybe 50 200 crores like you know to do the

03:32:07.800 --> 03:32:11.800
[Guest]: procurement and just get this done but the cost of a lockdown in an average

03:32:11.800 --> 03:32:15.280
[Guest]: size Indian state is about 2,000 crores a week right I mean so or sorry 2,000

03:32:15.280 --> 03:32:17.960
[Guest]: crores a day about somewhere between thousand 2,000 crores depending on the

03:32:17.960 --> 03:32:21.600
[Guest]: intensity of lockout so and this is essentially I feel so strongly about

03:32:21.600 --> 03:32:24.920
[Guest]: this because this is the core point of public health versus curative health

03:32:24.920 --> 03:32:28.280
[Guest]: right which we've talked about throughout this class so sorry I almost

03:32:28.280 --> 03:32:34.160
[Amit Varma]: feel like I have made it a class. I am perfectly happy to be a student in your class no issues

03:32:34.160 --> 03:32:38.200
[Amit Varma]: we are all me and all my listeners we are the biggest class you ever had

03:32:38.200 --> 03:32:42.680
[Guest]: probably this is true this is true but no I think you know but this is why I

03:32:42.680 --> 03:32:46.520
[Guest]: think it's useful to understand the first principles and then all be able to

03:32:46.520 --> 03:32:49.680
[Guest]: apply those first principles to the problem at hand right the first

03:32:49.680 --> 03:32:53.800
[Guest]: principles is the ROI and spending on public health dwarfs like you know so

03:32:53.800 --> 03:32:57.560
[Guest]: tomorrow now we are already talking about needing to do cash transfers to

03:32:57.560 --> 03:33:01.480
[Guest]: kind of alleviate the suffering from job loss absolutely that's correct but that

03:33:01.480 --> 03:33:05.480
[Guest]: palliative measure is going to cost you already 10 times 15 times 20 times what

03:33:05.480 --> 03:33:08.520
[Guest]: it will cost you to do universal accelerate vaccinations in every

03:33:08.520 --> 03:33:11.640
[Guest]: possible way and get the universal masking going for the next six to nine

03:33:11.640 --> 03:33:15.220
[Guest]: months right I mean so and think about it this way if there was an enemy at the

03:33:15.220 --> 03:33:19.280
[Guest]: border during wars I remember my grandfather like you know my mother

03:33:19.280 --> 03:33:24.720
[Guest]: remembers growing up in Agartala in 1971 like you know during the that 71 war

03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:27.880
[Guest]: and yeah there would be these sirens there would be blackouts like you know

03:33:27.880 --> 03:33:33.120
[Guest]: when there's kind of enemy air sorties coming and everybody every single person

03:33:33.120 --> 03:33:37.320
[Guest]: would turn their lights off right because you knew that one light on was

03:33:37.320 --> 03:33:41.080
[Guest]: kind of enough to give the whole game away right I mean and so you know but if

03:33:41.080 --> 03:33:45.080
[Guest]: you look at the statistics pandemics kill like we've lost more people in that

03:33:45.080 --> 03:33:49.840
[Guest]: the 1918 to 1920 kind of you know Spanish flu in India then ten times more

03:33:49.840 --> 03:33:53.280
[Guest]: than World War one and World War two put together right like I mean so why are we

03:33:53.280 --> 03:33:58.000
[Guest]: not treating it with that level of urgency where the only contribution we

03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:02.000
[Guest]: are asking every citizen to do is wear that mask and wear it at every single

03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:05.160
[Guest]: point when you're outside avoid the large gatherings and the government can

03:34:05.160 --> 03:34:09.480
[Guest]: kind of help and accelerate this by procuring and don't stop don't do

03:34:09.480 --> 03:34:13.680
[Guest]: distributing for masks to every family and just make it happen right I mean so

03:34:13.680 --> 03:34:16.760
[Guest]: that's the one thing which I feel very confident about saying that we just

03:34:16.760 --> 03:34:21.000
[Guest]: simply have to do I won't get into you know politics of vaccine pricing and

03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:24.360
[Guest]: procurement and all of that I think I just talked about that but you know I

03:34:24.360 --> 03:34:27.560
[Guest]: would just say regardless of what formula we use government of India state

03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:30.440
[Guest]: governments like you know just spend the money it takes to get the vaccines done

03:34:30.440 --> 03:34:35.040
[Guest]: and kind of don't try to nickel and dime and get poor patients to pay like

03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:38.160
[Guest]: five hundred thousand rupees like you know it's kind of completely completely

03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:41.840
[Amit Varma]: foolhardy so you mentioned the term there which kind of triggered a memory

03:34:41.840 --> 03:34:45.760
[Amit Varma]: of a recent news headline which is you said panchayat and I thought of how in

03:34:45.760 --> 03:34:51.320
[Amit Varma]: UP these 700 teachers died because they were sent on panchayat duty because the

03:34:51.320 --> 03:34:54.240
[Amit Varma]: UP government refused to you know postpone the elections they send these

03:34:54.240 --> 03:34:57.800
[Amit Varma]: teachers on government duty they died in fact a recent report from May 6 says

03:34:57.800 --> 03:35:01.320
[Amit Varma]: it's more than a thousand by now the death toll and there was a story of a

03:35:01.320 --> 03:35:06.160
[Amit Varma]: woman who you know her husband couldn't go because he was literally on his death

03:35:06.160 --> 03:35:09.640
[Amit Varma]: bed he ended up dying I think and she was asked by the government that why is

03:35:09.640 --> 03:35:13.280
[Amit Varma]: your husband not coming for duty and she had to send a photograph of him on his

03:35:13.280 --> 03:35:18.360
[Amit Varma]: hospital bed as proof something of that sort and that and to me that's murder by

03:35:18.360 --> 03:35:22.840
[Amit Varma]: the way plain and simple murder by the state and that kind of leads me to the

03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:26.240
[Amit Varma]: thought that of course I agree with you we should do universal masking but what

03:35:26.240 --> 03:35:30.320
[Amit Varma]: we're really talking about here is two things information and messaging that

03:35:30.320 --> 03:35:33.880
[Amit Varma]: this is a correct information we should get out there but this is messaging we

03:35:33.880 --> 03:35:37.240
[Amit Varma]: should be done in the public interest what we instead see the kind of

03:35:37.240 --> 03:35:41.040
[Amit Varma]: messaging that we see is actually spreading the wrong kind of information

03:35:41.040 --> 03:35:44.640
[Amit Varma]: like coronil is good for you you know that ayurvedic thing and that will cure

03:35:44.640 --> 03:35:48.600
[Amit Varma]: you or there will be a godman who will say that there's no problem with oxygen

03:35:48.600 --> 03:35:52.200
[Amit Varma]: you just need to learn how to breathe right and you need to do these yoga

03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:56.160
[Amit Varma]: poses and all that and for once I'm moving away by the way you will note

03:35:56.160 --> 03:36:00.080
[Amit Varma]: from criticizing the state to criticizing society itself because our

03:36:00.080 --> 03:36:04.000
[Amit Varma]: society honestly we elites in the first class of this plane and all that we

03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:07.400
[Amit Varma]: might think that we read books we read papers in your case you write papers and

03:36:07.400 --> 03:36:11.880
[Amit Varma]: we are all okay but we are a very backward country look at the things we

03:36:11.880 --> 03:36:16.520
[Amit Varma]: believe it seems to me to be an insurmountable challenge at two levels

03:36:16.520 --> 03:36:19.960
[Amit Varma]: and I don't mean to be negative and say that we shouldn't try at all and you

03:36:19.960 --> 03:36:23.880
[Guest]: know and so in fact I had not intended to talk about say Indian systems of

03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:26.400
[Guest]: health care or like you know alternative systems of health care but let me say I

03:36:26.400 --> 03:36:30.880
[Guest]: think one important point here right which is see I think if you read Sanjay

03:36:30.880 --> 03:36:34.800
[Guest]: Bharu's recent book see a big part of the current dispensation in government

03:36:34.800 --> 03:36:40.160
[Guest]: is something that reflects this deep sense of angst that the greatness of

03:36:40.160 --> 03:36:43.560
[Guest]: Indian history right mean and traditions and cultures like you know are being

03:36:43.560 --> 03:36:47.960
[Guest]: undervalued by kind of you know modernity and I think some of this is

03:36:47.960 --> 03:36:51.240
[Guest]: language right mean that the English-speaking class has been you know

03:36:51.240 --> 03:36:56.600
[Guest]: we have been incredibly remiss I think in kind of not getting scientific

03:36:56.600 --> 03:37:00.080
[Guest]: content right mean out in local languages in a way that it's kind of

03:37:00.080 --> 03:37:03.880
[Guest]: much more accessible so you know there's and in fact when I started writing my

03:37:03.880 --> 03:37:06.960
[Guest]: column in HT one of the reasons I picked HT was I spent a lot of time trying to

03:37:06.960 --> 03:37:09.720
[Guest]: translate and write in Hindi like I mean in Hindustan but it turned out too

03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:12.320
[Guest]: technical and like I think they told me Kinneboss you'll have to simplify this

03:37:12.320 --> 03:37:16.320
[Guest]: but that's a separate story but but at least the intent was there okay but the

03:37:16.320 --> 03:37:20.360
[Guest]: but no but I think here's the point I want to make is that see modern clinical

03:37:20.360 --> 03:37:24.880
[Guest]: trials okay so I do RCTs for a living I believe in RCTs and it came from

03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:29.400
[Guest]: medicine okay but that being said there is one big blind spot right which is

03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:33.040
[Guest]: conditional on doing a particular study we randomize the treatment and saying

03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:37.240
[Guest]: did this treatment have an effect okay but the universe of treatments that get

03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:41.200
[Guest]: evaluated by RCTs is highly selective right you know so what determines what

03:37:41.200 --> 03:37:46.440
[Guest]: gets evaluated correct so now to me the right way of kind of bridging I would

03:37:46.440 --> 03:37:50.000
[Guest]: say the tradition and the strength we have in our traditional system see here

03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:53.720
[Guest]: is my view of our traditional systems is that a lot of it may be quackery a lot

03:37:53.720 --> 03:37:58.260
[Guest]: of it may be placebo but just by natural selection okay the fact that something

03:37:58.260 --> 03:38:00.880
[Guest]: has survived for three thousand four thousand five thousand years means that

03:38:00.880 --> 03:38:05.360
[Guest]: there is likely to be some survivorship bias okay that if people say take ginger

03:38:05.360 --> 03:38:08.360
[Guest]: or take turmeric or take honey right like you know that is not kind of

03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:12.400
[Guest]: pharmaceutically done but that has a bunch of so my throat after talking for

03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:15.240
[Guest]: us what am I drinking I'm just drinking honey water like you know with herbal

03:38:15.240 --> 03:38:22.280
[Guest]: tea right so but where I think we need to really be thoughtful about bridging

03:38:22.280 --> 03:38:26.200
[Guest]: kind of the greatness of our traditions with the modern scientific standards is

03:38:26.200 --> 03:38:29.700
[Guest]: to say instead of claiming that we had all of these great things in plastic

03:38:29.700 --> 03:38:33.180
[Guest]: surgery in the back days I can always say here is a body of traditional

03:38:33.180 --> 03:38:37.200
[Guest]: knowledge that we can now invest in testing like you know with more modern

03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:40.680
[Guest]: scientific methods and then validate rather than waiting for Western

03:38:40.680 --> 03:38:43.720
[Guest]: pharmaceutical companies to come and patent like name and like you know I

03:38:43.720 --> 03:38:46.520
[Guest]: mean it's a good right like you know all these kind of things that we've been

03:38:46.520 --> 03:38:51.520
[Guest]: doing traditionally you know so in that way we've known it works so why leave it

03:38:51.520 --> 03:38:54.760
[Guest]: to the Westerners to come and bring modern science to our traditions as

03:38:54.760 --> 03:38:58.080
[Guest]: opposed to kind of taking the traditions and meeting the science and kind of

03:38:58.080 --> 03:39:00.320
[Guest]: getting the best of both worlds and the Chinese have been very good at this I

03:39:00.320 --> 03:39:03.400
[Guest]: forget the name of the scientist but somebody who won a Nobel Prize like you

03:39:03.400 --> 03:39:06.720
[Guest]: know I mean for medicine actually did exactly this right mean take a bunch of

03:39:06.720 --> 03:39:10.320
[Guest]: traditional medicine but then validate and some of these will not be true okay

03:39:10.320 --> 03:39:14.040
[Guest]: the whole point of kind of the modern RCTs is some of these will in fact have

03:39:14.040 --> 03:39:17.080
[Guest]: been placebos of folk wisdom but some of them will turn out to be very effective

03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:21.280
[Guest]: I share your despair at kind of pop science like you know and the marketing

03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:25.640
[Guest]: around it but I think it's important to recognize the source of cultural angst

03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:29.200
[Guest]: right I mean of where it comes from and then find a constructive way to channel

03:39:29.200 --> 03:39:33.640
[Guest]: that angst in a way that reflects a modern scientific temperament yeah I

03:39:33.640 --> 03:39:36.240
[Amit Varma]: mean I look I have nothing but respect for the conservative view that if

03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:39.200
[Amit Varma]: something has worked over the centuries I mean there's a reason it's a

03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:43.280
[Amit Varma]: survivorship bias you know putting haldi in doodh when you're ill and all that

03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:46.880
[Amit Varma]: it's fine I'm cool with that I have an issue with things like this coronel

03:39:46.880 --> 03:39:51.400
[Amit Varma]: stuff or you know a yogic pose will solve your oxygen problem which to me is

03:39:51.400 --> 03:39:54.800
[Amit Varma]: just offensive to the people who actually suffer from it I have a problem

03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:58.560
[Amit Varma]: with those but that's a separate issue I mean two of the major problems that I

03:39:58.560 --> 03:40:02.760
[Amit Varma]: have with you know our modern times have been expressed by us in this episode

03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:06.880
[Amit Varma]: which is the incentives problem and the narratives problem and neither of those

03:40:06.880 --> 03:40:11.200
[Amit Varma]: is going to go away anytime soon so but before I let you go let's turn away from

03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:14.880
[Amit Varma]: healthcare for a moment what have you been reading recently outside of work

03:40:14.880 --> 03:40:18.760
[Amit Varma]: let's say what are the last three books which filled you with joy we all which

03:40:18.760 --> 03:40:24.880
[Amit Varma]: you thoroughly enjoyed which you can recommend to me and my listeners except

03:40:24.880 --> 03:40:28.440
[Amit Varma]: that you know kindly don't put some random academic thing and say no no I

03:40:28.440 --> 03:40:33.360
[Amit Varma]: got joy from this and all that no no outside of that so here's the bad news

03:40:33.360 --> 03:40:38.480
[Guest]: and the good news okay so the the bad news is I have not actually done much

03:40:38.480 --> 03:40:42.360
[Guest]: reading in the past year year and a half because I've mainly been reading things

03:40:42.360 --> 03:40:46.040
[Guest]: around my book the good news is that my main source of new knowledge has been

03:40:46.040 --> 03:40:50.640
[Guest]: listening to podcasts including yours right like you know I mean and so one of

03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:54.440
[Guest]: my routines here in this pandemic and again San Diego it's interesting you

03:40:54.440 --> 03:40:57.080
[Guest]: mentioned Eric Topol right because he's here in San Diego and San Diego is just

03:40:57.080 --> 03:40:59.840
[Guest]: like a magical place to be in in some ways right because you can just go out

03:40:59.840 --> 03:41:04.440
[Guest]: in long walks and so yeah my source of absorbing new knowledge in the pandemic

03:41:04.440 --> 03:41:08.960
[Guest]: has actually been primarily audio and podcasts okay so yeah so somebody else

03:41:08.960 --> 03:41:11.880
[Guest]: would ask me I would say go listen to a bunch of seen and unseen episodes and

03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:15.040
[Guest]: I'm not saying this to flatter you because I had not done it in 180 at the

03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:18.840
[Guest]: time I did the first one but I have done as you can see from the connections I'm

03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:23.320
[Amit Varma]: making okay what are your favorite episode shallow what are your favorite

03:41:23.320 --> 03:41:27.120
[Guest]: episodes I mean obviously the one with Pratap was a classic like you know I

03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:31.160
[Guest]: mean that happened like you know immediately immediately after mine you

03:41:31.160 --> 03:41:34.640
[Guest]: know I enjoyed the one with Vinay Sitapati a lot though I mean I did think

03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:38.640
[Guest]: it kind of I would say whitewashed a little bit like you mean of kind of the

03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:42.120
[Guest]: larger narrative like you know of the rise of the RSS but I think overall I

03:41:42.120 --> 03:41:47.240
[Guest]: really enjoyed hearing the bit about the combination of legal journalistic and

03:41:47.240 --> 03:41:51.200
[Guest]: scholarly training in that book right and so I I can see the lack of the

03:41:51.200 --> 03:41:54.480
[Guest]: journalistic training in my own writing like you know because I'll do the fact

03:41:54.480 --> 03:41:59.320
[Guest]: checking in the same rigor as an academic but I haven't learned the craft

03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:04.440
[Guest]: of storytelling in my writing nearly as much right so that piece is a lot more

03:42:04.440 --> 03:42:07.240
[Guest]: work for me because you know I get the content right but then I have to

03:42:07.240 --> 03:42:10.200
[Guest]: simplify which is why I'm still saying I might do four podcasts and say

03:42:10.200 --> 03:42:17.480
[Amit Varma]: book chhodo yaar. You're most welcome to write a book but you're also welcome as a

03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:23.320
[Amit Varma]: supplementary effort a supplementary teacher training you can say but I

03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:26.480
[Guest]: enjoyed that in terms of the process of writing I've enjoyed like your recent

03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:30.800
[Guest]: scientific ones like you know with again I keep calling him bhalo manush but

03:42:30.800 --> 03:42:34.320
[Unknown]: Anirban right you know I think that was I think that was fun I think you know

03:42:34.320 --> 03:42:37.200
[Guest]: just going back in or Gautam like you know hearing people talk about the joy

03:42:37.200 --> 03:42:40.600
[Guest]: of science and I mean I'm a nerd I'm an academic at heart so yeah as a way of

03:42:40.600 --> 03:42:44.040
[Guest]: kind of learning you know people who have been at the cutting edge of other

03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:46.560
[Guest]: disciplines talking about their work I think that's the part I've really

03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:50.240
[Amit Varma]: enjoyed. Well I think many many many listeners of the seen and the unseen

03:42:50.240 --> 03:42:53.800
[Amit Varma]: would actually say that you are one of their favorite guests so once again

03:42:53.800 --> 03:42:58.240
[Amit Varma]: thank you so much for coming on the show and I hope our conversation keeps

03:42:58.240 --> 03:43:03.200
[Amit Varma]: continuing over the months and and good luck with your book and yeah take good

03:43:03.200 --> 03:43:07.280
[Amit Varma]: care of yourself as Amitabh Bachchan says on KBC and take good care of yourself

03:43:07.280 --> 03:43:10.680
[Amit Varma]: what else does he say that Shabba Khair line?

03:43:10.680 --> 03:43:13.480
[Guest]: Haan matlab gaana toh hai meriyaar Shabba Khair like you know

03:43:13.480 --> 03:43:16.440
[Amit Varma]: dinisara mizara tohre angana which is like where I know the line from

03:43:16.440 --> 03:43:19.720
[Amit Varma]: No at the end of KBC he used to say that he used to say a line which had Shabba Khair at the end of it

03:43:19.720 --> 03:43:23.560
[Guest]: it was quite a flourish. You know actually on our past episode I think

03:43:23.560 --> 03:43:27.440
[Guest]: somebody had kind of commented there saying achha this was a Bollywood length

03:43:27.440 --> 03:43:30.720
[Guest]: effort like you know why not put in a few song and dance also like you know

03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:35.600
[Guest]: Do you sing? Would you like to sing? Exactly. So what I'm going to sing is I'm going to sing like a

03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:39.600
[Guest]: line for you which reflects I think the writer's angst but it's also you know

03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:43.320
[Guest]: one of my favorite so it's this line from In Custody and Muhafiz right which

03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:52.560
[Unknown]: is aaj ek harf ko phir dhoondta phirta hai khayal

03:43:52.560 --> 03:43:57.440
[Guest]: right which is the poet writing that I have this pot that is running around

03:43:57.440 --> 03:44:02.120
[Guest]: like I mean looking for the right word to land on right I mean so when I kind

03:44:02.120 --> 03:44:05.680
[Guest]: of talk in high school sometimes about Indian education systems that obsesses

03:44:05.680 --> 03:44:09.480
[Guest]: so much in science and math I kind of keep emphasizing language because the

03:44:09.480 --> 03:44:13.080
[Guest]: precision of your thinking is limited by the precision of your language right I

03:44:13.080 --> 03:44:17.880
[Guest]: mean and so that's kind of the dominant emotion as I write right because you'll

03:44:17.880 --> 03:44:21.520
[Guest]: spend kind of sometimes hours grappling for kind of the right phrase the right

03:44:21.520 --> 03:44:25.200
[Guest]: sentence to get something done but yeah so I take that musical box

03:44:25.200 --> 03:44:31.440
[Amit Varma]: pichle baar Tamil mein baat kiya, is baar gaana gaaliya. Lovely, amazing. Muhafiz of course was one of the rare

03:44:31.440 --> 03:44:35.120
[Amit Varma]: films which Ismail Merchant directed himself instead of his partner James

03:44:35.120 --> 03:44:38.280
[Amit Varma]: Ivory doing that. Anything else you'd like to sing? Boss you have a good voice

03:44:38.280 --> 03:44:44.480
[Guest]: yaar. So among the unknown things about me is back in high school right I mean I

03:44:44.480 --> 03:44:50.720
[Guest]: used to be like you know an inter-school Antakshari champion. So I'm gonna give you a

03:44:50.720 --> 03:44:54.080
[Amit Varma]: letter and you got to sing something with that okay. Ho jayega but show pe nahi yaar.

03:44:54.080 --> 03:45:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Nahi abhi ek do line ga do. I'll give you a letter. Theek hai kya letter do. Tumhare naam ka letter deta ho.

03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:07.000
[Amit Varma]: K. Arre nahi yaar. Like no no no. Don't do this to me. Come on. Come on. Listeners will love it. K. Chalo.

03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:12.560
[Amit Varma]: K aur M. I'll give you an option because both are your name only. M say you know so many

03:45:12.560 --> 03:45:16.320
[Guest]: songs will start with maam. Nahi nahi nahi. There's no shortage of songs like you know so in fact

03:45:16.320 --> 03:45:19.840
[Guest]: see here's the tragedy of my Antakshari past also my teammates there were three

03:45:19.840 --> 03:45:23.600
[Guest]: of us okay so the other two had much better voices okay so I was the quantity

03:45:23.600 --> 03:45:29.000
[Guest]: guy they were the quality people okay so so my so what I would often do is

03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:32.200
[Guest]: essentially when the other team would start singing I would already know what

03:45:32.200 --> 03:45:35.640
[Guest]: it's going to end in so I will say achha yeh gaana gaana hai and pass it to my

03:45:35.640 --> 03:45:39.120
[Guest]: teammate who had the better voice for that particular song so so I was kind of

03:45:39.120 --> 03:45:44.880
[Amit Varma]: the intellectual kind of leader of the team. I'm not letting you get away bro. I'm

03:45:44.880 --> 03:45:50.080
[Amit Varma]: sorry this episode is not airing. K aur M. I've given you an option bro. No then you know if I

03:45:50.080 --> 03:45:54.040
[Guest]: want to get very melancholic on the K I would say like you know

03:45:54.040 --> 03:46:06.920
[Unknown]: Kabhi khud pe, kabhi halat pe, rona aaya, kabhi khud pe. And I say that because you know the halat

03:46:06.920 --> 03:46:10.240
[Guest]: have truly been like you know rona inducing so I think part of the problem

03:46:10.240 --> 03:46:14.840
[Guest]: was yeah most of my initial songs with K and M were happy songs and I couldn't

03:46:14.840 --> 03:46:18.360
[Guest]: automatically bring myself to sing those and I think the halat have been really

03:46:18.360 --> 03:46:21.720
[Guest]: hard because you know I had wanted to travel back and I'm not been able to

03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:24.920
[Guest]: travel back and you kind of pray every day for safety of friends and family so

03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:28.840
[Guest]: yeah maybe maybe all survive and get through to the other side and then

03:46:28.840 --> 03:46:32.840
[Amit Varma]: hopefully build a better Indian state. Well the halat may make us cry but you

03:46:32.840 --> 03:46:37.600
