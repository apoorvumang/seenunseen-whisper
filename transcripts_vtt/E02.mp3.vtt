00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.320
[Amit Varma]: It's the morning of November 8, 2016. You are the Prime Minister of India for the rest

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.060
[Amit Varma]: of that day. And in that day, you have to enact exactly one policy, which without breaking

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.600
[Amit Varma]: the law, or going against the constitution of India, hurts the people of India the most.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.800
[Amit Varma]: The maximum damage to the maximum people, whose effects will linger for the longest

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.180
[Amit Varma]: possible time. What will you do? This is a thought experiment I've been posing to my

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.080
[Amit Varma]: friends for the past couple of months, and none of them, not one of them, has come up

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.800
[Amit Varma]: with a policy worse than what our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, actually announced on the evening

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.360
[Unknown]: of November 8. Demonetization. Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:07.680
[Unknown]: on economics, politics and behavioural science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badumal.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, my weekly podcast on the seen and unseen effects of

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.240
[Amit Varma]: public policy and private action. On November 8, 2016, India's Prime Minister, Narendra

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.600
[Amit Varma]: Modi, announced that 500 and 1000 rupee notes would cease to be legal tender from Bindai

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.200
[Amit Varma]: that day. These notes constituted 86% of the cash in circulation, and essentially reached

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.600
[Amit Varma]: into every single pocket in the country. My first reaction when I heard of the move was

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.980
[Amit Varma]: that it was bound to be a disaster. I remembered Frederick Hayek's warning about the limits

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.600
[Amit Varma]: of knowledge. A move like this disrupted too much of the economy, reached into too many

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.800
[Amit Varma]: lives and the unknown unknowns, as it were, the unintended consequences, were terrifying.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.520
[Amit Varma]: It's been just two and a half months since demonetization, or notebandi as it's also

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.760
[Amit Varma]: called, and we are still coming to terms with the initially unseen effects. None of the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.880
[Amit Varma]: news is good. But the interesting thing is that even at the level of initially seen effects,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.640
[Amit Varma]: there is no good news. The government laid out a bunch of desirable objectives, but did

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.880
[Amit Varma]: those really materialize? To discuss the seen and the unseen effects of demonetization,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.640
[Amit Varma]: I have with me today, Suyash Rai, an economic analyst based in Delhi. Suyash, welcome to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640
[Amit Varma]: the show.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.640
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for having me.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.680
[Amit Varma]: Suyash, before I talk about the unintended consequences of demonetization, I want to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.640
[Amit Varma]: talk a bit about the intended effects. A primary intention behind demonetization was to hit

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.200
[Amit Varma]: black money. How far do you think the government succeeded in this?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.880
[Guest]: So let's first understand what the decision was and what are the pathways through which

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.520
[Guest]: it could impact black money and those holding black money. The decision was precisely to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.320
[Guest]: discontinue the legal tender status of 500 and 1000 rupees notes from 8th November midnight.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.960
[Guest]: And these notes basically were 86% of the currency in circulation. And lots of people

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.440
[Guest]: held these notes. And some of these notes must have been held by those who had made

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.400
[Guest]: black money over a period of time. Now, people make black money and then they accumulate

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.680
[Guest]: it over a period of time, right? That's unaccounted wealth is the right term to use for that wealth

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.680
[Guest]: that they hold. And that wealth is held in many forms. Some of it is probably held in

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.600
[Guest]: cash form. Some of it is held in the form of property, binami, in gold, in the form

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.480
[Guest]: of shares, in the form of wealth stored in foreign accounts. So there are many ways in

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.320
[Guest]: which it may be held. And this one pathway of impact on black money from demonetization

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.680
[Guest]: is an attack on the cash form of unaccounted wealth. How much is that? So, I mean, we don't

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.280
[Guest]: have really good estimates of how much is that because we're not observing all the behaviour

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.880
[Guest]: across the country about how unaccounted wealth is stored. But one source of data that we

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.920
[Guest]: have is from the rates that are conducted by the tax authorities all over the country.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.400
[Guest]: So if you look at the data that was provided by the Ministry of Finance in its 2012 white

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.680
[Guest]: paper on black money, it provides data from over 23,000 tax rates conducted over several

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.040
[Guest]: years from 2006 onwards. And what it shows is that from the total undisturbed income

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.700
[Guest]: that is found after these rates are conducted and investigations are conducted and you figure

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.000
[Guest]: out how much was the undisturbed income that a person was having, less than 5% on an average

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.840
[Guest]: is the cash that is caught in these investigations and rates. So it is not a totally precise

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.920
[Guest]: estimate of the unaccounted wealth in cash form, but it's a reasonably good beginning

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.560
[Guest]: point. Now, based on some other considerations that you may have, you can adjust it. But

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.400
[Guest]: if it's less than 5% from this data, I would be very, very, I mean, I would not be keen

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.680
[Guest]: to accept any estimate more than 6, 7% of unaccounted wealth being in cash form. So

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.600
[Guest]: that's what we're talking about here. That's the first pathway. And even if a person loses

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.880
[Guest]: all of that 5, 6%, the welfare loss for him or her is not very big because what can you

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.000
[Guest]: buy with 100 crore that you can't buy with 93 crore or 94 crore, right? So it's an inconvenience.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.640
[Guest]: It's a tough time for a few days, maybe weeks, but it's not going to disrupt your life entirely.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.000
[Guest]: There is another pathway, which we'll know over a period of time how it played out. This

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.040
[Guest]: is a pathway of enforcement opportunities. So what has happened is that lots of people

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.620
[Guest]: must be trying to launder money, trying to hide money, trying to get money exchanged.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.080
[Guest]: So in that process, some of them will make mistakes and will get caught. We're hearing

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.000
[Guest]: lots of news reports of tax authorities conducting raids on people with new money or old money

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.360
[Guest]: trying to get it laundered. So, but it is not adding up to a large number, right? I

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.280
[Guest]: read a report, the Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy had done a summary of all these

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.040
[Guest]: raids that have been conducted. And so far, after two months, this is as of 6th of January

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.720
[Guest]: 2017, the total undisclosed income from all these raids added up to just over 5,000 crore

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.880
[Guest]: rupees. And just imagine you've cancelled 15.4 lakh crore rupees of notes in circulation.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.320
[Guest]: And this pathway gives you, has still not given away 5,000 crore rupees, if this estimate

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.820
[Guest]: is to be believed. The other pathway, which I just talked about, where a loss has been

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:49.320
[Guest]: inflicted upon the person who is holding unaccounted wealth in cash form. We don't even know how

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:57.560
[Guest]: much is that because we have not yet been told. We are recording this on the 12th of

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.480
[Guest]: January 2017. And we don't even know how much money does not come back into the system.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.840
[Guest]: So that's one estimate about how much may have been destroyed in the hands of people

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.520
[Guest]: holding unaccounted wealth. And even the money that doesn't come back, part of it may be

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.040
[Guest]: by genuine people who had to take a loss. Like I read an op-ed by someone who had 50,000

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:24.000
[Guest]: rupees in crisp old, but crisp notes of 500 rupees each. And that person simply had lost

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.640
[Guest]: trace of it and found it after the deadline had expired.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.920
[Guest]: So we are in a situation where we can't truly tell. But even if you assume that all of the

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.480
[Guest]: money that doesn't come back, all the old money that doesn't come back, is basically

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.400
[Guest]: black money that has been disrupted and destroyed. It is not likely to be a big dent on those

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest]: holding black money because we have some idea that their total unaccounted wealth, only

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.280
[Guest]: a small portion of it is in cash flow.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.640
[Amit Varma]: So essentially to sum it up, one, this move attacked the stock and not the flow of black

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.800
[Amit Varma]: money. Two, even as far as the stock of black money was concerned, the estimates by the

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:06.440
[Amit Varma]: finance ministry themselves based on these IT rates showed that around 5% of black money

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.960
[Amit Varma]: is actually kept in the form of cash. And even that from the anecdotal evidence I hear

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.960
[Amit Varma]: all around me has been laundered very, very easily. So black money holders have at best

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.720
[Amit Varma]: suffered the kind of minor inconvenience that the Modi government promised they would, but

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.000
[Amit Varma]: the people would, but the poor have suffered far, far more.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.440
[Amit Varma]: Moving on to sort of the next rationale given for demonetization, which was that this will

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.880
[Amit Varma]: attack fake currency. There's a lot of counterfeit currency out there. There were whispers about

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:41.040
[Amit Varma]: how Pakistan is, you know, introducing fake currency into the market, is used for terrorism

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.840
[Amit Varma]: and so on. How much credence does this explanation hold?

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:52.360
[Guest]: So let me be very clear. This decision will wipe out all the fake currency in the economy.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.720
[Guest]: Most of it, almost. Why? Because we know that most of the fake currency is in 500 and thousand

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.720
[Guest]: rupee notes. So it's an achievement and that's a good thing to have happened. However, let

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.920
[Guest]: me just, I mean, discuss the scale of this problem. So, you know, the problem is being

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.680
[Guest]: solved through this decision, but the scale also matters about how big a problem it was

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.280
[Guest]: and should such a disruptive decision have been taken to solve that problem.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.520
[Guest]: So National Investigation Agency, along with the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.520
[Guest]: had in early 2016 done an estimate of total black money, total fake currency in circulation

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.080
[Guest]: in India, and that estimate pegged it at around 400 crore rupees. So out of about 18 lakh

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:42.160
[Guest]: crore rupees of currency in circulation, only about 400 crore rupees was in fake Indian

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:51.800
[Guest]: currency note, FICN. So one out of 4,000 notes was estimated to be the fake currency. And

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.160
[Guest]: this estimate is not done by some, I mean, you know, independent researcher sitting in

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.080
[Guest]: his office, but by the foremost statistical institute in this country and the foremost

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.320
[Guest]: investigation agency in the country. So that was the scale and this would have disrupted

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.840
[Guest]: it, but it is not a permanent solution to the problem of fake currency because it's

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.240
[Guest]: only a question of those, for those who are trying to circulate fake currency in the Indian

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.080
[Guest]: economy, they have to just adapt, they have to change their machines and bring out new

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.400
[Guest]: fake currencies. There have already been reports of people trying to fake the new 2,000 rupee

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.000
[Guest]: notes through very kind of crude methods as of now, but even though more sophisticated

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.360
[Guest]: methods will be used and they'll be, they'll come back. But at least from what I have read

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.880
[Guest]: about it, this is not usually the method that countries employ for addressing fake currency.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.680
[Guest]: Usually what is done is that slowly you phase out the old notes so that the fake currency

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:56.000
[Guest]: that was in those designs are removed. We did two years ago, we basically eliminated

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.760
[Guest]: the 2,500 rupee note that was issued before 2005 and that helped address the problem.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.720
[Guest]: Secondly, you try to intercept when they are trying to infuse this currency into the economy.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.720
[Guest]: So for example, we in India are able to intercept about a third of the fake currency that they

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.320
[Guest]: try to infuse. So that takes care of a part of the problem. So it's, first of all, the

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.240
[Guest]: scale is not as big. If you look at the scale of this problem for USD and all, it's much

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:27.400
[Guest]: bigger. And secondly, there are other better methods, gradual, but better methods to address

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400
[Guest]: this problem, I think.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.360
[Amit Varma]: The third rationale which is often given is connected to the fake currency to some extent

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.280
[Amit Varma]: is that terrorism and criminality thrive on, are a cash economy, they thrive on cash and

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.800
[Amit Varma]: that they would be affected by this. What's your take on this?

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.760
[Guest]: I think that's a reasonable expectation. To a large extent, these activities are cash

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:57.440
[Guest]: based. For example, there have been reports that child trafficking has slowed down or

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.200
[Guest]: totally disrupted because it was a largely a cash based network. But we have to think

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.800
[Guest]: about whether this is a permanent impact on these activities or even a medium term to

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.360
[Guest]: long term impact, or is it something which is just in the transition? Because the entire

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.880
[Guest]: economy is disrupted because if you cancel out 86% of the currency in circulation, so

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.480
[Guest]: all activities, a subset of those activities are criminal and terror activities. And we

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.120
[Guest]: have to see whether some of these networks are permanently disrupted, that we will know

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.800
[Guest]: over a period of time. For example, some of the networks could not withstand the pressure

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.920
[Guest]: of not having any activity for two, three months or four months, if they are permanently

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.080
[Guest]: disrupted. That's a benefit for society in the long run. But other than that, only short

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:48.120
[Guest]: term, because you're already seeing reports of terrorist activities being conducted, and

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.640
[Guest]: you've catched or killed terrorists who have the new notes on their bodies, you find new

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.080
[Guest]: notes, there was some encounter in Kashmir. And there is no evidence, at least from say,

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:06.480
[Guest]: look at Kashmir, the number of terror attacks has not really decreased in these, so there

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.440
[Guest]: is no, I mean, anyway, there are so many other factors that come into play, that it's very

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:17.880
[Guest]: hard to assign causality or any kind of, you don't know the counterfactual. Maybe it would

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.240
[Guest]: have been higher, the terror attacks frequency would have been higher if demonetization was

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.160
[Guest]: not done. But I don't think there is any evidence to suggest or even a prior kind of reasoning

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.200
[Guest]: to suggest that there's going to be a permanent impact on these activities. But there will

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.160
[Guest]: be a short term impact, because as you rightly said, there's a considerable amount of cash

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:43.240
[Guest]: intensity to these activities, and that will be disrupted. But, I mean, demonetizing 86%

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.240
[Guest]: of currency is not the...

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, this argument always seemed a little specious to me, because I would think

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.760
[Guest]: that, look, if you disrupt all businesses, you will, of course, disrupt these kinds of

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760
[Guest]: businesses as well.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.200
[Guest]: Yeah, like, if you disrupt your all mobile network in the country, okay, then all terrorists

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.840
[Guest]: will not only talk to each other, but you and I will also not talk to each other.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.760
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. So I want to move on from this a bit. I mean, the remarkable thing about this

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.480
[Amit Varma]: demonetization and why it's unfair to compare it to, say, you know, earlier demonetizations

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.200
[Amit Varma]: is the last time when this happened in the late 70s. The notes in question were really

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:22.640
[Amit Varma]: high denomination and they constituted only 0.6% of the total cash supply. These are 86%

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.920
[Amit Varma]: of the total cash supply. A 500 rupee note today will buy you less than a 50 rupee note

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.760
[Amit Varma]: would have, you know, bought you in 1978. So the common man uses these notes. These

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:39.120
[Amit Varma]: aren't just used for, you know, storing illicit money, but actually for everyday transactions.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.440
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about the enormous impact this must have had on the economy.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:50.640
[Guest]: So let me begin by just drawing a thread from what you said, that these are not really high

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.240
[Guest]: denomination notes, you know, these are higher denomination notes than other notes that circulate

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.160
[Guest]: in the Indian economy. So if you look at other countries, there is a 500 euro note, there

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.440
[Guest]: is a 1000 Swiss franc note, there's a 10,000 yen note. These are high denomination notes.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.800
[Guest]: So in fact, EU has studied the use of 500 euro note and they also are trying to phase

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.700
[Guest]: out gradually, not in this overnight fashion, the 500 euro note because the studies show

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:21.520
[Guest]: that it's being disproportionately used for storing black money or for criminal activities

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.440
[Guest]: and all because it's not a practical medium of exchange note, right? So these notes have

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:32.080
[Guest]: two core key functions. One is the store of value, store of white money value and black

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.400
[Guest]: money value, right? And the other function, which is a very important function, probably

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.000
[Guest]: the most important function is the medium of exchange function. It is used to buy things

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.920
[Guest]: to transact in the economy, right? So these two are the uses. What you are trying to address

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.060
[Guest]: is the store of value function for black money. That's the limited thing you want to address.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.720
[Guest]: But in the process of disrupting the store of value in white money, as well as the whole

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:01.040
[Guest]: medium of exchange function in the economy. And as I said, the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.960
[Guest]: are not very, very big notes. Everybody is using them. These are practical medium of

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.600
[Guest]: exchange notes. For example, if you want to go and buy grocery, you can easily get a 1,000

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.720
[Guest]: rupee change because it's not a very expensive note. In purchasing power parity terms, it's

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:22.680
[Guest]: just $30 basically. So now in the Indian economy, especially this is important to understand

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.760
[Guest]: because the Indian economy is still very cash intensive in terms of the volume of transaction.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.440
[Guest]: In the value of transaction terms, there's a lot of large value business to business

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:37.080
[Guest]: transactions have moved online because it's not practical to give 100 rupees in a cash

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.560
[Guest]: form to a company from which you're buying lots of auto parts, right? That's not how

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:46.760
[Guest]: it works. But in retail, if you look at individual and retail behavior, so let's look at two

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:54.640
[Guest]: things. One is how many people have used non-cash instruments. So in 2013, there was a survey

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.920
[Guest]: done which showed that more than 90% people had never used anything other than cash. Never.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:07.280
[Guest]: So that's one fact for you. Second is that there are about 1.5 crore shops in this country,

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.360
[Guest]: retail shops. Out of these 1.5 crore, there are only 14.6 lakh devices to accept debit

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.920
[Guest]: or credit cards. And some of these devices are actually such that in one shop, there

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:23.400
[Guest]: are two or three devices. So you can say less than 10%, well below 10% shops have the facility

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.520
[Guest]: to accept card based payment. This was the reality on November 8th. So of course, these

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.200
[Guest]: things should change and will change over a period of time. But what this means is there

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:38.440
[Guest]: is a certain disruption that sets in when the decision is taken in such a sudden way.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.580
[Guest]: So what you're seeing is that yes, some people have in terms of the number of transactions

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:48.200
[Guest]: moved to the cashless instruments and using it. But even there, the values of transaction

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.200
[Guest]: are actually not increasing. They're actually dropping on average, because they're trying

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.840
[Guest]: to adapt and figure out whether to spend how much to spend and all of that. We have to

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.480
[Guest]: figure that out what is happening there. But this is a massive monetary shock. Now let

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.960
[Guest]: me just come to contextualize the monetary shock a little bit. When the decision was

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.080
[Guest]: taken, there were about 18 lakh crore rupees of currency in circulation, out of which 15.4

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.720
[Guest]: lakh crore rupees were in 500,000 rupee notes, which was disrupted. There are about 10.5

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.360
[Guest]: lakh crore rupees in demand deposits in banks, and more than 96 lakh crore rupees in time

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.400
[Guest]: deposit in banks. Okay, so this is a part of that overall money supply that is available

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:31.960
[Guest]: to you and me for transacting and for storing the value. Now, out of this currency in circulation,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.800
[Guest]: 86% was destroyed, not the 86% of total money supply. But for people who are only using

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:44.520
[Guest]: cash for them 100% of their I mean, most almost 100% of the practical medium exchange cash

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.640
[Guest]: was destroyed. So those are where the impacts are likely to be. So there's a lot likely

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.600
[Guest]: to be a lot of impact on the informal sector. So if the Federation of Small and Medium Enterprises

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.360
[Guest]: has said that 80% of their members have been severely affected by this decision, we'll

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.720
[Guest]: know the impact when better measurements are done, surveys are done. So and in a formal

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:11.720
[Guest]: economy where the GDP measurement will show a certain impact, we'll know in a few quarters

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.760
[Guest]: what is the impact, because the recent estimate that was put out by CSO does not take into

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.440
[Guest]: account the data and all the numbers onwards. But we will know and the estimates about what

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.600
[Guest]: is that impact range from 0.5% to 3.5%. I've not done any forecasting, but it is likely

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.760
[Guest]: to be a significant impact. And just remember that 1% of GDP is about 1.5 lakh crore rupees

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.920
[Guest]: of cost. And much more important to understand and this cost will incurred by people who

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.160
[Guest]: didn't do anything wrong, you know, so and so the nature of this cost is very different

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.240
[Guest]: from the nature of the benefit. So you can't say that one rupee of benefit in the form

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.360
[Guest]: of a loss inflicted on someone who is holding black money is the same as one rupee of wage

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.240
[Guest]: loss for a labourer who's not able to get work. So the nature of costs and dimensions

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.600
[Guest]: are very different. And you have to take that into account while you're comparing by costs

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.600
[Guest]: and benefits. So even if suppose we figure out that 2 lakh crore rupees of loss was inflicted

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:13.360
[Guest]: on people with black money, you better have much smaller cost to justify that. You cannot

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:23.040
[Guest]: say that as long as 1 lakh 99,999 crore rupee worth of costs have been incurred, it's okay,

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.920
[Guest]: because the benefits are out of the cost. No, that's not how it should work. Because

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.160
[Guest]: if you truly take the welfare implications into account, the welfare implication for

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:36.600
[Guest]: someone holding the black money, getting a 5% haircut is almost negligible, while a welfare

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.720
[Guest]: implication of a person not able to get wage for 10, 15, 20 days is much more significant.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.400
[Guest]: So that you have to take into account that's good applied economics that in fact is a part

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.780
[Guest]: of policymaking when you do cost benefit analysis in many countries, you'd have to take equity

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:56.480
[Guest]: considerations into account. And once you take into account my hypothesis right now

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.640
[Guest]: is that costs are going to outweigh the benefits. I mean the humanitarian costs are massive

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.320
[Amit Varma]: and one reason for this is that despite the government's energetic PR on this matter,

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.080
[Amit Varma]: the fact is that a lot of people weren't equipped to even begin moving towards a cashless economy.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.040
[Amit Varma]: The fact remains that around 600 million people or 60 crore people don't have bank accounts

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.160
[Amit Varma]: and 300 million people don't have any form of ID whatsoever. So this means all the people

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.080
[Amit Varma]: who store their life savings in cash, a significant number of them aren't even able to go to the

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:37.360
[Amit Varma]: bank to exchange it for new notes or to you know move seamlessly into what you call the

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.120
[Amit Varma]: digital economy. And what's your take on the sort of the impact on the informal sector

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.920
[Amit Varma]: and the impact on the poorest of the poor?

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.040
[Guest]: So data will come in right, over a period of time we'll learn more about what's the

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.200
[Guest]: impact on different sectors and different, I mean wage employment creation, the association

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.000
[Guest]: of manufacturers in India have put a, put very drastic numbers out of the job loss because

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.920
[Guest]: of this, revenue loss because of this, 30-40% job loss, 50% drop in revenues. They put out

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.760
[Guest]: a large survey just a few days ago about the impact on their members. These are the manufacturers,

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:15.600
[Guest]: this is the Make in India crowd. So you've got this, these bits and pieces of data that

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.120
[Guest]: are coming out. Some of them are pretty significant and we have to look further into what is going

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:26.160
[Guest]: on and some others we will know over a period of time. But even if you don't have this data,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.760
[Guest]: you're sitting on 8th of November, you should be able to say with some level of confidence

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.920
[Guest]: with certain range, what is the likely impact on these? Because these are businesses which

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.640
[Guest]: have supply chains which are very cash intensive, you know. They may be a case to be made for

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:47.240
[Guest]: pushing, I mean slowly nudging them towards a less cash behaviour, you know. But to do

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.200
[Guest]: this in this manner is a little, you know, difficult to accept. So, and what is the environment

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.720
[Guest]: in which this is happening? If you look at the corporate data from 2016, about a third

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:04.520
[Guest]: of the firms in India which do regular reporting were in financial stress. What does that mean?

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.760
[Guest]: It means this precisely, that their operating profit was less than their interest obligation

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.360
[Guest]: in a given year, okay. So that means that they are not even able to earn enough to be

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:19.400
[Guest]: able to service their debt, which means they are very close to failure, right. So a third

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.440
[Guest]: of them were there before this event happened. Now suppose some of them fail because of this.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.160
[Guest]: So those, that organisational capital that was created by some bunch of entrepreneurs

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.640
[Guest]: and people working together over years and decades to create that will be lost forever.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.320
[Guest]: That's a permanent loss for the economy, that's a productivity loss. People who are working

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.160
[Guest]: there, for them it's a job loss and given the fact that generally their economic condition

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:47.640
[Guest]: is not good. You look at the investment data, the gross fixed capital formation, data on

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:53.040
[Guest]: new investment announcements, data on fixed assets of firms, all across there has been

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:59.040
[Guest]: a drop in the last, before demonetisation also, there was a significant drop. For example,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.960
[Guest]: GFCF is this year expected to, even the CSOs own projections drop, which is a very rare

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.640
[Guest]: thing because GFCF is a measure of investment in the economy and in a developing country

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.640
[Guest]: it usually just grows. But if you look at the last decade, in most years it has grown

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.320
[Guest]: by double digit numbers. This year it's going to shrink. So that's the context in which

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:25.000
[Guest]: this is happening. So if it was a very good situation and we were in a real boom situation,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.560
[Guest]: then the impact would have been a little less because many, less firms would have been on

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.680
[Guest]: the border of failure, between failure and survival. And now it's, there's so many firms

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:40.480
[Guest]: on that border that's more likely to be pushed down to failure. And that's a discontinuity.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:46.360
[Guest]: That's not just, you know, a step down. That's a throw into the abyss. You fall into the

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.360
[Guest]: abyss.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360
[Guest]: It's like a quantum leap backwards.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:54.360
[Guest]: Yes. So those firms, when they fail, I mean, it's not a reduction in profit. It's a destruction

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.800
[Guest]: of organisational capital. It's a reduction of certain jobs, certain productivity in the

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.240
[Guest]: economy, which is lost forever. And it will take years to recreate it because you, you

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.200
[Guest]: know, I mean, how difficult it is to create a firm and make it survive, create some jobs.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.360
[Guest]: And this was a particularly bad time because firms are already hurting.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.080
[Amit Varma]: One interesting statistic I saw, which illustrates how different strata of society have been

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:22.560
[Amit Varma]: affected by demonetisation is automobile sales, which have dipped sharply, most of all in

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.040
[Amit Varma]: the two-wheeler and three-wheeler segments. But SUVs haven't really seen a dip, which

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.960
[Amit Varma]: indicates that those who are relatively well-heeled and traditionally the holders of black money

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.600
[Amit Varma]: have done their jogar. They've laundered whatever they had to launder. And it's really just

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.400
[Amit Varma]: the poor who are suffering.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.160
[Amit Varma]: All of the economic disruption that is happening now, these firms going through welfare shocks

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.020
[Amit Varma]: and shutting down, all the people losing their jobs and migrant labour shifting back and

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:53.000
[Amit Varma]: asking for enrega. How does it play out in the long run? Is it like a sort of a temporary

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.480
[Amit Varma]: disruption and all the migrant labour will be back in the cities next quarter? Or is

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.640
[Amit Varma]: it something that has rippled effects that go much beyond this and keep hurting the economy

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.280
[Amit Varma]: over a period of time?

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:09.160
[Guest]: So let's set aside economic theory and just talk in terms of what we observe in the world,

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:16.800
[Guest]: right? So yes, I'm expecting that by end of March, cash shortage will be mostly eased,

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:23.120
[Guest]: right? ETMs will have cash, branches will not decline your money beyond 24,000 and all

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.880
[Guest]: of that. So let's assume that is going to happen and things likely to happen. So at

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.680
[Guest]: that point, some people are saying the disruption is, the shock is going to end. Yes, the shock

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.200
[Guest]: in terms of the monetary shock will end that day. But there are knock-on effects. How does

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.280
[Guest]: the world work, right? Like why do companies produce, why do factories produce? Because

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:47.040
[Guest]: you and I can go and buy. Why are we, you and I able to buy? Because we're earning from

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.040
[Guest]: somewhere, right? Why are we being paid? Because there is some demand for our labour, you know,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.200
[Guest]: in those companies that we work or wherever we work and on and on it goes, right? When

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.440
[Guest]: you disrupt this, like, for example, you talked about auto sales, there's been a huge shock

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.880
[Guest]: on two and three wheeler sale, right? Which will show up in the production numbers. Later

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:12.680
[Guest]: the production should be realigned to produce fewer two and three wheelers. You're not going

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:18.480
[Guest]: to just produce to stock, right? That's extremely inefficient. So that has an impact on the

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.560
[Guest]: employment in these sectors and their ancillary industries, right? So those people will earn

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.880
[Guest]: a little less. If they earn a little less, they will be spending a little less. And that

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:33.720
[Guest]: will have a knock-on effect on the demand and in various sectors in the economy. That's

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:42.400
[Guest]: one pathway. Second is that banks whose NPAs are at 9.1% of their total advances are going

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.720
[Guest]: to probably, I mean, they have to see how it goes. It's probably going to be in a much

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.080
[Guest]: worse shape. First of all, the immediate impact because it's two, three months, they're not

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.280
[Guest]: doing anything other than this dispensing of cash. So they haven't had the time to really

00:27:54.280 --> 00:28:01.160
[Guest]: figure out collection and all of that. But some of the firms that were basically indebted

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:07.360
[Guest]: by the banks will go into stress because of this event. And there will be more bad debt

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.400
[Guest]: created because of that. Some more NPAs might be created and some companies which were about

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.920
[Guest]: to come back into a situation where they can repay the bank loan would now probably again

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:22.240
[Guest]: go back. So if the banking sector gets into another crisis, a bigger crisis, it's already

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.120
[Guest]: in a crisis and it gets worse, then the credit supply can get choked, right? We are at a

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.480
[Guest]: credit growth, which is lowest in about two decades, right? It's like six, it's hovering

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.800
[Guest]: on six, 7%. And I mean, if you account for inflation, it's almost flat, which is very,

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:44.160
[Guest]: very rare. We have seen two digit credit growth for the most part. So in the last few decades.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.560
[Guest]: So the question is that these are different paths which are going to play out. I'm not

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.960
[Guest]: going to give a specific prediction about how it's going to play out, but I'm just describing

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.480
[Guest]: to you generically how we observe the world and how this, how the general equilibrium

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.680
[Guest]: response happens, right? These different demand shocks will play out into production, production

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.760
[Guest]: will again affect demand and there's a knock on effect. The banking sector crisis, if it

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.400
[Guest]: becomes further worse, is going to then play out into the ability of firms to borrow and

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.920
[Guest]: then borrow to invest or borrow even to just keep, survive. So these all impacts will play

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.160
[Guest]: out and then that will determine how long the crisis lasts. So it's not going to end

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:29.440
[Guest]: in March, 2017. It will last longer. How much longer? We don't know. I mean, I'm assuming

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.480
[Guest]: about a year more of difficulties of this type will be there. And then depending on

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:41.840
[Guest]: how the government responds and what reforms are done and how people's own ingenuity rises

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.520
[Guest]: to respond to these challenges, we will see how long it lasts.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:52.680
[Amit Varma]: So I want to end with a slightly deeper and more fundamental question. One way the government

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.960
[Amit Varma]: spins a demonetization is saying that, yes, it's disrupting the informal sector, the cash

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.540
[Amit Varma]: sector in a really big way, but that's a good thing because we need to get rid of the informal

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.920
[Amit Varma]: sector and, you know, have just a formal economy where everyone's paying their taxes and so

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:12.040
[Amit Varma]: on and so forth. And the way I've always looked at it is that the existence of an informal

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:18.320
[Amit Varma]: sector is not a reflection of the moral failing of the people, but of an institutional failure

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:23.440
[Amit Varma]: on the part of the state. Is that something you'd agree with? And I mean, how would one

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.040
[Amit Varma]: unpack this? Why is an informal sector necessarily a bad thing? Why does it exist in the first

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.040
[Guest]: place?

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:39.120
[Guest]: So let me take it point by point. First, let's take an example of a brick manufacturing setup

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.720
[Guest]: in, say, my village. Okay. It's set up by some person who has never even told the state

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:51.160
[Guest]: that he or she exists or his or her enterprise exists. Never told anybody. There's no registered

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.760
[Guest]: company, never paid tax. Say, employs 20 people directly and indirectly. Produces some brick

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.760
[Guest]: useful for society. I mean, the very fact that they exist means that they're providing

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.440
[Guest]: a value to society. Because people are buying bricks, bricks are useful. People build houses,

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.920
[Guest]: etc, etc. So what is wrong with this person? The most important wrong that this person

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.800
[Guest]: is doing is the fact that he or she is not paying taxes, right? That's the main thing.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.000
[Guest]: Other than, yes, he's not registered a company and all of that, employing people without

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.280
[Guest]: reporting to the labor department, all of that is there, but the main thing. So what

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:30.320
[Guest]: is the outcome we want from this? I mean, what is socially optimal? Socially optimal

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.080
[Guest]: is this person starts paying taxes, you know, maybe pay some back penalty for the taxes

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.680
[Guest]: he or she has avoided for a few years and start paying taxes and then comes into the

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:44.480
[Guest]: formal sector and starts, you know, being a part of this formal economy, official economy.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.200
[Guest]: That will be good because I'm assuming the taxes are fair and all of that. Let's abstract

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.840
[Guest]: that away, that there will be concerns about taxation and all of that. So that's one. But

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.680
[Guest]: if this, you do demonetization and this business is highly cash intensive and it dies, then

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.440
[Guest]: the society is not really better off because those 20 jobs are gone. This organizational

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:07.480
[Guest]: capital, of course, informal is gone forever. So how is this more optimal than having a,

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.200
[Guest]: I mean, this semi-legal enterprise producing? It's a legal activity. I mean, making bricks

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.200
[Guest]: is not illegal. He's doing it in a illegal way. So that, that, that is, I mean, I'm not

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.120
[Guest]: approving of that. So that's one way of looking at it. Just take an example of such enterprises

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.800
[Guest]: and see what would be better for society. That you go after these guys, cash them and

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.320
[Guest]: make them pay taxes and then continue, let them continue with their businesses, right?

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.000
[Guest]: Or you just take the risk of destroying some of them because of demonetization. That's

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.280
[Guest]: one. Second is that you have to think about why people do informalization. Like let's

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.120
[Guest]: talk about, say, labor force, right? A lot of informalization have been induced by our

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.600
[Guest]: own labor laws. I mean, this is, it's a cliche to say it. Everybody knows the issues there.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.480
[Guest]: Why more than 90% are employed informally into the economy because to employ someone

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.920
[Guest]: formally comes with such huge obligations that it is better for you to temp and construct.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.040
[Amit Varma]: So essentially compliance is either impossible or the cost of compliance is too high.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.760
[Guest]: For competitiveness purposes. So if you're in the same sector, there are some people

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.920
[Guest]: who are doing a lot of contracting and temping and some people who are mostly taking on roles,

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.880
[Guest]: formalizing labor, then the latter are going to be in a disadvantage because the former

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.600
[Guest]: don't have to incur those compliance costs and are not bound by the restrictions on hiring

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.680
[Guest]: and firing and all those kinds of issues. So there are those reasons also, which the

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.280
[Guest]: state very much has its control, you know, like state, in a broad sense, central government

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.000
[Guest]: as well as state government, they have certain powers which they can use to ease those burdens

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.320
[Guest]: which will then encourage formalization. There will still be people who will always want

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.640
[Guest]: to stay under the radar. For them, enforcement is a strategy. You go after them, you catch

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:49.240
[Guest]: them and you bring them to the law, right? Like, okay, you've been avoiding taxes for

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.960
[Guest]: 10 years, you pay taxes, your penalties, all of that. So that's the way to go. But to use

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.480
[Guest]: this kind of a blend instrument, and some people have said this is an experiment, you

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.800
[Guest]: know, it's an experiment for society. But there are experiments that are worth running

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.200
[Guest]: and experiments that are maybe not so good running. Like some writers said that there's

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:14.360
[Guest]: an invisible hiding hand, you know, the benevolent hiding hand. But that's Hirschman's characterization.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.640
[Guest]: He took 11 cases and wrote that there's a benevolent hiding hand. It's a very interesting

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.800
[Guest]: concept. It says this, that when the policymaker is making, announcing a new project, you usually

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:31.080
[Guest]: underestimate the risk of risk in the project, the obstacles you're going to face. And that's

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.200
[Guest]: good because later human ingenuity ensures that the benefits outweigh the cost. That

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:41.720
[Guest]: is hypothesis based on 11 cases. But in 2015, there was a paper that Cass and his co-author

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.680
[Guest]: did who looked at more than 300 cases put together. And they found that in about 80%

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.760
[Guest]: cases, it's a malevolent hiding hand, not the benevolent. In about 80% cases, what you

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.920
[Guest]: see is that the costs are higher than what you had initially imagined and benefits are

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.040
[Guest]: lower. Because it's the opposite that happens. It's not that human ingenuity works to increase

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.840
[Guest]: the benefits and reduce the cost for society. In fact, the opposite happens because many

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.520
[Guest]: people are able to take advantage and all of that. So the pathways are not very clear,

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.360
[Guest]: but there are empirically compared to the initial expected benefits and expected costs,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:20.240
[Guest]: the final costs are higher and benefits are smaller than about 80% of these 300 odd cases.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.880
[Guest]: So empirically, Hirschman's benevolent hiding hand is more of an exception. Out of five,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.360
[Guest]: one case you will find where the benevolent hiding hand is working, and the experiment

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:33.840
[Guest]: is going to succeed and make the society better. Even if you don't know the outcome in the

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.940
[Guest]: beginning, right, you underestimated the costs and overestimated the benefit at the beginning.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.000
[Guest]: But when it actually plays out, you may realise that you know, you actually overestimated

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.240
[Guest]: the benefits and underestimated the costs. So we have to look at it that way. And this

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.000
[Guest]: particular experiment I suspect is going to be more of a malevolent hiding hand. I have

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.520
[Guest]: some, it's my hypothesis, malevolent hiding hand, because the way it's playing out, everybody

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:03.640
[Guest]: is guilty unless proven innocent. Everybody is a little suspicious. So people are going

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.520
[Guest]: to respond to basically not look at what is the larger problem that is being solved, how

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.360
[Guest]: we can contribute to it. They're going to just save themselves or take the opportunity

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.520
[Guest]: to do whatever they can for themselves about it. So although lately, we have been hearing

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.800
[Guest]: the narrative that you're all in it together, we are all fighting this together. For about

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.040
[Guest]: a month, month and a half, it was like a lot of uncertainty. There was a state and people

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.760
[Guest]: on the other side, and everybody who was depositing or exchanging was suspect and now taxman could

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:38.320
[Guest]: come after you and all of that. So we should not be very confident that this is going to

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.080
[Guest]: necessarily become a benevolent hiding hand and we are going to have a successful experiment.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.080
[Guest]: And if the planning was wrong, people's ingenuity will bring it up and make it a good decision

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.080
[Guest]: because the nature of the decision does not lend itself to those kinds of responses from

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.600
[Amit Varma]: the society, in my view.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So, Yash, thanks a lot for talking to us about the malevolent unseen effects of demonetization.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.760
[Guest]: It was a pleasure having you on the show.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.480
[Amit Varma]: Thank you. Thank you. It was fun talking to you, Amit.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.120
[Amit Varma]: The day demonetization was announced, I wrote to my editor at the Times of India, for whom

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:16.160
[Amit Varma]: I write occasional guest columns, that this was a defining political event of the decade.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:22.420
[Amit Varma]: I think I might have understated it. Since this podcast was recorded, the IMF has released

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.960
[Amit Varma]: their estimate of GDP growth for the years to come. According to their forecast, our

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:34.080
[Amit Varma]: growth forecast has dropped by a full percentage point to 6.6 for this year. This is not a

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:40.400
[Amit Varma]: mere statistic. As my friend Nitin Pai of the Takshashila Institution has pointed out, a 1% increase

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.760
[Amit Varma]: in GDP means that around 2 million people come out of poverty.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:52.200
[Amit Varma]: Demonetization, therefore, is a humanitarian disaster with real human costs, and most of

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:59.320
[Amit Varma]: its unseen effects will remain unseen as private tragedy, barely reflected in public data.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.760
[Amit Varma]: As it happens, both Soyash and I have written extensively on this subject, and you can read

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:10.920
[Amit Varma]: our pieces on this episode's page on sceneunseen.in. On that note, I bid you goodbye until next

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:40.880
[Amit Varma]: week when Devangshu Dutta will join me to discuss GST, the Goods and Services Tax.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:53.960
[Unknown]: Take care.
