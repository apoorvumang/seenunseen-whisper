00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.520
[Amit Varma]: I

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.480
[Amit Varma]: take a shot at answering all these questions and many more.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.920
[Amit Varma]: I aim to go beyond the scene and show you all the unseen effects of public policy and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.920
[Amit Varma]: private action.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.800
[Amit Varma]: I speak to experts on Economics, Political Philosophy, Cognitive Neuroscience and Constitutional

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.640
[Amit Varma]: Law so that their insights can blow not only my mind, but also yours.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.720
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen releases every Monday.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.680
[Amit Varma]: So do check out the archives and follow the show at seenunseen.in.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.400
[Amit Varma]: You can also subscribe to The Seen and the Unseen on whatever podcast app you happen

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: to prefer.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And now, let's move on to the show.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.960
[Amit Varma]: If Donald Trump saw the way I lived, he would be very worried.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.280
[Amit Varma]: Here's what would worry him.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
[Amit Varma]: My maidservant.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.000
[Amit Varma]: There's a maidservant who works at my place, and she comes every morning to wash the dishes

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.480
[Amit Varma]: and do some household cleaning.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.920
[Amit Varma]: We pay her a decent amount, something she's quite happy with, and we get along well.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.280
[Amit Varma]: She has no complaints with my wife and me, and we like her work.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.480
[Amit Varma]: However, if Donald Trump was my grouchy uncle, and if he was visiting for the weekend, he

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.680
[Amit Varma]: would have a problem with my maidservant.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.400
[Amit Varma]: I can imagine what he would say.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.880
[Amit Varma]: He would point out that while we buy the lady's housecleaning services month after month,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.740
[Amit Varma]: she buys absolutely nothing from us.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.400
[Amit Varma]: In other words, we are running a trade deficit with her.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.720
[Amit Varma]: This is unfair, he would say.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.600
[Amit Varma]: Either she should start buying things from us, as much as we buy from her, ideally, or

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.040
[Amit Varma]: we should stop buying her services and do the daily cleaning ourselves.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.160
[Amit Varma]: I can totally imagine Trump shouting at me, you are being exploited, Amit.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.500
[Amit Varma]: Sad.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.320
[Amit Varma]: But Trump would be wrong.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320
[Amit Varma]: Can you see why?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.680
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.760
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.160
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.120
[Amit Varma]: My intro to this episode was inspired by an article Tim Harford wrote in the Financial

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.320
[Amit Varma]: Times in 2005, titled, A Trade Deficit with a Babysitter.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, I don't have a baby, so I Indianized it a little bit, and I don't need to tell

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.640
[Amit Varma]: you why it is absurd to think of a trade deficit with a maidservant as a problem.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.960
[Amit Varma]: It is because all trade is a positive sum game.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Both parties benefit.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.920
[Amit Varma]: We get our housecleaning done at a rate we are happy to pay, our maidservant gets a remuneration

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.780
[Amit Varma]: for it that she is happy with, otherwise she wouldn't do the job in the first place.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.880
[Amit Varma]: Both of us are better off.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.680
[Amit Varma]: This is true even of trade between countries.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.000
[Amit Varma]: And here's the thing, countries don't really trade with each other.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
[Amit Varma]: People do.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.240
[Amit Varma]: The US has a trade deficit with China, for example.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.560
[Amit Varma]: But actually, it doesn't mean that the US as a nation is buying anything from China

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.560
[Amit Varma]: the nation.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.200
[Amit Varma]: Individuals and corporations on both sides are trading with each other, and each trade

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200
[Amit Varma]: leaves both parties better off.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.720
[Amit Varma]: The value that is created or saved goes back into their respective economies.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.660
[Amit Varma]: A trade deficit between countries is no more a bad thing than your trade deficit with your

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.140
[Amit Varma]: maidservant.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.760
[Amit Varma]: And for this reason, protectionism is daft.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.840
[Amit Varma]: This is just basic economics.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.800
[Amit Varma]: Donald Trump disagrees, because he looks at the world in a zero-sum way.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.160
[Amit Varma]: But I won't go into that in detail in this episode, because I already did a pretty exhaustive

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.920
[Amit Varma]: episode on protectionism a few weeks ago.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.600
[Amit Varma]: Episode 59 of the Seen and the Unseen deals with protectionism, and my guest, the economist

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Anupam Manoor busted 8 common myths about protectionism.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Check that out in the archives of the show at seenunseen.in.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.760
[Amit Varma]: Today though, I have a guest who will take us into another aspect of trade deficits and

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Donald Trump's protectionist urge, the monetary aspect.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.320
[Amit Varma]: Vivek Kaul is my good friend and a frequent guest on this show, as well as the author

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.240
[Amit Varma]: of the outstanding Easy Money trilogy, which has just been re-released by HarperCollins.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.680
[Amit Varma]: Many of the insights he will now share with us are from that book.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.200
[Amit Varma]: But before I start my conversation with him, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.720
[Amit Varma]: If this happens to be the only podcast you listen to, well, you need to listen to some

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720
[Amit Varma]: more.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Check out the ones from IVM Podcast, who co-produced this show with me.

[Amit Varma]: From the magazine I edit, Pragati, at thinkpragati.com, there is the Pragati podcast, hosted by Hamsini

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.600
[Amit Varma]: Hariharan and Pawan Srinath, there is a brilliant Hindi podcast, Puliyabazi, hosted by Pranay

[Amit Varma]: So download the IVM podcast app today.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.320
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen, Vivek.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.840
[Guest]: Thanks Amit for having me over.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.800
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, this is going to be a tougher episode for you than usual because I've started this

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.920
[Amit Varma]: new custom of, from the last episode, of asking my friends personal questions about themselves

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.280
[Amit Varma]: so that the listeners can get to know them a little better.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.760
[Amit Varma]: So tell us a little bit about yourself, what's your background and how did you become a journalist?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.160
[Guest]: Where do I see myself five years from now?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and how do you feel?

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.080
[Amit Varma]: Aap batayenge hain, aapke zahin mein abhi kya chal raha hai, no no, seriously.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:12.640
[Guest]: So basically, you know, I did an MBA in information systems, and I worked for an IT company, I

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.560
[Guest]: was a project manager there, for all of 35 days.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.040
[Guest]: So the first two weeks, it sort of took me to figure out that I didn't fit in.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.960
[Guest]: The next two weeks, it took me to gather the courage to speak to my parents, primarily

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.680
[Guest]: my father, because he would have to continue, you know, financing me, and at the end of

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.240
[Guest]: the fifth week, I quit.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.520
[Guest]: I just stopped going, in fact, I didn't even quit.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:47.240
[Guest]: And then I tried doing a PhD for three years, and after that, I sort of landed up in journalism.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.720
[Guest]: And that was also quite by chance because, you know, DNA had launched in Mumbai and they

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.680
[Guest]: needed a personal finance editor, and I just landed up and I got the job, even though I

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.520
[Guest]: didn't know anything about personal finance.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.400
[Guest]: So that's how I sort of...

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.440
[Amit Varma]: And all the journalism that I've read of you, like I've been reading you for a few years,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.240
[Amit Varma]: so perhaps not from when you started, and all of it has been economics journalism.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240
[Guest]: I mean, what you specifically...

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.520
[Guest]: Yes, so that economics essentially started once I went, you know, freelance.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.080
[Guest]: That was primarily because one is it, you know, allows you to sort of write on a wide

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.100
[Guest]: array of topics.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.320
[Guest]: So you can make more money.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.560
[Guest]: Personal finance, what happens is, you know, after you've done it for a couple of years,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.840
[Guest]: I mean, you're done, there's nothing more to it.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:39.240
[Guest]: In fact, a couple of years, there's this great story about Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.080
[Guest]: He once decided that he wanted to write a book on personal finance.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.280
[Guest]: And then he figured out that all of personal finance could be summarized in 87 words.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.600
[Guest]: So he gave up on the idea.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.880
[Guest]: So you know, once you know that these are the four or five things you need to generally

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.160
[Guest]: do in order to manage your finances, after that it is, you're just rehashing, you know,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.440
[Guest]: the same thing day in, day out.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.460
[Guest]: And you can probably rehash for two to three years, beyond that, it's a little difficult.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:11.440
[Guest]: So you know, by 2007, 2008, I had already started, you know, writing more on economics

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.160
[Guest]: and management and, you know, personal finance had taken a backseat.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.560
[Guest]: And once I went freelance in 2012, economics became the main breadwinner.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.840
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there are plenty of economics journalists in the country, but one sort of

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.080
[Amit Varma]: niche which you've almost made your own and one reason, in fact, why you're such an excellent

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.160
[Amit Varma]: guest for the show, and I keep calling you here, is that you like to explain complicated

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.240
[Amit Varma]: economic fundas in simple language, which your grandmother can understand, or your mother,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.000
[Amit Varma]: as you said in an interview recently, was it like that from the beginning, or did you

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.320
[Amit Varma]: at some point while engaging with your readers?

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.800
[Guest]: No, actually, what, see, what happens is, and this is from the benefit of hindsight,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.320
[Guest]: you know, when you when you, so I never studied economics, okay, I mean, I've never went,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:04.360
[Guest]: I mean, I've never gone to a, you know, college where, you know, I studied economics, my only

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:10.520
[Guest]: exposure to economics was when I was doing my MBA, where, you know, in any standard MBA

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:17.080
[Guest]: course, has one subject, you know, one paper on microeconomics, and one paper on macroeconomics.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.960
[Guest]: And that is, you know, you don't really learn much there, because, you know, my MBA at the

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.960
[Guest]: end had 72 subjects.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.720
[Guest]: So two out of those 72, you really don't learn anything.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:33.600
[Guest]: So once, so when I first started writing economics, and this was for rediff, actually, and sometime

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:42.920
[Guest]: in late 2003, early 2004, when I first started writing economics, it was more of an act of

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.080
[Guest]: trying to understand things myself, okay.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.880
[Guest]: And that sort of state.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.520
[Guest]: So you know, what has happened over the years is that,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.000
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, the older Vivek today is writing for the younger Vivek, who's just learning

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
[Amit Varma]: the subject.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.360
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I mean, you could say that, yeah.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:09.240
[Amit Varma]: And since you're self-taught, in a sense, you're an autodidact to use that term in economics.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.520
[Amit Varma]: Who are the writers which impressed you the most?

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.760
[Amit Varma]: And which are the books which you felt were most useful in sort of bringing about quantum

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.360
[Amit Varma]: leaps in your understanding, for example?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.880
[Guest]: Okay, so you know, my problem is, I don't remember much of what I read.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.520
[Guest]: So I mean, I'll sort of some of the books that, in fact, an early book that I read,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:36.120
[Guest]: and I quite liked it, was a textbook by C. Rangarajan and Bakul Dholokia.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:43.280
[Guest]: And they wrote this book in 1979, when Mr. Rangarajan was still teaching at IIM Ahmedabad.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.640
[Guest]: And that was just one edition of that book that ever appeared.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.720
[Guest]: And you know, for the next 25 years, 30 years, they just kept republishing it.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.200
[Guest]: So I learned all the basic economics there, you know, what is GDP, what is fiscal deficit,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.000
[Guest]: how is GDP defined, you know, the basic very, you know, what is current account deficit,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.240
[Guest]: what is trade deficit, and it was a brilliant book.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.080
[Guest]: The tragedy is, I lost my copy, and I've never been able to find it again, because I think

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.680
[Guest]: it's out of print.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.760
[Amit Varma]: So that was...

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.160
[Guest]: So if any of the listeners have an old copy of the book, you can do a good deed to the

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.160
[Guest]: world.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.160
[Guest]: Yes.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:27.280
[Guest]: So that was one book that really sort of, then there have been a lot of, you know, I

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.640
[Guest]: think Tim Harford writes economics in a very, very approachable way.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.360
[Guest]: His books have really been great.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.120
[Guest]: Of late, I've been reading Thomas Sowell.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:44.120
[Guest]: I mean, his books are just fantastic, because, you know, what he does is, and what is actually

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:52.080
[Guest]: missing from most economics textbooks is that he relates economics to politics, society

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.800
[Guest]: and everyday life.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.400
[Guest]: And there, you know, I mean, I find it very, very funny that, you know, economics actually

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:05.040
[Guest]: gets taught in colleges without being related to, you know, the society and the politics

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040
[Amit Varma]: at large.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.560
[Amit Varma]: Thomas Sowell, for me, is one of the finest thinkers of the last century.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.640
[Amit Varma]: And even speaking in terms of textbooks, I think his two books, Basic Economics and Applied

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.160
[Guest]: Economics are both fantastic, in the sense that, you know, anyone can pick up and start

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.160
[Guest]: reading it.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160
[Guest]: There are no graphs, there is no math.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.000
[Guest]: And it's not that, you know, personally, I don't have a problem with math and graphs,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.680
[Unknown]: but it does put off a lot of people.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.680
[Guest]: And it's just fantastic.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.360
[Guest]: In fact, before I came here, I was reading, you know, Basic Economics, and that's a book

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:42.760
[Guest]: I sort of keep going back to because it just explains things in a very, very practical

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.760
[Guest]: sort of way.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.520
[Guest]: So, Thomas Sowell, you know, anyone who wants to learn economics and does not want to take

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.440
[Guest]: a full course or spend two years or three years in college, it's by far the best.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, if I may give a recommendation to my listeners, another textbook, which is really

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.000
[Amit Varma]: good is Tyler Carvin and Alex Tabarrok's textbook on macroeconomics and microeconomics.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.680
[Amit Varma]: And they also have great video courses at Marginal Revolution University.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.840
[Amit Varma]: So check that out.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.840
[Amit Varma]: Those are just wonderful.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, on Twitter, I promised your readers and my readers as well, that I would make you

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.080
[Amit Varma]: reveal something about yourself that no one in the world knows.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.680
[Guest]: This is the first time people will come to know.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.520
[Guest]: I mean, it's very difficult to come up with something, you know, which no one in the world

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.520
[Amit Varma]: knows.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Okay, let's say maybe your parents or your loved ones might know something, but the world

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.680
[Amit Varma]: at large would be surprised by this saying, really, Vivek likes wearing lingerie?

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.680
[Guest]: You know, something like that.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.880
[Guest]: No, I mean, I'm not.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.920
[Guest]: So you know, lingerie reminds me of an old story.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.720
[Guest]: And this was, I think, sometime 2007 or 2008 or 2009, maybe.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:57.080
[Guest]: And, and my grandfather asked my sister, in a very roundabout manner, which took my sister

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.240
[Guest]: some time to figure out as to, you know, what did he really mean by what he said.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.480
[Guest]: And he basically asked her, kya isko ladkiya pasand nahi hai, which essentially, you know,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.080
[Guest]: it was his way of asking whether, you know, I'm gay, so.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:17.080
[Amit Varma]: Okay, I won't ask you what the answer was, but most eligible bachelor in town, ladies,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.080
[Amit Varma]: if you're listening.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.920
[Guest]: No, so the point is, so yeah, so the larger point is, yeah, I mean, so I was just taking,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.520
[Guest]: you know, your lingerie point, right?

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.240
[Guest]: Or, you know, as we Indians call it, lingerie.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.240
[Amit Varma]: That's not a roundabout revelation that I asked for, right?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.880
[Guest]: I'll give you a sort of, you know, something that I mean, I mean, I have not, I mean, people

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.480
[Guest]: know this, you know, I am extremely fascinated by crime fiction.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.240
[Guest]: I mean, I read practically, you know, I live to read crime fiction.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:57.600
[Guest]: And over the long run, you know, if ever I reach a stage in life where I have some amount

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.680
[Guest]: of f**k you money, I mean, I want to write a crime fiction book, so, which is an ambition

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680
[Guest]: I share as well.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.400
[Guest]: So that is, yeah, I guess we can write a crime fiction book.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400
[Guest]: We can, sorry?

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we can sit in.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400
[Unknown]: No, I mean.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.000
[Guest]: The problem with, you know, the only problem I think is, you know, the plotting etc. is

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
[Guest]: not a problem.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.360
[Guest]: The problem is that, you know, in a city like Bombay, Mumbai, or in any city in India, how

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:34.160
[Guest]: do you figure out the procedure, part of how, you know, crime gets investigated?

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.520
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, we don't know, I mean, there is nothing really...

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.520
[Guest]: But a senior journalist at your level can just get in touch with a cop and say, yeah.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.520
[Guest]: It's very difficult, yeah.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.360
[Guest]: I mean, so what happens is, so I know someone who was sort of writing a crime fiction book,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:56.640
[Guest]: and so she did approach, you know, some senior police guy in Bombay, and so that guy's condition

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.560
[Guest]: was that he also, you know, wanted his name on the book.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.560
[Amit Varma]: So it's not so...

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560
[Amit Varma]: That's pretty bizarre.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's pretty bizarre.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.520
[Guest]: So it's not so straightforward, yeah.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.760
[Guest]: She should put his name on the book just to reveal it to the world, this is the guy.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.720
[Guest]: Or what one could do is, you know, and there are books like that, I mean, if you read the

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.640
[Guest]: Scandinavian crime fiction, you know, especially a guy like Henning Mankal, even though his

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:27.360
[Guest]: books are, you know, the main character, Kurt Wallander, is a chief inspector, he doesn't

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.600
[Guest]: really get into a lot of procedures.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.440
[Guest]: I mean, there's basic shooting, and you know, this gun, that gun, and you know, this is

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.000
[Guest]: where the bullet was, and all that's there.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:45.480
[Guest]: But it's more about plotting, and it's more about how Sweden has changed over the years,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:51.840
[Guest]: and the politics, you know, of the country and the weather, and it's just...

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.600
[Amit Varma]: So you'd do a Bombay analogue of that, if you were to do something.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.800
[Guest]: In fact, you know, the bizarre thing is, there is no crime fiction set in Bombay.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.160
[Guest]: I mean, and this is a city that can give you stories dime a dozen.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.480
[Guest]: And this is a city which actually has so many crime reporters.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.480
[Guest]: And so many stories.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.480
[Amit Varma]: It's mad.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.480
[Guest]: And it's so...

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.960
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, actually, crime reporters are by far the best guys, you know, when it

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.760
[Guest]: comes to writing crime fiction.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.040
[Guest]: I guess the problem in India is that a lot of crime reporters, even though they're very

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.760
[Guest]: good reporters, they can't write, you know, so ultimately, they get the story and someone

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:31.200
[Guest]: they tell the story, and there is a guy sitting and the desk guy in the newspaper actually

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.720
[Guest]: writes out the story.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.400
[Guest]: So even though they may have the stories, they don't have the ability to...

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.080
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, half of any narrative, like a narrative is really either taking a story

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.900
[Amit Varma]: forward or revealing character.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.720
[Amit Varma]: And I guess a crime reporter would be good at finding out the facts of a story and doing

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720
[Amit Varma]: that part of it.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.880
[Amit Varma]: But the other half, which is revealing character and going into the depths of human nature...

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:56.160
[Guest]: In fact, a few years back, you know, Indian Express did a fascinating story on a police

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:03.480
[Guest]: inspector who has retired, and he cannot let go of a case of a girl who disappeared.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.840
[Guest]: Now, this is just it's such an exciting plot point.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.360
[Guest]: I mean, you can just start there and then let your imagination flow.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.880
[Guest]: I'm already imagining the back cover of your next book.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.560
[Guest]: So I mean, I'm just saying, I mean, it's just, I mean, the city has so many stories which

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.560
[Amit Varma]: are not being told.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.440
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, given that you often write about Mr. Modi's economic policies, one could

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.520
[Amit Varma]: say you're writing crime nonfiction.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.320
[Amit Varma]: But just moving on from there, now that you've made this splendid revelation and our respective

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.960
[Amit Varma]: Twitter followers should be pleased by it, let's move on to the subject at hand.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.640
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned Scott Adams earlier, and when we just came to the studio, I saw you reading

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:49.320
[Amit Varma]: a book by Adams Outside and Adams, of course, writes a brilliant cartoon strip, Dilbert,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.760
[Amit Varma]: but was surprisingly for a lot of people, disappointingly for a lot of people, a big

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.280
[Amit Varma]: early supporter of Donald Trump.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.520
[Guest]: No, I mean, so, you know, this is a huge misconception that people have.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:05.360
[Guest]: I don't think he was he was a supporter, you know, of either Hillary or Donald Trump.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.880
[Guest]: He basically called the election right early enough.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:15.720
[Guest]: And he just, you know, he doubled up and he kept going on and on about how Trump will

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720
[Guest]: win.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.400
[Amit Varma]: And that essentially sort of was...

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.400
[Amit Varma]: People thought, oh, he must be a Trump supporter.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.040
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's like, you know, in India, now people are talking about the

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:30.080
[Guest]: fact that in 2019, there is no option, the Tina factor to Modi.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.480
[Guest]: But you know, you there is always an option, you and me may not like that option.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.680
[Guest]: So I think the situation that Scott Adams was in was very, very similar.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.240
[Guest]: I mean, he sort of called the election very early.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.200
[Guest]: And he just stood by it and people did not and I mean, the media by large, especially

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.340
[Guest]: the New York based media, which is liberal did not like that.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:20:01.260
[Amit Varma]: So why I bought Adams up was to seek seamlessly to the subject of Trump, and to the subject

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:07.560
[Amit Varma]: of Trump's vision of the world, which is where, in a sense, our talk about today's episode

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.720
[Amit Varma]: comes from, because it seems that he doesn't understand any of the things that you've written

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.160
[Amit Varma]: in your book, Easy Money, obviously, but also that his insular view of the world that is

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.160
[Amit Varma]: immigrants are bad trade with other countries is bad.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.280
[Amit Varma]: It's just fundamentally flawed.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:27.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, I've given one basic at the start of this episode, one basic economic

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.120
[Amit Varma]: point of view about why his fulmination against trade deficits are misguided, because I actually

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.040
[Amit Varma]: think trade deficits aren't a bad thing at all.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's just it's trade benefits everybody, both parties, but you've outlined a somewhat

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.360
[Amit Varma]: deeper monetarist view in your Easy Money trilogy, specifically the third book, the

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.280
[Amit Varma]: second last chapter, where you deal explicitly with this and you give historical parallels

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.560
[Amit Varma]: as well.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.920
[Guest]: So can you outline some of this?

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.400
[Guest]: So basically, you know, the first thing we need to realize is as to why is Trump doing

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.400
[Guest]: what he's doing?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.440
[Guest]: I mean, you know, at a superficial level, it seems bizarre, but actually it isn't because

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.360
[Guest]: he's just catering to his audience.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:17.580
[Guest]: So when Trump's campaign started, his slogan was, make America great again.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:23.080
[Guest]: And the funny thing is that this was not an original slogan at all, because in 1980, Ronald

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.400
[Guest]: Reagan had run on the slogan, let's make America great again.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.760
[Amit Varma]: So Trump simply just dropped one word.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Reagan, of course, a very different kind of leader and he meant very different things

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
[Guest]: by it.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.160
[Guest]: He was almost the opposite of what Trump is trying to do.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.720
[Guest]: So now, you know, why did Trump come up with a slogan like, you know, make America great

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.720
[Guest]: again?

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.800
[Guest]: And this essentially, the answer to this question lies in the fact that, you know, during the

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:54.920
[Guest]: heydays of the manufacturing boom in the United States, there were factories all over the

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.480
[Guest]: country and primarily, you know, what is called middle America.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:11.160
[Guest]: And these factories gradually sort of, you know, came to a stop and many white male Americans

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.680
[Guest]: lost their jobs.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:20.520
[Guest]: Now, Trump is essentially catering to this audience and, you know, when someone loses

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:27.280
[Guest]: a job, at least in, you know, developed democracies, they have an unemployment alliance and there

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.080
[Guest]: are many other facilities which are available.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:37.000
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, it's sort of, you know, not having a proper job hurts you personally.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.920
[Guest]: So I just like to quote something, you know, from a book called The Wealth of Humans, written

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.000
[Guest]: by a gentleman called Ryan Avent.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.080
[Guest]: And in this, he says, work is not just the means by which we obtain resources needed

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.920
[Guest]: to put food on the table.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.060
[Guest]: It is also a source of personal identity.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.040
[Guest]: It helps give structure to our days and our lives.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:05.560
[Guest]: It offers the possibility of personal fulfillment that comes from being of use to others and

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:13.340
[Guest]: is a critical part of the glue that holds society together and smooths its operation.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.160
[Guest]: So basically what has happened is, you know, all these Americans who have lost jobs over

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.200
[Guest]: the years have essentially started to think or rather, you know, have been thinking for

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:30.380
[Guest]: a while that it's the Chinese and the other foreign countries which have taken their jobs.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:36.240
[Guest]: So this is essentially the perception that prevails and, you know, perception is reality.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.640
[Guest]: And Trump has essentially played on this perception.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:46.320
[Guest]: So when he says that, you know, make America great again, what he essentially meant was

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.640
[Guest]: that, you know, all these factories which are flourishing, you know, up until the 80s

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.920
[Guest]: and the 90s will come back and, you know, the average American who's lost his job will

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.160
[Guest]: find a job all over again.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.240
[Guest]: Now, there are a couple of points here which, you know, we need to understand.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:09.640
[Guest]: You know, one is that have, you know, the Americans lost their jobs only due to the

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.580
[Guest]: Chinese and, you know, other countries like, you know, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.520
[Guest]: producing goods cheaply than America does?

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.780
[Guest]: The answer is yes and no.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:26.800
[Guest]: So what has also happened is that the productivity of the American worker has increased over

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.980
[Guest]: the years.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:33.840
[Guest]: And there's some research carried out by an economist called Michael Hicks, who writes

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:40.560
[Guest]: that almost 88% of job losses in manufacturing in America in recent years can be attributed

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.320
[Guest]: to productivity growth of American factories.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:49.060
[Guest]: Now, in simple terms, what it basically means is that an average American worker is producing

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.320
[Guest]: more goods while working in a factory than he did in the past, okay.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.540
[Guest]: And this is because of advances made in automation and IT.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.960
[Guest]: It has also led to the need for fewer factories carrying out manufacturing.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:06.840
[Guest]: Now, one of the data points that Hicks gives is that if the productivity levels of 2000

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:13.520
[Guest]: had prevailed in 2010, US would have required 20.9 million manufacturing workers.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.240
[Guest]: Instead, the American factories employed only 12.1 million individuals.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.400
[Guest]: So obviously, there is a gap of close to, you know, 9 million jobs.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.920
[Guest]: So you know, one reason that why America has lost jobs is because productivity has improved.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.240
[Guest]: And obviously, given the fact that, you know, other countries can produce things cheaply

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.520
[Guest]: than America can, I mean, has had an impact.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:44.960
[Guest]: So Trump has essentially, you know, sort of feeded into this sentiment.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:51.560
[Guest]: And, you know, one of the things that he said early enough was that he'll try and shrink

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.400
[Guest]: the American trade deficit.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.880
[Guest]: Now, what does that mean?

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.240
[Guest]: You know, trade deficit, a country runs a trade deficit, essentially, when its imports

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.380
[Guest]: are more than its exports.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.040
[Guest]: So what Trump basically wanted to say was that he'll sort of try shrinking American

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.220
[Guest]: imports.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.480
[Guest]: How do you shrink American imports?

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.960
[Guest]: You shrink American imports by basically encouraging protectionism so that, you know, Americans

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.640
[Guest]: are not able to import goods from other countries.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:27.360
[Guest]: And that essentially leads to a situation where, you know, the American companies become

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.000
[Guest]: competitive and they produce goods, which Americans can then buy.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I wrote a column when Trump was running pointing out that he had one thing

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.160
[Amit Varma]: in common with a lot of populist demagogues, which is that he tended to come up with simple,

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:49.140
[Amit Varma]: easy to understand answers to complex questions, which actually only had complex answers.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.240
[Amit Varma]: So for example, his answer to the question of where are the jobs in Middle America going

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.460
[Amit Varma]: was twofold.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.040
[Amit Varma]: One is that your jobs are being shipped out.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.460
[Amit Varma]: And the other was that immigrants are coming and taking your job.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:06.920
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, his anti-immigrant and anti-free trade kind of line, both of which are absolutely

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.920
[Amit Varma]: wrong.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to now ask you to obviously to expand on the trade deficit.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.000
[Amit Varma]: But before that, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.160
[Unknown]: Hey, it's been a great week on IVM Podcast.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.400
[Unknown]: If you're not following us on social media, please make sure you are.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.320

[Unknown]: This week on Keeping It Queer, Naveen talks to prominent author Devdutt Patnaik to explore

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.680
[Unknown]: queerness as depicted in Indian mythology.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.160
[Unknown]: On Cyrus Says, Cyrus meets the film critic and writer Rajasthan and the duo quickly descend

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.020
[Unknown]: into a whirlwind of movie references.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.240
[Unknown]: On LBB, catch a fun event in Delhi happening soon and a contest lined up for you on the

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.400
[Unknown]: LBB I Found Awesome podcast.

[Unknown]: Also, if you missed last week, make sure you catch Sahil Kattar on their first episode.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.840
[Unknown]: That was a great show.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.480
[Unknown]: On Paisa Vesa, if you missed last week's episode, we had a fun back to school special episode

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.680
[Unknown]: with a bunch of really smart 10 year olds who asked Anupam questions about inflation,

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.680
[Unknown]: taxes and more.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.440
[Unknown]: Try and listen to as many of these shows as you can.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.680
[Unknown]: And now on to your show.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.040
[Amit Varma]: I'm talking trade deficits with Vivek Kaul, that is I'm not talking about my trade deficits

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.240
[Amit Varma]: with Vivek Kaul because I have none.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.960
[Amit Varma]: But America's trade deficit with China.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:16.240
[Guest]: Yeah, so America runs a trade deficit of around, you know, 552 billion dollars.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.400
[Guest]: I mean, that was the trade deficit in 2017.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.040
[Guest]: And in 2016, it was around 500 billion.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.400
[Guest]: So basically, within a period of one year, it went up by around 10%.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.960
[Guest]: Now, what does that mean?

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:35.100
[Guest]: It essentially means that the total imports of America are greater than the total exports

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.800
[Guest]: of America by 552 billion dollars.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.840
[Guest]: Now, what does Trump propose to do about it?

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:48.480
[Guest]: And so, you know, this is something that Peter Navarro, an economist who served as a policy

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.680
[Guest]: advisor to Trump's electoral campaign, and I think perhaps continues to be associated

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.000
[Guest]: with him, I'm not sure of that, because so many people keep, you know, leaving the Trump

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.080
[Amit Varma]: administration and it's not possibly, you know, being in India, it's not possible to

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080
[Amit Varma]: keep track of.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.400
[Amit Varma]: It's my dream to see you as Trump's senior advisor one day.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.400
[Guest]: Yes.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.500
[Guest]: So Trump essentially, so this is something that, you know, Peter Navarro says Trump proposes

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:18.240
[Guest]: eliminating America's trade deficit through a combination of increased exports and reduced

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.240
[Guest]: imports.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.320
[Guest]: The idea is to manufacture more stuff in the US, bring down imports and increase exports.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.480
[Guest]: In the process, more jobs will be created for America and Americans.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.120
[Guest]: And this will make America great again, you know, QED, as you said, simple solutions to

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.120
[Unknown]: complex problems.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:44.640
[Guest]: And in fact, his website, this is Donald Trump's website, puts it, he plans to direct the Secretary

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.440
[Guest]: of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements of foreign countries currently

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.840
[Guest]: using to harm our workers and also direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.000
[Guest]: under American and international law to end these abuses.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.080
[Guest]: So again, you know, simple things that will sort of put tariffs on goods from abroad,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.880
[Guest]: you know, and so on and so forth.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:12.320
[Guest]: The problem is that what people don't understand is that if you look at American imports and

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.880
[Guest]: American exports, they move almost in a parallel line.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:22.720
[Guest]: I mean, even though there is a gap between them, if you were to plot out, you know, the

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.880
[Guest]: imports and the exports of America over the years, you would get two curves, which are

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.880
[Guest]: almost moving.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.800
[Amit Varma]: So there's a positive correlation.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:37.800
[Guest]: In fact, if you were to sort of put it in slightly, you know, complex terms, the curves

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.040
[Guest]: have a correlation of close to one.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.040
[Guest]: Okay.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.280
[Guest]: Now, what does that essentially mean?

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:51.280
[Guest]: Now, it basically means that dollars earned by the countries which export goods and services

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.040
[Guest]: to the United States, which is essentially the imports of U.S., are used to buy goods

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.740
[Guest]: and services being exported by the U.S.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.000
[Guest]: So the imports and the exports are very closely linked.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.840
[Guest]: So the moment you crack down on American imports, the other countries, the money that they make

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.140
[Guest]: will come down in the process.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:17.480
[Guest]: So they will have lesser money to buy goods and services being exported by the U.S.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.560
[Guest]: So Trump's view of, you know, simplistic view of sort of decreasing imports and increasing

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.320
[Guest]: exports wouldn't work.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.320
[Guest]: Okay.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.980
[Guest]: And it would also create a lot of problems globally.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.880
[Amit Varma]: But I would actually assume that that even if dollars won the universal currency of trade,

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.920
[Amit Varma]: so to say, that same correlation would still be there simply because trade is a positive

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.080
[Guest]: sum game, both sides are benefiting, and therefore, if you cut down on trade, both sides lose

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.080
[Amit Varma]: that value.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.520
[Amit Varma]: So even if he stopped buying from the Chinese, they'll have less money to buy from us.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.280
[Guest]: So in any case, there'll be a correlation.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.360
[Guest]: So I mean, forget dollar, I mean, you know, even let's say if trade was happening in gold

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:03.760
[Guest]: or, you know, currencies convertible into gold, anything, the same, you know, thing

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.760
[Guest]: would result.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:11.560
[Guest]: Now, you know, other than impacting America, this would also impact the global economy

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.440
[Guest]: in a big way.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.680
[Guest]: And I just like to quote something that an economist named Richard Duncan, you know,

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.440
[Guest]: has been talking about over the years.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.320
[Guest]: What he says is that over the past 35 years, the deficit, which is basically the American

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:31.640
[Guest]: trade deficit, has become the driver of global economic growth.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.640
[Guest]: Okay.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.480
[Guest]: So what will happen if Trump makes it difficult for the United States to import stuff from

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.680
[Guest]: China and other parts of the world?

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.080
[Guest]: If the American imports decline, so will its exports, primarily because other countries,

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.360
[Guest]: as you know, said, we said, won't have the dollars required to import stuff from the

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360
[Guest]: US.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:57.480
[Guest]: Also, with both imports, as well as export shrinking, the trade deficit may not reduce,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.480
[Amit Varma]: right?

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.080
[Amit Varma]: In percentage terms, it might just stay the same.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:07.320
[Guest]: So even in non percentage terms, I mean, both your, you know, exports and imports fall by

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.800
[Guest]: the same amount, your trade deficit stays the same, which mind you, I mean, our case

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.640
[Amit Varma]: completely is that the trade deficit doesn't matter.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.640
[Amit Varma]: It's not a bad thing.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.680
[Amit Varma]: But even if you happen to assume that it does matter, and you're sitting in Trump's shoes,

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.360
[Amit Varma]: this actually won't affect it at all.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.680
[Amit Varma]: So it's ineptitude upon ineptitude, basically.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:32.160
[Guest]: Now, further a fall in American imports will mean a fall in global demand.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.200
[Guest]: And in the process, the global economy will shrink.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.800
[Guest]: Now, how will this play out?

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:40.560
[Guest]: Now, Duncan essentially says that any attempt to eliminate the American trade deficit could

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:45.520
[Guest]: easily cause major problems for the global economy leading to another Great Depression.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.680
[Guest]: Things could go particularly bad for China.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:54.520
[Guest]: Now, in 2015, the US ran a trade deficit of $367 billion with China.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:00.600
[Guest]: I think in 2017, the number was close to around $336 billion.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.560
[Guest]: So this essentially means a trade deficit of $1 billion per day, roughly.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:11.240
[Guest]: Now, if this deficit is eliminated, you know, the Chinese economy will sort of collapse.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.600
[Guest]: If China collapses, economies of China's major trading partners will be severely impacted.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.560
[Guest]: When China exports less, it also imports less, largely because it will have fewer dollars

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.920
[Guest]: to pay for imports.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:30.000
[Guest]: Now, this will lead to the Chinese import of commodities from all over the world falling.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.240
[Guest]: This can have a huge impact on commodity exporting countries like Australia and Brazil, to name

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.240
[Guest]: a few.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.120
[Guest]: Now, Duncan also says that this could lead to social instability in China, threatening

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:45.080
[Guest]: the rule of the Communist Party, and even military conflict between China and its neighbors

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.240
[Guest]: and the US, possibly.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.360
[Guest]: The response from China could be like the way Japan responded at Pearl Harbor after

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.080
[Guest]: the United States imposed oil embargo on the country in 1941.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:04.640
[Guest]: So the point is that, you know, the US imports have sort of become, you know, a very important

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.120
[Guest]: factor in global demand.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.480
[Guest]: And if those imports are cracked down on, it will impact global demand everywhere.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.400
[Guest]: And once you know that happens, it could lead to political repercussions.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you know, I'd also sum it up simply by saying that, once you understand that trade

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.800
[Amit Varma]: is a positive sum game, and if there's a given state of trade happening between US and China,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.720
[Amit Varma]: by cutting it down, you're effectively creating a negative sum game where both sides lose

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.720
[Amit Varma]: value.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And because these are two giant economies, and the whole of the world is so dependent

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.040
[Amit Varma]: on these two, it's going to have a ripple effect.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's even simplistic to say that China will be the loser here.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.480
[Amit Varma]: If China loses, we all lose, if America loses, we all lose, if Pakistan loses, we all lose.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.640
[Amit Varma]: In terms of trade, if anyone is worse off, we are all worse off because the world is

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.640
[Guest]: interlinked.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.920
[Amit Varma]: You're right.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.480
[Amit Varma]: So Vivek, before the show started, when I asked you what you do to entertain yourself,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.320
[Amit Varma]: you said you spend a lot of time on Donald Trump's Twitter feed.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Give me an update what's going on, man.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:11.840
[Guest]: So you know, talking about tweets, Donald Trump recently sent out two tweets.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.400
[Guest]: One was against Canada, and there's another one, which we'll talk about later.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:21.520
[Guest]: So he essentially, you know, in this tweet said, fair trade is now to be called fool

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.160
[Guest]: trade if it is not reciprocal.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.880
[Guest]: According to a Canada release, they make almost $100 billion in trade with the US.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I don't know what he meant.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.400
[Amit Varma]: It was pretty bizarre.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400
[Amit Varma]: I don't think he knew.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.400
[Guest]: He knows what he meant.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:37.280
[Guest]: So what I, you know, once I sort of saw this tweet, I went looking for numbers.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:44.360
[Guest]: And very, very surprisingly, what I found was that the United States runs a trade surplus

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.720
[Guest]: of 8.4 billion with Canada.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:52.920
[Guest]: What it basically means is that the American exports to Canada are greater than the American

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.480
[Guest]: imports from Canada.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.800
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, by Trump's logic, which we disagree with, if China is screwing America, America

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.800
[Guest]: is screwing Canada.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800
[Guest]: Canada.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.800
[Guest]: Right.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.840
[Guest]: And any more than that, you know, when you're running a trade surplus with a country, why

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840
[Guest]: are you even complaining?

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if you're running a trade deficit also, why are you even complaining?

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.840
[Guest]: No, I mean, that's a different thing.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.200
[Guest]: But I'm just talking from, you know, Trump's logic.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.880
[Amit Varma]: If a guy thinks the deficit is bad, why would he think a surplus is also bad?

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:21.240
[Guest]: So, you know, and interestingly, so again, I mean, I looked, once I started looking at

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.240
[Amit Varma]: numbers...

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.680
[Amit Varma]: I think Justin Trudeau is not macho enough for him.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.680
[Amit Varma]: He's too metrosexual.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, that's why Trump likes Kim, big authoritarian dude.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.280
[Guest]: He's like, he likes these macho guys who will go people executing like that.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:38.560
[Guest]: So there's this photograph going around, I mean, obviously, it's photoshopped, where...

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.560
[Guest]: All photographs are photoshopped.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.240
[Guest]: These days, yes, all photographs are photoshopped.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:49.200
[Guest]: So I mean, so there's this picture going around in which you have Donald Trump marrying Kim.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:57.880
[Guest]: So anyway, so sort of, you know, I started digging, you know, a little more and realized

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:04.200
[Guest]: that the United States actually runs a trade deficit with Canada when it comes to goods.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.720
[Guest]: The trade deficit is around $17 billion.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:14.360
[Guest]: But when it comes to services, because, you know, America has, you know, big banks and

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.680
[Guest]: a lot of Canadian tourists actually come to America and spend money.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.640
[Guest]: America runs a trade surplus with Canada when it comes to services.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.560
[Guest]: And that surplus is around $25.4 billion.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:30.100
[Guest]: And hence, net-net, the overall surplus is around $8.4 billion.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.080
[Guest]: So the first question is, why is Trump even, you know, what is he complaining about when

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.000
[Guest]: you know, the second thing is that obviously, you know, given the fact that on the whole

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.160
[Guest]: America runs a trade deficit, examples like Canada are there.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:50.560
[Guest]: In fact, if you look at the American trade deficit, China accounts for nearly three fourths

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.560
[Amit Varma]: of it.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.560
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.560
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.560
[Guest]: So it was much less a few years ago.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.560
[Guest]: Yes.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:02.280
[Guest]: So it's it's sort of gone up from around 22% in 2000 to around almost 75% now, which is

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:08.520
[Amit Varma]: a sign of China's growing manufacturing might and you know, which if not for our labor laws

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.560
[Amit Varma]: and our law, you know, mad regulations, we could have had part of that.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560
[Guest]: Yes.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:19.240
[Guest]: So the larger point here is that, you know, there's no point bullying Canada, right?

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.720
[Guest]: If you have to bully, bully China.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.800
[Amit Varma]: So he's wasting his time on Canada.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.760
[Amit Varma]: I think he must have opened Melania's laptop and found a folder there called Justin.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:29.760
[Guest]: That must have started him off.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.760
[Guest]: I'm sorry.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.760
[Guest]: Continue.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.760
[Guest]: That was a bad joke.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:41.760
[Guest]: So, so if you look at the American trade with China, America runs a trade deficit of $376

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:47.920
[Guest]: billion when it comes to goods, but it runs a surplus of $40 billion when it comes to

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.920
[Guest]: services.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.440
[Guest]: So services are for America's doing pretty good.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:56.600
[Guest]: It is, you know, it is by far, you know, the most innovative country in the world.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:03.800
[Guest]: So now the point is, you know, the point that I want to make here is that, you know, most

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.520
[Guest]: of the global trade happens in terms of dollars.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520
[Guest]: Okay.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.520
[Guest]: And I have a number here.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.520
[Guest]: I think, let me just look it up.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.620
[Guest]: Yes.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:22.280
[Guest]: So this is something from a book called The Scandal of Money, in which George Gilder,

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:27.840
[Guest]: who's the author says, today, the dollar handles more than 60% of the world trade, denominates

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:33.600
[Guest]: more than half of the market capitalization of world stocks, and partakes in 87% of global

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.040
[Guest]: currency trades.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.520
[Guest]: So given the fact that most, you know, global trade is happening in dollars, countries end

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520
[Guest]: up with dollars, right?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.320
[Guest]: You know, when they trade, they end up with dollars.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.280
[Guest]: And what do they do with these dollars?

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.280
[Guest]: I mean, when you export, you earn dollars, and then you use those dollars to pay for

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.160
[Guest]: imports.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:02.560
[Guest]: Beyond that, there is still, you know, countries like China's, because their imports are significantly

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.720
[Guest]: lower than their exports, they end up with surplus dollars.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.040
[Amit Varma]: What would you do if it was the other way around?

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Would you buy dollars from the market?

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.920
[Guest]: Basically.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:17.920
[Guest]: Or there would be capital coming in, right, which would take care of, which is why, you

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:23.880
[Guest]: know, ultimately, if your current account is negative, your capital account, it has

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.480
[Amit Varma]: to be, has to be in surplus.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.440
[Amit Varma]: So what does China do with these dollars?

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:35.600
[Guest]: These dollars ultimately find their way, I mean, a lot of them, not all of them, into

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:40.800
[Guest]: American are invested in American financial securities, primarily treasury bonds issued

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.080
[Guest]: by the American government.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.120
[Guest]: Now, treasury bonds are essentially government bonds issued by the American government to

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.240
[Guest]: finance the fiscal deficit.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.640
[Guest]: Fiscal deficit is the difference between what a government earns and what it spends.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.680
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that is the deficit people should be worried about.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.000
[Guest]: That's a real problem.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.440
[Guest]: So what happens is, and China is not the only country which has these surplus dollars, which

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.600
[Guest]: find their way into the US, right?

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:12.600
[Guest]: There's Japan, there's Brazil, there's India, there is Saudi Arabia, Ireland, a lot of money

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600
[Guest]: comes.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.280
[Amit Varma]: So what's the consequence of this?

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:20.000
[Guest]: What I'm basically trying to say is that, you know, both China and Japan own treasury

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.280
[Guest]: bonds of more than a trillion dollars.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.280
[Guest]: Okay.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.160
[Guest]: In case of China, China owns, and this is data as of March 2018, China owned around

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.800
[Guest]: 1.19 trillion dollars worth of treasury bonds, Japan owned around 1.04 trillion.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.040
[Amit Varma]: So for the benefit of our listeners, just elaborate on this.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.040
[Amit Varma]: What are these treasury bonds?

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.160
[Amit Varma]: How do they function?

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.000
[Guest]: So treasury bonds are, as I said, you know, issued by the American government, they are

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.200
[Guest]: by far the safest financial security in the world.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.920
[Guest]: And they're safest because primarily American government borrows in dollars.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:59.440
[Guest]: And if at all there is a problem, it can simply print those dollars and hand it over to the

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.260
[Amit Varma]: people who had.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.640
[Amit Varma]: So when you buy these US treasury bonds, you're basically lending money to the US at a certain

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640
[Guest]: rate.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.680
[Guest]: So because there is so much demand for US treasury bonds, the American government can

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.600
[Guest]: get away with offering a very low rate of interest on these bonds.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.600
[Guest]: Okay.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.760
[Guest]: Now, treasury bonds typically in any country or, you know, government bonds in any country

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.260
[Guest]: sort of act as a benchmark for the entire interest rate scenario in that country.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.320
[Guest]: So if the treasury bonds offer low interest rates, automatically the, you know, the other

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.840
[Guest]: loan interest rates are also low.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:39.800
[Guest]: And as you know, you know, as we all know, that low interest rates are very, very important

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.720
[Guest]: of that great American dream.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.520
[Guest]: I mean, the American dream is basically nothing but consumerism and it's, it's a euphemistic

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.040
[Guest]: term for consumerism.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:56.720
[Guest]: So if all these dollars do not find their way back into the US, the interest rates in

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.000
[Guest]: the US will not be as low as they currently are.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.720
[Guest]: So you know, the larger point here is that America has an exorbitant privilege.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.720
[Amit Varma]: What does that mean?

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.800
[Amit Varma]: So just demystify that if I can stop you for a second.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.600
[Amit Varma]: Is it the case that because all this money finds its way back to the US and therefore

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.840
[Amit Varma]: they have that supply of money to lend that therefore that money is cheap because supply

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.560
[Amit Varma]: is great relative demand and therefore they can charge low interest rates.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560
[Guest]: Is that correct?

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.560
[Guest]: Yes.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.560
[Guest]: Yes.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:32.640
[Guest]: So, you know, if Donald Trump starts cracking down on American imports, all these surplus

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.640
[Guest]: dollars coming back into the US will not come back to the US.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And therefore the interest rates for American citizens get higher.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.000
[Guest]: Interest rates will go up.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.160
[Guest]: And if interest rates go up, you know, the entire American dream, which I, as I just

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.040
[Guest]: said, is basically consumerism and nothing else.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.520
[Amit Varma]: Though I have to say I disagree with the word consumerism.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.440
[Amit Varma]: It's a bogey term, but we won't get into that argument here.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:45:01.000
[Guest]: But I get your point that they'll have less money to spend and it will be a downward spiral.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.960
[Guest]: So essentially, you know, so the larger point here is that Donald Trump is basically attacking

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:11.920
[Guest]: at the heart of the system that has fueled the American dream.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.840
[Guest]: And it's a system which has already been sort of weakened by many other factors.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.080
[Amit Varma]: And he's indirectly making America poor again.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.080
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.080
[Guest]: I mean, that's that's for sure.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.360
[Guest]: That's for sure.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:27.920
[Guest]: And so, so this was one tweet that, you know, a man, Donald Trump sent out.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.160
[Guest]: The other tweet that he sent out was very interesting.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:36.840
[Guest]: And this he sent out yesterday at 522 p.m. and you know, read it at 523.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.840
[Guest]: I didn't.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840
[Guest]: I didn't.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.280
[Guest]: Essentially, I was coming out of a meeting and, you know, some random guy on Twitter

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.620
[Guest]: sort of, you know, tagged me on that tweet.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.800
[Amit Varma]: And that random guy on Twitter is listening right now and saying he's calling me a random

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.440
[Guest]: guy.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:58.000
[Guest]: I mean, I don't remember who he was, but yes, so thank you, random guy, for bringing this

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.520
[Guest]: to my notice.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.840
[Guest]: So what what Mr. Trump tweeted was oil prices are too high.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.000
[Guest]: OPEC is at it again.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
[Guest]: OK.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.320
[Guest]: Now OPEC, as you know, is the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:20.000
[Guest]: It is an oil cartel, primarily, you know, led by Saudi Arabia.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.880
[Guest]: Now, if you attack OPEC, you're basically attacking Saudi Arabia.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.920
[Guest]: I mean, there are no two ways about it.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:34.040
[Guest]: So, you know, so basically, you know, we'll we'll need to get into a little bit of history

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.040
[Guest]: here.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:41.240
[Guest]: And before we do that, you know, there is some basic, some, you know, economics that

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.760
[Guest]: I need to sort of share here.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:50.040
[Guest]: So OPEC is what economists would call a leading firm model of oligopoly.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.040
[Guest]: OK.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:56.480
[Guest]: Now, if you accuse me of using big words, I mean, I know when I first came across this

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:01.720
[Guest]: terminology, I was like, you know, why can't they just use at least, you know, oligopoly

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.640
[Amit Varma]: could have been coined a little more.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640
[Amit Varma]: Can I use OPEC in a sentence?

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.080
[Amit Varma]: Do you know the difference between water and oil?

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.080
[Amit Varma]: No.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.080
[Amit Varma]: Water is transparent, oil is OPEC.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.080
[Amit Varma]: Oh, man.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080
[Guest]: Sorry.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:19.320
[Guest]: So OPEC essentially follows the leading firm model of oligopoly.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:25.720
[Guest]: And that basically means that they cater to a market dominated by a small number of sellers

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.280
[Guest]: and within those small number of sellers, the largest seller, which in this case happens

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.720
[Guest]: to be Saudi Arabia, sets the price.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.720
[Guest]: OK.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:39.440
[Guest]: So why I sort of went into this is to tell our readers that when you attack OPEC, you're

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.400
[Guest]: essentially attacking Saudi Arabia.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.600
[Guest]: Now, so there is a lot of history.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.600
[Amit Varma]: Trump may not even know that, but never mind.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.720
[Guest]: Let's not go there.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:56.440
[Guest]: So there's a lot of history that we sort of need to discuss with our listeners here.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:05.200
[Guest]: Now, you know, America in the early 20th century fell in love with the automobile and the production

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:12.000
[Guest]: sort of went up from around 1.9 million units in 1920 to 4.5 million in 1929.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.120
[Guest]: And after that, the Great Depression struck and then the Second World War happened.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:22.080
[Guest]: And during the Second World War, all these automobile factories essentially were converted

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.040
[Guest]: into arms factories.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:30.760
[Guest]: Now, once the World War started coming to an end, and this was late 1944, early 1945,

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:35.760
[Guest]: the Americans realized that, you know, there would be an automobile boom all over again

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:40.320
[Guest]: because, you know, people had not bought cars for many years.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.880
[Guest]: And what was also happening was that, you know, American cities were expanding, you

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:50.160
[Guest]: know, all these suburbs were coming in and there was no, you know, public transport system

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.960
[Guest]: to cater to these suburbs.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.900
[Guest]: So you needed cars.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:02.280
[Guest]: So sometime in 1945, the American president, Franklin Roosevelt, you know, realized this.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.360
[Guest]: I mean, obviously, his set of advisors would have told him about it.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:12.400
[Guest]: And he traveled quietly to the USS Quincy, a ship anchored in the Red Sea.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:17.080
[Guest]: Here he met King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, the country which was by then home to the

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.040
[Guest]: largest oil reserves in the world.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:28.840
[Guest]: And American, you know, so basically America, as I said, had become obsessed with the automobile

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:35.200
[Guest]: and due to that, this had led to a swift decline in its oil reserves, even though it was the

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.760
[Guest]: biggest producer of oil at that point of time.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.240
[Guest]: The country needed to secure another source for an assured supply of oil.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.040
[Guest]: In return for access to Saudi Arabian oil reserves, King Ibn Saud was promised full

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:53.880
[Guest]: American military support to the ruling clan of Al Saud, who still rule, who still rule

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.640
[Guest]: and the military guarantee is also still there.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:04.200
[Guest]: What had also happened sort of parallelly was that in 1944, the countries, you know,

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:11.960
[Guest]: the world had gotten together at Bretton Woods in the state of New Hampshire in the United

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.680
[Guest]: States and sort of tried to design a new global monetary system.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:22.560
[Guest]: And in this new global monetary system, the American dollar was at the heart.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:29.480
[Guest]: It was the only currency that continued to be convertible into gold, you know.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:35.080
[Guest]: So you could, countries, other countries could convert their, you know, convert US dollars

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.760
[Guest]: into gold.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:43.320
[Guest]: And I think one ounce of gold was essentially worth $35.

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:48.100
[Guest]: So one ounce is around 31.1 grams.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:54.840
[Guest]: So this essentially led to a situation where countries sort of started, you know, till

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.680
[Guest]: then the trading currency used to be the British pound.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:04.080
[Guest]: Now, countries gradually started moving away from the pound and, you know, graduating towards

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.800
[Guest]: the dollar primarily because pound was no longer convertible into gold and dollar was.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:16.120
[Guest]: So this essentially led to a situation where the global trade moved towards dollars.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And OPEC also, because people felt more secure, because it was convertible, it was convertible

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.040
[Guest]: into gold.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:28.160
[Guest]: See, paper money as you know, as we sort of discussed in a previous episode is pure paper

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:37.480
[Guest]: money is a very recent concept, which is probably as old as, you know, 45, 46 years, I mean,

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:42.200
[Guest]: 71 was when the link between gold and paper money broke down completely.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And I urge our listeners to go to seen unseen.in where our archives are and check out my episode

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:54.080
[Amit Varma]: on easy money with Vivek, which discussed his books in detail and plus the sort of insights

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.440
[Amit Varma]: he's touching upon right now.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.800
[Guest]: So so basically, you know, back then everyone sort of wanted their paper currency to be

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.080
[Guest]: convertible into gold.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:07.680
[Guest]: So and you know, OPEC was no exception and Saudi Arabia was no exception.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.040
[Guest]: I mean, the Saudis love their gold.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.840
[Guest]: So oil was bought and sold in dollars.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.840
[Guest]: Okay.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:21.360
[Guest]: Now, this is a very important point, which a lot of people don't realize oil continues

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.200
[Guest]: to be bought and sold in dollars.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:30.080
[Guest]: In fact, you know, over the years, other members of the OPEC, including Iran, have tried to

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.960
[Guest]: move OPEC away from dollars.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:39.080
[Guest]: I mean, in fact, in the late 70s, you know, few countries wanted to sell oil in a basket

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.400
[Guest]: of currencies, but Saudi Arabia did not let it happen.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.880
[Amit Varma]: So essentially, if India wants to buy oil from Saudi Arabia or slash OPEC, it will have

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.400
[Amit Varma]: to pay in dollars, and it will have to get those dollars from somewhere.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:56.080
[Guest]: So when oil is bought and sold in dollars, it essentially forces countries which do not

00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:00.240
[Guest]: produce enough oil to earn those dollars.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.760
[Guest]: How do you earn those dollars?

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:08.720
[Guest]: You earn those dollars by exporting whatever you have in terms of dollars, and then you

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.840
[Guest]: use those dollars to buy this oil.

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.240
[Guest]: And most countries in the world do not produce enough oil.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:22.960
[Guest]: I mean, like the Indian import dependency in 2017-18 was close to 82%, which basically

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:28.520
[Guest]: means that only 18% of the oil consumed in India was produced in India.

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.120
[Guest]: The rest was imported.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.280
[Guest]: And when you import, you pay in dollars.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.800
[Guest]: And when you pay in dollars, you need to earn in dollars.

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.880
[Guest]: So again, you know, this goes back to the...

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.200
[Amit Varma]: What's the implication of this?

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.960
[Guest]: So the implication is this, you know, it goes back to a term that I used, exorbitant privilege.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:50.440
[Guest]: You know, all other countries in the world need to earn these dollars.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:53.840
[Guest]: Saudi Arabia can simply print money, can simply print it.

00:53:53.840 --> 00:54:01.040
[Guest]: So if oil, let's say, is not sold in terms of dollars, what happens then?

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:05.840
[Guest]: Let's say oil is, you know, I mean, they sort of, the Saudi guys come up with, OPEC comes

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:11.280
[Guest]: up with its own currency, okay, and says, okay, now we'll only buy and sell oil in this

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.280
[Guest]: currency.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.280
[Amit Varma]: What happens then?

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.280
[Amit Varma]: I would name it Kols.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.280
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, whatever.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.280
[Guest]: They may call it Al-Sauds or whatever.

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.280
[Guest]: Al-Kols.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.280
[Guest]: So what happens then?

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:23.080
[Guest]: Then the world does not need to trade in dollars.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.480
[Guest]: If the world does not need to trade in dollars, the world does not need to export in dollars.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:34.080
[Guest]: If the world does not need to export in dollars, all the surplus dollars do not go back to

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.080
[Guest]: the US.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.080
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080
[Amit Varma]: And this again affects the interest rates.

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:41.880
[Amit Varma]: And so there are, I mean, the point is there are implications, you know, which you cannot

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.480
[Guest]: possibly even think of.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:49.400
[Amit Varma]: And we are all tied to each other and if you affect this in terms of making trade freer,

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.200
[Amit Varma]: you increase the virtuous cycle effect of it.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:56.180
[Amit Varma]: And if you actually cut down on free trade, you can make it a vicious cycle where everybody

00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.080
[Amit Varma]: spirals and gets worse.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.080
[Guest]: Yes.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:04.760
[Guest]: So basically, you know, what happens is, and this is again, you know, it all goes back

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.280
[Guest]: to the title of your show, the seen and the unseen.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.280
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.280
[Amit Varma]: These are all unseen.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:14.440
[Guest]: Because what happens is when we talk economics, especially, you know, political economy, we

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.680
[Guest]: just tend to look at the seen effects.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.360
[Guest]: But there are so many unseen, you know, second order, third order effects that you simply

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.120
[Guest]: cannot figure out in advance.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.120
[Guest]: Right.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:34.040
[Guest]: So, so again, so the larger point here is that, you know, a precedent of, you know,

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:42.200
[Guest]: of the only global superpower should not be tweeting like, you know, you and me do.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.400
[Amit Varma]: So I don't tweet like that, I'm very offended by that.

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.240
[Amit Varma]: No, by you and me, I mean, people in general, people in general.

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.880
[Amit Varma]: So Vivek, just to change the subject, when we were talking on the phone yesterday, I

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:59.440
[Amit Varma]: was recording this on a Thursday before the Monday when it's released.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, the day when the football World Cup starts.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.760
[Amit Varma]: And I told you that, hey, do you know, Spain has just sacked their coach, Lopeta Aguillo,

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.340
[Amit Varma]: however, his name is pronounced.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.480
[Amit Varma]: And you started talking about easy money again.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.560
[Guest]: Iske saath Spain ka kya connection hai?

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:17.560
[Guest]: So the connection is that, you know, whatever is happening in the US now, has sort of happened

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:23.800
[Guest]: with the Spain, you know, few centuries back in the 15th and the 16th century.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:31.080
[Guest]: So you know, essentially, what happened was that in the early 16th century, Spaniards

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:35.680
[Guest]: captured large parts of what is now known as South America, right.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.880
[Guest]: And the area had large deposits of silver and gold, right.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:47.800
[Guest]: So these precious metals were sort of transported from Spain, from South America to Spain, and,

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.960
[Guest]: you know, then they were converted into coins.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:56.600
[Guest]: And these coins were used to buy things, okay.

00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:03.280
[Guest]: And you know, the story, one of the great stories of this is that in 1545, one of the

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:10.120
[Guest]: biggest silver mines was found in a place called Potosi, I hope I'm pronouncing it correctly,

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.120
[Guest]: which is now in Bolivia.

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:16.680
[Guest]: Now Potosi is one of the highest cities in the world and is situated at a height of 4090

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.960
[Guest]: meters.

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:22.440
[Guest]: And given the altitude that it sits on, it took Spaniards some time to get there.

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.800
[Guest]: Here a mountain of silver of six miles around its base was discovered.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:32.920
[Guest]: The mountain or the rich hill as it became to be called, generated nearly 45,000 tons

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:38.640
[Guest]: of silver between 1556 and 1783, which is like, you know, more than 200 years.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.960
[Guest]: But that was the original city on a hill.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:45.200
[Guest]: And most of this newfound silver was shipped to Spain.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.060
[Guest]: And in the best years, some 300 tons of silver came in from silver mines in the various parts

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:53.480
[Guest]: of South America.

00:57:53.480 --> 00:58:00.200
[Guest]: Now once this gold and silver started coming in from, you know, from South America, the

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:05.000
[Guest]: Spaniards became proficient at spending it rather than engaging themselves in any productive

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
[Guest]: activity.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.760
[Guest]: Easy money had spoiled them and they produced very little of their own.

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.800
[Guest]: Once this happened, everything had to be imported.

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:18.000
[Guest]: You know, weapons came from the Dutch, woolens from British, glassware from Italians and

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
[Guest]: so on.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
[Guest]: Now Thomas Sowell, you know, who we were discussing at the very beginning, makes a very interesting

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.400
[Guest]: point in Wealth, Poverty and Politics, which is, you know, a great book that he's written.

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:38.800
[Guest]: The vast wealth pouring into Spain allowed the Spanish elite to live in luxury and leisure,

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:43.100
[Guest]: enjoying the products of other countries purchased with windfall gain in gold and silver.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:48.080
[Guest]: At one point, Spanish imports were nearly twice as large as its exports, with the difference

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.560
[Guest]: being covered by payments in gold and silver.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:55.560
[Guest]: It was a source of pride, however, that all the world served Spain while Spain served

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.560
[Guest]: nobody.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:03.160
[Guest]: Now if you sort of compare the situation, you know, something similar is playing out

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.160
[Guest]: in the US.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:08.720
[Guest]: Now obviously things are not as bad in the US as they were in Spain, but if you look

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:15.280
[Guest]: at the ratio of US imports and US exports, and I'm talking about goods here, not services,

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:25.440
[Guest]: the ratio is 1.5, which basically means that the US imports 50% more goods than it exports.

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:33.160
[Guest]: So, you know, Spain had like, you know, Spain had an unlimited amount of access to gold

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.160
[Guest]: and silver.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:39.240
[Guest]: Similarly, US has an unlimited access to the dollar, you know, other countries, as we've

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.720
[Amit Varma]: been discussing, need to earn it.

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.560
[Amit Varma]: They can just spend the money, that will devalue their own currency and cause inflation, blah

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.560
[Guest]: blah blah, but whatever.

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.360
[Guest]: Yes, but over a period of time, you know, even if they gradually keep printing it, it

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:57.560
[Guest]: doesn't make, you know, a rate of inflation of 2-3% a year does not really kill anyone,

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.560
[Guest]: right?

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:03.560
[Guest]: While the unlimited access to gold and silver was Spain's easy money, the dollar is United

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:08.560
[Guest]: States' easy money, and given this, it isn't surprising that like Spain, the United States

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.080
[Guest]: imports much more than it exports.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:18.160
[Guest]: Also, you know, Spain had to face the risk of gold and silver running out, which it eventually

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.760
[Guest]: did, but the US can keep running its printing press.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.840
[Amit Varma]: So how did that Spanish story play out?

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.160
[Amit Varma]: I don't know how they'll do at this World Cup, but how did that story play out?

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.480
[Guest]: So obviously, you know, after a point of time, you know, the supply of silver sort of started

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480
[Guest]: coming down.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.000
[Guest]: I mean, it peaked in 1600 and started to fall after that.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.480
[Guest]: But the spending habits of people did not change immediately, leading to Spain getting

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:50.160
[Guest]: into debts with foreigners and the government defaulted on its loans, you know, in 1607,

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.040
[Guest]: 1627 and 1647.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.560
[Guest]: So that's in a sense a crucial difference in that they ran out of gold, the US as well.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.200
[Guest]: Yes, because what happens is, you know, ultimately at that point of time, you know, gold was

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.240
[Guest]: money and there was no, you know, gold wasn't unlimited.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:09.160
[Guest]: The US can never run out of money, as long as dollar continues to be the international

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.600
[Guest]: trading, international reserve currency.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.360
[Amit Varma]: So tell me something, how do you see all of this playing out?

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.360
[Amit Varma]: You cannot...

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.360
[Amit Varma]: What's your worst case scenario?

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360
[Amit Varma]: You cannot predict anything.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:25.840
[Guest]: I mean, you know, there is no worst case scenario, because something like this can continue for

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840
[Guest]: years and years.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.640
[Guest]: I mean, it can possibly last, you know, even our lifetimes.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.840
[Amit Varma]: And we are, you know, sort of in an age of populist demagogues everywhere who are insular

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.840
[Amit Varma]: in this way.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.520
[Amit Varma]: And if you think about it, this is not really a right-left divide, because people on the

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.960
[Amit Varma]: right typically tend to be for free trade.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.080
[Amit Varma]: And in this case, if you look at their policies towards trade, Trump and Bernie Sanders have

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.440
[Amit Varma]: pretty much identical and identically destructive policies.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:57.760
[Guest]: In fact, you know, the interesting point is, if not the US dollar, then what?

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.760
[Guest]: Okay.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.880
[Guest]: Now, in 99, when the euro sort of came into the picture, people started to say, okay,

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.240
[Guest]: now the euro will take on the dollar.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:15.440
[Guest]: But if you look at the situation in Europe, and especially Southern Europe, it's even,

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.920
[Guest]: you know, more worse than, you know, the situation in the US.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.440
[Guest]: In fact, the situation in the US has now started to improve.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.640
[Guest]: So how does the euro challenge the dollar?

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.600
[Guest]: If you look at Japan, I mean, the country has not grown for many, many years.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.560
[Guest]: And with the number of old people going up and the population shrinking, whether the

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.320
[Guest]: country will, you know, what will happen is anybody's guess.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.880
[Guest]: So again, the yen cannot take on the dollar.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.940
[Guest]: That leaves us with the Chinese Yuan.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:53.080
[Guest]: The Chinese Yuan cannot take on the dollar until China has full capital account convertibility.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.120
[Guest]: Now, what do I mean by that?

01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:01.440
[Guest]: What I mean is that a Chinese guy can sort of take out his money from China and invest

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.760
[Guest]: it anywhere in the world at any point of time.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:09.200
[Guest]: Now, that is not allowed as of now, because China needs access to all these savings to

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.880
[Guest]: build all the infrastructure that it is.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:18.720
[Guest]: So if, you know, if money cannot sort of flow in and flow out freely from any country at

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.640
[Guest]: any point of time, that currency can never be the international reserve currency.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:28.160
[Guest]: You know, major reason why dollar is the international reserve currency is because the US Treasury

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.440
[Guest]: bond market is extremely liquid.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.200
[Guest]: You can bring in money at any point of time, you can take out money at any point of time.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.800
[Guest]: So which means they'll continue to have a disproportionately large influence on the

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800
[Guest]: world's economy.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.880
[Guest]: So what will happen is, my guess is, since you've asked me to sort of paint a futuristic

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:48.720
[Guest]: picture, my guess is, and this is already happening, that China will work towards projecting

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.600
[Guest]: the Yuan as, you know, an international currency.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:58.480
[Guest]: But that is not going to happen, like, you know, in 2022, or in 2025, it will at least

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.760
[Guest]: take a couple of decades.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.160
[Guest]: By then, you know, who knows what else might happen.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.120
[Amit Varma]: So, and on that wonderful, hopeful note, Vivek, I hope you enjoy the World Cup.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.120
[Guest]: And thanks so much for coming on the scene and the unseen.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.360
[Guest]: The World Cups in 2019, right?

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.520
[Guest]: Yaar, tu cricket hi dekhta hai kya?

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I don't watch.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320
[Amit Varma]: The US hasn't qualified.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320
[Amit Varma]: So you don't give a shit.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:27.280
[Guest]: So in fact, if you're talking about football, you know, the four countries which have 50%

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:34.000
[Guest]: of the world population, US, India, China and Indonesia, are not playing the World Cup.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
[Guest]: Immediately boycott the World Cup.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.720
[Amit Varma]: By the way, I went and watched the Hero Cup intercontinental final between India and Kenya

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.680
[Amit Varma]: and it was quite excellent.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.640
[Amit Varma]: Next time you must come with me and fall in love with the beautiful game of football.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.880
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:46.360
[Unknown]: As you can see, we have a podcast listener in his natural habitat.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.160
[Unknown]: Billions of years of evolution have led him to this point.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.960
[Unknown]: He's on his way to work and listening to podcasts makes his miserable day better.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.980
[Unknown]: He will now head to work and use all his knowledge to communicate with other colleagues and possibly

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.660
[Unknown]: future mates.
