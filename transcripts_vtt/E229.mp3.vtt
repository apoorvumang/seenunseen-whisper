00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
[Amit Varma]: How should we think of medicine as a profession?

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.120
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand, it's a career path like any other.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.400
[Amit Varma]: You learn a skill, and people pay you for your expertise.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.400
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, it's also thought of as a noble calling.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.740
[Amit Varma]: You help other people.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.640
[Amit Varma]: You sometimes give them the gift of life, and sometimes you give them a better life.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.160
[Amit Varma]: In India, doctors are mostly invisible to us, except when we have no option but to notice

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
[Amit Varma]: them.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.200
[Amit Varma]: Doctors can be both villains and heroes to us.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.920
[Amit Varma]: On one hand, we rail against doctors who over-prescribe tests and medicine because that's the way

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.120
[Amit Varma]: their incentives go and patients be damned.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.920
[Amit Varma]: We are objects to them.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.560
[Amit Varma]: On the other hand, we go to them with our deepest problems, including our greatest anxiety,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.560
[Amit Varma]: the fear of death.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that over the last year, doctors and nurses

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.480
[Amit Varma]: and other medical personnel have been our greatest heroes.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.980
[Amit Varma]: Lakhs of these frontline workers in India have gone beyond their call of duty, functioning

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.400
[Amit Varma]: in a battleground with limited information, driven not just by money, but by empathy and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.400
[Amit Varma]: the desperate desire to help.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.200
[Amit Varma]: They have risked their lives to save the lives of others.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.520
[Amit Varma]: When I think of those who let us down in this crisis, and the politicians are on top of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.540
[Amit Varma]: that list, I begin to lose faith in humanity.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.240
[Amit Varma]: But then I look at the medical profession and I regain that faith.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.260
[Amit Varma]: You see, we will beat this pandemic.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.760
[Amit Varma]: And it won't just be a triumph of science and medicine when we do.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.840
[Unknown]: It will also be a triumph of human beings expressing their humanity.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.320
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.400
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.440
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.720
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.540
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Lancelot Pinto, a doctor and a scholar who has come to public attention

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.440
[Amit Varma]: in the last few months for being a voice of reason in this fog of confusion.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.400
[Amit Varma]: Lance has been clearing doubts and misconceptions since this pandemic began and has been especially

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.400
[Amit Varma]: eloquent in recent weeks on the dangers of over-prescribing drugs to COVID patients.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.960
[Amit Varma]: Many of the deaths in recent weeks have come because of a dysfunctional state and were

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.520
[Amit Varma]: otherwise avoidable.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.800
[Amit Varma]: But some have happened because of over-medication of doctors going overboard with medicine that

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.960
[Amit Varma]: has adverse side effects.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.440
[Amit Varma]: Lance called this out early and I wouldn't be surprised if he saved lives not just in

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.920
[Amit Varma]: his work as a doctor, but also in his interventions as a public intellectual.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Friends of mine have actually been patients of his in this time and praise him highly.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.720
[Amit Varma]: I was delighted when he agreed to be a guest on the show.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.000
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to explore a much wider canvas than just COVID though.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.840
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to explore the practice of medicine.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.160
[Amit Varma]: Why do doctors opt for this profession?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.320
[Amit Varma]: What is a doctor's life really like away from the glamour of Robin Cook novels and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.160
[Amit Varma]: ER and scrubs?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.840
[Amit Varma]: What are the incentives that drive doctors, both as doctors and as human beings?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.520
[Amit Varma]: How do they stay in touch with the cutting edge of medicine, which may be so different

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.160
[Amit Varma]: from what they learnt in their college textbooks?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.800
[Amit Varma]: Beyond these general questions, I also wanted to talk about some of Lance's areas of specialisation.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.840
[Amit Varma]: He runs smoking cessation clinics and talks about how medicine has now made it easy to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.880
[Amit Varma]: quit smoking.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.760
[Amit Varma]: He talks about the importance of sleep and the unintuitive ways in which our body functions.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Did you know that a throat muscle can cause erectile dysfunction?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.280
[Amit Varma]: This is the scene and the unseen right there.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.880
[Amit Varma]: So we cover a lot of ground in this episode, and only the last half an hour or so is actually

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880
[Amit Varma]: about COVID-19.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.640
[Amit Varma]: I love this conversation, I learnt a lot from it, but before we get to it, let's take a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.360
[Amit Varma]: quick commercial break.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.280
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.240
[Amit Varma]: I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.360
[Amit Varma]: This means that I read more books, but I also read more long-form articles and essays.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.320
[Amit Varma]: There's a world of knowledge available through the internet.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.900
[Amit Varma]: But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.400
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.520
[Amit Varma]: How do we put the right incentives in place?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.320
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered one way.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.480
[Amit Varma]: A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.240
[Amit Varma]: which aims to help people up-level themselves by reading more.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.680
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.400
[Amit Varma]: Every day for six months, they sent me a long-form article to read.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.600
[Amit Varma]: The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.200
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.720
[Amit Varma]: At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.160
[Amit Varma]: So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.560

[Amit Varma]: New batches start every month.

[Amit Varma]: They also have a great program called Future Stack, which helps you stay up-to-date with

[Amit Varma]: Unlevel yourself.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.800
[Amit Varma]: So Amit, tell me about your childhood.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.840
[Amit Varma]: Where did you grow up?

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.840
[Amit Varma]: What was it like before your journey in medicine began?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.480
[Guest]: To begin with, Amit I don't think you've missed anything much in terms of my journey.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.880
[Guest]: But I grew up in Mumbai.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.240
[Guest]: I was born in Mumbai, grew up here, born in Bombay, grew up in Mumbai.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.560
[Guest]: That's how I like to say it.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.440
[Guest]: I was born in the suburbs of Mumbai called Bhandup.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.160
[Guest]: It's a small little suburb on the central line.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.240
[Guest]: So if you're familiar with Bombay, the suburbs are looked down upon very often but that's

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.420
[Guest]: where I began.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.720
[Guest]: I went to a school called St. Xavier's School and my dad worked in administration at Crompton

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.200
[Guest]: Greaves and pretty much held one job all his life, you know, so that was who he was.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.640
[Guest]: My mother was a school teacher at the school that I studied in.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.000
[Guest]: She was a primary school teacher.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.720
[Guest]: And both of them were migrants from Mangalore, so they moved after they got married.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.920
[Guest]: My dad was here for a couple of years before that.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.360
[Guest]: And you know, I remember my dad telling me stories about how he came to the city with

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.280
[Guest]: nothing, which is so true for a lot of migrants to Mumbai.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.960
[Guest]: He stayed with his brother, who was already here for some time.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.160
[Guest]: And that was my childhood.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.240
[Guest]: So I grew up in a family where both my parents worked.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.280
[Guest]: I think there was a strong ethos on working hard.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.120
[Guest]: You know, I remember my dad leaving home at seven in the morning because he worked in

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.920
[Guest]: South Bombay, which is the other end of town, and would return by 7.30 or so in the evening.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.960
[Guest]: I think education was always very important.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.440
[Guest]: There was a stress on education.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.040
[Guest]: However, I never felt pressured.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.000
[Guest]: There was never any pressure to perform or, you know, there was never any, you will grow

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.360
[Guest]: up and become a doctor or engineer or anything of that sort.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.000
[Guest]: Fortunately for me, and I really don't know, I mean, there may be a lot of subtle things

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.720
[Guest]: that help in life, which you don't realize.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.720
[Guest]: Fortunately for me, I think I liked studying.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.000
[Guest]: I was happy going to school.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.680
[Guest]: I, in fact, you know, at the end of vacations, I was looking forward to school beginning

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680
[Guest]: again.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.280
[Guest]: And I was naturally drawn towards reading and studying and fortunately did well.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.120
[Guest]: Somewhere along, you know, when you reach middle school to high school is when you start

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.280
[Guest]: thinking about what you want to become.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.680
[Guest]: And I think I always wanted to become a pilot for some time.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.960
[Guest]: Again, I guess it's a common thing for a lot of people to want to do adventurous things

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960
[Guest]: like that.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.960
[Guest]: But I think at some point of time, somewhere close to maybe my seventh grade or so, this

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.040
[Guest]: whole thing about taking up medicine became real.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.000
[Guest]: Maybe it was influenced by the fact that my dad had a bypass when I was in the sixth standard.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.800
[Guest]: There was some interaction with the healthcare system.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.960
[Guest]: Maybe I looked up to some of those doctors in awe and there was a lot of reading of Robin

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.520
[Guest]: Cook as well, which I don't know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, because that's

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.240
[Guest]: a very skewed presentation of medicine, but it still looks glamorous.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.240
[Guest]: It looks interesting.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.920
[Guest]: And I think I was naturally drawn towards medicine at that point of time.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.320
[Guest]: So somewhere around the seventh or eighth standard, it was medicine and nothing else

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.320
[Guest]: for me.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:29.240
[Guest]: Of course, growing up in a middle-class household in Mumbai, you do not think of too many different

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240
[Guest]: options as a career.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.600
[Guest]: You think of medicine, you think of engineering, you think of a few other things.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.640
[Guest]: And in hindsight, maybe my alternative life would also include the possibility of journalism,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.360
[Guest]: the possibility of being an author, the possibility of exploring the humanities in some way, because

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.080
[Guest]: I think that's a big lacuna in medical education that we aren't exposed to humanities.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.080
[Guest]: So 10th standard, you know, big year, important year, you have to do well, I did reasonably

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080
[Guest]: okay.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.280
[Guest]: I went to a college called RUIA, which was, so that's another recurring theme in my life.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.440
[Guest]: I always got into the second best college, I think, or second best of mostly everything.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440
[Guest]: And we talk about that.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.600
[Guest]: So, you know, the number one college in Mumbai was considered Rupert L for the sciences.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600
[Guest]: I didn't make the cut.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.680
[Guest]: So I went to RUIA.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.600
[Guest]: Then 12th standard is another, you know, you realize that it's from a pool of 10,000 odd

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.960
[Guest]: people, about 100 seats are what's available in the public institutions where you want

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.040
[Guest]: to be in terms of an MBBS education.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.520
[Guest]: And again, you know, the King Edward Memorial Hospital, or KEM is considered number one

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520
[Guest]: in Mumbai.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.520
[Guest]: I didn't.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.360
[Guest]: So my percentage was 95.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.560
[Guest]: And I think KEM stopped at 95 point something.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.280
[Guest]: So I got into Sion Hospital.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.720
[Guest]: And Sion Hospital was a very interesting experience in terms of, you know, there was a decent

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:49.400
[Guest]: balance of extracurricular activities as well as studies where, you know, it wasn't the

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.560
[Guest]: typical nerds where everybody constantly had their heads buried in books.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.480
[Guest]: We had this festival called Ashwamedh, which was quite important every year.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.800
[Guest]: So we got some exposure to, you know, debating, to doing a lot of public speaking, etc.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.720
[Guest]: And those were good years.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.360
[Guest]: That's pretty much the early years, if you ask me.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.060
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what kind of strikes me was that growing up as an 80s kid, I remember back

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.320
[Amit Varma]: in the day, the traditional occupations that good middle class kids were supposed to go

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.760
[Amit Varma]: as you said, was you do doctor and engineering, and a little later on MBA also became kind

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.760
[Amit Varma]: of fashionable.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.760
[Amit Varma]: And this, of course, is if you didn't sit for the civil services.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, I would imagine that by the 90s, post liberalization, all of this is kind of changing.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.400
[Amit Varma]: But nevertheless, I think in the second half of the 90s, you decide to go in for an MBBS

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.640
[Amit Varma]: anyway, and you pointed out that you had a natural interest in this.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.060
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of things strike me.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.480
[Amit Varma]: One is that it takes an awfully long time to become a doctor, you do your engineering

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.120
[Amit Varma]: course and you're an engineer.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.080
[Amit Varma]: But with a doctor, it's just a years keep stretching on, it almost seems like you know,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.080
[Amit Varma]: you're in your 30s before you can actually do anything.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.740
[Amit Varma]: And even then, there is a survivorship bias where you hear of good doctors making a lot

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.740
[Amit Varma]: of money.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.820
[Amit Varma]: But it's not necessary that at the end of that journey, you will be successful.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.440
[Amit Varma]: So when you made that final call, I mean, obviously, you must have taken this into account.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.520
[Amit Varma]: So what was the thinking that went behind it?

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.940
[Amit Varma]: And when you started, did you find that the study of medicine was turning out to be different

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.940
[Amit Varma]: from what you expected?

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.440
[Amit Varma]: Or you knew going in what it was going to be?

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, as you pointed out, there's a Robin Cook influence and all of that.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.360
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about your decision making during this time, what you expected?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.420
[Amit Varma]: What did you enjoy about it?

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.880
[Guest]: So it's a very interesting question you asked there, because so one of my closest friends

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.340
[Guest]: in school was a guy who went on to do engineering.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.840
[Guest]: And I would spend a lot of time at his house, and it was a joint family, they had doctors

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.400
[Guest]: in their house as well.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.680
[Guest]: And this constant theme that I was reminded of was, you know, you choose medicine, you're

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.680
[Guest]: just going to be studying, you will never make money, you will be studying till you're

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.680
[Guest]: 30-35.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.280
[Guest]: You know, baal jhar jayenge, which, you know, unfortunately, is true right now.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.440
[Guest]: But you know, baal jhar jayenge, lekin tumhara, you know, you'll still be studying and, you

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.120
[Guest]: know, obviously, anecdotes of doctors and their kids giving exams together, you know,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.200
[Guest]: come to the fore, you know, look at him, his second standard son, and he had both giving

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.800
[Guest]: exams at the same time.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.080
[Guest]: So those kinds of stories were constantly, you were constantly reminded that, you know,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.320
[Guest]: you may not be making such a good choice.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.280
[Guest]: You know, one of the things that really is very crystal clear in my head was this conversation

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.960
[Guest]: I had with this guy, whose wife worked for one of the hospitals in Mumbai.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.520
[Guest]: And I don't remember whether she was a doctor or what was the context.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.720
[Guest]: But he said something like, listen, you know, you will become a doctor, maybe, you know,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.540
[Guest]: maybe you'll get into medicine.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.200
[Guest]: But at the end of medicine, do you know how difficult it is to get a postgraduate seat,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.680
[Guest]: you know, you will struggle with the postgraduate seat.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.180
[Guest]: And everybody who doesn't get a postgraduate seat of their choice ends up doing PSM.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.200
[Guest]: So PSM is preventive and social medicine.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.160
[Guest]: And this is when I'm in like 10th standard, I don't even know what he's talking about,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160
[Guest]: right.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.480
[Guest]: So he says, you will do PSM, and all you will be telling people to do is wash their hands.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.800
[Guest]: And the irony is that for the past year, all I've been telling people to do is wash their

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.680
[Guest]: hands, right?

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.920
[Guest]: It's somehow come back a full circle.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.200
[Guest]: But to answer your question, I guess there is a lot of naivety when you make a choice

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.440
[Guest]: when you're exactly from the background that I am, you know, you are middle class.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.920
[Guest]: So you don't have a strong safety net in that sense, where you can assume that you will

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.760
[Guest]: study indefinitely, and you know, you will somehow be supported.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.440
[Guest]: And yet you make this leap of faith.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.380
[Guest]: And I think that that decision is a difficult decision.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.840
[Guest]: And I think some of that is is totally naivety, you know, because you don't know, really,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.500
[Guest]: you've seen only the glamorous part of things, you don't realize that for every doctor who's

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.640
[Guest]: probably you know, in your face looking glamorous looking good, there are probably 10 doctors

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.400
[Guest]: who are really struggling, who are finding it difficult, because it's such a competitive

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.680
[Guest]: field because you know, everyone is pretty intelligent.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:50.080
[Guest]: So I think that final leap of faith is very often made against all advice.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.920
[Guest]: And it's made at a time when you really don't know what's on the other side.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.400
[Guest]: So it's truly a leap of faith in that sense, you know, so to answer your question, I think,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.240
[Guest]: you know, as fatalistic as it may sound, I've also believed that things which don't work

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.860
[Guest]: out sometimes just don't work out for a reason.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.800
[Guest]: So had I not got the requisite marks to make it into medicine, maybe I would have just

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.480
[Guest]: like taken it in my stride and done something else at that point of time.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.640
[Guest]: But even today, you know, so somebody going through the system, even today, where the

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.400
[Guest]: applicant pool is so high, you have to compete so hard to get into the right kind of colleges

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.120
[Guest]: to get a good education.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.840
[Guest]: I think there's no simple answer, you know.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.000
[Guest]: So if somebody asks me today, if somebody in my similar situation, who's in 10th or

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.440
[Guest]: 11th asks me today, whether this is the right choice for me, I will place the facts in front

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.960
[Guest]: of the person, but I will not tell them that it's a no brainer that you know, this is this

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.240
[Guest]: is the best life that you'll ever have, because it is a tough life.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.520
[Guest]: And you know, I think that that's kind of my answer to your question.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, that's very illuminating, because just thinking aloud, you know, I had

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.280
[Amit Varma]: a young person come to me for advice a few months ago, where his mother wanted him to

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280
[Amit Varma]: do medicine.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.520
[Amit Varma]: And he was like, what's the scene?

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.360
[Amit Varma]: And I said, Listen, in the end, of course, it is a personal decision, it's up to you.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.760
[Amit Varma]: But just putting my economics hat on, I would say that the opportunity cost of medicine

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.760
[Amit Varma]: is far higher.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.240
[Amit Varma]: Because if you decide engineering is not for you, you can do an MBA, you can go to a scroll

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.760
[Amit Varma]: or a wire or the Times of India and say, make me a trainee reporter, or whatever there are

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.320
[Amit Varma]: all those options are kind of there.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.120
[Amit Varma]: But medicine, you could be 30 by the time you realize you're not going to make it.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.200
[Amit Varma]: And it could be too late.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.640
[Amit Varma]: So if all things were equal, satirist parables, it would almost be a no brainer not to do

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640
[Amit Varma]: medicine.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.560
[Amit Varma]: But if that's where your heart lies, that's where your heart lies.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, my other question here is that I've spoken to people who say that we got into medicine

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.680
[Amit Varma]: because of a passion for biology, because of the wonder of medicine, like one of my

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.520
[Amit Varma]: friends told me that, you know, one of his parents died of cancer when he was young.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.160
[Amit Varma]: And he said, I want to find a cure for cancer, right.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.560
[Amit Varma]: And therefore he gets into medicine.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.320
[Amit Varma]: But having gotten a certain way along the academic path, he realized that wait a minute,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.320
[Amit Varma]: doctors don't find a cure for anything, I need to be a scientist.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And then he goes and he becomes a scientist.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And now he's a successful academic somewhere.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.640
[Amit Varma]: So you know, did you go through that kind of process?

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Because a lot of the things that I guess would attract you, which would be intellectually

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.660
[Amit Varma]: attractive or stimulating about the study of medicine would actually be related to science

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.640
[Amit Varma]: and higher research, rather than becoming a practicing doctor to begin with.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.920
[Amit Varma]: And I'm aware that you have an MSc in epidemiology and all of that, which you went on to do,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.600
[Amit Varma]: but you are a practicing doctor.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.240
[Amit Varma]: So obviously, this has to be something that you then thought about.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.760
[Amit Varma]: And what then made you decide that no, I will practice, I will be a doctor because it seems

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.760
[Amit Varma]: to me that just from the way that I look at it, it feels that in science, you're always

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.160
[Amit Varma]: moving forward, even if it's a little forward incrementally, but you're moving forward.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.620
[Amit Varma]: While in medicine, it seems that you're running to stand still, you're always trying to kind

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.320
[Amit Varma]: of figure out what is the latest and kind of apply that.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.040
[Amit Varma]: So how has that process of thinking these things through been for you?

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.120
[Guest]: So I think when people begin, no matter what they begin in terms of their career, I think

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.480
[Guest]: everybody has a very big canvas in mind, they always think that, you know, they're going

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.280
[Guest]: to change the world in some way.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.400
[Guest]: So if you, you know, if you met someone like, if you met me when I was in my 10th grade

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.160
[Guest]: or my 12th grade and said, you know, what is evidence based medicine?

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.720
[Guest]: Do you know how, how will you make decisions when it comes to patient care?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.760
[Guest]: I think there was no concept of, of anything like that at that point of time, in the sense

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.720
[Guest]: in on my radar, right?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.320
[Guest]: So most, most of the decisions are made in terms of what kind of a person do you want

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.320
[Guest]: to be?

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.960
[Guest]: So I was, I was always attracted to this concept of just working hard and giving it your best,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960
[Guest]: no matter what.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.880
[Guest]: And, you know, let things take care of themselves, you know, don't, don't be obsessed about how

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.000
[Guest]: much money you're making.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.160
[Guest]: Don't be obsessed about what, what is the so-called return on investment, you know,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.760
[Guest]: which is, which is the whole argument against medicine, right?

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.840
[Guest]: Which everyone reminds you again and again that, you know, when are you going to make

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840
[Guest]: money?

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.920
[Guest]: And the worst is when you're like around 24 years old, you know, where all your friends,

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.880
[Guest]: the last bencher in your school is also suddenly joined the merchant Navy and he's making like

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.480
[Guest]: 20 times the amount that you are.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.840
[Guest]: And everybody points out that you've clearly made the wrong decision.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:08.080
[Guest]: So I think this, this decision comes from a place of, I think a larger principle that,

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.680
[Guest]: you know, you enjoy at some level helping people.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.400
[Guest]: I don't necessarily mean in an altruistic way, or I don't mean it, I don't mean it in

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.880
[Guest]: a, in a charitable way.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.040
[Guest]: I mean it in a way that, you know, somebody comes to you with some sort of a problem,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.800
[Guest]: you are able to give them some sort of an instant relief, you are able to give them

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.520
[Guest]: solace in some way.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.000
[Guest]: And that turnaround time is rapid enough that you get the feedback, you feel good about

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
[Guest]: it, you feel that you are making a difference on micro levels.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.400
[Guest]: And I think that's the model, or that's the goal that people are attracted to at that

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.600
[Guest]: stage when, you know, early on.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.080
[Guest]: Now whether that will cause a big dent in the world, possibly not, you know, but I think

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.080
[Guest]: those little joys on a day to day basis, where even though, you know, as you rightly pointed

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.720
[Guest]: out, you're running to stay in the same place when you look at the macro picture, but at

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.680
[Guest]: the micro picture, you're making small moves every single day, which, which give you a

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.480
[Guest]: lot of instant gratification, which a lot of other fields possibly don't get.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.400
[Guest]: You know, if you're, and this is my perspective, and I could be completely wrong.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.520
[Guest]: But say if you're a software engineer, and you're designing software, maybe when the

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.640
[Guest]: product is finally ready one year down the road, you get a lot of gratification and you

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.700
[Guest]: get a lot of sense of achievement.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.080
[Guest]: But during that one year, it's probably every single day is, is, is tough, you know, because

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.120
[Guest]: you're just writing code maybe.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.280
[Guest]: But but for a doctor, I think there are a lot of small joys in every single day.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.280
[Guest]: And I think that's what drives a lot of us, especially in your early years, because you've

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.000
[Guest]: seen you've yourself gone to a doctor at some point of time, you've yourself realized that

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.680
[Guest]: they give you some sort of a salve, some sort of a relief at that point, which makes you

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.680
[Guest]: feel good.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.760
[Guest]: And I think I think that process is something which is very attractive.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.760
[Amit Varma]: That's really interesting.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Because I mean, when you think about it, the world is a positive someplace.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And we benefit when others benefit, mostly unless you know, you're in the government

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.240
[Amit Varma]: or you're in seeking or whatever.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.160
[Amit Varma]: But for most of us, the benefit that comes from our work is unseen, it's like really

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.200
[Amit Varma]: the scene in the unseen, that it's way down the road, like you said, if a software engineer

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.280
[Amit Varma]: designed some software, even when the software is out there, he can't really see the benefit,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.760
[Amit Varma]: he doesn't know how much difference is few lines of code made.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.920
[Amit Varma]: Maybe if he works in Microsoft, maybe that's what made Windows hang.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.720
[Amit Varma]: But in your case, it's a little more immediate, which is fascinating to me.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.800
[Amit Varma]: It also sort of strikes me that, you know, when we think of experts, when we think of

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.120
[Amit Varma]: the professionals, we think of them as people who know their field.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.960
[Amit Varma]: But I think what often happens is in many fields, whether it is medicine or economics

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.360
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, in all fields, there's a set of people who are not really actively engaged

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.560
[Amit Varma]: in that sense, they are doing the degree, they get the knowledge, and that is a knowledge

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.560
[Amit Varma]: they have.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And very often, it's kind of a static kind of knowledge.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.520
[Amit Varma]: And they don't have the intellectual curiosity to maybe apply their frame to other things

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.280
[Amit Varma]: and constantly broaden, constantly read all of that.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I noticed this most with some economists, you know, there are really two

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.200
[Amit Varma]: kinds of economists, those who are thinking actively about the world.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.720
[Amit Varma]: And those who have done the training, who can make the charts and do the regressions

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.160
[Amit Varma]: and all that, but aren't really thinking that actively now with doctors also, it seems to

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.720
[Amit Varma]: me that we think of doctors as experts, we have a problem, we go to a doc, doc will solve

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.720
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.040
[Amit Varma]: But very often, you know, a doctor say trained in the 1990s, was trained in what was in many

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.200
[Amit Varma]: fields, very outdated knowledge, for example, nutrition, right, where for the longest time

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.480
[Amit Varma]: for decades, you know, the sugar lobby funded all these studies at Harvard and all that

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.840
[Amit Varma]: in the 1950s and 60s.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.360
[Amit Varma]: And you know, fat was demonized, sugar was supposed to be okay.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.040
[Amit Varma]: And the American government released guidelines to this effect in the late 1970s.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.320
[Amit Varma]: And their obesity epidemic begins from there.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.320
[Amit Varma]: And in something like the last 10 to 15 years, it's kind of become common knowledge that

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.880
[Amit Varma]: all of this is kind of rubbish, we've been obsessing over the wrong things, sugar is

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.880
[Amit Varma]: the real problem.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.900
[Amit Varma]: Now, one of my friends went to a doctor recently to ask about nutrition.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And he got that old dogma, because she hadn't read up and updated herself on the state of

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.040
[Amit Varma]: the science.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.040
[Amit Varma]: So a two part question really that when you were studying, did you notice this difference

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.600
[Amit Varma]: in approach that there are people who just want to understand what is in the books and

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.280
[Amit Varma]: do well in the exams.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.480
[Amit Varma]: And there are people who are naturally curious, who are reading more, and therefore who are

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:17.640
[Amit Varma]: more likely in future to stay updated with whatever the state of the science is.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.760
[Guest]: I think part of that is the problem in which medical education occurs.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.200
[Guest]: And you know, it's very fact heavy.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.000
[Guest]: So let's look at medical textbooks, right?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.920
[Guest]: So I mean, most of us have this God textbook for every subject under the sun.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.480
[Guest]: So if you're studying anatomy, this is the God textbook.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.840
[Guest]: If you're studying physiology, this is the God textbook.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.760
[Guest]: Now, I've been part of a process of knowing how textbooks are written.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.600
[Guest]: And if you look at how textbooks are written, the time gap between when the decision to

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.120
[Guest]: write the textbook begins to the textbook actually being published is usually around

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.800
[Guest]: two to three years.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.160
[Guest]: So when it actually gets published, some of the stuff was current and relevant three years

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.080
[Guest]: ago and is probably already been surpassed by newer knowledge or superseded by a newer

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.140
[Guest]: study which has happened.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.440
[Guest]: So if you bank completely on textbooks, you're not going to get state of the art knowledge.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.120
[Guest]: However, medical education gives a lot of focus on textbooks.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.240
[Guest]: So that's one example where you are taught to keep sticking to the facts which are written

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.320
[Guest]: in the textbook that's written in stone because it's this God textbook.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.820
[Guest]: It's this Bible of a particular subject.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.880
[Guest]: You are not taught the methodology to critique things.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.200
[Guest]: You are taught to remember the facts.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.540
[Guest]: You are not really trained in how to critique facts.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.160
[Guest]: So if that training comes into play, then you would have this healthy discussion which

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.720
[Guest]: would constantly happen, which happens in academia, right?

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.360
[Guest]: Where somebody says something and another person points out and says, but listen, there

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.300
[Guest]: was this newer study which was published just two days ago.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.560
[Guest]: Have you gone through it?

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:47.520
[Guest]: And that constant debate, that constant being the constant chatter among academics, which

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.360
[Guest]: makes one realize that, you know, you need to constantly update yourself is very often

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.000
[Guest]: lacking in medical schools.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
[Guest]: That is a big problem.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.720
[Guest]: So that you are not taught really to question.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.760
[Guest]: Now whether that divides the world into two parts, I don't think it's that straightforward.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:09.840
[Guest]: I think most of us with a medical education come out again with the same concepts of truths

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.600
[Guest]: being absolutely written in stone.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.200
[Guest]: It's when you start practicing, if you are curious enough, if you realize that, you know,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.880
[Guest]: every patient does not fit into a particular mold, if you start questioning why something's

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.080
[Guest]: happening in a certain way when you expected it to happen the other way, if you then get

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.960
[Guest]: into a process of constantly searching, constantly reviewing the literature, I think that that

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.740
[Guest]: makes a lot of difference.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.160
[Guest]: Now part of that is also a function of time.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.640
[Guest]: So it is extremely difficult for doctors to continuously update themselves, which is why

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.000
[Guest]: it would be nice if there were simpler guidelines, right?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.520
[Guest]: I mean, that's what we all want.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.960
[Guest]: We want some sort of a guideline that's constantly updated, or some sort of a course which we

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.120
[Guest]: can attend once a year where we get updated and change our practice.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.080
[Guest]: Now expecting a practicing doctor to be able to continuously update themselves is a tough

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.320
[Guest]: task.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.520
[Guest]: And the way it works, unfortunately or unfortunately, in medicine is that the older you get, the

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.600
[Guest]: more senior you get, your patient base increases and, you know, there's word of mouth, there's

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.200
[Guest]: a general awareness of a particular doctor of a particular specialty being there.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.520
[Guest]: And that just means that you're getting busier and busier and therefore having lesser and

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.480
[Guest]: lesser time to update yourself.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.360
[Guest]: And unfortunately, this then becomes a common trajectory for a lot of doctors and, you know,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.120
[Guest]: even I hope this doesn't happen to me, but that's the natural drift, unfortunately, that

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.520
[Guest]: you get busy, you get popular, you get more patients, less time to read, and gradually

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.680
[Guest]: you start doing things which are outdated.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.760
[Guest]: And I think this needs to be rethought, you know, we need to figure out a way to get out

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.120
[Amit Varma]: of this.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.520
[Amit Varma]: And how does one keep in touch with latest research then?

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.640
[Amit Varma]: Like, is the internet a game changer there?

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.440
[Amit Varma]: Because I would assume that pre the internet for a practicing doctor to want to keep in

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.480
[Amit Varma]: touch with the latest in the field, especially if you're in India, and all the latest research

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.320
[Amit Varma]: and all that is happening in the US is incredibly difficult, but now it should be kind of easier.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.360
[Amit Varma]: So what are your practices like, are there journals you go to, do you spend a certain

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.920
[Amit Varma]: amount of time reading papers?

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.880
[Amit Varma]: Do you tell yourself that X percent of the time I must devote to updating myself or,

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, leveling up?

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.040
[Guest]: How does that process kind of work for you?

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.080
[Guest]: So I think one of the best ways of keeping yourself updated on the literature is having

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.080
[Guest]: students, right?

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.560
[Guest]: And I have the luxury of having students, I'm at a teaching institute.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.040
[Guest]: So when you teach students, you automatically update yourself on the latest literature.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:33.160
[Guest]: If you inculcate that hunger in them, students have this natural questioning hunger, which

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.840
[Guest]: they will, you know, they will pose questions to you on rounds sometimes saying that, you

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.920
[Guest]: know, is this the right way of doing things?

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.160
[Guest]: And that again, needs to be fostered.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.720
[Guest]: If you go by the didactic method, that it's my way or the highway, you know, this is right

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.560
[Guest]: because boss says so, you will end up having your knowledge not updated because, you know,

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.880
[Guest]: where you are at is where you will be.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.560
[Guest]: Your students will not question you and you will keep perpetuating the same cycle.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.840
[Guest]: If you have students who constantly ask you or, and you can ask them as well, you know,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.480
[Guest]: why don't you read up on this and tell me more about this, that exchange keeps you updated

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.000
[Guest]: and it's very useful.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.960
[Guest]: But then again, I have the luxury of being in a teaching institute.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.280
[Guest]: If you're not at a teaching institute, fortunately, there are a lot of, I don't know what they're

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.280
[Guest]: called.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.680
[Guest]: They probably like meta websites, which have started compiling literature from all the

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680
[Guest]: available evidence.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.120
[Guest]: And, you know, the thing that comes to mind, which I use on a day-to-day basis is something

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.760
[Guest]: called up-to-date.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.720
[Guest]: So up-to-date is a website, which also has an app on your phone now, where they get experts

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.560
[Guest]: in a particular field to write a particular topic and that expert will cover the topic

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.080
[Guest]: through and through.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.440
[Guest]: The experts are also incentivized to update it every year or so.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.320
[Guest]: I think, you know, they're actually paid, I know, because some of my supervisors have

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.240
[Guest]: written topics here and they're incentivized to keep updating the topic.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.560
[Guest]: So supposing I have this patient sitting in front of me who I think has this rare lung

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.240
[Guest]: disorder and I've, you know, the last time I've seen a patient with something like this

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.400
[Guest]: was about three years back.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.220
[Guest]: So clearly I'm not going to be by default updated on the literature because it's not

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.480
[Guest]: being on my radar.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.820
[Guest]: I haven't actively searched for this disease.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.720
[Guest]: So I go to up-to-date, I open it and very often, you know, I will come to know if there's

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.080
[Guest]: a new drug available, if there's a new therapy that has been tried somewhere, there are links

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.040
[Guest]: sometimes which will take me to earlier studies, and then I can choose to go into a deep dive.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.920
[Guest]: So up-to-date will summarize what the literature is, give me the references for those papers.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:27.080
[Guest]: I can then go and dig out those papers myself, critique those papers, see if they make sense

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.480
[Guest]: and summarize.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.960
[Guest]: But this is not as easy as it sounds in the sense that you're trying to do all of this

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.840
[Guest]: in the middle of an OPD, in the middle of a clinic.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.800
[Guest]: So I have sometimes told patients, let me read up.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.720
[Guest]: I open this in front of the patient and I do it, but I can see how a lot of people would

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.660
[Guest]: feel that doing that would make the patient question their credentials.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.840
[Guest]: So I think we need to also create a healthy atmosphere where, you know, the doctor doesn't

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.840
[Guest]: know all the answers.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.200
[Guest]: The doctor will update his knowledge if necessary in front of you.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.000
[Guest]: The doctor is someone who will give you the best knowledge as of today.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.360
[Guest]: How he gets there could be a journey, could involve some time on your part.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.600
[Guest]: He doesn't need to be an encyclopedia with all the answers ready.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.560
[Guest]: As long as we start moving to that modality where even patients accept that, you know,

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.480
[Guest]: accept a doctor who's searching in front of them, accept a doctor who says, I don't know.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.560
[Guest]: I think that's great.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.400
[Guest]: So when I talk to my friends and relatives, I tell them very often that the doctor you

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:29.280
[Guest]: want is the doctor who once in a while says, I don't know the answer to this question.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.760
[Guest]: If you have a doctor who knows the answer to every question, then that's, you know,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.000
[Guest]: I mean, it could be exceptionally good, of course, but, you know, that would be a rarity.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, this leads me into a digression on what patients really expect from their

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.120
[Amit Varma]: doctors.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.760
[Amit Varma]: And I think in India, at least, they expect a veneer of knowledge.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.760
[Amit Varma]: They expect their doctor to be like an expert, to have the definitive answers, to give them

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.760
[Amit Varma]: medicines.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.080
[Amit Varma]: Look, you know, as you have also pointed out in the past, this is what leads to overprescription

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.080
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.920
[Amit Varma]: I remember I read an episode on healthcare with the economist Karthik Murali Tharan and

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:06.160
[Amit Varma]: he referred to this study in 2007, where, you know, the author of the study asked a

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.080
[Amit Varma]: doctor in a slum so that, you know, when someone has diarrhea, what do you give them?

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.040
[Amit Varma]: And the person listed out a bunch of medicines.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And then the guy asked that, you know, why don't you just give them oral rehydration?

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840
[Amit Varma]: Because that's enough.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840
[Amit Varma]: That's what WHO recommends.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.320
[Amit Varma]: And he said, no, because then they won't come to me, they've come to a doctor, they expect

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.840
[Amit Varma]: a bunch of medicines.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.840
[Amit Varma]: That's what I do.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.400
[Amit Varma]: If I don't do that, they'll go to someone else, I lose income.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.920
[Amit Varma]: And that's something, by the way, in India that it's not just doctors, it's we expect

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.280
[Amit Varma]: all our experts to be full of certainty, while the truth is that those who know the most

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.320
[Amit Varma]: will have the least certainty because they'll know how much they don't know.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:42.400
[Amit Varma]: Whereas, you know, it's a Dunning-Kruger effect that it's often the fools who have the greatest

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.040
[Amit Varma]: certainty, not to say that doctors are necessarily like that.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.440
[Amit Varma]: So what do you feel about this?

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.840
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that there is also this kind of interaction where you not only have to find

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.440
[Amit Varma]: the best treatment, but you also have to live up to the patient's expectations?

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.360
[Amit Varma]: So is it like a game theoretic problem somewhere where there are trade-offs you have to consider?

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.360
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.680
[Guest]: I couldn't agree more.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.680
[Guest]: So you gave a context in which you have a diagnosis.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.920
[Guest]: I often have to face a situation where I tell the patient, listen, we need to do a few tests,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.680
[Guest]: you know, we'll do these tests, we'll meet up again with the results of these tests.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.480
[Guest]: And then we'll talk about what needs to be done.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.280
[Guest]: And on their way out, they very often will turn back and say, but what have you given

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.480
[Guest]: me in treatment today?

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.920
[Guest]: And I need to tell them that I don't know what you have, you know, I genuinely don't

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920
[Guest]: know what you have.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.240
[Guest]: How can I treat you if I don't know what you have?

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.960
[Guest]: And they still will very often insist that, you know, but just give me something for today.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:42.080
[Guest]: You know, it's almost like this whole interaction is incomplete till there is a prescription

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.160
[Guest]: prescribing drugs.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.080
[Guest]: You know, it's not just a prescription with tests.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.520
[Guest]: It has to be a prescription prescribing drugs because I've come to you with a problem and

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.540
[Guest]: you have to give me a fix in some way.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:58.720
[Guest]: So I completely empathize, you know, so there is no judgment on my part when I see doctors,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.800
[Guest]: you know, starting off people on a bunch of medications or doctors being forced to order

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:09.120
[Guest]: tests sometimes, because we've created this sort of a culture where, you know, a doctor

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.080
[Guest]: who prescribes a lot and I get better is the right doctor.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.400
[Guest]: The doctor who says take nothing, even if I get better, but he didn't give me anything.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.160
[Guest]: So it's not, it's basul nahi hua, as you say in Hindi, you know, there was, it didn't complete

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160
[Guest]: the interaction.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.160
[Guest]: What did I pay him so much for?

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.240
[Guest]: You know, why did I waste my time going there?

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.240
[Guest]: I didn't get anything out of it.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.960
[Guest]: So I think this is a genuine problem.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.880
[Guest]: And I think we need to start thinking in terms of how to let people know that medicines are

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.320
[Guest]: not a solution for every problem.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.120
[Guest]: And going on and on indefinitely with medicines are also not a solution, you know.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.080
[Guest]: And there are some problems which can be fixed.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.960
[Guest]: There are some problems to which, you know, there are no solutions sometimes you just

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.800
[Guest]: have to have to accept that.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.680
[Guest]: I mean, we talk about all these fancy things and, you know, cutting edge stuff and doing

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.520
[Guest]: scans while as you look at respiratory medicine, something as simple as cough.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.480
[Guest]: You know, there are people who are doing PhDs in cough as of today, you know, after centuries

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.680
[Guest]: and centuries of coughing, we still don't know what really causes cough in certain circumstances.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.320
[Guest]: We still don't know where the receptors exactly might be.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.000
[Guest]: We still don't know what is the drug that will actually work.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.840
[Guest]: I remember meeting this world expert in cough and he runs a cough clinic.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.560
[Guest]: And I said, you know, how do you, there was a particular example I gave him and I said,

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.560
[Guest]: how do you treat it?

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.040
[Guest]: So he says, listen, my clinic's very busy.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.880
[Guest]: So I cannot, you know, see people frequently.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.840
[Guest]: So I can see them maybe once a month.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.160
[Guest]: So I take any four random drugs which work on cough generally.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.640
[Guest]: I say if week one you try this, if this doesn't work, week two you try this, if that doesn't

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.920
[Guest]: work, week three you try this, if that doesn't work, week four you try this.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.120
[Guest]: And he says, for all you know, nature cures them at some point of time and then the patient

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.960
[Guest]: attributes the cure to that last medication, you know.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.960
[Guest]: So that's how it is.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:55.120
[Guest]: You know, people want some sort of a medicine as a solution for every problem.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.840
[Guest]: And I think we need to do something to counter that.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.640
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, you know, what you said reminded me of the common phenomenon of regression

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.640
[Amit Varma]: to the mean, right?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.080
[Amit Varma]: Like, why do, for example, people think homeopathy works?

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.640
[Amit Varma]: Part of it is, of course, a placebo effect, but part of it is if you take homeopathy for

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.000
[Amit Varma]: something that's going to get better anyway, you will ascribe causation.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.640
[Amit Varma]: You will say, oh, this cured me.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.920
[Amit Varma]: And this could also be true of any cocktail of medicines that the doctor gives you for

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.000
[Amit Varma]: a particular point where you got better on your own, but hey, you feel this worked and

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, you will give credit to the medicine and therefore to the doctor.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.120
[Amit Varma]: And this, of course, happens in politics also where, you know, Amit Shah recently came out

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.360
[Amit Varma]: and said that, you know, Narendra Modi ji has solved the second wave.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.160
[Amit Varma]: And I'm like, that's regression to the mean, right?

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.020
[Amit Varma]: The second wave at some point in time would have gone down in the most extreme case with

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.400
[Amit Varma]: everyone dying, but whatever happens, a wave would have gone down.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.120
[Amit Varma]: So the fact of it going down alone is not reason enough to take credit.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.980
[Amit Varma]: But I don't want to draw you into that kind of political stuff.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.980
[Amit Varma]: What am I even doing?

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:55.220
[Amit Varma]: A couple of interesting things, like one thing that sort of strikes me is that when it comes

00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:00.640
[Amit Varma]: to the practice of medicine itself, especially I'm assuming in a place like India, I think

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.060
[Amit Varma]: two things would happen for a doctor and I'm just sort of thinking aloud and you can enlighten

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.500
[Amit Varma]: me on whether these processes actually happen and all of that.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.360
[Amit Varma]: One is because you're seeing a multiple number of patients and you do not have unlimited

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:17.120
[Amit Varma]: time for each one, you develop these what economists call fast and frugal heuristics

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.800
[Amit Varma]: by which you figure out that, okay, this is the symptom and this is likely to be the most

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.960
[Amit Varma]: common cause for it.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, let me try this and all of that.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.400
[Amit Varma]: And how does that process work?

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Because initially as a young person, you must be enthusiastic, you want to get to the root

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.160
[Amit Varma]: of everything.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Is there a point in time when you realize that in practical terms, it is not possible

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.760
[Amit Varma]: and I'll let you answer this first and then I'll go on to my next one.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.880
[Guest]: So that's again the unfortunate part of medicine, you know, the better you get, the more successful

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.760
[Guest]: you get, the larger the volume of patients you have, the larger the volume of patients

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.760
[Guest]: you have, the lesser time you spend with each one of them.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.200
[Guest]: And then, you know, exactly what you said, you're pretty much triaging in your head.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:02.720
[Guest]: Is this person in dire need for some emergent treatment or is this person not so bad where,

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.800
[Guest]: you know, we can just quickly give him something, send him off, you know, maybe nature takes

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.800
[Guest]: care of it.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.560
[Guest]: Maybe he gets better and he comes back.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.680
[Guest]: If it doesn't, then he comes back to me and maybe that second time round is where I really

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.760
[Guest]: spend more time because now I realize that, you know, that quick three minute consult

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.040
[Guest]: wasn't good enough.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.400
[Guest]: I completely agree with you, you know, the unfortunate part of becoming successful and

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.760
[Guest]: being good at something, in medicine especially, is that eventually it leads to large volumes.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.920
[Guest]: And I think one of the ways in which you can solve this problem is by having a team.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.280
[Guest]: So if you have a good second rung, if you have a good bunch of assistants working with

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.560
[Guest]: you, kind of filter things out, you know, give you a brief, quick summary of what's

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.400
[Guest]: happening and then you act on that summary, I think that makes a big difference.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.080
[Guest]: Because otherwise, you know, exactly what you said, it becomes like quick algorithms.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.760
[Guest]: Everything becomes algorithmic and whoever doesn't fit into that algorithm is a problem.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.760
[Guest]: So let me give you an example.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.360
[Guest]: You know, since we're talking about COVID-19, so one of the things that has been a common

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.720
[Guest]: problem over the past year is individuals who've come to me with breathlessness who

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.320
[Guest]: are actually sighing, you know, because of anxiety, you take a deep breath and you breathe

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.440
[Guest]: out and that, you know, there are natural processes which lower your heart rate when

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.440
[Guest]: you do that.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.580
[Guest]: There are natural processes which calm you when you do that.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.320
[Guest]: So it's almost like an epidemic of sighing that I've seen over the past year.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.800
[Guest]: And these individuals, if you go down that same algorithmic route, somebody says they

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.640
[Guest]: are breathless, you know, do a whole bunch of tests, you know, and then find nothing

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.640
[Guest]: wrong.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.420
[Guest]: Then you try some inhaler, you try something, I mean, you can completely go down that route.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.680
[Guest]: But very often, if you just spend like 30 seconds looking at that person and talking

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:41.400
[Guest]: to that person, you will realize that during that conversation itself, the person sighs

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.480
[Guest]: a couple of times, and you realize that the person is in a hospital, the person is anxious,

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.920
[Guest]: and clearly that person is sighing.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.280
[Guest]: You ask them when they sleep at night, do they sigh or get up breathless?

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.880
[Guest]: And the answer to that is almost always no.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.560
[Guest]: So clearly, you know, whatever the problem is, is not happening at night, which again

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:04.320
[Guest]: points towards a psychological problem, something that's making the person anxious.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.240
[Guest]: And again, you know, this is why it's important to spend time.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.080
[Guest]: This is why it's important to observe patients and realize what's happening.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.080
[Amit Varma]: This is mind blowing.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.080
[Amit Varma]: An epidemic of sighing.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.080
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Another question.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.440
[Amit Varma]: My last episode was with Kavita Krishnan, and in that we briefly spoke about Mary Wollstonecraft,

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.720
[Amit Varma]: the great feminist author of the early 19th century or the late 18th century, really.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.280
[Amit Varma]: And one of the tragedies there is that she died young because she died during childbirth.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:33.320
[Amit Varma]: In fact, she gave birth to Mary Shelley, who would later marry the poet, and she died three

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.640
[Amit Varma]: days after childbirth, I think because the doctor didn't wash his hands, right?

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.280
[Amit Varma]: Because that basic protocol was not known at the time.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.000
[Amit Varma]: That is something that happened in the middle of the 19th century.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.200
[Amit Varma]: Ignaz Semmelweis said that, you know, correlated not washing hands to disease and people ignored

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.200
[Amit Varma]: him for decades.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.440
[Amit Varma]: And I think if I remember correctly, he died in a lunatic asylum eventually.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.000
[Amit Varma]: Something really sad like that.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.520
[Amit Varma]: And that eventually got figured out.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.440
[Amit Varma]: But that was also the reason that around that time, things like homeopathy and all that

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.160
[Amit Varma]: alternative medicines became common, because at least they weren't harming people.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, of course, there is harm in terms of the opportunity cost.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.760
[Amit Varma]: You don't get some other treatment if you take sugar pills, but they weren't harming

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.760
[Amit Varma]: people.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.080
[Amit Varma]: Whereas if you went to a hospital, your chances of dying were insanely high because evidence

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.440
[Amit Varma]: based medicine, as it were, was simply not at that stage of advancement.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.360
[Amit Varma]: Now, that, of course, has changed.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.640
[Amit Varma]: And today it is.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:26.320
[Amit Varma]: But for most things, how important would you say these processes still are internalizing

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.680
[Amit Varma]: them and with the washing of hands being the most basic example.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.200
[Amit Varma]: But if you think of do no harm, just kind of internalizing them and going with that,

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there's a great quote, I forget by whom some famous doctor you might know.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.760
[Amit Varma]: I just read this recently on Twitter.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.120
[Amit Varma]: I think Anirban Mahapatra quoted this person in his episode with me on COVID-19, where

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.400
[Amit Varma]: he said that at its core, every medicine is a poison.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:54.120
[Amit Varma]: So to what extent does the do no harm imperative of the physician go in both in terms of processes

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.760
[Amit Varma]: or best practices like washing hands and all of that, and also just being aware that listen,

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.080
[Amit Varma]: I'm expected to give a cocktail of medicines to this person, but all of them have side

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.160
[Amit Varma]: effects, all of them can do harm in different ways.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.400
[Amit Varma]: Like we are finding out and we'll discuss COVID-19 later.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.760
[Amit Varma]: But if you give steroids too early, that depresses the immune system and chances are your fever

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760
[Amit Varma]: will go down.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.860
[Amit Varma]: But COVID will hit you really hard after that happens, which has happened in so many cases.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:23.200
[Amit Varma]: So how much of a part is just being aware of what not to do as much as what to do?

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.200
[Guest]: I think it's extremely important to not trivialize any medicine.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:32.200
[Guest]: You know, for some reason, we have this concept of safe medicines and unsafe medicines.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.120
[Guest]: And what you said is absolutely right.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.240
[Guest]: It's the dose that determines what a poison is.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.440
[Guest]: I think there's a Latin quote which says that.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.000
[Guest]: You know, things like vitamin D, for example, you can overdose on vitamin D when given as

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
[Guest]: an injection.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.280
[Guest]: And we've seen patients get admitted with hypervitaminosis D, which is a real thing.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.860
[Guest]: You know, it causes confusion, it causes a lot of problems.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:57.520
[Guest]: So even things which are seemingly innocuous may not necessarily be innocuous, may not

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.920
[Guest]: be innocuous for a particular person, right?

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.620
[Guest]: It may be okay for 99.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.620
[Guest]: So that's another aspect.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.640
[Guest]: Number one, it may not be innocuous for anyone.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.080
[Guest]: Number two, maybe what if there is a subset of people in whom it doesn't react well.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.080
[Guest]: And we just prescribe it assuming that, you know, these words which are used, you know,

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:19.360
[Guest]: safe, vitamins, immunity boosters, you know, things that give a person a sense of something

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.360
[Guest]: is being done.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.800
[Guest]: And because by virtue of something being done, I'm going to be in a better place than I was

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.780
[Guest]: prior to receiving this.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.360
[Guest]: And yes, there is a placebo effect.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.300
[Guest]: You know, people do feel better with a lot of different things.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.680
[Guest]: And that is a challenge for a doctor as well, you know, in terms of, should I give something

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.480
[Guest]: because that something will act like a placebo and make this person feel better.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:45.640
[Guest]: And therefore, you know, my obligation to be a caregiver of some sort should not supersede

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:51.320
[Guest]: my obligation to just be absolutely right and proper about not unnecessarily prescribing

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.320
[Guest]: things.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.520
[Guest]: So that's the balance that you have to find.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.720
[Guest]: So if somebody comes to me and somebody comes to another doctor, we're talking about a counterfactual,

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.560
[Guest]: where the other doctor gives the patient a vitamin, the patient suddenly feels a boost

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.960
[Guest]: of energy, he or she is happy, they go back feeling extremely satisfied versus the patient

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.840
[Guest]: coming to me, I say, you know, you have nothing wrong with you, please go away, in the nicest

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.240
[Guest]: way possible, of course.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.560
[Guest]: But you know, that person continues to suffer in some way, who's to say who's right in this

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.560
[Guest]: circumstance, right?

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.960
[Guest]: This is where the challenge lies, you know, the effect of placebos, should it really mean

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:26.280
[Guest]: something to a doctor as well to give a placebo, but based on the fact that we are scientists

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:32.000
[Guest]: and based on the fact that we hold on to science, for everything that we do, I think we shouldn't

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.760
[Guest]: be doing anything without a strong rational reason or scientific basis that suggests that

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.320
[Guest]: something is going to work.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.400
[Guest]: And you know, I'm equally passionate making this argument with tests, I mean, possibly

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.860
[Guest]: even more than medicines, right?

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:51.920
[Guest]: For me, if I order a test, the outcome of the test must influence my treatment decisions

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.920
[Guest]: in some way.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.940
[Guest]: You know, if you look at probability, probabilistically, there was a study done, which shows that if

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.360
[Guest]: you did eight random tests without a pretest probability, right?

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:06.320
[Guest]: So not Bayesian, you just randomly just gave anybody eight tests, 20% of the population

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:11.320
[Guest]: that you give those eight tests to would have one abnormal value completely by random chance,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.320
[Guest]: right?

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:17.640
[Guest]: Now, if you increase that to 16 tests, I think it's about 16 or 20 tests, that probability

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.140
[Guest]: goes up to about 99%.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:23.320
[Guest]: So one test will be abnormal completely by random chance.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.080
[Guest]: So if you've asked for a test, you need to know that if the abnormal value comes back,

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.360
[Guest]: are you going to do something about it?

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.920
[Guest]: And if the answer to that is, I'm not going to do anything about it, you have no business

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.800
[Guest]: ordering that test to begin with.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.880
[Guest]: I think the same flavor holds true for medicines as well.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:43.280
[Guest]: You do not want to give medicines just because you can't leave a prescription blank, or you

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.200
[Guest]: don't know what needs to be done.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.420
[Guest]: You give a medicine only when you believe that science has proven in some way that taking

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:57.080
[Guest]: that medicine for that individual will improve his or her odds of getting better as compared

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.080
[Guest]: to doing nothing.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.080
[Guest]: I think that should be the guiding light.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:05.880
[Amit Varma]: And earlier we spoke about doctors responding to incentives from patients in terms of overprescribing

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.880
[Amit Varma]: and all that.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.720
[Amit Varma]: But doctors are also prey to other kinds of incentives.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.420
[Amit Varma]: And I'm told this is more of a problem in the north than here.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.680
[Amit Varma]: But I'd like your opinion on it, which is that, look, you're working for a hospital

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.800
[Amit Varma]: in different places from whatever doctors will get a commission for every test that

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.800
[Amit Varma]: they order.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.240
[Amit Varma]: So they incentivize to order tests, they get a revenue share in whatever their practice

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.000
[Amit Varma]: brings in within the hospital.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.960
[Amit Varma]: So they are incentivized towards asking the patient to do maximum tests, which may be

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.880
[Amit Varma]: unnecessary with, you know, all kinds of overtreatment.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.720
[Amit Varma]: And I know that just talking about these incentives makes doctors seem like heartless mercenary

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.000
[Amit Varma]: beings.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.120
[Amit Varma]: And I don't want to give that impression at all, especially because what I think has become

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.680
[Amit Varma]: visible to all of us in the last few months is that our frontline workers in the health

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.840
[Amit Varma]: care systems, our doctors, our nurses, and other medical personnel are our heroes.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.200
[Amit Varma]: They are like the firefighters of 9-11.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.120
[Amit Varma]: How do you respond to these incentives and do these incentives exist?

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:06.040
[Amit Varma]: How does someone like you then draw a line and say that, no, I'm not going to do this,

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.160
[Amit Varma]: which would immediately hurt your income?

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.080
[Guest]: How does one negotiate that?

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.960
[Guest]: So I'm honestly fortunate to be in an ecosystem which does not demand any of that to me.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.160
[Guest]: So that makes me very comfortable in terms of what I'm doing.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.080
[Guest]: My hospital is an ethical hospital, there is no pressure.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.720
[Guest]: I can admit somebody, not give them anything and discharge them after five days, and there

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.400
[Guest]: will be no questions asked.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.840
[Guest]: That being said, I have heard very often of these incentives being in place.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.440
[Guest]: But you know what I think, Amit, I don't think any doctor begins with a place that they would

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.640
[Guest]: want to do that.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.520
[Guest]: I think every doctor possibly starts with a place that, listen, I will do what is indicated,

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.080
[Guest]: I will do what's completely ethical.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:51.360
[Guest]: And if as part of doing something ethical, I get some sort of a bonus or some sort of

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.680
[Guest]: kickback, what's so wrong in that?

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.480
[Guest]: I think that's the starting point for people who indulge in that.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.360
[Guest]: The problem is, it starts off like that, but this is a line which is very difficult to

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360
[Guest]: walk on, right?

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.800
[Guest]: I mean, like any other incentive in life, at what point does the incentive drive the

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.880
[Guest]: prescription versus the incentive being incidental to the prescription is where the huge challenge

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880
[Guest]: lies.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.160
[Guest]: And this is true for anyone.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:21.520
[Guest]: So I mean, you know, I've worked with somebody called Dick Menzies at McGill, who would refuse

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.120
[Guest]: to take a pen from a pharmaceutical company.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:29.120
[Guest]: He would say that the moment I have a pen from a pharmaceutical company, I will be obliged

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.960
[Guest]: to do something nice in return to this person.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:35.960
[Guest]: You know, I've received pens from pharmaceutical companies, and I've never thought of it, because

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:41.000
[Guest]: I believe genuinely that, you know, this is just a pen, this is not going to influence

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
[Guest]: my practice.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.120
[Guest]: But to be honest, who knows, at a subconscious level, if that particular pen writes really

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:51.040
[Guest]: well, maybe, or that particular pen is something that I'm very fond of.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.720
[Guest]: Maybe at a subconscious level, I will be more inclined to support that particular company

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.080
[Guest]: which gave me that pen, you know.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.960
[Guest]: So I think these are inherent to the practice.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.280
[Guest]: I think the extreme version of it would be to completely not accept anything.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:09.520
[Guest]: But, you know, I think majority of us get into a zone where we honestly believe that,

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.280
[Guest]: you know, a little bit here and a little bit there in terms of, you know, a gift for Diwali,

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.000
[Guest]: for example, is not going to make so much of a difference.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.800
[Guest]: But that's a very tough, that's a very thin line, you know.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.400
[Guest]: And I think that's a challenge that most doctors face.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.040
[Amit Varma]: Is there a systemic issue here then?

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Is there a systemic issue that, look, if you want to set up a hospital, you want to maximize

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.760
[Amit Varma]: your revenue because it's obviously expensive to do so.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.400
[Amit Varma]: And this is one way of doing that, that you incentivize the doctors and then it just becomes

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.760
[Amit Varma]: a vicious cycle.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.600
[Amit Varma]: And you've pointed out that your hospital, Hinduja Hospital, doesn't do this.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.760
[Amit Varma]: It's a quote-unquote ethical hospital.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.000
[Amit Varma]: So my question then is that, is it possible for new hospitals to come up that are ethical

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.880
[Amit Varma]: hospitals or are they putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage with hospitals

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.200
[Amit Varma]: that are unethical hospitals as it were?

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.320
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure they wouldn't describe themselves that way.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:06.240
[Guest]: I can imagine that if healthcare is treated like the open market, I can imagine how not

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.800
[Guest]: indulging in such practices would hit your bottom line.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.160
[Guest]: I mean, that's straightforward math.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:17.400
[Guest]: So I can imagine the fact that it's relatively difficult to compete and match up to maybe

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:22.280
[Guest]: the incomes of other individuals in other hospitals if you don't play the game by the

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.320
[Guest]: rules that have been established.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.680
[Guest]: So I can see how that could be a problem.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:34.000
[Guest]: And I think that problem arises when you start dealing with healthcare as you would deal

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.120
[Guest]: with anything else in the free market.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:41.560
[Guest]: And that's the reason, that's the whole conversation around medical ethics, the whole conversation

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.560
[Guest]: around why patients need to be protected, etc., comes from this whole asymmetry of knowledge

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.520
[Guest]: between doctors and the persons deriving the services.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:55.040
[Guest]: You cannot treat it in the same way as you would treat any other open market, which is

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.680
[Guest]: why all over the world there are safeguards in place to prevent things from happening.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.800
[Guest]: I think that's the bottom line.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.840
[Guest]: There needs to be something in place to prevent it from being a completely open market.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.080
[Guest]: There has to be some sort of regulation.

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.520
[Guest]: For example, the same pharmaceutical companies, if you take an example, are completely not

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:16.120
[Guest]: allowed to do a lot of the things in stricter countries that they are allowed to do in a

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.600
[Guest]: country like India.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.760
[Guest]: And why has that happened?

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.760
[Guest]: Because of the same reason.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.720
[Guest]: The government has realized at some point of time that if you let it open, if you let

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:28.120
[Guest]: it work or function like a free market, it's going to be demand, supply, it's going to

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.400
[Guest]: be the same kind of incentivized.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.320
[Guest]: It's going to be not necessarily in the consumer's best interest.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.040
[Guest]: It's going to be in the best interest of the players, you know, and that's why it needs

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.880
[Amit Varma]: to be regularized.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.040
[Amit Varma]: I would imagine that, you know, the solution can also come from within the free market.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:46.120
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you had enough supply, if you had enough, if you had ease of entry and

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:50.800
[Amit Varma]: enough hospitals and all that, then some of them would advertise that we are ethical hospitals

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:55.360
[Amit Varma]: in these ways that, you know, no commissions are given to doctors on ordering tests or

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.360
[Amit Varma]: blah, blah, blah.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And then that would also, you know, it would become a competitive advantage instead of

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
[Amit Varma]: something that you do out of pure idealism.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.160
[Amit Varma]: So that is also possible.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.440
[Amit Varma]: But anyway, that's that's a whole different question.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.440
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of get back.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I have a bunch of other general questions I'll also come to before we come to COVID.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.360
[Amit Varma]: But I want to now go back earlier in your personal journey, which we left when we took

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.640
[Amit Varma]: all these digressions that, you know, you're doing medicine and you're doing MBBS and all

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.060
[Amit Varma]: of that.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.840
[Amit Varma]: What does the journey from that look like?

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.360
[Amit Varma]: Like, how do you choose what to specialize in?

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.880
[Amit Varma]: You've specialized in respiratory diseases and so on.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.920
[Amit Varma]: You've also spoken a lot on tuberculosis.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.040
[Amit Varma]: I also want to talk to you about sleep because, you know, I watched a presentation of yours

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.960
[Amit Varma]: on that on YouTube, and it was extremely enlightening in many TIL moments.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.000
[Amit Varma]: But before that, tell me a bit about your journey that how do you get interested in

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.760
[Amit Varma]: these things as opposed to other things?

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.840
[Amit Varma]: And then what prompts that next sort of step where it's not just that you've become a doctor,

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.640
[Amit Varma]: but you're actually going and doing an MSc in McGill University as you did.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.960
[Amit Varma]: Tell me how you're evolving during these years.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:03.360
[Guest]: In terms of the choice of specialization, I think very early on, for most of us, if

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.880
[Guest]: you speak to most doctors very early on somewhere in the at the end of the first or the second

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.400
[Guest]: year, people kind of figure out whether they want to become surgeons or they want to become

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.400
[Guest]: physicians.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.640
[Guest]: So I think that's and it's quite fascinating, actually, you know, in terms of personalities,

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.200
[Guest]: in terms of, you know, what kind of individuals are drawn towards surgery, what kinds of individuals

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:25.400
[Guest]: are drawn towards medicine, I'm sure it'll make an interesting study someday to do personality

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.660
[Guest]: tests and figure out who's drawn to what, even in terms of subjects.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.880
[Guest]: In the first year, we have something called anatomy, physiology and biochemistry.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:36.840
[Guest]: And very often, the guys who love physiology, end up drifting towards being a physician,

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.680
[Guest]: the guys who are hardcore into anatomy, end up drifting towards surgery.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.060
[Guest]: And that kind of plays out further down the course as well.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.680
[Guest]: So I think very early on, physiology is something that fascinated me.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.760
[Guest]: And it still does, you know, just just understanding mechanisms is mind blowing sometimes why something

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.040
[Guest]: occurs.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:57.040
[Guest]: And I think if you really understand physiology, you really understand a lot of medicine, you

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:01.840
[Guest]: don't, you don't need, you know, superlative knowledge in terms of medications and drugs,

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.680
[Guest]: as long as you understand the basics of why what happens.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.920
[Guest]: So I love physiology, I had a distinction in physiology, it was one of my favorite subjects.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.400
[Guest]: And I think that pretty much decided that I was going to be a physician.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.000
[Guest]: I also am a lazy guy.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.280
[Guest]: So standing in one place for like six hours was was not for me.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.800
[Guest]: So that so that got decided early on.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.720
[Guest]: Now at the end of your MBBS, it's the same fight again, right, a whole big pool of really

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:30.520
[Guest]: smart people, all of them trying to get into coveted fields.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:35.440
[Guest]: I think a decent chunk of us end up in fields that we get rather than the fields that we

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.160
[Guest]: initially want.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.400
[Guest]: The good thing about medicine, though, is that if you really like questioning things,

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:46.280
[Guest]: if you really get excited about the body, and you know, small processes here and there,

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.960
[Guest]: really, no matter what you decide to become, and where you end up being, where you end

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.880
[Guest]: up being can be equally fascinating, equally interesting.

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.520
[Guest]: Because if you take a deep dive into any particular field, I think it can be fascinating.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:02.620
[Guest]: So in my last year, I mean, I was, I fully knew that I was going to become a physician.

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:07.840
[Guest]: But I had this gynecology professor who was really, really passionate about teaching.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.680
[Guest]: And I was completely in love with the subject in terms of, you know, I eventually got a

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:18.760
[Guest]: distinction in the subject, I would read, I would, you know, attend labor, you know,

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.880
[Guest]: watch things happen, be really passionate about gynecology fully knowing fully well,

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.380
[Guest]: that this is not what I was going to become.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:31.160
[Guest]: And I think that's the passion that a good teacher, you know, instills in you that teaches

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:36.340
[Guest]: you things about a field that you may not even be interested in pursuing, but you realize

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.600
[Guest]: is fascinating.

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.560
[Guest]: So again, to come back to the question, I initially wanted to do internal medicine,

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:47.520
[Guest]: that was a broader, you know, head to toe, get an idea of physiology, how everything

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:52.000
[Guest]: works in terms of the body systems, and then, you know, possibly super specialize in something

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000
[Guest]: else eventually.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.960
[Guest]: But again, you know, I mean, as usual, I didn't get into the first field of choice, I got

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.660
[Guest]: into respiratory medicine purely by chance.

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:04.400
[Guest]: So I was doing a presentation, I was working at Hinduja, it was a job that I was doing

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:11.320
[Guest]: post MBBS, I was doing a presentation and Dr. Udwadia, who was the chest physician at

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:15.000
[Guest]: Hinduja walked in and listened to the presentation at the end of it, he came up to me and he

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.920
[Guest]: said, you know, that was a great presentation, etc.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.640
[Guest]: And I interviewed for medicine, I didn't make it into medicine.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.440
[Guest]: And then the respiratory interviews were happening.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.920
[Guest]: And I interviewed and, and it just worked out, it just worked out because he remembered

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.540
[Guest]: me from this random presentation, you know, so it was just, it was good fortune.

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:34.120
[Guest]: That being said, you know, I mean, respiratory medicine is very hardcore to physiology, it's

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:40.240
[Guest]: very hardcore to internal medicine, it's very central to other body systems as well.

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.240
[Guest]: So I completely enjoyed my residency.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.480
[Guest]: So my residency was at Hinduja.

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.680
[Guest]: And again, there is a general perception of public institutes being much better than private

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.680
[Guest]: institutes.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:55.720
[Guest]: And, you know, so again, my first choice would have been a public institute had everything

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.920
[Guest]: aligned the way it should have.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.720
[Guest]: But it didn't, I got into a private institute.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.120
[Guest]: But I must say, I mean, the kind of education that I got here for three years was was really

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:08.400
[Guest]: defining in a lot of different ways, you know, we had Dr. Udwadia and Dr. Mahasur, both of

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.240
[Guest]: them senior, both of them very good Dr. Mahasur, who was the head of department of KEM.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.120
[Guest]: So he came from a public institute, he had served most of his life in a public institute.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:21.320
[Guest]: And Dr. Udwadia, who was at the frontier of research, he was somebody who was very passionate

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.320
[Guest]: about research.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:29.260
[Guest]: We did this study in 2010, we basically took 106 different practitioners were practicing

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.400
[Guest]: in a slum of Mumbai.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.840
[Guest]: This was Dharavi.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:35.240
[Guest]: And we asked them to fill up a prescription for a person with a standard weight.

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:39.480
[Guest]: So I think we said the weight was 60 kilos, a person with 60 kilos came and sat in front

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.920
[Guest]: of you and he has tuberculosis, write up a prescription.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.080
[Guest]: That was our that was kind of what we requested them to do.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:49.800
[Guest]: And 106 practitioners, if I remember right, wrote 64 different prescriptions, out of which

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:54.340
[Guest]: six were what we consider to be accurate and right based on the current guidelines then.

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.940
[Guest]: So six of 106 were accurate.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:01.560
[Guest]: So that was an eye opener as well, and that was when we realized it also opened my eyes

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:07.080
[Guest]: in terms of tuberculosis and realizing that about 70% of the population, 70 to 80% of

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:11.160
[Guest]: the population approached the private health care system first when they wanted treatment

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.120
[Guest]: for tuberculosis.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:17.480
[Guest]: And most of our data, most of our information, most of our guidelines, everything was directed

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.800
[Guest]: towards the public health care system.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:25.920
[Guest]: So it was this mismatch where everybody thinks about the private health care system as being

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.360
[Guest]: driven by incentives, not being kosher in a lot of different ways.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.440
[Guest]: And yet, number one, you know, it seemed like patients were preferring us.

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:38.480
[Guest]: And number two, there was this chaos in terms of prescriptions, in terms of the way medicine

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.880
[Guest]: was practiced.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.600
[Guest]: So that was a big eye opener in terms of research, you know, that was that was the first major

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:48.040
[Guest]: publication that I had, and you know, it got me passionate about TB.

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.600
[Guest]: The other side, of course, was Dr. Mahasur, who taught me some really great things in

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.000
[Guest]: terms of how to take care of patients.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.640
[Guest]: So Dr. Mahasur would insist, you know, we would go on rounds and, you know, I would

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:01.560
[Guest]: start saying, 31-year-old patient who's this, this, this, and you would suddenly stop you

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.920
[Guest]: and say, what's the name of the patient?

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.200
[Guest]: And then all of a sudden, you'd realize that you were caught in the back foot, you didn't

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.480
[Guest]: know the name of the patient, because, you know, everything was just details, right?

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.800
[Guest]: You're taught to be detail oriented.

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.920
[Guest]: And he was very insistent that we knew every patient by name, we knew a little more about

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.760
[Guest]: them in terms of their background, we knew what their social circumstances were.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.560
[Guest]: And I think that was fantastic.

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.560
[Guest]: That was an eye opener.

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:30.000
[Guest]: I remember a situation where we had this elderly lady who was admitted forever, you know, one

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
[Guest]: of those patients was not getting discharged, and Dr. Mahasur would come on rounds.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.040
[Guest]: And we would pretty much not do anything.

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.680
[Guest]: So you know, as residents, you want to have as less work as possible, or you want to be

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:40.680
[Guest]: streamlined.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.040
[Guest]: And we would constantly wonder, you know, why is this lady there, we're not doing anything

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.280
[Guest]: for her.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:49.720
[Guest]: And then one fine day, he told us about the story about how she had problems at home and

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:54.360
[Guest]: how she wasn't accepted at home, and how she didn't have a caregiver at home, and the moment

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:58.120
[Guest]: she went home, she would deteriorate, things wouldn't work out for her, because there was

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.160
[Guest]: nobody to take care of her.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.800
[Guest]: And he pretty much knew everything about the family, you know, which we, despite the fact

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:09.760
[Guest]: that we spent every single day with her, hadn't bothered asking her about at all.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.380
[Guest]: So I think this balance was great, you know, the balance of cutting edge, you know, trying

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:19.840
[Guest]: to identify the big questions in research, trying to really work on changing the world

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.360
[Guest]: in some ways, while at the same time being completely grounded to the reality that at

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:28.320
[Guest]: the end of the day, you know, we are caregivers at the end of the day, you can be all evidence

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.000
[Guest]: based medicine if you want, but if you don't provide comfort to patients in some way, you're

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.120
[Guest]: not necessarily a good doctor.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.520
[Guest]: So I think that made a big difference in terms of my training as far as respiratory medicine

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.520
[Amit Varma]: goes.

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:45.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so, you know, in my episode with Karthik on healthcare, we'd kind of discussed a bunch

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.600
[Amit Varma]: of studies.

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.120
[Amit Varma]: And what they all showed is pretty much what you're pointing out about only six doctors

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:53.000
[Amit Varma]: out of hundred and whatever, kind of getting it right.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.880
[Amit Varma]: And that was true in his studies for both public and private, in fact, public fared

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.920
[Amit Varma]: a bit worse.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:03.120
[Amit Varma]: But my question before we move on is, why did the guys who got it wrong, get it wrong?

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.860
[Guest]: That's a difficult question, honestly.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:12.440
[Guest]: So I think part of that is the fact that people just don't bother updating themselves sometimes.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:18.240
[Guest]: So maybe they weren't up to speed in terms of what the data was telling them, what the

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.480
[Guest]: guidelines were telling them.

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.800
[Guest]: Maybe nobody reached them in a way because they were practicing in a place where, you

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.840
[Guest]: know, the dissemination of knowledge wasn't a priority.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.860
[Guest]: It was also a disease like tuberculosis, where drugs don't tend to be very expensive.

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:36.240
[Guest]: So pharmaceutical representatives are not coming after you, telling you what you should

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.900
[Guest]: prescribe and why you should prescribe it because it's not worth their time or effort.

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:45.160
[Guest]: And I think a part of it is maybe a lot of them just had standard prescriptions.

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:50.360
[Guest]: A lot of TB prescriptions are supposed to be tailored to a person's weight.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:55.000
[Guest]: And maybe they've just been used to prescribing a certain thing and just having a standard

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.620
[Guest]: copy paste prescription for everybody that it just made their lives easier with the volumes

00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.260
[Guest]: of people they were dealing with.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.060
[Guest]: Maybe that was one of the reasons why that happened.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:08.680
[Amit Varma]: What also strikes me out of what your wonderful answer a while back was that the study of

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.920
[Amit Varma]: medicine can take you in two opposite directions.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.680
[Amit Varma]: That on the one hand, it can make a person in front of you less human because you're

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.000
[Amit Varma]: just noting down the details.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.280
[Amit Varma]: This is the age, this is the weight, blah, blah, blah.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's something you need to watch out for.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.280
[Amit Varma]: And as you said, you were fortunate to have a doctor who, you know, made you cognizant

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.840
[Amit Varma]: and mindful of these things.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.800
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, it can also make them more human in the sense that we look at ourselves

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.120
[Amit Varma]: and the people all around us as if everybody's immortal.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.260
[Amit Varma]: You know, we don't consider our own mortality.

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.760
[Amit Varma]: And we even take others for granted for that reason.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.600
[Amit Varma]: But I'm guessing that once you start studying medicine, and it becomes explicit to you that

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.320
[Amit Varma]: this is a body and this is how the body functions, and eventually it kind of breaks down.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.420
[Amit Varma]: Does that then change the way that you look at others that that veneer of immortality

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.420
[Amit Varma]: goes down?

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.120
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you might, for example, go to a wedding and your aunt will complain about

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.000
[Amit Varma]: how your uncle is snoring so much.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.960
[Amit Varma]: At an earlier date, that is just an endearing detail.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.720
[Amit Varma]: But suddenly you are now asking your uncle about his throat muscles, his uvula, does

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.360
[Amit Varma]: he sleep on his side or not?

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, any thoughts on these two, like very different aspects?

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.640
[Amit Varma]: You've already commented on the first one where you have to be mindful and treat them

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.080
[Amit Varma]: as actual people.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.560
[Amit Varma]: But the other one, does it does it kind of change the way that you look at others and

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.760
[Amit Varma]: yourself and your own body that there are things that you would otherwise take for granted

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.920
[Amit Varma]: and you see others take for granted, but you don't anymore because you know enough of the

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.560
[Amit Varma]: body to know that this is stuff I need to kind of focus on.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:39.760
[Guest]: So that's the unfortunate part at a certain level, because you look at everything probabilistically,

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760
[Guest]: right?

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.600
[Guest]: You start analyzing everything around you in terms of probabilities.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:49.080
[Guest]: So if you know that your loved one has a particular disease, you're already calculating probabilities

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.240
[Guest]: of hospitalization, probabilities of bad outcomes, probabilities of what might happen.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.000
[Guest]: So you're also a party pooper right at the end of the day, like you rightly pointed out,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.120
[Guest]: you point out things to people who were blissfully unaware of some things and were living a happy

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.200
[Guest]: life and now suddenly you've added to the problems on their plate.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:12.400
[Guest]: And that's a fine balance sometimes because I run a smoking cessation clinic, for example.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.360
[Guest]: Now you know a lot of people who smoke clearly know that it's not good for them.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.720
[Guest]: So you know, catching hold of someone and pointing out the obvious to them is not necessarily

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.600
[Guest]: in their best interest.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.000
[Guest]: But you end up nudging people in the right direction, yes, you know, because you're more

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.040
[Guest]: sensitized to the fact that, you know, what you are seeing cannot be unseen.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:36.200
[Guest]: So if you're seeing an individual who clearly, like you said, has a neck, which is bulky,

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:41.360
[Guest]: fits into a certain profile, you know, you're almost tempted to ask, okay, do you snore?

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:46.320
[Guest]: You go down an inquisitive pathway, but I think that has to be done with a lot of sensitivity

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.320
[Guest]: as well.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.560
[Guest]: You know, that's the other thing about life, right?

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.560
[Guest]: There is what we call the natural history of disease.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.560
[Guest]: So not everybody with a particular condition is necessarily going to deteriorate.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.420
[Guest]: Not everybody is going to follow a particular trajectory.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:06.080
[Guest]: So when you're actually eyeballing somebody and screening them, you're in effect doing

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.720
[Guest]: a screening test.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.920
[Guest]: And your screening tests are solid only if you know the natural history and you know

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.440
[Guest]: that intervening is going to make a difference.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.560
[Guest]: So when I tend to do that, I need to be reasonably certain that I'm giving advice that is going

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.520
[Guest]: to possibly alter the trajectory of an individual's life.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.080
[Guest]: Otherwise, it's a little tricky to get into those situations, right?

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.200
[Amit Varma]: One of the things that you kind of also then have to do is confront the limits of medicine.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.160
[Amit Varma]: Like the instinct, obviously, is I want to help the patient has come.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.080
[Amit Varma]: The patient also wants medicine, the patient expects treatment.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.640
[Amit Varma]: But sometimes you run into these natural limits where there's not much you can do.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.720
[Amit Varma]: The patient behavior has to change.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.000
[Amit Varma]: You have only so much control over that.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.160
[Amit Varma]: Like when I go to my GP, an endearing gentleman named Dr. Kothari in Lokhandwala, who has

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:54.080
[Amit Varma]: I think 400 Ganesha idols in his office, a lovely gentleman, and one thing he will no

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.480
[Amit Varma]: matter what I go to him with, he will tell me that, Amit, stop eating outside food, or

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.840
[Amit Varma]: Amit, you must, you know, get enough sleep, both of which are true.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.720
[Amit Varma]: But there's a limit to how much control you have over somebody's behavior, which is one

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.880
[Amit Varma]: of the limits of medicine.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.560
[Amit Varma]: And the other limit of medicine is that there are areas in which we simply haven't advanced

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560
[Amit Varma]: enough.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:19.360
[Amit Varma]: And with a particular disease that are advanced, you know, probabilistically, I mean, you can't

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.480
[Amit Varma]: be cold and brutal and tell them that these are the probabilities, you know, at best five

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.000
[Amit Varma]: years at worst six months, you know, that becomes difficult.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.400
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes there are diseases where, you know, maybe like GERD, for example, where

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.000
[Amit Varma]: you can't cure the thing, it's just, you know, it is what it is.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.620
[Amit Varma]: So how does one deal with them?

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:39.960
[Amit Varma]: Because a patient expectation always is of the doctor as a kind of a God who's got a

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.480
[Amit Varma]: solution for everything, who better have a solution for everything.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.520
[Guest]: I think empathy plays a very important role in that situation where it's a shared journey,

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:54.040
[Guest]: it's a shared experience, it's not didactic, it's not one way, it's nudging people in the

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.040
[Guest]: right direction.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.000
[Guest]: And as you rightly pointed out, a lot of them have already connected the dots when it comes

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.560
[Guest]: to lifestyle choices and lifestyle changes.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:06.840
[Guest]: I think it's useful to just nudge people in the right direction and offer them help wherever

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.840
[Guest]: possible.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.260
[Guest]: Smoking cessation, for example, you know, there are medications which help, you know,

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.220
[Guest]: and a lot of people aren't aware of these medications.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:18.340
[Guest]: So we tend to, you know, treat them as you would treat any other disease, there's no

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:23.200
[Guest]: judgment involved, there's no, there's no, you know, point wagging a finger at the person

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.840
[Guest]: and saying this is wrong.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.120
[Guest]: You accept the person for who they are, you try to help them to whatever extent.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.600
[Guest]: And then you also, you know, for diseases, as you rightly pointed out, you may not have

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600
[Guest]: a cure.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.760
[Guest]: So you be transparent in that process.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:42.400
[Guest]: I think it's important not to tell, you know, there is a school of medicine, which constantly

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.000
[Guest]: reassures patients.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.640
[Guest]: I very often don't reassure patients in the sense that I say, listen, this is what we

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.200
[Guest]: are going to try.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.840
[Guest]: It may or may not work.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.560
[Guest]: If it doesn't work, you know, we will try something else.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.200
[Guest]: I have very often offered patients to go and seek a second opinion.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.600
[Guest]: I say, listen, you know, maybe you should see another doctor, you know, maybe there

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.040
[Guest]: are people who've dealt with this in a different way and have met with success.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.440
[Guest]: I don't claim to have all the answers.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.880
[Guest]: I think that's the kind of transparency that's really important.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.760
[Guest]: The other end of the spectrum, and you know, which gets me again, really disturbed is end

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.760
[Guest]: of life care.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:23.480
[Guest]: Where very often I think it's the onus is on the doctor to kind of help the patient

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:28.360
[Guest]: and tell them that listen, this is not a situation in which you need to prolong care, you know,

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.280
[Guest]: you feel obliged to prolong care forever.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.240
[Guest]: And that's one thing that really riles me, gets me very disturbed when I see people,

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:41.920
[Guest]: you know, who clearly are not doing well, who clearly are on multiple drugs, multiple

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920
[Guest]: supports.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.200
[Guest]: And you know, the family says just keep going on, keep going on.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.440
[Guest]: I think there's a huge responsibility on the physician to navigate that situation and help

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.720
[Guest]: individuals realize this is not what you would want for yourself.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.940
[Guest]: So please don't subject somebody you love to what you're currently doing.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.080
[Guest]: And this is a common theme.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:03.640
[Guest]: I ask individuals, you know, who have their loved ones on ventilators and multiple supports,

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.960
[Guest]: clearly not doing well, you know, I very often ask them, I said, would you want this for

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:13.200
[Guest]: yourself 30 years from now or so, if you were in this situation?

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.320
[Guest]: And very often the answer is a very absolute emphatic no.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.960
[Guest]: Then I asked them, would your loved one, you know, had you had this conversation with them

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:25.160
[Guest]: 10 years ago and said, listen, 10 years from now, you will be in this situation, you will

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.760
[Guest]: be on multiple supports.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.920
[Guest]: Would you want everything to be done at that point, or would you want us to let you go

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.480
[Guest]: at that point?

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.280
[Guest]: And they will say, you know, I know my dad, he would definitely not want to be in this

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.400
[Guest]: situation.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.080
[Guest]: And yet we perpetuate this, you know, as you rightly said, you know, this is the same analogy

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.040
[Guest]: of a disease that has no cure.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:47.560
[Guest]: There are certain situations where there is no hope, you know, or the hope is such that

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:50.820
[Guest]: the person will never live a meaningful life again.

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:55.560
[Guest]: And I think that's where a physician, the onus is really on us to help individuals make

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.840
[Guest]: the right choice.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:01.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, there's a there's a great book by Atul Gawande called Being Mortal, which is just

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.040
[Amit Varma]: about this.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.800
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me that, you know, one thing that people might not think about so

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.640
[Amit Varma]: much, but I'm sure you have, and I'm sure doctors do, is that the responsibility is

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.880
[Amit Varma]: not just to prolong life, but sometimes also to enhance quality of life.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.760
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes there is a trade off.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And what you, you know, must have faced is the difficult situation where you actually

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.680
[Amit Varma]: have to tell a patient that, listen, stop the treatment.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.680
[Amit Varma]: What is that situation like, and also in all your years of practice, are there moments

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.440
[Amit Varma]: which were difficult for you, that were really hard, that made you wonder that why am I putting

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.440
[Amit Varma]: myself through this?

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.440
[Amit Varma]: Like, I understand the gratification of helping so many people in small, small ways.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.040
[Amit Varma]: But there are also these painful moments where you can't help them anymore.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.560
[Amit Varma]: So how does one kind of deal with that?

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.320
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about it.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.760
[Guest]: So this to me is one of the most painful situations.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.880
[Guest]: And unfortunately, it's getting more and more frequent, having to deal with it, you know,

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.680
[Guest]: where individuals have reached a point where they clearly are not going to recover, where

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:05.560
[Guest]: they are on multiple supports, where life is just being prolonged, but there's no quality

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.320
[Guest]: to that life at all.

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:12.360
[Guest]: And yet modern medicine gives us this whole illusion of keeping a person alive, right?

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.440
[Guest]: The word alive itself is very debatable in this context.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.360
[Guest]: I find this extremely difficult to do.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:24.280
[Guest]: You know, I was reading an article recently, the title of the article was How Doctors Die.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.080
[Guest]: And it was a very interesting article, which talks about how when doctors themselves get

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:34.000
[Guest]: diagnosed with certain conditions, they choose to just go to a house somewhere in the wilderness,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.040
[Guest]: live quietly, spend the last six months, you know, with their family, have quality time

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:43.280
[Guest]: and just pass away quietly, when they themselves have to deal with situations like that.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:48.240
[Guest]: And yet, you know, we offer a lot more to patients than we should.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.000
[Guest]: Now part of that is, of course, you know, that there is litigation that everybody is

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
[Guest]: also afraid of, that how could you not do anything in a situation like this, which is

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.480
[Guest]: why I think it's very important to have advanced directives, you know, legal advanced directives

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.880
[Guest]: in place, if you've thought about it, and if you don't want to be subjected to something

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.360
[Guest]: when you reach a point, but in the absence of an advanced directive, you know, most doctors

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.280
[Guest]: will end up doing everything that the patient's family tells them to do.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.440
[Guest]: And I find this extremely difficult.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.120
[Guest]: So I've dealt with situations where there were individuals who were leading lives where

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.520
[Guest]: they were almost non communicative for five and six years, you know, post after a stroke,

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:30.980
[Guest]: but the loved ones would want to keep on going on, get them admitted frequently.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:36.480
[Guest]: So there's zero communication, there is no evidence of what we would normally perceive

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.000
[Guest]: as being a living human being.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.700
[Guest]: And yet we would keep prolonging the situation just because, you know, the family has resources,

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.320
[Guest]: the family has money, the family is ready to pay, you know, so who are you to question

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.960
[Guest]: this decision.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.520
[Guest]: And one of the solutions offered in this article written by this doctor was that if you're

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.800
[Guest]: uncomfortable with the situation, you need to transfer care to another physician.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.480
[Guest]: I've never I've never thought of doing that.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:04.080
[Guest]: But you know, after reading this article, it really made me wonder whether I should

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.880
[Guest]: start doing that, because it goes against every belief that I believe in, it goes against

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880
[Guest]: my training.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.000
[Guest]: I train to become a doctor, not just to save lives, but to add some meaning to those lives

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.120
[Guest]: to add some quality to those lives.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.840
[Guest]: And as you rightly said, you know, Atul Gawande's book talks about how, I think about 50% of

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:29.840
[Guest]: your of your lifetime cost on medicine or medical care happens in the last one month

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.340
[Guest]: of your life.

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:37.080
[Guest]: So it's that stark, that just because we have the ability to put people on ventilators to

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.920
[Guest]: start infusions and bring their blood pressure up to start dialysis and, you know, get their

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.640
[Guest]: kidneys functioning.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.080
[Guest]: Just because we have this ability, we've started doing things which are which are possibly

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.400
[Guest]: not always in the patient's best interest.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.040
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, within the culture, we might romanticize things like, you know, in

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Dylan Thomas's famous words to rage, rage against the dying of the light.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:03.480
[Amit Varma]: Whereas I would certainly in that situation, just like to have the grace to just go quietly

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:08.080
[Amit Varma]: and save everybody and myself the trouble, which, you know, brings me to euthanasia.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.680
[Amit Varma]: Like, what do you feel about euthanasia?

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:13.440
[Amit Varma]: Like some countries have kind of moved towards legalizing it.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.040
[Amit Varma]: And for those who don't know, euthanasia is where at the end of your life, you choose

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:21.920
[Amit Varma]: to just kind of go when you have a fatal disease or such like and and the two issues that the

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.560
[Amit Varma]: two sort of related questions that come up is that in a country like India, you know,

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.600
[Amit Varma]: where there is so much jogar and the rule of law doesn't really hold, if you were to

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.240
[Amit Varma]: legalize it, you know, it could become a pretext for people to just, you know, murder their

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:39.200
[Amit Varma]: older relatives and, you know, get the paperwork done to show that it's euthanasia.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.960
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, if one agrees that euthanasia is a dignified way to end life and that we

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:50.600
[Amit Varma]: should all have the right to end our lives, then what do we make of suicide in a general

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.720
[Amit Varma]: sense that, you know, even if you're not ill, you know, suicide, of course, is criminalized

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.640
[Amit Varma]: here, therefore becoming the one crime for which you get punished when you fail at it

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.960
[Amit Varma]: and is often correlated with the mental health issues.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.720
[Amit Varma]: And there, of course, you know, it is something to worry about.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:11.320
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, a completely cold, rational person might say that I'm not ill, but I just

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.200
[Amit Varma]: don't want to go on and I have autonomy over my body.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.360
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, are these are these kind of questions that you've thought about?

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.840
[Guest]: So I have, there's actually a very interesting documentary by The Economist, so, you know,

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.560
[Guest]: Economist does these small documentaries about this Belgian girl who was 24 and chose to

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.840
[Guest]: get euthanized.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.760
[Guest]: It's extremely disturbing, of course, to watch it as well.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.520
[Guest]: But, you know, medically, the dilemmas are, of course, whether it's active or it's passive.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:46.120
[Guest]: So active euthanasia is where a doctor plays a role in actually ending a person's life.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:51.280
[Guest]: And that goes against the oath that goes against the Hippocrates oath, where we are not supposed

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.000
[Guest]: to actively help anyone die.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.240
[Guest]: That's that's not what our skill sets are designed to do.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.440
[Guest]: Then there's passive euthanasia, where you set it up for the patient, but the patient

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.640
[Guest]: presses the button, the patient pulls the trigger, the patient figures out or the person

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.600
[Guest]: let's not use the word patient figures out when the time is right and they want to go

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.080
[Guest]: down that road.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:15.520
[Guest]: Now, the problem is that I absolutely agree with the autonomy part of things.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.080
[Guest]: And I think it's fair.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.720
[Guest]: I think it's better to go down that road when it's done as an advance directive and something

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.640
[Guest]: is decided not when the time comes, which may cloud your ability to make a calm, rational

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.600
[Guest]: decision, but it's done in advance.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.840
[Guest]: So I think advance directives are very nice in terms of saying, listen, if I reach a point

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.400
[Guest]: where you have to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation on me, I don't want that being done.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.880
[Guest]: So the no code principle, right?

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.400
[Guest]: People have bracelets which say that I don't want a code.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.280
[Guest]: I think that's relatively straightforward in terms of ethical frameworks.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.640
[Guest]: I think what's more challenging is what you just described, that you're not overtly suffering

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.440
[Guest]: and yet you've decided that enough is enough and you want to go at your prime rather than

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.360
[Guest]: go down a pathway where you suffer.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.840
[Guest]: I have thought of that.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.040
[Guest]: And I don't think there's an easy answer to that, unfortunately, because religion comes

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.320
[Guest]: into play, personal beliefs come into play, the slippery slope, where do you draw the

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.320
[Guest]: line?

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:15.000
[Guest]: Is there a line at which you say it's okay to do it, and what is our role as a society

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.920
[Guest]: in terms of protecting the individual from making a step that is so detrimental to them?

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.120
[Guest]: Do we have some sort of an obligation to protect that individual in terms of counseling, in

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.160
[Guest]: terms of going through a process?

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.600
[Guest]: And to the best of my knowledge, the countries that do allow euthanasia also have certain

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.760
[Guest]: measures in place where you need to go through a certain level of counseling, you need to

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.600
[Guest]: go through psychiatric evaluation, everyone needs to be convinced that it's a rational

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.600
[Guest]: decision.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:44.680
[Guest]: There is a situation which is irretrievable in some way, and only then you're allowed

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.120
[Guest]: to go ahead with the decision.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, many, many fascinating ethical questions in play there.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.520
[Amit Varma]: Before we go in for a break, a question harking back to something that you said earlier, where

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:01.320
[Amit Varma]: you spoke about how you'd like to see more of the humanities being taught in medicine.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.760
[Amit Varma]: And I completely get that because there is a danger that otherwise, you know, you could

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.280
[Amit Varma]: just have a one track thing where you know how medicines interact with the body and that's

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.280
[Amit Varma]: kind of it.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:14.580
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, it's more important to have a more well rounded approach towards humanity.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And also you spoke about, almost wistfully of the path, the road's not taken as it were

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.600
[Amit Varma]: right at the start, where you spoke about one could have been an author or whatever.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Was there stuff like that in your mind at any point that were you interested, like what

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.200
[Amit Varma]: kind of books did you read?

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.920
[Amit Varma]: What were you outside the context of medicine and the study of medicine?

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920
[Amit Varma]: What were you reading?

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.320
[Amit Varma]: Did you want to be a writer?

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, when you read people like, say, Atul Gawande, or Abraham Verghese, or Eric

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Topol, or whatever, do you think that, hey, okay, I should also be, you know, going down

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.040
[Amit Varma]: that road?

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.640
[Guest]: Tell me a bit about that.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.440
[Guest]: So it's definitely on the bucket list.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:53.840
[Guest]: And I do hope I will, I will write something someday of, of relevance and interest to to

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.520
[Guest]: some readers, at least.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.600
[Guest]: I think a lot of my passion or my hunger for writing comes out in scientific literature

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.600
[Guest]: and publications.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.840
[Guest]: And so that's, that's kind of an outlet in a way, the reason I could be a little prolific

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.000
[Guest]: was because I really enjoyed writing.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.240
[Guest]: For me to construct something out of nothing is very fascinating.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:16.120
[Guest]: But this this concept of, of humanities also comes from how fascinating science is, right?

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.600
[Guest]: So when I did my epidemiology, I realized that a lot of epidemiological principles actually

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.400
[Guest]: came from economics, and a lot of them came from philosophy.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.840
[Guest]: If you look at, you know, we use something called p-value, right?

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.600
[Guest]: So a p-value basically is a measure of statistical significance, right?

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.400
[Guest]: So and when it's below a certain level, like 0.05 is a cutoff, we say that this, this is

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.800
[Guest]: something that's rare, this is something that's, that that cannot happen by chance.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.080
[Guest]: So there is definitely a genuine association.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.560
[Guest]: So when you look at is drug A better than drug B, if the p-value is less than 0.05,

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.120
[Guest]: you say yes, it's better.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.680
[Guest]: And it's beyond reasonable doubt or beyond beyond chance.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:58.440
[Guest]: Now, if you go back, the real argument comes from, from something Latin, which is reductio

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.160
[Guest]: ab absurdum.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.360
[Guest]: You basically reduce the argument to a level that it's absurd that the alternative is true.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.160
[Guest]: And then you prove the truth accordingly.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.760
[Guest]: So that basically is coming from philosophy.

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.880
[Guest]: And I think if we were trained in some sort of philosophy, in some sort of critical thinking,

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.760
[Guest]: I think all of us would become much better doctors, because it wouldn't be that this

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.360
[Guest]: is written in stone, we would learn to question things.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.400
[Guest]: We would learn context in a, in a lot of different ways.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.200
[Guest]: And this whole realization that, and when I say humanities, I don't necessarily mean

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.200
[Guest]: the appreciation of art, I mean, things which actually eventually led to medicine in so

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.640
[Guest]: many different ways.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.880
[Guest]: Abraham Verghese, to answer your second question, I think Abraham Verghese, My Own Country was

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:43.760
[Guest]: one of my favorite books of all time, probably, because again, you know, it was the empathy

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:49.680
[Guest]: that someone working at the start of the HIV pandemic in a small little town, the whole

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.200
[Guest]: people coming out of the closet at that point of time, I think it was fascinating in terms

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.760
[Guest]: of contextualizing medicine and not making it just cold, hard facts.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.520
[Guest]: Complications, again, by Gawande was a great, great book.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.080
[Guest]: His first book, you know, he's written some after that, which weren't as impressive, let's

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.080
[Guest]: put it that way.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.200
[Guest]: But I thought Complications was, was fascinating.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.240
[Guest]: I pretty much read anything.

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.000
[Guest]: I don't think I'm very selective about what I read.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
[Guest]: I think The Looming Tower was the last book that I can think of recently that I really

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
[Guest]: liked.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.920
[Guest]: And then there's this book called Do No Harm by a guy called Henry Marsh, who's a neurosurgeon

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.160
[Guest]: in the UK.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.440
[Guest]: And I thought it was a fantastic book.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:31.400
[Guest]: It's a book I read a couple of years ago, where he's so brutally honest about the mistakes

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.440
[Guest]: that he's made.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:37.520
[Guest]: And he's so, and he can probably do it because he's relatively senior now, and you know,

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.040
[Guest]: some of the stuff that he talks about would have potentially lawsuit material.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:47.040
[Guest]: But he's being so brutally honest about the uncertainties associated with medicine.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.040
[Guest]: And I find that fascinating.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.640
[Guest]: You know, I think, I think doctors need to be a lot more humble than they are.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.040
[Guest]: Because there is so much uncertainty there is on a daily basis.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:00.520
[Guest]: You know, I see patients in my clinic, I send them off home, there is a small proportion

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.800
[Guest]: of those patients who anything can happen the moment they leave out of my office, right.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.320
[Guest]: And you know, that that uncertainty, I think quantifying that uncertainty and trying to

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:14.600
[Guest]: become a better doctor, knowing that uncertainty is out there, is is what fascinates me.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:20.720
[Guest]: And I think, you know, it's a blend of philosophical, logical reasoning, it's a blend of accepting

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:25.560
[Guest]: that uncertainty, it's a blend of this whole principle of do no harm, right.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.480
[Guest]: So the burden of proof is always on us to prove that things work.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.400
[Guest]: It's never on, you know, let's try something.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.560
[Guest]: If it doesn't work, then let's chuck it, because it's human lives that you're dealing with.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.640
[Guest]: And I think that structure of logic and argument also comes from the humanities, which I find

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.640
[Guest]: very fascinating.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:46.760
[Amit Varma]: So I had a recent episode with another person who's been a voice of reason in these COVID

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.520
[Amit Varma]: months, which is Gautam Menon.

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:53.600
[Amit Varma]: And Gautam also spoke about bringing different lenses to bear, like, he brings a lens of

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.200
[Amit Varma]: physics into biology and biology into physics.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.160
[Amit Varma]: And he's also got statistical training and all these lenses help.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:04.160
[Amit Varma]: So do you find yourself applying the lenses and the frames that you've got from your study

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.480
[Amit Varma]: of medicine into the world at large?

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And vice versa?

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.360
[Amit Varma]: Like do you apply other frames?

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.760
[Amit Varma]: Like one book that a lot of my guests seem to have liked and recommended on the show

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.680
[Amit Varma]: is a book called The Rules of Contagion by Adam Kuczarski.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.280
[Amit Varma]: And there, of course, you realize that contagion is not just in the biological sense of how

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:24.960
[Amit Varma]: a disease spreads, but similar rules and similar trends can apply to even, you know, contagion

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.360
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to information, for example.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.800
[Amit Varma]: So do you find yourself doing this kind of interdisciplinary sort of applying of frames

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.360
[Amit Varma]: of from one thing to another?

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:38.360
[Amit Varma]: And then how much do you feel that that enriches your understanding?

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360
[Amit Varma]: No, absolutely.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:46.280
[Guest]: I mean, I can be pretty annoying to a lot of people sometimes because of this inherent

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.680
[Guest]: cynicism that comes from epidemiology, right?

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:52.440
[Guest]: So everything is in the realm of probability.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.040
[Guest]: So there's no certainty at all.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.040
[Guest]: Everything is like, what is the counterfactual?

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.840
[Guest]: You know, what if this didn't happen and something else had happened is what you're trying to

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:00.840
[Guest]: prove.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.080
[Guest]: And since you never have a counterfactual, you try to come as close to that counterfactual

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.040
[Guest]: as you can.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.080
[Guest]: And that spills over to everything in life.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.960
[Guest]: So every time somebody is talking about, you know, say arranged marriage is better than

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.480
[Guest]: love marriage, for example, and you're saying, you know, what the selection biases are, individuals

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.560
[Guest]: who get into an arranged marriage is different from individuals who get into a love marriage.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.280
[Guest]: What are the confounding variables?

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:27.120
[Guest]: You know, are they more wealthy and therefore have a safety net to go back to if they, you

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.600
[Guest]: know, if it fails versus in one versus the other, and you're constantly dissecting it

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.880
[Guest]: out in every aspect of your life.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:41.880
[Guest]: And I think that's the fun of the generalizability of the same principles across everything around

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.880
[Guest]: you.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.360
[Guest]: There's this fascinating story, which I love telling, and you know, I'm going to use this

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.280
[Guest]: opportunity to speak about it.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:52.880
[Guest]: There was this guy called Abraham Wald, and this was the Second World War.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.880
[Guest]: This was 1943.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:23:00.440
[Guest]: Abraham Wald was a biostatistician, was a statistician, and he was assigned to try and

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:06.720
[Guest]: figure out why so many planes were getting shot down and, you know, how could those planes

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:07.720
[Guest]: be reinforced?

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.800
[Guest]: How could they make those weak spots stronger?

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.000
[Guest]: He was given this data set where they had this whole bunch of planes and all the bullet

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.280
[Guest]: holes on the planes were mapped on it.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:21.240
[Guest]: And he looked at all of them and, you know, it was clearly that the wings, the fuselage

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.680
[Guest]: and the tails, you know, these were the three areas that were hit the most.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.440
[Guest]: And you know, as one would normally expect, the person would say, you know, reinforce

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.480
[Guest]: the wings, the tails and the fuselage, because they hit the most.

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.920
[Guest]: And what he said was just the opposite.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:40.400
[Guest]: He said, everything other than the wings, the fuselage and the tails needs to be reinforced,

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.480
[Guest]: because these are the planes that came back to the base.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.320
[Guest]: The ones that were lost out were obviously hit in the other areas, you know.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.720
[Guest]: So that was his survivor bias.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.320
[Guest]: The ones that survived and came back, clearly did okay, despite all the bullet holes in

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320
[Guest]: all these areas.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.600
[Guest]: The ones that didn't were hit in the other areas.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:00.520
[Guest]: I think that's fascinating stuff and, you know, these principles apply to everything

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.520
[Guest]: in life.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:04.680
[Guest]: If you just look at the data set, and you don't have the broader picture as to why that

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.560
[Guest]: data is in front of you, and what's the context in which it is, you will end up making a lot

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:12.080
[Guest]: of biased and flawed decisions.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's actually one of my favorite stories as well.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.720
[Amit Varma]: And Wald, in fact, served on a committee at one point in time with Milton Friedman and

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.860
[Amit Varma]: a few other eminent people whose names I forget.

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:27.360
[Amit Varma]: But I think Friedman once commented something to the effect of how it felt to be in a room

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.320
[Amit Varma]: where everyone was smarter than you, which for someone like Friedman to say is pretty

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.320
[Amit Varma]: remarkable.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:37.880
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I think I get that feeling from the seen and the unseen as well, that

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.240
[Amit Varma]: every week, I'm basically the second smartest person in the conversation, if there is only

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:43.240
[Amit Varma]: one guest.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.640
[Amit Varma]: But we'll now take a quick commercial break.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:49.160
[Amit Varma]: And on the other side of the commercial break, we'll continue talking about the practice

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.160
[Amit Varma]: of medicine.

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:54.080
[Amit Varma]: We'll look at some of your pet areas like smoking cessation and sleep, both of which

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.240
[Amit Varma]: I want to talk a little bit more about.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.760
[Amit Varma]: And then finally, we'll talk about COVID-19 as well, you know, where you have always kind

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.880
[Amit Varma]: of been a little bit ahead of the curve and showing the way to others.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:08.360
[Amit Varma]: So all that after a quick break.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut,

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.960
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.920
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:33.160
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.440
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons.

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.200
[Amit Varma]: And now it is time to revive it.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.960
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:47.040
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.600
[Amit Varma]: regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.200
[Amit Varma]: I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:58.800
[Amit Varma]: So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com and subscribe.

[Amit Varma]: The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.440
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:20.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Dr. Lancelot Pinto about the practice of medicine and especially in

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.040
[Amit Varma]: the narrowed down context of COVID-19 in the last few months.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.960
[Amit Varma]: But as we continue this fascinating discussion, Lance, I'm reminded of something you said

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.780
[Amit Varma]: just before the break, which brings me to my next question.

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:35.280
[Amit Varma]: But before that, you know, a quick anecdote about the President Harry Truman, who once

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.160
[Amit Varma]: when he was president said, give me a one handed economist.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.440
[Amit Varma]: And he did not mean this in a literal way.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.360
[Amit Varma]: But what he meant was his advisors would keep saying to him, on the one hand this on the

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.720
[Amit Varma]: other hand that and he just wanted, you know, he wanted to make decisions he wanted things

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.720
[Amit Varma]: straight up.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:55.720
[Amit Varma]: Now you mentioned probabilistic thinking a few times in this episode so far, which is

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.720
[Amit Varma]: music to my ears.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:59.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I was a professional poker player for a few years.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.160
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of taught me to look at everything in the world around us in a probabilistic

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160
[Amit Varma]: manner.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:10.440
[Amit Varma]: But most people don't most people crave certainties and of course, we always ascribe certainty

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.680
[Amit Varma]: to the past, like after something has happened, it has 100% happened or 0% happened and it's

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.700
[Amit Varma]: easy to kind of look at it like that.

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.720
[Amit Varma]: But even for the future, they want a similar kind of certainty.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:26.300
[Amit Varma]: So as a medical practitioner, how is it for you where you want to explain something in

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:30.600
[Amit Varma]: probabilistic terms, but you know that the other person in a manner of speaking wants

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.280
[Amit Varma]: a one handed doctor?

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.200
[Guest]: How do you deal with that?

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:39.920
[Guest]: This is a challenge I pretty much face on a daily basis, because, you know, at the end

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.760
[Guest]: of every conversation, the patient often will say but sab kuch theek hoga na or you know,

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.040
[Guest]: some broad, definite statement is made at the end.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.800
[Guest]: And they want me to say yes, and I find it extremely difficult to do that.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.480
[Guest]: But kuch bura toh nahi hoga but nothing bad will happen.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.600
[Guest]: But you know, in two months, we will get better, right?

01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:02.120
[Guest]: You know, so it's these definite absolutes that people constantly seek.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:07.360
[Guest]: And it makes the whole conversation a lot quicker if I wasn't a probabilistic thinker,

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.400
[Guest]: you know, unfortunately, I am.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:15.560
[Guest]: So it makes my consults longer as a consequence, but I'm trying to explain that I do hope that

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:16.880
[Guest]: things get better for you.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.360
[Guest]: And I do want things to get better for you.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.800
[Guest]: But I can't guarantee that that's going to happen, you know, and that's that's true for

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.900
[Guest]: a significant chunk of diseases, especially at a specialist level, you know.

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:31.640
[Guest]: So if you're if you're dealing in the community, and somebody comes to you with the sniffles,

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.240
[Guest]: for example, you can say with reasonable degree of certainty that out of 100 people I treat

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.240
[Guest]: like this 99 are going to get better.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.360
[Guest]: So you know, I can I can afford to tell all 100 that things are going to get better and

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.680
[Guest]: be wrong once and you know, have that guy say, but, you know, listen, you said that

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:48.160
[Guest]: I would get better and you know, have that conversation again, the more specialized you

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:51.760
[Guest]: get in terms of, you know, people being referred to you after somebody has had a look at them

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.600
[Guest]: already, after someone has tried something already, it's not work, then they come to

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:57.600
[Guest]: you.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.360
[Guest]: It's not because the person who's tried something very often has done something wrong.

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.120
[Guest]: It's just that the nature of the illness is such that there's a lot of uncertainty around

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.920
[Guest]: certain diseases and certain conditions.

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:12.200
[Guest]: And I think being a communicator in such a situation is difficult, it's, it's challenging.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:17.920
[Guest]: But I think at the same time, it's, it's a challenge that we need to take on in a positive

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.720
[Guest]: kind of way and in an empowering kind of way not.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:26.520
[Guest]: So you empower the patient to know about what they are going through rather than look down

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.340
[Guest]: on the patient and try and say things like so I've heard this phrase.

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.340
[Guest]: So many times, right?

01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:35.840
[Guest]: You're, you're a Google patient, you know, like you go and Google it, you know, and my

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.680
[Guest]: doctor told me, yeah, this is what you must have got from Google.

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.280
[Guest]: There are these memes floating around or these jokes floating around on WhatsApp saying Google

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:45.640
[Guest]: patients not wanted or something like that, right?

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.040
[Guest]: I see nothing wrong in that.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.920
[Guest]: I see nothing wrong in a person Googling.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.960
[Guest]: I mean, it's his or her body, you know, you're going to a doctor, the doctor is going to

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:58.160
[Guest]: violate that sanctity of space and, you know, give you something to put into your own body.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:01.880
[Guest]: Why should you not be empowered and educated about what's, what's happening there, you

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:02.880
[Guest]: know?

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.400
[Guest]: So what's so wrong if I do my Google search?

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.440
[Guest]: In fact, why don't you, I mean, as a doctor, why don't you suggest a better way to Google

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:09.440
[Guest]: search?

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.400
[Guest]: You train the patient, say, listen, don't go to Google, fine.

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:14.000
[Guest]: Google may have taught you this, don't look down on your patient and say, oh yeah, this

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
[Guest]: is rubbish.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.480
[Guest]: Instead say, why don't you go to this legitimate site, which has legitimate information and

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.680
[Guest]: you come to the same conclusion.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:26.120
[Guest]: So to answer your question, and very often, I think people have done studies on this also

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:30.280
[Guest]: where they look at, you know, what the doctor says and what the patient takes away are two

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.440
[Guest]: different things sometimes.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.760
[Guest]: So no matter how much you try to explain probabilities, the patient often goes away saying, speaking

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.720
[Guest]: in absolutes, the doctor said things will get better or the doctor says things will

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.880
[Guest]: get, things are not going to get better.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.200
[Guest]: And sometimes, you know, if they go away with the feeling that the doctor said that there's

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.320
[Guest]: no hope, you know, if that's their interpretation of things, that's the first cue for them to

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.520
[Guest]: jump and go to another doc.

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.960
[Guest]: If they find a doctor who deals with absolutes, they're then happy, you know?

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:56.320
[Guest]: It is a big challenge.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.800
[Guest]: And there's no easy solution to this, because if I have to stay honest, I have to speak

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.480
[Guest]: in terms of probabilities.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.520
[Guest]: If I go black or white, then I'm not being honest to myself.

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.680
[Guest]: So you know, I mean, this is just who I am.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:10.440
[Guest]: And hopefully, a significant proportion of patients do understand that it's coming from

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.920
[Guest]: the right and good place.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.720
[Amit Varma]: For my listeners who must now all be intrigued and saying that, oh, you know, tell us how

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:17.720
[Amit Varma]: to Google.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:22.400
[Amit Varma]: So why don't you give us a quick one minute or two minute clinic on how to get information,

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.480
[Amit Varma]: how to be a Google patient, so to say, like, where should they go?

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.480
[Amit Varma]: Where should they begin?

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.720
[Amit Varma]: And what should they watch out for?

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:32.240
[Guest]: So most websites are just like up to date is something that I alluded to earlier up

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.480
[Guest]: to date has a patient version as well.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:38.480
[Guest]: So for every article that's there about a particular disease, there's a patient information

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.080
[Guest]: sheet which is also available, which is coming from a legitimate source.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:48.240
[Guest]: The second thing a lot of journals nowadays do so journals have started having their social

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.000
[Guest]: media sites as well, which are quite active and a lot of that is targeted towards the

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.800
[Guest]: end user or the patient.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:57.920
[Guest]: So there will be a professional summary and there will be a patient summary very often.

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.840
[Guest]: The Cochrane collaboration, right?

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:03.560
[Guest]: So basically, what happens in medicine is once you have a whole bunch of studies which

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.760
[Guest]: are out there on a particular subject, what people do is they synthesize this information

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.680
[Guest]: and do what we call systematic reviews.

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.480
[Guest]: So systematic reviews are currently considered the highest level of evidence because it's

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.820
[Guest]: a summary of everything that's out there.

01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.920
[Guest]: And the Cochrane collaboration is one of the collaborations that consistently does systematic

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:22.080
[Guest]: reviews on important subjects.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:25.880
[Guest]: And again, on their summary page at the bottom, there is a patient summary.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:29.440
[Guest]: So if you go to the Cochrane collaboration website on a particular topic that you are

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.840
[Guest]: interested in, you will get a patient layperson summary, which is not technical, which will

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.840
[Guest]: help you.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:38.560
[Guest]: You can also ask your doctor, you know, because again, most of us are part of professional

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.560
[Guest]: associations.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:43.560
[Guest]: So when it comes to respiratory, there's the American Thoracic Society, there is the American

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.800
[Guest]: College of Chest Physicians, there's the British Thoracic Society.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.960
[Guest]: All of these societies have layperson versions of most articles that are published there.

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:56.120
[Guest]: So I think going through legitimate societies and then trying to figure out what the layperson

01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:01.040
[Guest]: version is, is far better than looking at an opinion or an op-ed that someone has just

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.400
[Guest]: posted out there, which may be biased.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.400
[Amit Varma]: Great point, sir.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.440
[Amit Varma]: Let's now talk about some of your pet themes.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:12.960
[Amit Varma]: But before we do that, a quick word on your MSc, which you did in McGill University, Epidemiology.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.440
[Amit Varma]: What kind of made you go for that?

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:17.800
[Amit Varma]: Because the subject, of course, is fascinating, like you said, you know, insights from many

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:22.560
[Amit Varma]: different fields come to bear upon that, economics, statistics, philosophy, as you pointed out

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.560
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:24.720
[Amit Varma]: What made you go for that?

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:29.280
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, what drove you towards some of your, like, what are your current,

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, apart from COVID-19, what are your current sort of areas into which you've gone

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:36.800
[Amit Varma]: into rabbit holes and become a specialist, so to say, and why?

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.720
[Guest]: So McGill again, you know, happened by chance, because of the TB study, because of the TB

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:46.400
[Guest]: work that we've done out here, Madhukar Pai, who's a professor at McGill, and is one of

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.720
[Guest]: the top TB guys in the world in TB diagnostics.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.120
[Guest]: He offered me this opportunity to do a Master's in Epidemiology.

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:55.760
[Guest]: I got mixed feedback from people around me.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.760
[Guest]: A lot of people told me that it was a big mistake, because I was stepping out of clinical

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.320
[Guest]: medicine for two years.

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:05.600
[Guest]: I was very jittery about it, because, you know, a doctor going away and, you know, going

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:10.240
[Guest]: back to school in a way, staying away from patients for two years, will I be employable

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:14.080
[Guest]: when I come back, if I decide to come back after two years, was a big challenge.

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.840
[Guest]: I think a lot of, big deal of the credit goes to Dr. Udbadia, who at that point of time

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:22.200
[Guest]: told me that if he were in my shoes and had an opportunity at that point of time, he would

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.360
[Guest]: accept it in the blink of an eye.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.160
[Guest]: And in that sense, it was a leap of faith.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:31.080
[Guest]: And again, the epidemiology almost didn't happen, because there were certain math requirements

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:35.160
[Guest]: to get into an MSc Epidemiology, which I didn't have on my transcript, and it took a lot of

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:43.000
[Guest]: pleading and kind of reassurances on the part of Madhupai and other people, which then made

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.160
[Guest]: them kind of waive off that requirement.

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:48.200
[Guest]: So that's how McGill happened.

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.600
[Guest]: And I had no concept of how important McGill was as a school.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.440
[Guest]: I think I realized it once I went out there.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:00.040
[Guest]: So one of the introductions that happen when you go to McGill is that they sell t-shirts

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:05.520
[Guest]: outside during orientation, which says Harvard, and below that it says America's McGill.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.080
[Guest]: So that's the joke they have there.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.600
[Guest]: But it's a great university in terms of respiratory medicine, a lot of good stuff has come out

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.600
[Guest]: from McGill.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.480
[Guest]: It was where William Osler was, so it's a mecca in some ways.

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.400
[Guest]: It's where the brain was mapped by Dr. Penfield.

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.840
[Guest]: And the Department of Epidemiology was again, it was a real solid department.

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.560
[Guest]: So I was coming out of a residency, right?

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.600
[Guest]: So three years of a residency, you hardly slept, you worked like really hard.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.600
[Guest]: So I thought this is going to be a piece of cake, you know, what is a master's, you know,

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.600
[Guest]: I mean, it's like, it's going to be child's play.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.600
[Guest]: And it was grueling.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.400
[Guest]: It was grueling two years where, you know, I didn't sleep much because it was assignment

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:44.020
[Guest]: after assignment.

01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:48.280
[Guest]: It was stuff that I had no idea about, you know, you were going back to probability and

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:53.040
[Guest]: maths and Bayesian stuff, learning statistical software.

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:56.800
[Guest]: It was extremely challenging and you know, half of your class is really young and half

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:02.240
[Guest]: of the class, I was about 35 and we had a bunch of people who were like 24 who had just

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:05.280
[Guest]: come out of their bachelors and were directly doing it.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.840
[Guest]: And you know, half of her class is your age.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.840
[Guest]: So, you know, and then you have to do group assignments, which people have with people

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.560
[Guest]: 10 years younger than you.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.080
[Guest]: And those 10 years do matter, right, when you're talking about 24 versus 35.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.440
[Guest]: So it was a fascinating experience.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.600
[Guest]: And again, you know, we had some great professors.

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.160
[Guest]: We had Madhu himself was a great mentor.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.800
[Guest]: He's somebody who's a machine in terms of working, you know, you send them an email

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.640
[Guest]: at any time of the day, somehow he manages to reply and I still see that happening.

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.160
[Guest]: There was great TB work happening.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.480
[Guest]: It was a bunch of people who worked in collaboration.

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:37.500
[Guest]: I mean, I truly appreciated the power of collaborative work as well.

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.120
[Guest]: So people were not necessarily competing with each other.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:43.920
[Guest]: People were all complimenting each other and supporting people to grow.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.000
[Guest]: In terms of rabbit holes, I got very passionate about medical ethics.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.060
[Guest]: I attended a class by a guy called Jonathan Kimmelman, who was brilliant in terms of ethics.

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:58.320
[Guest]: My understanding of ethics completely took a 180 degree, you know, you know, all of us

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.080
[Guest]: think of ethics as being some sort of a field, which is, you know, does it feel right?

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.080
[Guest]: Does it feel wrong?

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.440
[Guest]: You know, what does it feel?

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:07.480
[Guest]: Does it conflict with your morals and that kind of stuff?

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.080
[Guest]: And then I realized that the thing that he kept saying over and over again in the class

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.440
[Guest]: is that this is a science.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.600
[Guest]: This is not based on a gut feel.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:18.480
[Guest]: There is a framework in which it works and, you know, something that may be wrong in one

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.080
[Guest]: framework could be right in another framework.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.040
[Guest]: And I think that's pretty much similar to how economics works as well, right, in terms

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.440
[Guest]: of, you know, it's the framework that matters and decides what's acceptable and what's not

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:29.880
[Guest]: acceptable.

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:34.240
[Guest]: Even in terms of epidemiology, you know, this whole, we used to have this whole critiquing

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.840
[Guest]: of papers, you know, which went on for hours sometimes, everybody pointing out how things

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:42.520
[Guest]: could be done in a better way, how things could be done differently.

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.840
[Guest]: And I think that made a huge difference in terms of how I looked at everything after

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:47.840
[Guest]: that.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.560
[Guest]: So it adds a lot of uncertainty, unfortunately, to your life.

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:54.680
[Guest]: So I went there certain and it came back uncertain in a lot of ways.

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:59.120
[Guest]: So in terms of the practice of medicine, you know, from knowing all the answers, it came

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:05.640
[Guest]: to almost knowing nothing anymore, which in some ways is great, but in some ways makes

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:06.640
[Guest]: you a little cynical.

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.680
[Guest]: You know, every time there's a new study, I'm like, we'll see, you know, that's my usual

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.600
[Guest]: answer versus saying, oh, wow, there's this wonder drug, you know, this is going to change

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600
[Guest]: everything.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.960
[Guest]: So my levels of cynicism have increased significantly, but I genuinely believe that that was a great

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:19.960
[Guest]: experience.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:20.960
[Amit Varma]: That is so fascinating.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, can you give me a concrete example of where this would apply in your everyday

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.880
[Amit Varma]: practice that levels of certainty having gone down and which is, of course, the way knowledge

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.200
[Amit Varma]: works, the more you know, the more you realize there is more to know.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.560
[Amit Varma]: But in your case, in practical terms, how did it change?

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:39.760
[Amit Varma]: Like, obviously, you would have looked at medicine in a more probabilistic way.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.360
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that, how did it sort of change your practice as it were?

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.800
[Guest]: So let's again, I'll give you a cynical example.

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:50.760
[Guest]: So when Remdesivir got announced, I don't know if you remember that moment.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:54.520
[Guest]: It was Fauci at the White House next to Trump.

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.360
[Guest]: And he says, you know, this is a pivotal moment in the history of COVID.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:02.920
[Guest]: And it reminds me of HIV and it reminds me of how we changed everything.

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:07.600
[Guest]: And my first reaction was, this is the head of NIAID, right?

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.120
[Guest]: I think that's what it's called, the National Institute of Allergy and Diseases.

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.720
[Guest]: He was the guy who conducted the study.

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.680
[Guest]: And he was announcing it at the White House rather than announcing it in a publication.

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:20.160
[Guest]: So I was like, there's a lot of conflict of interest out there.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:23.360
[Guest]: You know, you need to let the science come out, let the paper come out.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.840
[Guest]: We'll have a look at what it says.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.720
[Guest]: We'll have a look at whether it's a game changer or not.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:33.920
[Guest]: So this inherent blind faith in individuals, institutions, I think that's been shaken a

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.840
[Guest]: lot and in a healthy way.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.240
[Guest]: You know, I mean, I don't have anything against Fauci, obviously, and, you know, we all respect

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.200
[Guest]: him and he's been a great voice of reason throughout all of this.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:47.040
[Guest]: But you know, I've learned to question everything in terms of, you know, the God being in the

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.040
[Guest]: details in a way.

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and remdesivir was also, it almost seems like a drug of hope in the sense it was used

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:57.520
[Amit Varma]: during Ebola also, if I remember correctly, and they said it's going to be the wonder

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.840
[Amit Varma]: drug and it really didn't do anything there.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, speaking of Fauci, just a quick aside, some friends and I had a session recently

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.800
[Amit Varma]: on conspiracy theories.

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:09.480
[Amit Varma]: And Fauci, of course, is at the center of many conspiracy theories and many people claiming

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.080
[Amit Varma]: he created the COVID virus and all that.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.280
[Amit Varma]: These guys are bizarre.

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.280
[Amit Varma]: So we had like this fantasy situation where Fauci, Sushant Singh Rajput and Subhash Chandra

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.080
[Amit Varma]: Bose went in a UFO to blow up the World Trade Center.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:26.640
[Amit Varma]: So you know, you're bringing many conspiracy theories together.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.320
[Amit Varma]: But before moving on, you know, everything you say is so fascinating that all these sidelights

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.320
[Amit Varma]: I want to explore.

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.280
[Amit Varma]: I also want to talk a little bit about that ethics part where you said you looked at it

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.280
[Amit Varma]: completely differently in the sense that it now gave you a much more clearly defined framework

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.600
[Amit Varma]: to think about medical ethics and it wasn't just about intuition and whether something

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.320
[Amit Varma]: feels icky or not.

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.800
[Amit Varma]: But can you tell me a little bit more about that framework which you use to think through

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.680
[Amit Varma]: issues of medical ethics now?

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:59.120
[Guest]: It's like this whole free market versus, you know, what is governed by the government or

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.520
[Guest]: you know, government controlled healthcare, for example, this whole debate about what

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.680
[Guest]: is right and what is wrong, you know, so the private sector becomes a very easy target

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.400
[Guest]: to bash up, you know, saying that private sector is after money, private sector is after

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400
[Guest]: incentives.

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:16.480
[Guest]: This is a framework that has been allowed by whoever decides what the framework is.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:23.080
[Guest]: Once the framework is in place, I feel it is wrong to criticize a for-profit entity

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.880
[Guest]: for doing what they try to do to make a profit, right?

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:30.520
[Guest]: So it's you've defined that this is the framework, you've defined that you should allow this

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:35.680
[Guest]: framework to work, and then deciding what is right and wrong becomes a very blurry line

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.360
[Guest]: once you've created that sort of a framework.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:42.840
[Guest]: This whole concept of, you know, if you look at what is the worth of a life or what is

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.680
[Guest]: the value of a life, right?

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.960
[Guest]: It sounds horrible to say that, you know, from a sentimental perspective, right?

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.320
[Guest]: But if you look at it in terms of how much are you ready to spend to save that one life,

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:56.640
[Guest]: that's how economics works in terms of healthcare.

01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:01.400
[Guest]: Everything works in terms of metrics where they look at, you know, the cost versus the

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.640
[Guest]: benefit for every particular thing.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.040
[Guest]: And that, again, is defined in some sort of a framework.

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.400
[Guest]: We have accepted, like I think the UK at some point of time said that one daily or one disability

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:15.280
[Guest]: adjusted life year was equal to 20,000 pounds or something like that.

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.720
[Guest]: So somebody came up with that framework and said that this is what we are ready to spend

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:26.120
[Guest]: on an individual in the country paid by taxpayer money to save one year of productive life,

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.120
[Guest]: right?

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:31.360
[Guest]: So earlier, all of these things would have been nauseating in some ways, would have been

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:34.320
[Guest]: like, how can you ever look at health this way?

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.280
[Guest]: But that's the practicalities of the universe.

01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.640
[Guest]: We work in frameworks, we work in some sort of an ethical framework that we choose to

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.880
[Guest]: decide is acceptable to us as a society.

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:49.000
[Guest]: And once you accept that framework, then the whole argument about right versus wrong, good

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.500
[Guest]: versus bad has to happen within that framework.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:56.360
[Guest]: You can't start making arguments outside that framework and saying something is wrong.

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:59.400
[Guest]: So that's what the whole ethical principles made me realize.

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.880
[Guest]: This whole training in ethics, whatever little I did in ethics, made me realize that there

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:07.400
[Guest]: are different ways of looking at the same thing, and there is no right way.

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:14.300
[Guest]: This whole utilitarianism versus some other schools of thought, where it's not just the

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:17.920
[Guest]: utility of a particular thing that's being analyzed, but it's something else.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:22.880
[Guest]: And I don't claim to understand all of it, it's clearly esoteric stuff.

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:27.140
[Guest]: But it just makes you realize that to call something right or wrong, or to call something

01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:32.360
[Guest]: ethical or unethical, should not come from a gut feeling or should not come from a place

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.740
[Guest]: of emotion.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:37.560
[Guest]: It needs to come from a framework in which you analyze these parameters.

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.720
[Amit Varma]: And these frameworks can be complex and subjective, for example, just a thought that comes to

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:47.000
[Amit Varma]: mind that supposing you're in a hospital where COVID patients are rushing in and you don't

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.920
[Amit Varma]: have enough beds or where oxygen and you have to try as you have to choose who do you give

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.120
[Amit Varma]: treatment to.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.240
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, you could say the old people are more vulnerable, give oxygen to

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.240
[Amit Varma]: them.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:59.720
[Amit Varma]: On the other hand, you could say that the young people have more productive years of

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.480
[Amit Varma]: life left, give oxygen to them instead.

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:06.400
[Amit Varma]: And then you start weighing up, you know, what is the probability of old person surviving

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.400
[Amit Varma]: or dying?

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.880
[Amit Varma]: What is the probability of young person surviving or dying?

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.720
[Amit Varma]: How do you put a value on each extra year that each person might have?

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.160
[Amit Varma]: So implicitly, you know, you are doing it now, whether you do it in an explicit way

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.760
[Amit Varma]: where you put numbers to this or not, or you do it implicitly and you go with whatever

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.680
[Amit Varma]: your moral instinct, as it were, is that no, we have to save the old or no, you know, or

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.520
[Amit Varma]: the other way around, you are making these icky decisions.

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:36.640
[Amit Varma]: So what sometimes we need to do is we need to sort of be explicit and try to actually

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.640
[Guest]: think this stuff out.

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.640
[Guest]: Right.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.920
[Guest]: So take the other example of schools, right?

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:43.720
[Guest]: So I have twins who are six and a half years old, who've missed one year of school who

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.200
[Guest]: are very likely to miss the second year of school as well.

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:52.080
[Guest]: And you know, in an ethical framework in terms of, you know, what is right, what is wrong,

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.440
[Guest]: we always speak about our responsibilities towards children, right?

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.360
[Guest]: They're the vulnerable in the society.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:02.320
[Guest]: So we have to speak on their behalf, we have to lobby, we have to fight on their behalf.

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.600
[Guest]: And they've not really had a voice in this pandemic, right?

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:09.560
[Guest]: We've just decided that despite the fact that children hardly ever get affected.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:14.320
[Guest]: So it's an extremely small proportion of kids who fall sick enough to be hospitalized or

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:18.640
[Guest]: sick enough to have worse outcomes, extremely like it's almost negligible.

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.000
[Guest]: And yet we are subjecting them to two years of a lack of social interaction, two years

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.880
[Guest]: of meeting their friends, two years of sports, two years of everything, with the argument

01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:31.200
[Guest]: that it's being done to protect the elderly, because they're going to go back home and

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:32.200
[Guest]: the elderly are vulnerable.

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:36.240
[Guest]: They're going to have people who have other vulnerabilities at home, and we need to protect

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.240
[Guest]: them.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.760
[Guest]: Now, this is where ethics comes into play, right?

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.640
[Guest]: I mean, this is a this is a difficult question to answer.

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:47.560
[Guest]: What is the worth of those two years of social interaction and education in a child's life

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.160
[Guest]: versus protecting an elderly individual?

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.160
[Guest]: And you know, there's no straight answer.

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.800
[Guest]: There's no easy answer to this.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:55.880
[Guest]: But it's interesting when at least you generate a debate around these things.

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:56.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.720
[Amit Varma]: And the sort of problem I've always had with utilitarianism is that utilitarianism depends

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:06.040
[Amit Varma]: on calculating the utility of different actions, which is impossible to do.

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.040
[Amit Varma]: Like it's incalculable.

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.400
[Amit Varma]: If a kid is losing two years of a school life, it is incalculable.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.280
[Amit Varma]: You don't have any idea.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.960
[Amit Varma]: By incalculable, I don't mean incredibly infinitely high.

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.320
[Amit Varma]: I just mean that you literally cannot calculate it.

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.520
[Amit Varma]: You don't know what the psychological impact will be.

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.960
[Amit Varma]: You don't know what the human capital impact will be in terms of what they might have learned

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.920
[Amit Varma]: or how they are socialized and all of those things you simply don't know.

01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:32.240
[Amit Varma]: So if you are just going to take a utilitarian calculus, then eventually you will be putting

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.160
[Amit Varma]: subjective values out there in terms of this is how much I would value this and all that,

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.980
[Amit Varma]: which will go down to your own biases and therefore become completely unscientific.

01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:45.800
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, it's a really fascinating and muddy field.

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:49.280
[Amit Varma]: Let's come back to one of your pet subjects, which is sleep.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:52.540
[Amit Varma]: Like you mentioned how in your practice you wouldn't sleep enough and you thought the

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:55.700
[Amit Varma]: masters would be easy, but you found that during the masters also you're not getting

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:56.800
[Amit Varma]: enough sleep.

01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:01.200
[Amit Varma]: And that is a classic instance of a doctor not following his own advice because your

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:04.600
[Amit Varma]: advice to people constantly is that get enough sleep.

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Sleep is incredibly important and a subject close to my heart because I have sleep apnea,

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.480
[Amit Varma]: by the way.

01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:14.440
[Amit Varma]: I'm on a CPAP machine and it changed the quality of my life in multiple ways, which I'll kind

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.440
[Amit Varma]: of get into.

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And I just think that this is something that everyone needs to be aware of, because especially

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:25.600
[Amit Varma]: when we are young, the notion of just working constantly and staying up nights and all that

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.360
[Amit Varma]: is so romanticized.

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:32.880
[Amit Varma]: Even in some corporate jobs, it is considered natural that you stay till late night and

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.240
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:39.560
[Amit Varma]: And these lifestyles have an impact not just in terms of the short term impact of oh, you're

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.800
[Amit Varma]: sleepy the next day, but they have a massive long term impact on health, including possibly

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:49.960
[Amit Varma]: as people are finding out, raising the probability of Alzheimer's, getting Alzheimer's later

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:50.960
[Amit Varma]: on.

01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:55.120
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this, because it just seems to be such an important area

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:58.880
[Amit Varma]: that there is not enough public awareness about.

01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.880
[Guest]: Sleep is fascinating.

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:00.880
[Guest]: Right.

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.240
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the the raw data, we spend a third of our life sleeping and that

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.640
[Guest]: would convert with an average lifespan of about 70 years.

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.680
[Guest]: You're effectively about 20 years of your life, you're asleep.

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:17.360
[Guest]: And yet the field of sleep medicine took off somewhere around the 70s.

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:21.480
[Guest]: You know, that's where a lot of research happened in the University of Chicago.

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:24.000
[Guest]: Sleep apnea was described for the first time.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.240
[Guest]: And it's a fascinating field for in many different ways and a lot is being still researched.

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.600
[Guest]: So simple things like reaction time.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.160
[Guest]: So there were experiments where they looked at, you know, Tetris as a game that, you know,

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:38.440
[Guest]: you gave a bunch of people, let them play Tetris.

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.280
[Guest]: Half of them fell asleep, half of them were not allowed to sleep.

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:43.280
[Guest]: And you make them play again.

01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:49.080
[Guest]: And the ones who felt asleep, there was extreme consolidation of these patterns and memory

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.840
[Guest]: to an extent that they did much, much, much better the next morning versus the group that

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:53.960
[Guest]: didn't fall asleep.

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.200
[Guest]: So that's short term.

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.200
[Guest]: That's quick, quick results.

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:59.080
[Guest]: You know, things like attention span, things like memory.

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:04.040
[Guest]: I think there have been studies which have shown that one extra hour of sleep in school

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:09.360
[Guest]: going kids can reduce the incidence of attention deficit hyperactivity to a great extent.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:13.840
[Guest]: Because kids, unlike adults, when they are sleep deprived, tend to get more irritable,

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:20.080
[Guest]: tend to get more what we call hyper as compared to adults who would just be sleepy.

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.520
[Guest]: A lot of road traffic accidents have been attributed to the lack of sleep as well or

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.920
[Guest]: to sleep related disorders.

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.840
[Guest]: These are like the low hanging fruit, right?

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:33.560
[Guest]: But as you rightly pointed out that people are looking at associations between sleep

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:39.340
[Guest]: apnea and the development of cancers in the long run, for example, because it's what happens

01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:44.480
[Guest]: in sleep apnea as you have intermittent periods of time in the night where your oxygen levels

01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.480
[Guest]: are low.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:49.440
[Guest]: So your cells are deprived of oxygen and then suddenly you wake up subconsciously and then

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.680
[Guest]: your oxygen levels shoot up again.

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.440
[Guest]: So this, what we call intermittent hypoxia, that you're getting oxygen and you're not

01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:00.300
[Guest]: getting oxygen has been postulated to play a role even in the formation of cancers.

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:02.000
[Guest]: So pretty much every field.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.880
[Guest]: So again, the low hanging fruit, the initial study showed the strong link with high blood

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:10.360
[Guest]: pressure, strong link with stroke, possible link with heart disease as well.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:14.120
[Guest]: So we've picked up the low hanging fruits and now the research is going into the subtler

01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.120
[Guest]: things.

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.260
[Guest]: Unfortunately, to pick up subtler things, you need larger studies, which involve lots

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.840
[Guest]: of money and it takes a longer time to prove these things.

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:28.160
[Guest]: But we're realizing it more and more that sleep is crucial to health in a lot of different

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.160
[Guest]: ways.

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.160
[Guest]: And you're absolutely right.

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:31.480
[Guest]: We romanticize lack of sleep.

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.440
[Guest]: We almost wear it as a badge to say that I worked so hard that I barely slept last night.

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.120
[Guest]: But clearly the science suggests that it's not something to be proud of and it's something

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.040
[Guest]: that we really need to pay attention to.

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I'll link to a fascinating talk on YouTube that you gave on this, which had

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:48.640
[Amit Varma]: a bunch of insights.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:53.160
[Amit Varma]: And one of the insights I got on that was that in the US, vehicular accidents caused

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.840
[Amit Varma]: by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs combined.

01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:02.400
[Amit Varma]: So you know, it's not that you don't just need to ban drunk driving and people high

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:05.160
[Amit Varma]: on cocaine driving, but you also need to sleep enough.

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.080
[Amit Varma]: Everybody needs to sleep enough.

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:10.080
[Amit Varma]: Sleep apnea, for those who don't know, is an extremely common condition.

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:13.960
[Amit Varma]: What really happens is that because of a bunch of complex biological factors, which you mentioned

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:18.480
[Amit Varma]: in your presentation, so I won't go through that here, that your breathing keeps getting

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:23.080
[Amit Varma]: interrupted because of a temporary blockage in your airway because of which you keep waking

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:24.600
[Amit Varma]: up through the night.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:30.360
[Amit Varma]: And one sign of sleep apnea, possible sleep apnea is snoring.

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:35.080
[Amit Varma]: And of course, 30 to 40% of people snore and only 10% have sleep apnea.

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:38.280
[Amit Varma]: So it's not necessary that if you snore, you have sleep apnea.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:43.280
[Amit Varma]: But so I got myself tested for it and I got a CPAP machine and the sleep apnea problem

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.280
[Amit Varma]: just solved.

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.640
[Amit Varma]: But another interesting thing happened there, which I've never actually spoken to a medical

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:48.640
[Amit Varma]: practitioner.

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:53.160
[Amit Varma]: So I don't know if it's even a good thing, but it completely transformed my quality of

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:57.360
[Amit Varma]: life, which is that for years since childhood, I would often wake up in the morning with

01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:59.560
[Amit Varma]: a sore throat and a blocked nose.

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:03.840
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I figured out much later was GERD because of acid reflux.

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.640
[Amit Varma]: And the moment I started using the CPAP machine, this just stopped.

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:12.440
[Amit Varma]: I presumed it was because wind rushing into my respiratory system stopped the acid reflux.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:17.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it didn't come all the way up to the nose and the throat, but it completely transformed

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:22.120
[Amit Varma]: my quality of life because before that, there was not a single day in my life that I hadn't

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:26.440
[Amit Varma]: woken up with a sore throat or a blocked nose, which I initially used to assume was I didn't

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:27.440
[Amit Varma]: associate it with GERD.

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.120
[Amit Varma]: I thought it's a random respiratory thing.

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:34.240
[Amit Varma]: When I was a kid, my mother even took me to a homeopath in Pune, which is kind of funny.

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:38.040
[Amit Varma]: So and I'm thinking that at one level, it's a good thing that treatment for something

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.280
[Amit Varma]: else has happened to have this impact here.

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:44.080
[Amit Varma]: But at the other level, it's a bad thing because what it is treating is a symptom.

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:47.360
[Amit Varma]: And the underlying causes of GERD, which I might need to do something about whether it's

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.480
[Amit Varma]: losing weight or whatever, is stuff that I'm not handling.

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:55.440
[Amit Varma]: So do you sometimes see this in your practice that you're treating something, but something

01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:00.400
[Amit Varma]: else gets sorted or something counterintuitive like this happens, like in this particular

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.600
[Amit Varma]: case, what would your reaction be?

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:06.400
[Guest]: There are a lot of associations with sleep apnea.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:10.120
[Guest]: Before I get into that, just to add to something you said earlier, so there was a study which

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:15.920
[Guest]: looked at blood alcohol levels and sleep deprivation, and they actually did it in medical students

01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.720
[Guest]: and found that medical students post-call who were sleep deprived, in terms of their

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:25.240
[Guest]: cognitive performance performed very similar to people who had a reasonable amount of alcohol

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.560
[Guest]: in their system.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:29.880
[Guest]: So that's how bad sleep deprivation is.

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:33.480
[Guest]: So there may be a lot of teetotallers out there who work really hard and feel that they're

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:37.800
[Guest]: not drinking, but they're probably causing an equal amount of damage by depriving themselves

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:39.200
[Guest]: of sleep.

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:42.320
[Guest]: So to get back to your question in terms of whether sleep apnea is connected to a lot

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.160
[Guest]: of things, there are lots of fascinating things that happen.

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:50.080
[Guest]: So sleep apnea basically is obstruction of the windpipe at the level of the throat, right?

01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:54.480
[Guest]: So it's generally fat at the base of the tongue, at the back of the tongue, which causes an

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.480
[Guest]: obstruction out there.

01:53:55.480 --> 01:54:00.440
[Guest]: So what happens essentially is when you breathe in sleep apnea, so your windpipe is shut,

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:03.560
[Guest]: and you're breathing against the resistance of a shut windpipe.

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:09.040
[Guest]: So imagine, if you think about that experiment where you have a diaphragm below a bottle

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:13.400
[Guest]: and you pull the diaphragm down and the balloons fill up inside, I don't know if you've, we've

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:18.420
[Guest]: done this in school, this is like you're shutting that and you're pulling the diaphragm down,

01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:20.760
[Guest]: but you've shut down the way for the air to enter.

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:23.680
[Guest]: So that puts a lot of negative pressure inside the chest.

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:28.720
[Guest]: Now this negative pressure inside the chest surprisingly causes the heart muscle to stretch.

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:33.560
[Guest]: When the heart muscle stretches, it releases a substance called atrial natriuretic peptide,

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.600
[Guest]: which causes you to basically pee.

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:39.320
[Guest]: So it's very interesting that people with sleep apnea very often will pee three or four

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:43.600
[Guest]: times every night in the severe form, or at least once or twice every night.

01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:46.720
[Guest]: And the moment they start using the CPAP machine, that completely stops.

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:49.560
[Guest]: So something that you wouldn't even think is related, right?

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.920
[Guest]: You would think, why is my peeing frequency gone down when all you've done is push air

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.320
[Guest]: down my throat?

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.280
[Guest]: But that's how fascinating the human body is.

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.520
[Guest]: There are so many things which are interconnected.

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:04.600
[Guest]: So GERD is a very common comorbidity with sleep apnea, because again, you know, obesity,

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:08.600
[Guest]: GERD and sleep apnea, you know, kind of form a triangle.

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:13.280
[Guest]: And the treatment of sleep apnea, it very often gets rid of a lot of these corollary

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:19.400
[Guest]: symptoms, which you otherwise would not have thought directly associated with the disease.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:23.440
[Guest]: Blood pressure tends to come down by a few points, you know, heart rates tend to get

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:27.680
[Guest]: better post-sleep apnea, you know, something that's not spoken about.

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:31.480
[Guest]: Erectile dysfunction is sometimes very common in individuals who have sleep apnea as well.

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.680
[Guest]: And that gets to know, and we have a lot of urology reference to us.

01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:39.680
[Guest]: So urologists who are up to date with the literature and sensitized enough to this connection

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.280
[Guest]: have sent me patients of erectile dysfunction coming to a person getting their sleep apnea

01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:47.640
[Guest]: treated and then, you know, their erectile dysfunction getting better as well.

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.360
[Guest]: So it's fascinating how things are related sometimes, you know, and it may not be very

01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:56.080
[Guest]: obvious in terms of physiology that it's air going down the respiratory system.

01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:58.720
[Guest]: So all its effects have to be related to the respiratory system.

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:01.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, it is completely fascinating.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:06.960
[Amit Varma]: So the fact that there are people out there with erectile problems, which are caused by

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.680
[Guest]: a throat muscle.

01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:09.680
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:10.680
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:13.160
[Amit Varma]: Doing something that they should is insanely fascinating.

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:17.240
[Amit Varma]: I didn't actually imply that my sleep apnea and GERD were necessarily linked.

01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.040
[Amit Varma]: I think I've always had the GERD, but this just turned out to be the CPAP machine just

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:26.040
[Amit Varma]: turned out to be a jogar solution in whatever way it works for that.

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And that got me to thinking about jogar solutions, because one of the other like interesting

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.640
[Amit Varma]: things that I learned that you sometimes recommend is that you recommend that your patients with

01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:37.440
[Amit Varma]: sleep apnea that they sleep on the side, because then they are less likely to feel the effects

01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:42.440
[Amit Varma]: of it and to make sure that they do that, you sometimes ask them to sleep with tennis

01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.720
[Amit Varma]: balls sewn onto the back of their shirt.

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:48.000
[Amit Varma]: So they can't possibly sleep on their back, even if they want to.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.160
[Amit Varma]: So as a doctor, do you find yourself thinking creatively for these kind of jogar solutions

01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:57.760
[Amit Varma]: that come from commonsensical thinking or do you kind of do this a lot or and how do

01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:59.480
[Amit Varma]: patients react to it?

01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:04.000
[Guest]: So the next level of jogar, by the way, for the same solution is to wear a bra in the

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.480
[Guest]: opposite direction and stuff it with tennis balls, right?

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.800
[Guest]: But you don't want to open the door to the pizza delivery guy, of course, when that happens.

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.320
[Guest]: But that's a jogar again, you know, I mean, that's an easier jogar rather than sewing

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:19.040
[Guest]: sometimes, but you know, people obviously, you know, stare at you when you say things

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:21.560
[Guest]: like that, wondering if something's wrong with you.

01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:24.520
[Guest]: But trust me, I mean, it does work very well, because sleep apnea is clearly worse when

01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:28.060
[Guest]: you're on your back versus when you're on your belly or on your sides.

01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:31.920
[Guest]: That's the same solution indirectly, we're trying to apply for COVID as well, right?

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:36.480
[Guest]: Making people sleep prone, because the airway opens up, the lung opens up a bit, and it

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:37.960
[Guest]: improves oxygenation.

01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:42.640
[Guest]: A lot of medical grade equipment often is very expensive.

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.680
[Guest]: And you know, all of us do try to work with some sorts of solutions, sometimes to help

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:53.820
[Guest]: people deal with their lack of ability to sometimes purchase that kind of medical equipment,

01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:57.000
[Guest]: but to do it in a way that that gives them the same relief.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.400
[Guest]: And you know, I think there's a lot of innovation happening in these kinds of spaces, as well,

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.840
[Guest]: which suggests that it doesn't have to be that expensive.

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.280
[Guest]: You know, sometimes things which are not expensive also work well.

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.440
[Guest]: For example, in asthma, we use inhalers, right?

01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:14.640
[Guest]: So inhalers, the traditional inhalers, which you press, and you take a breath, have to

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:16.140
[Guest]: be coordinated perfectly.

01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:19.920
[Guest]: So the second you press the inhaler, if you don't breathe, you end up getting a mouth

01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:22.200
[Guest]: spray, nothing goes into the chest, right?

01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:24.680
[Guest]: So the solution to that is something called a spacer.

01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:29.480
[Guest]: It's like this round plastic transparent box at the end of which you attach the inhaler,

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:34.520
[Guest]: you press it, so the drug is locked into the spacer, and then you breathe at your own convenience.

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:38.920
[Guest]: Now the jugaad for this, which I've seen people do is use a PET bottle, you cut the end of

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:43.120
[Guest]: the PET bottle, so you stick the inhaler to that end, you keep the mouth of the bottle

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:46.560
[Guest]: in your mouth, you press the inhaler, and you breathe through it.

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:49.000
[Guest]: And again, it takes away the problem of coordination.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.420
[Guest]: It's a total jugaad in that sense.

01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:56.040
[Guest]: And from what little I know, it seems to work really well, as opposed to a spacer, which

01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:58.260
[Guest]: is a more expensive device.

01:58:58.260 --> 01:58:59.760
[Amit Varma]: That sounds really fascinating.

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:03.840
[Amit Varma]: Let's go on to, you know, one of the other subjects in which you've been active, which

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:07.040
[Amit Varma]: is you've spoken of your smoking cessation therapy.

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:12.140
[Amit Varma]: And recently, in fact, you tweeted, quote, most individuals who consume tobacco know

01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:16.680
[Amit Varma]: it is harmful, but continue to do so because of the highly addictive nature of nicotine.

01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:22.320
[Amit Varma]: What we need to do is not offer such individuals a sermon, but a science based way to overcome

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:23.320
[Amit Varma]: the addiction.

01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:24.320
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:27.440
[Amit Varma]: And of course, part of the reason that you're into that you care about smoking is you're

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:31.820
[Amit Varma]: into all these pulmonary diseases of the lungs, which are caused by smoking.

01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:32.820
[Amit Varma]: So it is a big deal.

01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:35.800
[Amit Varma]: You don't just want to treat symptoms, you want to get to the root cause, make people

01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:36.800
[Amit Varma]: stop smoking.

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about this, like, what are the approaches that you make?

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:45.440
[Amit Varma]: Because most of the approaches towards to make people stop smoking is sort of to guilt

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:47.120
[Amit Varma]: them into stopping.

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:48.120
[Amit Varma]: What do you guys do?

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:49.120
[Guest]: Right.

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.320
[Guest]: So I'm just going to throw some statistics.

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:55.880
[Guest]: So there was a study called the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, it's called the GATS survey.

01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:00.480
[Guest]: And it was done in India, it was found that more than 90% of individuals, even in rural

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:06.160
[Guest]: India, even with literacy levels being questionable, more than 90% of individuals knew that tobacco

02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:07.160
[Guest]: was bad for them.

02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:12.480
[Guest]: You know, in the survey, around 50% of individuals admitted to having tried to quit in the year

02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:14.480
[Guest]: prior, in the previous year.

02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:17.160
[Guest]: This clearly suggests that there is not a knowledge problem.

02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:21.160
[Guest]: So whenever you want to change behavior, there are three things that are generally needed

02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:22.600
[Guest]: for changing behavior.

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:26.920
[Guest]: From what again, what I understand of behavioral sciences, you need the knowledge, or you need

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:29.920
[Guest]: the motivation and you need the confidence, right?

02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:34.480
[Guest]: The problem is, as doctors, when we see patients sitting in front of us who admit to smoking,

02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:37.000
[Guest]: we think it's a knowledge problem for some reason.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.200
[Guest]: And we give them a sermon about, you know, listen, this is bad, this can affect you in

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:45.000
[Guest]: this way, it can affect you in that way, when the data clearly suggests that they already

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
[Guest]: know that.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.880
[Guest]: So you're working on the wrong part of the problem.

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:52.720
[Guest]: The second is the motivation and third is the confidence.

02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:58.520
[Guest]: And if you speak to people who smoke, their confidence levels are abysmally low, because

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.840
[Guest]: they've tried many times in the past and they've failed.

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:05.560
[Guest]: You know, most individuals will not even admit to trying, they will not even admit to their

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:08.520
[Guest]: own spouses and their own loved ones that they are trying.

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:12.560
[Guest]: They will do it quietly because their confidence levels are so low that they already know it's

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:15.160
[Guest]: not going to work when they start, right?

02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:18.860
[Guest]: Now the reason for that is that nicotine is a highly addictive substance.

02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:21.120
[Guest]: Nicotine addiction is an addiction.

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.120
[Guest]: It's not a habit.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.120
[Guest]: It's not.

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:27.760
[Guest]: So we use these words like habit, lifestyle choice, we use all sorts of words to make

02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:31.200
[Guest]: the burden of guilt, like you said, you know, to make the person feel guilty, to make the

02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:36.640
[Guest]: person feel responsible for where they're at, where the science clearly shows you that

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:40.120
[Guest]: it's an addiction and should be treated like any other addiction.

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:45.080
[Guest]: So when you see a person who is in front of you, and I run a tobacco cessation clinic,

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:48.640
[Guest]: so they come to me reasonably motivated already, which is great, you know.

02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:50.920
[Guest]: So I don't have to work on that motivation.

02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:54.720
[Guest]: Now that may be a different story altogether, how you work on that motivation, but once

02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:59.000
[Guest]: they are motivated enough, they do not need that lecture or that sermon or that guilt

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.520
[Guest]: trip or that, you know, the guilting.

02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:04.200
[Guest]: What they need is a solution and the solutions are science-based.

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:10.160
[Guest]: So all over the world, the standard therapy for smoking cessation has been defined.

02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.560
[Guest]: There are drugs which are designed to work on centers of the brain to give you the same

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:19.520
[Guest]: pleasurable experience that a cigarette gives you whilst at the same time not giving you

02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:22.280
[Guest]: the thousand other things that a cigarette gives you.

02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.320
[Guest]: And most of these therapies have been used for about three to six months.

02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.560
[Guest]: So it's a defined fixed therapy for three to six months, which a person adheres to according

02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.040
[Guest]: to a certain plan.

02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.640
[Guest]: That plan ensures that they don't get irritable, they don't feel cravings, they don't feel

02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:37.640
[Guest]: terrible.

02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:43.040
[Guest]: So the bottom line of a smoking cessation clinic is that you are able to quit comfortably.

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.920
[Guest]: Anybody can quit, right?

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:49.360
[Guest]: But that quitting is so uncomfortable usually that people get back thinking that it's easier

02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:52.080
[Guest]: to continue rather than going down that path.

02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.080
[Guest]: And if you look at the statistics there of a hundred people who decide to quit within

02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.400
[Guest]: a month, 97 have started smoking again, only three succeed.

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:04.120
[Guest]: And if I had to guess, those three would be individuals who are doing it after say a bypass

02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:08.480
[Guest]: surgery, after a major life event, after getting diagnosed with something that really shakes

02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:09.480
[Guest]: them up.

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:10.920
[Guest]: And that's not where we want people to be.

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:13.960
[Guest]: We want people to be able to do it comfortably and there's a science to it.

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:18.480
[Guest]: Now, again, it's unfortunate that we have specialized clinics and I have to do it like

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:23.360
[Guest]: I have some secret mantra to it, whereas all over the world, it's general practitioners,

02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.920
[Guest]: it's being done as part of routine healthcare.

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.760
[Guest]: There is no great skill to this.

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:31.400
[Guest]: And what I've been trying really hard in terms of training sessions, we've been working with

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.920
[Guest]: people as well, is to de-specialize this.

02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:40.320
[Guest]: This is something that your general practitioner should be able to offer you without any judgment,

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.080
[Guest]: without any gyan, you smoke and you want to give up smoking.

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:45.080
[Guest]: This is what you need to do.

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:46.520
[Guest]: And it should be as straightforward as that.

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:48.960
[Guest]: And this is again, you know, this is something that's been done all over the world.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:51.720
[Guest]: This is not something special.

02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:52.720
[Amit Varma]: And what do these medicines do?

02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:56.800
[Amit Varma]: Like, do they tackle the dopamine receptors of the brain or something or how do they kind

02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:57.800
[Guest]: of work?

02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:02.600
[Guest]: So the most fascinating molecule in this group, which has shown the maximum amount of success

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.320
[Guest]: is a drug called varinicline.

02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:07.280
[Guest]: So basically what happens is when you smoke a cigarette or you consume tobacco in any

02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:12.160
[Guest]: form, the nicotine goes and binds to a receptor in the brain, which eventually leads to the

02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:13.160
[Guest]: release of dopamine.

02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:19.000
[Guest]: Now dopamine is a pleasure chemical, you know, and it's not only is it a pleasure chemical,

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.360
[Guest]: it comes out in response to some very primal needs.

02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:28.140
[Guest]: So hunger, thirst, sex, these are the times when dopamine gets released in the brain.

02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:32.880
[Guest]: So it has a very strong pleasurable element as well as a very strong primal evolutionary

02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:35.000
[Guest]: role in human beings.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.560
[Guest]: Varinicline binds to these receptors and causes that dopamine surge.

02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:41.960
[Guest]: So when an individual smokes, he gets that surge of dopamine, which keeps him stimulated

02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:45.280
[Guest]: in some ways, which feeds into that pleasure activity.

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.320
[Guest]: Now varinicline goes and binds to the receptor called the acetylcholine receptor, which eventually

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.620
[Guest]: causes the release of dopamine.

02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:55.360
[Guest]: So it gives you that kick, which you would normally get, and it gives it to you in a

02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.360
[Guest]: sustained way.

02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:01.360
[Guest]: So a person who smokes or consumes tobacco really craves it when the nicotine levels

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:04.280
[Guest]: hit a nadir, hit a really low level.

02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:09.200
[Guest]: By virtue of this drug constantly stimulating that center, you do not reach those low levels

02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:12.720
[Guest]: and therefore the cravings don't generally occur.

02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:18.680
[Guest]: What's fascinating is also that if while you're on the drug, you decide to smoke, the nicotine

02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:22.760
[Guest]: in your cigarette smoke does not have any receptor to bind to because the receptor has

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:24.520
[Guest]: been blocked by the drug.

02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:27.080
[Guest]: So you don't experience the pleasure that you would normally get.

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:31.760
[Guest]: So I've had a lot of patients come back to me and say, I did smoke, but you know, I stopped

02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:35.240
[Guest]: at half a cigarette and I just threw it away because it wasn't doing it for me.

02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:39.840
[Guest]: So this is what we call a partial agonist antagonist, you know, so it not only stimulates,

02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:41.760
[Guest]: but it also blocks the receptor.

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:45.200
[Guest]: I think the physiology again is fascinating.

02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:46.640
[Guest]: This is one of the drugs that we use.

02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:49.440
[Guest]: You can also use combination nicotine replacement therapy.

02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:54.200
[Guest]: So a patch, which generally tends to work for 24 hours in the background, again, preventing

02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:58.680
[Guest]: those low levels of nicotine combined with either a gum or a lozenge or an inhaler to

02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:00.560
[Guest]: be used as and when you have cravings.

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:02.600
[Guest]: So that's another strategy we employ.

02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:04.960
[Guest]: And sometimes we use a combination of both strategies.

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:07.000
[Guest]: But again, this is not based on a gut feeling.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:10.320
[Guest]: So there are certain predictors of addiction, you know, so supposing you've started smoking

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:14.920
[Guest]: in your teens, supposing you smoke within the first five minutes of waking up.

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:18.440
[Guest]: If you smoke more than 10 to 15 cigarettes a day, you are likely to be more addicted

02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:22.720
[Guest]: and you very often need a combination of drugs in that situation.

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:25.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this is incredibly fascinating.

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:30.160
[Amit Varma]: And of course, it's a smoking specific solution because the molecule would bind to the receptor

02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:32.320
[Amit Varma]: that nicotine binds to.

02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:35.200
[Amit Varma]: And so, you know, it wouldn't be useful for other kinds of addiction.

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.880
[Amit Varma]: There's an amusing story I have.

02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:37.880
[Amit Varma]: It's not amusing.

02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:41.920
[Amit Varma]: It's kind of sad about how I tried to wean a friend of gambling addiction because the

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:43.520
[Amit Varma]: mechanisms are the same, right?

02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:46.120
[Amit Varma]: Pushing chips forward, dopamine rush in your head and all that.

02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:51.720
[Amit Varma]: So there's this guy who was a banker who lived in Worli and the location is relevant.

02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:52.720
[Amit Varma]: So he was a banker.

02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:53.720
[Amit Varma]: He lived in Worli.

02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:56.880
[Amit Varma]: He used to play these underground cash games with me back in the day.

02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:58.760
[Amit Varma]: And it was clearly he was just addicted.

02:06:58.760 --> 02:06:59.760
[Amit Varma]: He wasn't using his brain.

02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.160
[Amit Varma]: He was just losing big.

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:02.160
[Amit Varma]: And I liked him a lot.

02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:03.920
[Amit Varma]: A very sweet guy.

02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And I could realize that bit by bit he's blowing his savings up.

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:08.540
[Amit Varma]: His wife is pissed off.

02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:12.440
[Amit Varma]: So I called him home one day and I live in Andheri and this is also relevant.

02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And at the time I called him, you know, he was playing at this video game parlor in Bandra.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.320
[Amit Varma]: So even when, you know, there were no live games, he would go to this video game parlor

02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:23.060
[Amit Varma]: and play video poker there.

02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:25.320
[Amit Varma]: So anyway, so he came home and we chatted about it.

02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:27.360
[Amit Varma]: And as you said, the knowledge wasn't a problem.

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.880
[Amit Varma]: He understood it was an addiction.

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:31.800
[Amit Varma]: And I went took him through the biochemistry and all of that.

02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:34.440
[Amit Varma]: And I said, we have to figure out some drastic ways of stopping it.

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:37.520
[Amit Varma]: This is what I recommend that you call your wife right now.

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:41.360
[Amit Varma]: And you tell her that you are giving her the credit card and all access to the bank and

02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:42.360
[Amit Varma]: everything.

02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:44.540
[Amit Varma]: And you're just stopping all your access to money.

02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:48.360
[Amit Varma]: She has to give you pocket money every day for whatever taxi or Uber you take.

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.360
[Amit Varma]: And that is it.

02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:51.800
[Amit Varma]: You have no other access to your money.

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:52.800
[Amit Varma]: And he agreed.

02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:53.800
[Amit Varma]: He called his wife.

02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:55.860
[Amit Varma]: She was delighted at the suggestion.

02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And I think she also told him, I'll make chicken for you today, come for dinner.

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:00.480
[Amit Varma]: So he was very excited.

02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:04.760
[Amit Varma]: He said, Amit, you know, you might just have saved my family life and all that.

02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:06.380
[Amit Varma]: And then he leaves home.

02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:10.080
[Amit Varma]: But the problem is this, and this is why the locations are important, that to get from

02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:12.380
[Amit Varma]: Andheri to Worli, you have to cross Bandra.

02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:17.120
[Amit Varma]: And three hours later, another friend calls me and he says that, bro, your friend is sitting

02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:19.720
[Amit Varma]: at this video parlor playing for the last two hours.

02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:21.080
[Amit Varma]: So that didn't kind of work out well.

02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:24.880
[Amit Varma]: And I guess, you know, is there any kind of pharmacology for general addiction?

02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:28.200
[Amit Varma]: Because so many people are also addicted to social media, you know, or even something

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.200
[Amit Varma]: like Tetris or whatever.

02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:34.640
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, but I guess there's nothing you can do for that in terms of medicine yet,

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:35.640
[Guest]: right?

02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:40.320
[Guest]: In the domain of psychology, I know that cognitive behavior therapy is being tried in a lot of

02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:41.320
[Guest]: addictions.

02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:44.000
[Guest]: Hypnotherapy claims to have some success.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.800
[Guest]: But you know, again, these things are not very consistent.

02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:50.180
[Guest]: So you're not really sure in terms of the literature.

02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:55.240
[Guest]: That's one of the problems of sciences that are not pharmacotherapy-based, right?

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:59.320
[Guest]: So the drug, the dosage, mode of delivery, when a clinical trial is conducted, all these

02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:00.480
[Guest]: are very clearly defined.

02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:03.600
[Guest]: So therefore, all over the world, anyone can try to replicate that.

02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:08.160
[Guest]: The problem with behavioral sciences sometimes is that it's the person whose expertise it

02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:13.920
[Guest]: is, it's the way they deliver it, and to translate that sometimes is a little challenging.

02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:18.880
[Amit Varma]: So let's talk about COVID-19 now, because COVID-19 is clearly an incredibly difficult

02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:21.120
[Amit Varma]: problem for a doctor to deal with.

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:25.760
[Amit Varma]: Because you're having every day to make decisions on matters that involve life and death.

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And in terms of information, you're in the fog of war, you don't know what the hell is

02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.240
[Amit Varma]: going on.

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:33.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, someone like you would be looking at the latest research trying to figure out

02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:34.200
[Amit Varma]: what is a virus?

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:35.200
[Amit Varma]: What does it do?

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.200
[Amit Varma]: But even there, how does one treat COVID?

02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:41.160
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about your experience over these last few months, right?

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.840
[Amit Varma]: How did your thinking on this evolve?

02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:45.000
[Amit Varma]: What were the dilemmas you faced?

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.920
[Amit Varma]: Just what was it like for you guys?

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:50.880
[Guest]: I think the worst part was clearly the first two, three months, right?

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:54.200
[Guest]: Because there was complete uncertainty, we had no idea what was going to work.

02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:00.640
[Guest]: We started using steroids about a month or two before the recovery trial got published.

02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:03.920
[Guest]: And we used it in these prolonged fevers that were happening in the second week, sometimes

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:05.720
[Guest]: with the oxygen levels were dropping.

02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:09.560
[Guest]: We used it purely based on a gut feeling at that point of time, and a little bit of literature

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:13.440
[Guest]: that was coming up from small reports from China saying that, you know, methylprednisolone

02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:15.280
[Guest]: was used in a couple of studies.

02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:19.800
[Guest]: And we saw positive results and that reinforced, I believe, in the appropriate use of steroids

02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:20.800
[Guest]: at that point.

02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:26.600
[Guest]: But again, you know, I mean, it was one center doing something by themselves based on what

02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:29.680
[Guest]: you could call trial and error to a certain extent.

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.560
[Guest]: As time passed by, and the literature started accumulating, and that's, you know, you have

02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:39.960
[Guest]: to give immense amount of credit to people who got drug trials and these adaptive trials

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.480
[Guest]: up and running within a few months, you know.

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:47.240
[Guest]: Being a researcher myself, I know how extremely difficult it is to do simple, small little

02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:48.240
[Guest]: studies.

02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:53.600
[Guest]: And these guys, you know, like the solidarity, like recovery, they did trials on a nationwide

02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:59.520
[Guest]: scale with multiple centers, got everybody on board, got randomization to occur, protocols,

02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:01.480
[Guest]: you know, submitted to ethics committees.

02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:05.680
[Guest]: To do all of that in the time span that they did it is nothing short of a miracle, you

02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:10.160
[Guest]: know, and that needs to be lauded, which also possibly reflects how prepared they were for

02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.160
[Guest]: something like this.

02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:16.520
[Guest]: The systems were in place to roll out a study if need be.

02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:20.000
[Guest]: Possibly they had thought about this in advance, may not be in the context of a pandemic, but

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.840
[Guest]: in the context of any study for that matter, that if they wanted to roll out a study within

02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:28.320
[Guest]: two months, they could do it and do it really well of a high caliber.

02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:33.920
[Guest]: As the results of these studies started coming in, it became a lot easier in terms of what

02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:36.680
[Guest]: we definitely know and what we definitely do not know.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.840
[Guest]: So there's still uncertainty.

02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:42.480
[Guest]: For example, you know, the use of blood thinners is still an uncertain area.

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:46.040
[Guest]: Couple of studies published just in the last week, one showed that aspirin possibly doesn't

02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:47.040
[Guest]: work.

02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.720
[Guest]: One shows that when you use blood thinners in a treatment dose, which we call a therapeutic

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:51.960
[Guest]: dose, a high dose doesn't work.

02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:52.960
[Guest]: But this is still evolving.

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:58.200
[Guest]: So, you know, there is still uncertainty, but as and when the large trials showed us

02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:04.000
[Guest]: that things definitely don't work, I think gradually things started becoming clearer.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.760
[Guest]: This is one of the places where being, you know, an epidemiologist kind of possibly helped

02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:11.800
[Guest]: me because the cynicism was the default.

02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:14.320
[Guest]: The default was never, you know, let's try this new thing.

02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:15.800
[Guest]: Let's try something else.

02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:20.320
[Guest]: The other thing that was constantly reassuring was that the number of individuals who got

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:25.280
[Guest]: hospitalized, the number of individuals who got severe enough was still a small fraction

02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:26.960
[Guest]: of the total number of cases.

02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:31.280
[Guest]: When that first zero prevalence study came out, for example, it said 57% of people in

02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:33.640
[Guest]: slums had already been infected.

02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:37.960
[Guest]: And if you extrapolated to that, you realize that the fraction of individuals who got admitted

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.560
[Guest]: was a really tiny fraction.

02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:43.040
[Guest]: It wasn't really big if so many people had antibodies already.

02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:45.280
[Guest]: So there were two reassuring things, therefore, right?

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:49.760
[Guest]: One was that this was a disease which spared the majority, which did not cause a majority

02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:50.760
[Guest]: to die.

02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:55.320
[Guest]: Had it been a disease which did cause a majority to die, we would have been in big trouble

02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:59.680
[Guest]: because then we would have to constantly make very difficult choices.

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:05.000
[Guest]: The reason we could go to what is called masterful inactivity or watching, you know, closely

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.480
[Guest]: observing, monitoring is because we knew at the back of our minds that a majority of individuals

02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:12.480
[Guest]: are going to do very well without any intervention.

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:16.880
[Guest]: That was one thing that was very useful from a treatment perspective.

02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:21.020
[Guest]: The second thing that was very useful was the data that kept coming in and telling us

02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:22.560
[Guest]: what didn't work.

02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:27.640
[Guest]: So you know, when plasma got thrown out and, you know, we realized it didn't work.

02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:31.520
[Guest]: In drugs like remdesivir, there was more accumulating evidence to suggest that it didn't work.

02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:36.120
[Guest]: Lopinavir, ritonavir, there were a lot of hydroxychloroquine, all these drugs, you know,

02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:39.440
[Guest]: reasonably quickly, there was information out there to tell us that we shouldn't be

02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:40.440
[Guest]: using it.

02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:46.120
[Guest]: So I think the combination of low severity disease in that sense, as an absolute fraction,

02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:51.280
[Guest]: combined with the rapidity with which evidence was synthesized, I think really helped us

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:55.120
[Guest]: gain confidence as the pandemic went on.

02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:59.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the things that we sometimes talk about in public policy is this flawed

02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:04.160
[Amit Varma]: mindset of, we must do something, this is something, therefore, let's do it.

02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:08.480
[Amit Varma]: And I guess to some extent, that is a pressure which would have hit doctors during this period,

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:12.720
[Amit Varma]: because you would have been under pressure to medicate, to give some medicine or the

02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:13.720
[Amit Varma]: other.

02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:17.560
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, even if you are skeptical of say last year, one would have been skeptical

02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:22.400
[Amit Varma]: of hydroxychloroquine and this year, you know, during the second wave, we've had ivermectin,

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:28.000
[Amit Varma]: remdesivir, plasma, all lauded as sort of therapies, I guess, one, there would be pressure

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:34.000
[Amit Varma]: on doctors to prescribe them, because relatives would be saying, you know, that doctor prescribed

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
[Amit Varma]: this for my uncle, and so on.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.280
[Amit Varma]: How does one deal with that?

02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:42.760
[Amit Varma]: Because one of the things that I noted was that there was this panic on social media

02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:48.120
[Amit Varma]: with these hundreds of messages every day, or hundreds that I saw every day about ivermectin

02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.280
[Amit Varma]: needed, remdesivir needed, plasma needed, well, we know they don't work.

02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:56.040
[Amit Varma]: And the problem is that frantic relatives going out to get them are actually catching

02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:01.120
[Amit Varma]: COVID, standing in line somewhere and trying to get the damn medicine, therefore compounding

02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:03.480
[Amit Varma]: tragedy on tragedy, as it were.

02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:05.480
[Amit Varma]: So as a doctor, how did you deal with that?

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:10.640
[Amit Varma]: Did you face that kind of pressure from your patients, ki, arey lekin remdesivir nahi diya?

02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:13.040
[Guest]: It was it was an extremely difficult period.

02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:15.120
[Guest]: And to a certain extent, it still is.

02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:19.260
[Guest]: It's just that when you when you gain a voice that is that has a little more credibility

02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:23.160
[Guest]: and respect with time, people tend to trust you a little more.

02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:28.160
[Guest]: But you know, it was extremely difficult at the start to tell people that observation

02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:33.960
[Guest]: to to say that monitoring and you know, to constantly handhold them and say that we are

02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:34.960
[Guest]: monitoring you.

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.360
[Guest]: We are not saying don't do anything and just, you know, leave it to God.

02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:42.160
[Guest]: We're not saying that we're saying that we are monitoring you.

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:44.760
[Guest]: Steroids came on very early as lifesaving drugs.

02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:49.560
[Guest]: So we said that we knew that if you do deteriorate, we have something that might work.

02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.180
[Guest]: Tocilizumab, at some point of time, there was evidence to suggest that it works.

02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:56.520
[Guest]: So we did have drugs for when people deteriorated.

02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:02.020
[Guest]: But to tell people to just stay put was extremely challenging and not just challenging.

02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:03.240
[Guest]: It was it was challenging.

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:05.100
[Guest]: It was time consuming.

02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:09.800
[Guest]: It was fatiguing as a doctor to have the same conversation over and over and over again.

02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:14.560
[Guest]: And it would give me nightmares at some point of time, you know, because I am the guy who

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:20.200
[Guest]: is telling somebody that you don't do anything, knowing fully well that there is a fraction

02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:22.880
[Guest]: of the don't do anything is going to deteriorate.

02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:26.000
[Guest]: The unfortunate part is that I have no control over that deterioration.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.760
[Guest]: I don't have a drug that can prevent that deterioration.

02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:31.100
[Guest]: I don't have the drug that can make the person better today.

02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:33.080
[Guest]: So that deterioration doesn't happen.

02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:37.280
[Guest]: So I am telling a person that I offer you nothing today, knowing fully well that, you

02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:41.260
[Guest]: know, a small fraction of these individuals who got nothing would deteriorate.

02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:45.520
[Guest]: And then in hindsight would clearly blame me as being the person responsible for their

02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:50.060
[Guest]: deterioration, not understanding that that deterioration, unfortunately, would have happened

02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:51.720
[Guest]: no matter what, you know.

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:56.160
[Guest]: So that was very scary to sleep at night, knowing that there was a cohort of patients

02:16:56.160 --> 02:17:00.360
[Guest]: out there who you were handholding, not giving anything.

02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:03.540
[Guest]: And knowing that, you know, when you wake up in the morning, there would be a WhatsApp

02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:07.120
[Guest]: message once in a way saying that, you know, this person's oxygen levels fell the previous

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:09.160
[Guest]: night, got admitted.

02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:12.600
[Guest]: And you hope, you know, you hope that their faith in you was strong enough that they realize

02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:16.160
[Guest]: that you did nothing wrong, you know, you were following the science.

02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:20.200
[Guest]: And you know, fortunately, I think a lot of my patients got it, but it takes a lot of

02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:24.440
[Guest]: time in terms of counseling and handholding as well.

02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:28.600
[Guest]: That's what I resent to a small extent that, you know, I was the one having to explain

02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:35.080
[Guest]: why I was doing the scientific thing, while the guy next door who was prescribing 10 drugs

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:36.080
[Guest]: had no explaining to do.

02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:40.040
[Guest]: He said, oh, you come in, you got COVID, take these 10 drugs, go, patient happy, doctor

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:41.560
[Guest]: happy, you know, life moves on.

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:47.000
[Guest]: Nine out of 10 of his patients also got better because that's the nature of the illness.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.720
[Guest]: One out of 10 who didn't get better would probably say, you know, but my poor doctor

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:55.320
[Guest]: tried everything and still I didn't get better, while I was unfortunately the bad guy.

02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:00.920
[Guest]: And you know, that was one thing that I didn't really like in terms of having to explain

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:01.920
[Guest]: being scientific.

02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:04.440
[Guest]: I don't think that's how medicine works, you know.

02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:06.480
[Guest]: The burden of proof should be on the drug.

02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:08.280
[Guest]: The drug has to prove its worth.

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:15.440
[Guest]: I don't have to prove the fact that my scientific choices of not giving you a drug because there

02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:20.120
[Guest]: is no drug that works need to be justified on an ongoing basis.

02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I can totally see why any doctor would be incentivized to give that cocktail

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.520
[Amit Varma]: of drugs just to avoid the blame because that is what the patients expect.

02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of tragic.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.320
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a quick digression before we come back to COVID.

02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:40.120
[Amit Varma]: How does one deal psychologically with patients taking a turn for the worse and dying over

02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:43.440
[Amit Varma]: the years, over so much medical practice, especially for a doctor, like you pointed

02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:49.440
[Amit Varma]: out, where you've been trained to when you try to look at each patient as not a collection

02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:54.520
[Amit Varma]: of statistics of age, weight, whatever, but also as a human being, you know, their names,

02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:57.640
[Amit Varma]: you kind of you're chatting with them about their lives.

02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:00.860
[Amit Varma]: And then at some point they go and some of the time you can't do anything about it.

02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:05.080
[Amit Varma]: Some of the time you can in hindsight know that had I done something different, it would

02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:06.720
[Amit Varma]: have worked out differently.

02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:10.480
[Amit Varma]: So how did you deal with that kind of a process?

02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Is it still hard after all these years or, you know, does one kind of build a system

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.600
[Amit Varma]: of mental defense where, you know, you can just get on with things?

02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:25.320
[Guest]: I mean, the probabilistic thinking and the uncertainty kind of is what you use to soothe

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:29.520
[Guest]: your conscience when it does happen, because, you know, at the end of the day, you have

02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:33.360
[Guest]: to soothe your conscience in some way, otherwise, you know, you are not going to make peace

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:37.400
[Guest]: and you're not going to be, and if it shatters your confidence completely, you're not going

02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:40.200
[Guest]: to be able to offer the best to the next patient, you know.

02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:45.640
[Guest]: So I think the probabilistic thinking probably helps in some ways in that situation, because

02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:48.500
[Guest]: I've seen doctors swing from one direction to the other also.

02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:52.320
[Guest]: You have one person who beats the odds and something really bad happens, and then you

02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:55.080
[Guest]: become extremely defensive after that.

02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:58.080
[Guest]: Sometimes it's because of litigation, sometimes it's just because of a conscience which can't

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:00.680
[Guest]: make peace with the fact that something like that happened.

02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:04.680
[Guest]: And if it serves to grow, great, you know, which is what it's all about, you know.

02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:06.520
[Guest]: On a daily basis, all of us are growing.

02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:10.240
[Guest]: I would be stupid to say that, you know, I've done everything right.

02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:15.120
[Guest]: All of us have made judgment errors, all of us have, you know, sometimes relied on our

02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:17.760
[Guest]: instinct when our instincts have failed us.

02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:23.480
[Guest]: And as long as we learn from them in a way that's not usually detrimental, you know.

02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:28.120
[Guest]: So let me give you an example, when we give drugs for tuberculosis, if you give it in

02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:33.160
[Guest]: a young individual, three out of a thousand individuals, the drugs will affect the liver.

02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:38.520
[Guest]: Now if that makes me start doing liver function tests on all the thousand to prevent that,

02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:42.840
[Guest]: to pick up those three early, firstly, there's no reason to believe that I would be able

02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:48.980
[Guest]: to pick them up early, you know, because symptoms manifest when the liver doesn't work properly,

02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:51.720
[Guest]: and maybe the symptoms come before you can pick it up early.

02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:58.100
[Guest]: But if I, you know, have one patient out of a thousand get a bad liver, get a bad episode

02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:02.920
[Guest]: of hepatitis, get admitted, for example, and it completely shakes up my belief system,

02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:06.760
[Guest]: and then I start doing liver function tests on every single patient who comes, I don't

02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:07.760
[Guest]: think that's fair as well.

02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:12.760
[Guest]: You know, I mean, it's okay to feel that something bad should not have happened.

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:16.680
[Guest]: But you also know that that was within the probability that's being described the world

02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:17.800
[Guest]: over.

02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:20.480
[Guest]: You need to accept that that's what happened.

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:23.200
[Guest]: Maybe your education skills need to get better.

02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:25.520
[Guest]: Maybe the patient came in too late.

02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:29.440
[Guest]: Maybe the patient could have come a day before when they started noticing symptoms rather

02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:30.800
[Guest]: than wait.

02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:34.880
[Guest]: So it's great to audit what went wrong.

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:39.240
[Guest]: It's great to look back and try and figure out what went wrong, and how can we improve

02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:40.240
[Guest]: on things.

02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:44.800
[Guest]: But that balance of not, therefore, you know, doing a U-turn and completely going the other

02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:50.960
[Guest]: way in terms of being overly being gung-ho about investigations, being very, very defensive.

02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:54.040
[Guest]: I think that's a challenging balance.

02:21:54.040 --> 02:22:00.480
[Guest]: That being said, I mean, it always shatters you when you lose someone unexpectedly.

02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:03.000
[Guest]: And that's the uncertainty that medicine is all about.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.940
[Guest]: You know, there are some individuals who you will lose on your watch with zero expectations

02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:10.840
[Guest]: of you losing them.

02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:15.280
[Guest]: Those tend to be rare events, but when they do happen, you have no clue in terms of, you

02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:17.760
[Guest]: know, was that going to happen anyways?

02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:20.480
[Guest]: Did it happen because of something that I did?

02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:22.160
[Guest]: Could I have done something better?

02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:27.040
[Guest]: Was I not serious enough in terms of, you know, investigating a little more, pushing

02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:28.040
[Guest]: a little harder?

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:30.960
[Guest]: Did the message not come out clearly?

02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:34.480
[Guest]: And that introspection is unfortunately part of the deal, you know.

02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:41.160
[Guest]: And, you know, fortunately, shockers of events which completely fall outside the probability

02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:44.320
[Guest]: of what you think are rare, you know, fortunately, they are rare.

02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:49.040
[Guest]: But when they do happen, and you know, that's the busier you get, the larger your base of

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:52.520
[Guest]: patients, such events do happen with an increasing frequency.

02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:56.680
[Guest]: So what would happen once in two years, maybe starts happening once in six months, but you

02:22:56.680 --> 02:22:59.320
[Guest]: definitely lose sleep when that happens.

02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:03.440
[Guest]: It shatters you, it completely disturbs you for a few days, and you never forget that.

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:06.720
[Guest]: So that you will never forget when you talk about, you know, your past experiences, you

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:12.000
[Guest]: will never forget a person who, who behaved in a way that you completely didn't expect.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned litigation a couple of times, like, is that something that's an issue in

02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:17.880
[Amit Varma]: India that you have to worry about litigation?

02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Are you in probabilistic terms, how likely are you to get sued and, you know, also just

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:27.960
[Amit Varma]: in general to deal with relatives of patients when things don't go right, like we've heard

02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:33.560
[Amit Varma]: of stories of shocking stories of doctors and nurses being beaten up when recently when

02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:35.560
[Amit Varma]: patients have died of COVID-19.

02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:41.760
[Amit Varma]: But in general, how big is the litigation issue and just dealing with relatives of patients?

02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:48.120
[Guest]: It is a big issue, not in terms of, you know, the volume of cases that get registered, but

02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:53.400
[Guest]: it's a big issue in terms of, even if one case gets registered, the way the system is

02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:59.040
[Guest]: designed is that, you know, you're almost guilty unless you prove your innocence.

02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:00.840
[Guest]: And that's very challenging.

02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:05.160
[Guest]: So most of us have gone through it once a couple of years or so.

02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:10.600
[Guest]: And when we do go through it, it's extremely biased against us is what most of us tend

02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:12.120
[Guest]: to agree on.

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:13.320
[Guest]: So let me give you an example.

02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:17.880
[Guest]: So in the city of Mumbai, for example, if somebody wants to file a case, they can simultaneously

02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:19.640
[Guest]: file it in three different forums.

02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:24.240
[Guest]: There's the consumer forum, there's law, and there's the medical council.

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:27.960
[Guest]: So you can simultaneously file the same case in all three.

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:31.960
[Guest]: And the doctor has to make appearances in all three simultaneously, you know.

02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:35.360
[Guest]: And it's not that the decision in one can influence the decision in the other.

02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:37.600
[Guest]: You can get three separate decisions.

02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:43.720
[Guest]: So once you go through something like this, it does make you a little defensive for sure.

02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:48.680
[Guest]: It does change the way in which you naturally treat patients.

02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:53.880
[Guest]: And I do understand that patient rights have to be protected at all costs.

02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:59.480
[Guest]: I do understand that doctors make mistakes and have to pay for it when they do make mistakes

02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:00.480
[Guest]: in some form.

02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:02.680
[Guest]: That's the only natural way to do things.

02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:06.560
[Guest]: We all have indemnity insurance to accept the fact that we will make mistakes no matter

02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:07.560
[Guest]: what.

02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:11.400
[Guest]: And therefore, the compensation needs to be covered by indemnity.

02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:14.560
[Guest]: But as long as the process is fair, I think good will come out of it.

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:19.320
[Guest]: As long as the process is skewed to such an extent that doctors start second-guessing

02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:25.400
[Guest]: every move that they make, it's going to go in the U.S. way, where everything is so defensive

02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:27.280
[Guest]: that the system will get expensive.

02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.320
[Guest]: It's the example I just gave you, right?

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:33.560
[Guest]: So if I want to make sure that nobody gets hepatitis, I'm going to just make a thousand

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:39.600
[Guest]: people do LFTs to kind of say that, you know, I covered my grounds, I covered my bases,

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:44.520
[Guest]: I did what I had to do, despite that this happened, okay, you know, I can't help it.

02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:45.920
[Guest]: And do it just from that perspective.

02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:47.960
[Guest]: Do it not because it's going to help my patient.

02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:52.360
[Guest]: Do it not because I genuinely believe it makes a difference, but do it only because on paper

02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:55.120
[Guest]: I have done it, you know, and that's protected me.

02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:56.760
[Guest]: So I really hope it doesn't go that way.

02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:02.240
[Guest]: But unfortunately, you know, there are indicators that it might be going that way.

02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:03.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's get back to COVID.

02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:07.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one of the very valid points that you made and which I kind of want to

02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:11.560
[Amit Varma]: underscore is that if someone is using medicine, the burden of proof is on that person.

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:15.640
[Amit Varma]: That you got to show that the medicine works and the reason, you know, that deserves underscoring

02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.720
[Amit Varma]: is that it's not that if a medicine doesn't work, it doesn't work.

02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:24.440
[Amit Varma]: Medicines have tons of side effects, like, you know, in the case of steroids, as we now

02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:29.560
[Amit Varma]: know, and as from what I recall, you were earlier than others in pointing out vociferously

02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:33.680
[Amit Varma]: that there's no point in giving steroids in the first week of infection and all because

02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:37.680
[Amit Varma]: people will get a fever and then they'll fight the fever and then they'll get better most

02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:41.800
[Amit Varma]: of the time when they don't get better when they deteriorate when there are oxygen issues.

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.200
[Amit Varma]: That's where steroids like dexamethasone and all can be useful.

02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:48.720
[Amit Varma]: The problem with giving steroids early on is that it will actually work in getting the

02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:52.080
[Amit Varma]: fever down, but it will also get the immune system down.

02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:56.360
[Amit Varma]: So COVID will actually hurt you more and it's in the second week where you could just completely

02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:01.520
[Amit Varma]: collapse and it's literally because of the medicine that was given to you.

02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:06.460
[Amit Varma]: So now what I'd like you to do for our listeners is take them through how you look at this

02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:09.100
[Amit Varma]: whole treatment cycle of COVID.

02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:10.100
[Amit Varma]: What is recommended?

02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:11.100
[Amit Varma]: What is not?

02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Like at a bare bones level, I know that in the first week, if you just have fever, you

02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:18.920
[Amit Varma]: got to monitor your oxygen and you got to take paracetamol and that's it, right?

02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:23.120
[Amit Varma]: So just kind of go through that kind of protocol for people who might be listening in and especially

02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:28.500
[Amit Varma]: people who are not in big cities, who don't have access to doctors and all of that.

02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:29.760
[Amit Varma]: How should they approach it?

02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:31.200
[Amit Varma]: What should they do?

02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:34.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, because people tend to panic, you know, you'll have an epidemic of sighing all

02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:36.160
[Guest]: over again.

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:40.520
[Guest]: Also I think the reassuring thing that all the listeners need to know is that we still

02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:44.680
[Guest]: believe that a majority of individuals get better with nothing, right?

02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:47.800
[Guest]: If you look at the recent study, in fact, from the US, which was the antibody cocktail

02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:52.220
[Guest]: study, they found a hospitalization rate in high risk individuals.

02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:57.360
[Guest]: So individuals who had at least one risk factor in the placebo arm of that study, it was about

02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:58.960
[Guest]: 3% of them who got hospitalized.

02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:01.600
[Guest]: So it's not even the traditional 15% that we talk about.

02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:03.360
[Guest]: It's possibly a lot lower.

02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:06.560
[Guest]: If you include the zero prevalence studies in India as well, I'm sure the figure that

02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:09.940
[Guest]: we arrive at would be somewhere around 3% of hospitalization.

02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:15.260
[Guest]: So 97 out of a hundred individuals will get better at home without anything being done.

02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:17.040
[Guest]: And I think that's very reassuring.

02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:21.760
[Guest]: Now what happens is the typical cycle of COVID is that the first week is where the virus

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:22.760
[Guest]: enters the body.

02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:26.000
[Guest]: The first week is where the virus multiplies for some time.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.200
[Guest]: The first week is where the body launches an immune response against the virus and that

02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:35.200
[Guest]: immune response, just by virtue of the fact that 97% people probably get better, suggests

02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:38.280
[Guest]: that that immune response does its job in most of the cases.

02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:42.160
[Guest]: Somehow antibodies are generated, they neutralize the virus.

02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:43.160
[Guest]: You could feel fatigued.

02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:44.160
[Guest]: You could feel tired.

02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:47.480
[Guest]: You could feel low energy for some time, but by and large, your life will move on.

02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:51.360
[Guest]: By and large, you will return to baseline in a month or so.

02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:54.540
[Guest]: Now in that first week, what are the things that have been shown to work?

02:28:54.540 --> 02:29:00.760
[Guest]: One of the things that may have a role is an inhaler of steroids, but steroids at a

02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:06.680
[Guest]: very low dose inhaled directly into the lungs in some way modulates the inflammation, helps

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:08.240
[Guest]: in some way.

02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:11.200
[Guest]: And there are a couple of small studies which have shown that it may work.

02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:16.160
[Guest]: Again, the caveat is that these are small studies, maybe down the road that we may realize

02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:20.080
[Guest]: that they aren't necessarily wonder drugs or great drugs.

02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:21.700
[Guest]: Maybe it's a small role.

02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:23.840
[Guest]: That being said, inhalers are extremely safe.

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:28.120
[Guest]: So the safety profile of inhalers has been established for a long, long time now at the

02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:31.120
[Guest]: doses that's being recommended for COVID for a short period.

02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:34.000
[Guest]: Again, we don't anticipate any major side effects.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.520
[Guest]: So the inhalers work in the first week, especially if you have a cough, especially if you have

02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:39.360
[Guest]: lower respiratory symptoms.

02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:42.320
[Guest]: The other thing that works in the first week is the antibody cocktail.

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:45.260
[Guest]: So the antibody cocktail is basically preformed antibodies.

02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:51.240
[Guest]: So normally what your body would do, generate an immune response that one to two or one

02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:57.080
[Guest]: to 3% of individuals in whom that immune response doesn't work for some reason, they might benefit

02:29:57.080 --> 02:30:01.160
[Guest]: with boosting their immune response with an antibody cocktail injected into them.

02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:04.880
[Guest]: Now this works when given within the first seven days of symptoms.

02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:06.780
[Guest]: So it has to be given early.

02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:09.100
[Guest]: It is recommended in individuals who have risk factors.

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:13.400
[Guest]: So it's not recommended in individuals who otherwise also are likely to do well.

02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:17.960
[Guest]: So if you have heart disease, if you are elderly, if you have underlying kidney disease, if

02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:23.080
[Guest]: you are immunosuppressed in some ways, if you are obese, if you have diabetes, these

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:26.480
[Guest]: are the risk factors in whom you could consider the antibody cocktail.

02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:27.480
[Guest]: Of course, it's very expensive.

02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:31.480
[Guest]: It costs about 60,000 rupees for a dose, but it may have a role.

02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.280
[Guest]: So that's what works in the first week.

02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:37.160
[Guest]: Now by the end of the first week, majority of individuals would have recovered.

02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:41.400
[Guest]: The fever would have settled, the cough would start getting a little better, their oxygen

02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:44.480
[Guest]: levels would be rock solid throughout, they would never have dropped.

02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:46.920
[Guest]: And these are individuals who don't need to do anything at this point.

02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:50.200
[Guest]: You know, if the cough has settled, they stop the inhaler as well.

02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:53.960
[Guest]: In this small fraction, a small proportion of individuals at the end of the second week,

02:30:53.960 --> 02:30:56.220
[Guest]: what happens is a hyperimmune response.

02:30:56.220 --> 02:31:00.280
[Guest]: So the body's immunity has kicked in, but it's overzealous for some reason.

02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:01.280
[Guest]: It's overenthusiastic.

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:02.700
[Guest]: It does too much.

02:31:02.700 --> 02:31:06.760
[Guest]: And that hyperimmune response causes the oxygen levels to go low.

02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:10.000
[Guest]: That causes a person to get breathless, the cough to get worse.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.920
[Guest]: This is the stage at which problems occur.

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:14.900
[Guest]: This is a stage at which individuals often get hospitalized.

02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:18.320
[Guest]: If your oxygen levels are low, this is where the steroids work.

02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:23.280
[Guest]: So the oxygen levels low mean that your lung is full of immune cells.

02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.760
[Guest]: They could be white blood cells, they could be antibodies.

02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:29.900
[Guest]: This whole cytokine storm that we talk about, there are lots of immune cells which are trying

02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:32.720
[Guest]: to fix the lung, but are actually doing harm.

02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:34.720
[Guest]: And they are suppressed with the use of corticosteroids.

02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:40.120
[Guest]: So steroids suppress your immunity at this point where the immune response is too much.

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:43.880
[Guest]: If you do the same in the first week, when your body's natural immune response is trying

02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:48.320
[Guest]: to fight it, those same steroids will suppress that natural immune response and leave you

02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:50.120
[Guest]: completely exposed to the virus.

02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:54.160
[Guest]: So the virus has an unopposed position where it can multiply.

02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:55.160
[Guest]: There's no natural immunity.

02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:57.000
[Guest]: The steroids have suppressed that.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.720
[Guest]: Sugars also go up with steroids.

02:31:58.720 --> 02:32:01.200
[Guest]: So it's a great environment for the virus to proliferate.

02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:04.320
[Guest]: At the end of the first week, very often there's no virus left in the body or there's minuscule

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:05.320
[Guest]: virus.

02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:08.280
[Guest]: So therefore it's safe to use steroids to suppress the immune response.

02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:10.080
[Guest]: Now if you deteriorate further.

02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:15.600
[Guest]: So if despite giving you steroids for about one to two days, there are certain markers

02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:16.600
[Guest]: which also help.

02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:21.560
[Guest]: If your CRP is above 75, you might be a candidate for a drug like tocilizumab because that's

02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:23.520
[Guest]: a drug which supplements the use of steroids.

02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:26.680
[Guest]: It tries to suppress your immunity even further.

02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:28.920
[Guest]: Some studies are also looking at higher doses of steroids.

02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:32.600
[Guest]: So the doses of steroids which are currently recommended are six milligrams of dexamethasone

02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:33.880
[Guest]: once a day.

02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:37.760
[Guest]: But there are some studies which suggest that if despite the dexa you're deteriorating,

02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:39.560
[Guest]: 12 milligrams could be attempted.

02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:43.840
[Guest]: You can double the dose of steroids, especially if you don't have access to tocilizumab or

02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:46.560
[Guest]: you know, again, it's a very expensive drug.

02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:47.720
[Guest]: Oxygen is life saving.

02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:51.420
[Guest]: If your oxygen levels are low at this stage, you know, being on oxygen helps.

02:32:51.420 --> 02:32:55.560
[Guest]: Sleeping prone really helps because it helps improve oxygenation.

02:32:55.560 --> 02:33:00.640
[Guest]: Being on either non-invasive ventilator or high flow nasal devices also help in, you

02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:04.480
[Guest]: know, helping your lungs recover, giving you adequate oxygen while your lungs are on the

02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:06.160
[Guest]: pathway to recovery.

02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:10.160
[Guest]: And if things still don't recover at this point, then you get on to ventilation, then

02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:14.200
[Guest]: you get on to whatever salvage modalities are feasible.

02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:15.200
[Amit Varma]: So that's fascinating.

02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:18.840
[Amit Varma]: And the picture emerging here is that a lot of these people, it's not the virus that is

02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:20.440
[Amit Varma]: killing them directly.

02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:24.920
[Amit Varma]: The virus is setting off an immune response, which is more or less eliminating the virus

02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:28.440
[Amit Varma]: by the end of the first week or reducing it substantially.

02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:32.400
[Amit Varma]: And then the cytokine storm really kicks in or other, you know, the overactivity of the

02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:37.040
[Amit Varma]: immune system is what really gets you and it's a downward spiral from there unless all

02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:38.280
[Amit Varma]: of these treatments come in.

02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:42.080
[Amit Varma]: And of course, when you have oxygen shortages, then it's basically the system killing you

02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:45.120
[Amit Varma]: because otherwise those people wouldn't have died.

02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:47.720
[Amit Varma]: All incredibly fascinating.

02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:51.680
[Amit Varma]: So you know, we are almost at the end of the time that you had allotted me.

02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:56.280
[Amit Varma]: And of all my guests, I would feel incredibly guilty about taking too much more of your

02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:57.280
[Amit Varma]: time.

02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:01.360
[Amit Varma]: So just a couple of questions, the one on COVID and then one back to medicine in general.

02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:06.320
[Amit Varma]: And the COVID question is that you guys have just managed to get the official guidelines

02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:11.200
[Amit Varma]: of the government actually changed to reflect what you feel the treatment protocol should

02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:13.080
[Amit Varma]: be, which was earlier not the case.

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:17.160
[Amit Varma]: Earlier, the case was science would find something and then the, you know, the bureaucracy would

02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:20.200
[Amit Varma]: catch up later, the treatment protocols would catch up later.

02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:24.580
[Amit Varma]: But now hearteningly, one is finding that even the official guidelines are along these

02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:29.400
[Amit Varma]: lines that don't do over treatment, don't use all these random plasma ivermectin and

02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:30.840
[Amit Varma]: all that which don't work.

02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:35.860
[Amit Varma]: But instead, this is a protocol to follow, which is kind of exactly what you laid out.

02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:41.540
[Amit Varma]: So how easy or hard is it to sort of work with these kinds of authorities where bureaucracy

02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:46.520
[Amit Varma]: is an issue, where, again, the cover my ass incentive may get in the way where they might

02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:50.480
[Amit Varma]: be wary of, you know, not recommending something, what if something happens, you know, why not

02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:52.560
[Amit Varma]: just put all the medicines out there?

02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:58.080
[Amit Varma]: So what is that process like of dealing with government of dealing with authorities like

02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:02.840
[Amit Varma]: that, because in some capacities, even you have given at least informal advice, right?

02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:03.840
[Guest]: Right.

02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:07.160
[Guest]: So I cannot take any credit for the change in the guidelines.

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:11.120
[Guest]: Unfortunately, we don't know who the authors were also because, you know, I think all of

02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:15.320
[Guest]: us want to pat their backs and all of us want to say thank you, but we don't really know

02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:16.520
[Guest]: as of now who to thank.

02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:19.480
[Guest]: But you know, that being said, it's a great move forward.

02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:24.520
[Guest]: The process, I wouldn't know what was the process which actually led to the final change

02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:25.840
[Guest]: in policy.

02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:31.280
[Guest]: But I think all of us, you know, in whatever capacity possible have been trying to push

02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:32.880
[Guest]: people towards rational cures.

02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:36.760
[Guest]: I think some of it also is a consequence of bad outcomes happening.

02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:41.240
[Guest]: So I think the mucormycosis pandemic sensitized a lot of people to the fact that steroids

02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:47.060
[Guest]: were being possibly used for prolonged periods of times, possibly being used inappropriately.

02:35:47.060 --> 02:35:48.120
[Guest]: And that was an eye opener.

02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:52.700
[Guest]: So I think it took a second pandemic of the mucormycosis to realize the inappropriateness

02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:53.700
[Guest]: of steroids.

02:35:53.700 --> 02:35:59.400
[Guest]: Now, it's unfortunate that that's how it happened, but you know, in this case, I think that was

02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:03.240
[Guest]: a nudge towards shifting to evidence-based medicine as well.

02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:09.560
[Guest]: I think the rushes for remdesivir, the black marketeering that people saw for remdesivir

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:13.680
[Guest]: also was a nudge in the right direction in terms of people realizing that it wasn't just

02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:14.720
[Guest]: a science problem.

02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:20.120
[Guest]: The science problem led to actually bigger problems in terms of this belief that it was

02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:24.680
[Guest]: life-saving, this exploitation of individuals who are at their most vulnerable.

02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:27.280
[Guest]: And I think that was an eye opener as well.

02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:31.960
[Guest]: Plasma, I think, you know, it was, you know, finally, after saying it over and over again

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:35.600
[Guest]: in different forums, I think different, you know, plasma was actually unfortunate also

02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:39.360
[Guest]: because India, that was one great trial which came out of India, right?

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.040
[Guest]: In the midst of this pandemic, we still managed to do one good trial, which was PLACID, which

02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:44.280
[Guest]: was related to plasma.

02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:47.480
[Guest]: We proved that it didn't work and we still didn't take it off our guidelines.

02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:49.080
[Guest]: So that was unfortunate in a way.

02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:52.400
[Guest]: But I think people pointed it out over and over again, you know, after recovery published

02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:55.600
[Guest]: their data from PLACID, I think that changed as well.

02:36:55.600 --> 02:37:02.760
[Guest]: It's not been easy, but I think there's a network of individuals who have the ability

02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:07.840
[Guest]: to influence the right people, the people on committees, the people on guideline committees,

02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:11.640
[Guest]: the people in positions of creating those guidelines.

02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:16.960
[Guest]: And I think, you know, the gradual soft influence that everyone had around possibly nudged them

02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:18.360
[Guest]: in the right direction.

02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:20.880
[Guest]: So I wouldn't know the exact process in which it changed.

02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:23.840
[Guest]: But I think it's a great, great move that it changed.

02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:30.080
[Guest]: And let's hope that that whatever thought processes opened up these doors would still

02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:32.800
[Guest]: stay in place for future updating of the evidence.

02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:36.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's a fantastic last point that you don't just want it to be this one-off where

02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:40.300
[Amit Varma]: they did the right thing and, you know, whatever, but you want those processes to remain.

02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:43.080
[Amit Varma]: So it is always science based and evidence based.

02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:47.240
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, you know, in an earlier episode, I mentioned about remdesivir being slightly

02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:51.440
[Amit Varma]: dubious and one doctor actually wrote into me, I don't remember if he wrote to me or

02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:55.440
[Amit Varma]: he put a Twitter comment, but he basically said that, why are you spreading wrong information?

02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:59.840
[Amit Varma]: I have used it on my patients, it works, to which I, you know, if someone like that is

02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:03.040
[Amit Varma]: listening to this, I would just say, go back to the start of the episode and listen to

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.840
[Amit Varma]: what we said about regression to the mean.

02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:10.160
[Amit Varma]: And also one should not quickly, you know, ascribe causation, maybe it is something,

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:12.240
[Amit Varma]: some other medicine that actually helped.

02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:14.360
[Amit Varma]: So we never know counterfactuals there.

02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:19.720
[Amit Varma]: So my final question is this, and it's a broad question about medicine in general, which

02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:24.840
[Amit Varma]: is, so when we look back to the 19th century, we know the state of medicine was so dismal,

02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:28.020
[Amit Varma]: and we think of today and we say, oh, we have advanced so much.

02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:32.520
[Amit Varma]: But it is another fallacy that humans tend to commit, they think that where they are

02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:34.960
[Amit Varma]: now is a peak of human progress.

02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:38.840
[Amit Varma]: And the truth is that 100 years later, when we look at the state of medicine today, we

02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:42.840
[Amit Varma]: are going to say, oh my God, what primitive people, what are they even doing?

02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:43.840
[Amit Varma]: Right?

02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.080
[Amit Varma]: So I find that we are at an exciting time, perhaps even an inflection point for medicine.

02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:50.120
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sorry, if this is naive, please correct me.

02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:52.400
[Amit Varma]: But I say this completely as an outsider.

02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:57.120
[Amit Varma]: We're just looking at, for example, what our understanding of genetics and the genome,

02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:01.040
[Amit Varma]: the insights that we've gotten from that, or what artificial intelligence is doing.

02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:03.720
[Amit Varma]: Eric Topol has a great book, Deep Medicine about that.

02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:06.120
[Amit Varma]: It strikes me that there's a lot to be excited about the future.

02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:10.320
[Amit Varma]: Now, you are, of course, on the cutting edge of all of this in terms of reading up on it

02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:12.220
[Amit Varma]: and understanding it and all of that.

02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:14.480
[Amit Varma]: So looking ahead, what is the future of medicine?

02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:18.240
[Amit Varma]: Like, what do you think 20 years later, you will be doing differently?

02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:20.520
[Amit Varma]: What are the ways in which your life will be better?

02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:24.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, some people speak about an mRNA vaccine for cancer and all that.

02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:25.040
[Amit Varma]: That would be really nice.

02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:26.080
[Amit Varma]: Please bring it on.

02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And hopefully sleeping enough will prevent Alzheimer's for those of us who sleep enough.

02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:35.320
[Amit Varma]: But apart from these frivolous asides, how different will the future of medicine actually

02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:36.320
[Amit Varma]: look?

02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:40.200
[Amit Varma]: And another context in which I kind of bring that up is that in India, most people don't

02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:42.040
[Amit Varma]: have the privilege to go to a doctor.

02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:46.360
[Amit Varma]: The vast majority of India is completely underserved or served by quacks.

02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:51.040
[Amit Varma]: And the vast majority of doctors also will not know treatment protocol for basic things,

02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:53.800
[Amit Varma]: as I discussed in my episode with Karthik Muralidharan.

02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:58.840
[Amit Varma]: So actually, what most Indians do is that they just get by in one jugaadu way or the

02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:00.380
[Amit Varma]: other for minor things.

02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:04.520
[Amit Varma]: And it is only when something major happens that they actually land up at a hospital and

02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:05.520
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:06.600
[Amit Varma]: So that is their medicine.

02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Is there hope for them?

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:12.960
[Amit Varma]: Is there hope for, say, AI and all of that to help empower them with information and

02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:16.760
[Amit Varma]: knowledge and, you know, those kind of resources?

02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:20.640
[Guest]: Some of the changes are, you know, just to allude to what we've already spoken about.

02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:23.160
[Guest]: So something like sleep apnea, for example, right?

02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:26.680
[Guest]: So if you see 20 years ago, so that's, you know, roughly within this, you know, I was

02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:29.360
[Guest]: I was in MBBS 20 years ago.

02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:33.240
[Guest]: The machine used to be about 10 kilos in terms of weight.

02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:37.680
[Guest]: It used to be really bulky, really uncomfortable masks that people couldn't wear.

02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:39.600
[Guest]: Almost everybody was cribbing and complaining.

02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:41.280
[Guest]: You look at where we are today, right?

02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:44.460
[Guest]: It's a 400 gram machine, which is now currently available.

02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:48.360
[Guest]: You get a download, which clearly tells you, you know, what was the level of obstruction

02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:49.720
[Guest]: before, what it is today.

02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:53.680
[Guest]: There is feedback in terms of whether there's a leak, whether you want to change those settings,

02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:55.280
[Guest]: how you want to manage things.

02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:59.440
[Guest]: So just in terms of, you know, the sheer information that's currently available to us to tweak

02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:03.920
[Guest]: things, to improve comfort, to improve patient adherence, all this has improved within a

02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:06.200
[Guest]: span of like less than 20 years or so.

02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:10.440
[Guest]: So tuberculosis, for example, another disease where once upon a time, you know, when the

02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:15.800
[Guest]: MDR epidemic or the multi-drug resistant TB epidemic began, we would do cultures.

02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:18.200
[Guest]: The cultures would take about six to eight weeks to grow.

02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:22.000
[Guest]: Then we would do drug susceptibility tests, which would tell us what is sensitive, what

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.320
[Guest]: is not sensitive.

02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:27.400
[Guest]: Now we have cartridge based tests, which within one and a half hour tell us whether you have

02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:28.960
[Guest]: MDR TB or not.

02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:34.960
[Guest]: So there's been a lot of progress, which we've already experienced in the past 15 to 20 years.

02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:37.080
[Guest]: Unfortunately, the point that you make is very valid.

02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:44.120
[Guest]: So progress at the cutting edge does not necessarily percolate down to progress for the vast majority.

02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:48.660
[Guest]: However, I mean, something like telemedicine, for example, has the potential of reaching

02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:50.480
[Guest]: people in remoter areas.

02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:54.040
[Guest]: I think COVID has normalized telemedicine to a certain extent.

02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:57.960
[Guest]: So I work with IIT and we've created this digital stethoscope, for example, which when

02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:02.240
[Guest]: given to a primary health care center, the person can apply it to a person's chest and

02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:06.400
[Guest]: I can listen to the sounds via Bluetooth via an app somewhere else in the country.

02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:09.880
[Guest]: So I can literally auscultate a patient I'm not seeing.

02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:14.680
[Guest]: These are potential things that can make a difference, but you know, it's not only technology,

02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:16.520
[Guest]: it's also the human skill that needs to develop.

02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:20.440
[Guest]: If we realize, you know, you can give people thousands of ventilators, but you know, even

02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:25.160
[Guest]: at an institute like mine, it takes a certain level of skill to use a ventilator.

02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:27.080
[Guest]: And I cannot claim to have complete expertise.

02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:31.400
[Guest]: I probably have 50% expertise, you know, because I'm not an intensivist, it's the intensivist

02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:34.920
[Guest]: at my hospital who really knows how to handle a ventilator.

02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:40.040
[Guest]: So to assume that somebody who's not even at a tertiary care institute in a smaller

02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:44.320
[Guest]: center would just be given a ventilator and the person would be able to handle the ventilator

02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:45.880
[Guest]: is not necessarily true.

02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:51.280
[Guest]: So I think the improvements in terms of technology has to go in parallel with the improvements

02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:55.360
[Guest]: in terms of human expertise as well to use those measures.

02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:59.160
[Guest]: You know, when you talk about molecular genetics, when you talk about phenotyping individuals,

02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:03.200
[Guest]: so for sleep apnea, there's a potential of a new drug which can cure sleep apnea in a

02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:04.720
[Guest]: certain subset of individuals.

02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:09.000
[Guest]: So you know, even a CPAP might look bulky, even the current CPAP might look bulky and

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.520
[Guest]: redundant 20 years from now, if we have a pill that's going to fix it, right?

02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:17.120
[Guest]: But that level of what we call individualized medicine, personalized medicine, that level

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:23.600
[Guest]: of phenotyping to try and figure out who fits into which basket is going to be expensive.

02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:26.360
[Guest]: It's going to be difficult to interpret, difficult to manage.

02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:32.640
[Guest]: So we struggle with letting evidence-based medicine for a disease that has basically

02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:38.240
[Guest]: five drugs or six drugs, if we struggle with that percolating, then imagine trying to communicate

02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:45.080
[Guest]: the sophistication that you get from a whole genome output and trying to explain the nuances

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:46.080
[Guest]: to anybody.

02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:50.520
[Guest]: I'm not looking down on somebody or I'm not talking about some, you know, me being superior

02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:54.560
[Guest]: to somebody else, but you know, we are going to be as illiterate about things like that

02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:55.560
[Guest]: as anybody else.

02:43:55.560 --> 02:44:00.160
[Guest]: And to constantly be able to update yourself and to then be able to make that reach the

02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:03.640
[Guest]: lowest rung of society, I think that's going to be a big challenge.

02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:08.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, these are very wise words in the sense that, you know, I am as optimistic

02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:13.080
[Amit Varma]: as you that science will keep marching on forward, but the state and the society also

02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:15.760
[Amit Varma]: have to keep up and advance similarly.

02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:19.780
[Amit Varma]: And what I would also point out is that many of these treatments that will come up from

02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:23.960
[Amit Varma]: understanding the genome better or using the insights of AI are something that privileged

02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:26.400
[Amit Varma]: people like us can access really easily.

02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:27.760
[Amit Varma]: But that is not the core problem.

02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:32.080
[Amit Varma]: The core problem is something else and the core problem is just getting it out there.

02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:36.440
[Amit Varma]: And especially in India, with the state of both our state and our society, it's worrying,

02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:39.560
[Amit Varma]: but hopefully science will empower us and we'll get the job done.

02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:43.920
[Amit Varma]: Lance, I'm so privileged and lucky to have three hours of your time of all people to
