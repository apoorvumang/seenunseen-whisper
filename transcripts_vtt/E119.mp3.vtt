[Unknown]: IVM

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Before you listen to this episode of the scene in the unseen I have a recommendation for you

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Do check out pulya bazi hosted by Saurabh Chandra and Pranay Koteswane two really good friends of mine

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.040
[Amit Varma]: Kick-ass podcast in Hindi. It's amazing

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.640
[Amit Varma]: One of the themes of the last few episodes of the scene in the unseen is how hindsight makes the past seem inevitable

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.360
[Amit Varma]: It isn't always like that

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.200
[Amit Varma]: Sitting here in 2019. It's obvious that the Narendra Modi government has failed at so many different levels

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.080
[Amit Varma]: But back in 2014

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.240
[Amit Varma]: There were many who were hopeful that this government would make important reforms and take the country forward

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Among those who felt this hope in fact was a guest of my episode today

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:51.120
[Amit Varma]: Who was then and is now a spokesperson for the Congress Party the BJP's manifesto in 2014 had much that was welcome

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.560
[Amit Varma]: And some of those seems in fact have carried forward to the Congress manifesto of 2019

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.000
[Amit Varma]: unfortunately for India much of that was just words

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.680
[Amit Varma]: Modi wasted a great opportunity to take our country ahead and no matter which party you support that has to count as a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
[Unknown]: great disappointment

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.720
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen our weekly podcast on economics politics and behavioral science, please. Welcome your host

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.080
[Amit Varma]: Amit Varma welcome to the scene in the unseen my guest for today is a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.280
[Amit Varma]: Economist Salman soz who is a spokesperson for the Congress Party and has just released a book called the great disappointment

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.040
[Amit Varma]: The book is about the economics of Narendra Modi's five-year term and given that it is written by a member of the opposition party

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.960
[Amit Varma]: I expected it to be a partisan hit job far from it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.800
[Amit Varma]: Salman clearly wrote the book with his economist hat on even though he's quite forthright about where his loyalties lie

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.080
[Amit Varma]: His account in the book is surprisingly balanced and has personal touches that I found refreshing

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.640
[Amit Varma]: for example

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.040
[Amit Varma]: He writes that he liked much that was in the BJP manifesto of 2014 and that he was hopeful that Modi would fulfill some of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.440
[Amit Varma]: His promises. In fact, his book is called the great disappointment

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.200
[Amit Varma]: Because Modi did not fulfill those promises when I wrote to Salman to invite him for the show

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.280
[Amit Varma]: I told him that I wanted to talk about more than just what was in the book many of the topics he covers like

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.720
[Amit Varma]: Demonetization and GST have already been covered in detail in the scene and the unseen over multiple episodes

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.920
[Amit Varma]: I wanted him to go beyond the economics of Modi's term and I also wanted to ask him tough questions about the Congress Party itself

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.160
[Amit Varma]: Salman's response to this request can be summed up in three words

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Ask me anything and indeed he gamely took on everything. I threw at him. He told me what the UPA did wrong

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.200
[Amit Varma]: He explained what Modi got right?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.480
[Amit Varma]: He praised the watch by government and he even took on an awkward question about the dynastic nature of the Congress Party leadership

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.680
[Amit Varma]: Whether his answers convinced you or not is a different matter

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.720
[Amit Varma]: but I was enormously impressed at the sincerity and the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Intellectual honesty and the fact that a leader from a major political party would open himself up to difficult questions in this manner

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.560
[Amit Varma]: Can you imagine anyone from a current BJP leadership agreeing to do this?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.520
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to a conversation though a quick commercial break

[Amit Varma]: I want to recommend today is by one of my heroes a 19th century French writer Frederick Barcia

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.640
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the title of this podcast is seen in the unseen comes from an essay that he wrote called that which is seen and that

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.080
[Amit Varma]: Which is not seen the book. I'm recommending though is a masterpiece

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.720
[Unknown]: Salman welcome to the scene in the unseen. Thank you so much. I mean, thank you for having me

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Salman I really enjoyed reading your book the great disappointment which did not live up to his title in the sense

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.040
[Amit Varma]: It wasn't a great disappointment for me

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Before we kind of get to the book tell me a little bit about you know your career as an economist and

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.360
[Guest]: all the journeys you made so far. Well, you know, I went for higher studies to the US and

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.160
[Guest]: You know realized that I enjoyed policy work and didn't really want to get into the PhD stream

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.400
[Guest]: You know going to academics and all that

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.840
[Guest]: So the World Bank was always one of those things that my father used to tell me about you talk about the World Bank

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.920
[Guest]: The IMF and GATT those days we had the GATT not the WTO

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.040
[Guest]: So he always thought of me as an international civil servant and you know, I pursued that

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.440
[Guest]: And somehow landed up at the World Bank

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.480
[Guest]: Passed around my resume quite a bit and then you know started doing in fact

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.480
[Guest]: my first assignment at the World Bank was about evaluation and the importance of results in

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160
[Guest]: in development work and

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.280
[Guest]: After all these years now I feel that there's a lot more emphasis on

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.920
[Guest]: What the outcomes and impacts of programs are as opposed to just the inputs because we used to focus so much on inputs earlier

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.120
[Guest]: So in the World Bank, I've you know done a lot of different work. I worked on

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.600
[Guest]: Strategic issues I worked on actually I worked on natural disasters

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.400
[Guest]: And how to manage their impacts and I've actually led teams in Europe and Central Asia

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.440
[Guest]: I worked on you know forming international partnerships

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.480
[Guest]: so a lot of different stuff, but then you know eventually when I moved to India in

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.720
[Guest]: 2011 I quit the World Bank because I thought that you know, there are plenty of people with my kind of

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.080
[Guest]: Background in the US and I wanted to kind of do more work in Kashmir and in and in India

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.080
[Guest]: I thought this international exposure to policy work would probably help there

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.360
[Guest]: So, you know I took you know, in some ways I kind of took that kind of

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.360
[Guest]: Lens and went moved to India and of course the reality on the ground is very different from what you see from Washington

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.440
[Guest]: So it was very very very interesting experience, but I actually started delving more into

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.360
[Guest]: India's political economy, which I found to be very interesting. And of course India's challenges are you know immense?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.080
[Guest]: And so, you know, I think I think that's how I can just

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.560
[Guest]: Meandered around and ultimately ended up

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:57.360
[Guest]: Working on India writing about the Indian economy and eventually writing this book and now you're part of the Congress and you're one of the

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.040
[Amit Varma]: spokespeople and you know one thing that sort of I wonder is you know

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.080
[Amit Varma]: Harry Truman once spoke about how he would like 100 economists because economists keep saying well on the one hand this and

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.760
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so as an economist, obviously you're trained to look at every side of an issue to

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.440
[Amit Varma]: Examine all the nuances and so on but in politics, especially I would imagine if you're the spokesman of a party

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes you have to stick to a simple narrative

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.920
[Amit Varma]: You can't do on the one hand this on the other hand that how do you reconcile those different challenges?

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Well, yeah, I think that is a significant challenge for people

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.440
[Guest]: Especially who come with you know with my background

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.200
[Guest]: But you know, I mean first I come from

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.880
[Guest]: You know a family where politics was already kind of ingrained in us. My father has been a politician for decades

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.920
[Guest]: He was a member of Parliament for many many terms and also minister. So I think I've seen it up close

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.720
[Guest]: but when you join a political party, which I did in

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.680
[Guest]: 2013 or so formally and then you're asked to represent the party and its views

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.000
[Guest]: Of course, you do get kind of taken in by the political party

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.200
[Guest]: you can just take it into this one way kind of

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.800
[Guest]: communication so to speak but I think

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.160
[Guest]: the way I dealt with this was basically stick to facts as much as possible and

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.360
[Guest]: If so, I can have focused on data

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.680
[Guest]: so my big thing was I'll try and use data to make my argument and I remember in the

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.880
[Guest]: 2014 in the run-up to the 2014 election I

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.920
[Guest]: I used to you know face a barrage of questions on the economy on inflation

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.280
[Guest]: Fiscal deficits and this thing and that thing and what I would rely on is, you know

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.680
[Guest]: UPA's growth story its poverty reduction story and of course they have a problem as well

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.120
[Guest]: But you know in development you have problems and it there's no there is no kind of clean development model. It's pretty you know

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.320
[Guest]: You have to roll up your sleeves. You have to go

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:06.680
[Guest]: Knee-deep into mud and it's you know, sometimes you have progress sometimes you regress, but that's what economic development is

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.240
[Guest]: so I think I kept that as my kind of

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.120
[Guest]: Compass so to speak so I would not just spew the party line

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:21.000
[Guest]: I would actually try to kind of back my assertions with data. So in that sense I created a space for myself

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.960
[Guest]: Which I thought was available and and that's how I did it

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:32.000
[Guest]: It's not easy, of course, because you know, you know and and writing this book actually, you know

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.280
[Guest]: It's not been that simple because I didn't want this to become

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:41.600
[Guest]: Oh, there's a Congress guy and he's written a book about Modi and against Modi. So I didn't want it to be like that

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.840
[Guest]: I've tried my best actually to be as objective as possible

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.400
[Guest]: I've given the government credit wherever I could but for the most part, you know

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:55.180
[Guest]: I really feel the title reflects what I see about this government even though you disagree

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.120
[Guest]: In fact others have told me that they don't agree with the title but for different reasons

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.720
[Amit Varma]: No, no

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.200
[Amit Varma]: when I I was actually kidding what I meant was that reading the book was not a disappointment for me as

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Far as Modi's term is I think calling it a disappointment is an understatement

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and and I think you're absolutely right in the sense that one of the things that surprised me when I was reading the

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.000
[Amit Varma]: book is that there are moments when you're critical of the UPA especially

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.480
[Amit Varma]: UPA too and there are moments where you give credit where credit is due to Modi and and we'll come to all of that but

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.840
[Amit Varma]: Before we sort of come to the five-year period of 2014 to 2019 which the book is about

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.480
[Amit Varma]: I'd like you to also

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Set a sort of context for me

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:43.860
[Amit Varma]: In terms of what has happened in the Indian economy before that and if I can ask you one broad question that sitting in 2014

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:51.440
[Amit Varma]: What are the broad lessons that policymakers could have taken from all those decades of governance of independence India before that?

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.700
[Guest]: Well, you know the context for the book is you know to my mind the context for the book is twofold

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.300
[Guest]: one is

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:06.140
[Guest]: You know on a lighter note and that is the commissioning agent at penguin had been after my life for two years

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.860
[Guest]: She'd seen my articles and newspapers and all that

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.340
[Guest]: She felt that I could write something and initially we thought we'd write about Kashmir

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.060
[Guest]: then I said no, I know the economy reasonably well and

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.380
[Guest]: Ultimately, you know and with the elections approaching

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.300
[Guest]: She said wouldn't you want to do an assessment of how the government is done? And it was a compelling argument

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.620
[Guest]: And I said, okay. Yeah, that makes sense to me. I've done a three-year, you know

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.660
[Guest]: Modinomics at three earlier and then I said, okay, maybe I can just build on that

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:39.780
[Guest]: But the more important context for this book is and then I'll get to the lessons what I think that were missed

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:46.180
[Guest]: Was this this slogan this kind of a statement by candidate Modi that he would do in 60

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.740
[Guest]: Months what others have not done in 60 years

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.500
[Guest]: That really stuck with me, you know because I was in the middle of the campaign

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:59.620
[Guest]: I would go on TV all the time and that particular statement was it really kind of drew people in but I knew

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.860
[Guest]: From an economic development perspective how unfair it was to all those who had come before him

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.740
[Guest]: So I think that is how I say I can if that gave me the kind of passion to write

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.460
[Guest]: I think for me that was the most important thing. In fact in this book

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.100
[Guest]: I constantly talk about that and I wanted to see that's why I wrote inheritance

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:24.460
[Guest]: The first part of this book is about inheritance. What did different prime ministers receive as inheritance?

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.940
[Guest]: I talked about Nehru and the six million refugees

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.340
[Guest]: Which was the biggest refugee crisis outside of World War two and also a lack of food

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:37.580
[Guest]: I mean those were the big challenges Nehru faced and then I kind of list what other prime ministers

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:44.300
[Guest]: Faced and all that and then so in some sense that is the context. I mean being unfair to predecessors

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:50.900
[Guest]: Belittling India's achievements and then trying to say that you would do something that I knew to be impossible

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.700
[Guest]: but you know, I think if you

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.460
[Guest]: If you ask most people in India

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:02.540
[Guest]: They'll say the demonetization and GST were the big big issues that come to mind from an economic management perspective

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:08.500
[Guest]: From my perspective it is more about the banking sector. I think that is the big, you know

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.900
[Guest]: lesson that they missed and

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.860
[Guest]: That is banking sector problems do not resolve themselves easily, right?

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.860
[Guest]: I mean and I think it was a budding

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:25.340
[Guest]: Banking sector crisis it was still I think much smaller than it is now at that time

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.980
[Guest]: There's plenty of evidence from around the world that these crises need to be tackled

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.140
[Guest]: sooner because you know, the banking sector is the lifeblood of the economy and

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:41.340
[Guest]: International institutions like the World Bank ADB IMF and and by the way the government's own

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.580
[Guest]: Department of Economic Affairs it all be there RBI

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:50.260
[Guest]: Everybody had been flagging this that this is a problem and I somehow feel that this was not addressed

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:56.060
[Guest]: Promptly and I think that may be one of the big reasons why the economy has not

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:02.580
[Guest]: Done as well and mind you demonetize the economy was slowing down before demonetization

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:09.380
[Guest]: For several quarters before demonetization happened. So I think the part of the reason is because

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.460
[Guest]: The system was clogged up. Well, you know corporate balance sheets are also kind of

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:19.060
[Guest]: Stressed so I think that was one lesson the other lesson. I mean, obviously, you know, I don't know

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.140
[Guest]: There's so many lessons from international development from India's own experience

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.980
[Guest]: We'd had joblessness for a long time

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.420
[Guest]: We had high growth but still we were not creating the kinds of decent jobs that we need our young people to

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.060
[Guest]: Take on I don't think there was sufficient focus on that

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.540
[Guest]: It was almost like you can just manufacture your way out of it without trying to understand

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:45.140
[Guest]: that the world had moved on and yet in some ways the industrialized for some time and

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:53.180
[Guest]: I'm not sure why we were not focusing on issues like education and I think this government also missed that opportunity

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.940
[Guest]: You know, why not education? Why not health? Why not?

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.020
[Guest]: malnutrition such Bharat is very important but

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:06.100
[Guest]: Malnutrition is what gives you productive citizenry for the future. So

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.300
[Guest]: When you have such a mandate when you have I don't know

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.780
[Guest]: But it's almost a wealth of experience and we're still not doing the things that we need to do. I you know, I'm

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.020
[Guest]: Frankly puzzled so I don't know why I think the kind of you know in my question the kind of

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.620
[Amit Varma]: Lessons I was referring to were not not the specifics which we'll come to when we talk about the period the five-year period

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.980
[Amit Varma]: Modi's term but more about broader lessons. For example much as Modi

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:36.420
[Amit Varma]: Criticized Nehru and in fact blames him for everything. He seems to have the same command and control

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.300
[Amit Varma]: Approach to the economy, which is perhaps not always apt as you point out and you know, you've written in your book about

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.060
[Amit Varma]: You know in your section on Indira Gandhi you cite Bhagwati and Panagariya and about how

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.420
[Amit Varma]: The state's dominance over economic affairs cost India in those years 65 to 75

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.860
[Amit Varma]: When India's per capita grew by 0.3 percent

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:03.700
[Amit Varma]: Per annum GDP growth during that period averaged 2.6 percent and and eventually

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.700
[Amit Varma]: You know that mindset was thrust aside and you know

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:13.460
[Amit Varma]: There were some reforms in the 80s and then more in 91 obviously forced by demon forced by liberalization

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:18.820
[Amit Varma]: Sorry, so my broader question was that in terms of mindset in in Modi's rhetoric

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.020
[Amit Varma]: It seemed that he had made a lot of those shifts like you pointed out

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.820
[Amit Varma]: He branded himself as a sort of a Thatcherite conservative and he was a bit of a

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.580
[Amit Varma]: Thatcherite conservative and whatever but in his actions, none of those really manifested, you know

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.980
[Amit Varma]: He had the same command and control mindset. He had the same top-down view and

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.180
[Amit Varma]: You know the importance of the state and economic affairs

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.660
[Amit Varma]: In those sense, what are the lessons that you would have liked to have seen?

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:50.200
[Amit Varma]: What are the lessons that other policymakers had learned but Modi hadn't learned or internalized?

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.420
[Guest]: I think it's not about learning lessons, you know in the sense that you know

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.900
[Guest]: We know that there are lessons that are people who will learn them others who are just not uh, you know

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:04.820
[Guest]: Prone to learning those kinds of things at all. And I think Modi's, you know, Modi was never a

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.060
[Guest]: Decentralizer in Gujarat, right? I mean Modi's uh, Modi was a strongman in Gujarat. That's how he did things

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.860
[Guest]: He was this decisive. So, you know been so so-called decisive leader who's going to basically

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:22.020
[Guest]: will everything into shape and uh, he managed lots of ministries and that's how he thought

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:28.340
[Guest]: He would manage India. And in fact, I talked about the centralizing instinct. Uh, you know, uh, I think in

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.620
[Guest]: Maybe the third part of the book where Panagariya basically talks about how you know

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.860
[Guest]: Modi did this and that and he was really

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.260
[Guest]: Focused on getting projects moving and all that whereas I was thinking that you know

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.780
[Guest]: He was centralizing things because that's what he knew. That's who he was

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.780
[Guest]: So it wasn't it's not as if he was suddenly going to change

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.900
[Guest]: I personally believe that once you're beyond 30, you're not going to change your core habits

00:17:53.460 --> 00:18:00.260
[Guest]: So, uh, so I don't really think anybody should expect that he would somehow decentralize power

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.400
[Guest]: And I think the lesson for us as citizens and also as observers

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.140
[Guest]: is that

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.540
[Guest]: You know

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.340
[Guest]: It really a lot depends on who's running the government in a country like India where?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:18.180
[Guest]: We have a parliamentary democracy at the same time. We we look to someone to lead us and here we have someone who

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:25.380
[Guest]: Does not believe in the kind of decentralization that India needs because India is too vast too diverse too complicated

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.100
[Guest]: For any central force to run, you know, in fact, you know

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.300
[Guest]: My other research which I did not kind of incorporate in the book

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:38.100
[Guest]: Was about the role of states, you know, we we talk a lot about the center

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.460
[Guest]: We don't talk enough about the states. It's easy to say that the congress party or what did you guys do for 60 years?

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.180
[Guest]: Or meanwhile for the last 30 40 years

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.140
[Guest]: The congress has not been present in big states like Bihar and uh and up

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.300
[Guest]: Where bjp has been present in fits and starts in these kinds of states and in Madhya Pradesh and all this so

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.700
[Guest]: A lot of India's progress is about states. It's about districts

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.460
[Guest]: It's about the village level and I think that's where prime minister

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:12.500
[Guest]: Rajiv Gandhi had the correct instinct and that was decentralized because that's what so you need somebody at the top

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.900
[Guest]: Who'll say you know what if India has to really?

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.180
[Guest]: Progress the one good way to do that would be devolving more power

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.300
[Guest]: To other parts and I don't think so

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.260
[Guest]: even though lessons

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.700
[Guest]: Existed that you need to kind of have broad-based growth. You need to you know

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:38.180
[Guest]: Need to you know, decentralize you need local level kind of people to take up their development issues

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.220
[Guest]: but those lessons could not have been learned by Modi because had he learned them he would have

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.140
[Guest]: You know, he would have paid attention to them in Gujarat as well

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.940
[Guest]: But that's not who he is. So to expect him to learn those lessons, I think is uh, you know

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.580
[Guest]: To my mind would not be correct. We should just basically say that

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:04.660
[Guest]: Today it's Modi tomorrow. It could be somebody else. That's somebody else and the kind of power you wield

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.420
[Guest]: May have something to do with what how India progresses in the future

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:15.220
[Guest]: Mind you that is that maybe one of the reasons coalitions are you have proven to be not the disaster

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.540
[Guest]: That the BJP portrays them to be

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:23.220
[Guest]: Maybe coalitions are better because you have a lot of give and take you don't have a central authority and you're just going to say

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.380
[Guest]: Okay, everybody gets a piece of the pie and maybe that is how India can develop

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.980
[Guest]: But having a strong central character, I don't think it works. I don't think it has worked

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.540
[Guest]: I think it has worked to the detriment of the country in the last five years and every time there's a

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.580
[Guest]: I fear that every time there's a centralizing force India does not stand to gain

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.180
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you and you know at a time where institutions are being weakened

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:52.420
[Amit Varma]: I think another advantage of a coalition government is that you have more checks and balances by default in the political economy

00:20:52.420 --> 00:21:00.420
[Amit Varma]: Where other institutions which are supposed to perform that role may not quite be able to before we get started on the book in the Modi years

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.420
[Amit Varma]: A final question about

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:09.380
[Amit Varma]: UPA 1 and UPA 2 now what mistakes do you think the congress made which will cause their huge defeat in

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.140
[Amit Varma]: 2014 and obviously this period of time the 10 years before that are not a monolithic period

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.100
[Amit Varma]: There were periods of growth. There were periods of very good economic management

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.100
[Amit Varma]: There were periods of very bad economic management

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.220
[Amit Varma]: There were periods of very bad economic management such as when Pranam Mukherjee was finance minister, for example

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.780
[Amit Varma]: And you know that reflected in all the data

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.820
[Amit Varma]: So, you know

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:34.820
[Amit Varma]: What do you think was like in a sense a failure of at some level and you acknowledge this in the book as well

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.900
[Amit Varma]: They didn't do as well as they should have and that

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.500
[Amit Varma]: Enabled Modi to sweep to power in 2014. Can you can you kind of sum that up for me?

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.140
[Guest]: You know, I think of Modi's rise

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:51.460
[Guest]: And this amazing victory that the BJP had in 2014. It was like this perfect storm

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.820
[Guest]: The economy was losing steam and I can i've talked about how that happened

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.060
[Guest]: on the other hand

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.780
[Guest]: You had these corruption scandals, you know, some of them were

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.220
[Guest]: Clearly scandals others were not as clear

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:12.820
[Guest]: Then you had vast kind of organized carder based party that was becoming an alternative and on the other hand you had

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.820
[Guest]: You know this pent-up

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.580
[Guest]: demand from

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.980
[Guest]: Young people for jobs and a better life because they could see on their smartphones what other people around the world had

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.460
[Guest]: And finally you had the messenger

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:29.700
[Guest]: And was a very unique messenger and had been built up over the years as a kind of a messiah

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.660
[Guest]: So this is a perfect storm of all these things coming together

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:38.180
[Guest]: That I think delivered this victory. It wasn't any one thing as far as the UPS time is concerned

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.780
[Guest]: Of course, you're right. I mean there was there were periods of high growth and

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.040
[Guest]: and good development poverty reduction

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.260
[Guest]: but I think

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.700
[Guest]: to my mind

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:54.340
[Guest]: When we look at the 2008 crisis and the response to that, of course the response to that was a pretty big fiscal stimulus

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.740
[Guest]: At that time by the way, not as I record in the book not as big as uh,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:05.460
[Guest]: What the us did and what china did but of course, we we did not face the same severity of the crisis as they did

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.420
[Guest]: But I think we were not able to handle that because that that really you know

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.540
[Guest]: uh

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:17.460
[Guest]: If you remember in the aftermath of the global financial crisis india continued growing

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:24.820
[Guest]: And then it kind of you know, I think it was a sugar high in some ways and was hard to sustain sugar highs, right?

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.580
[Guest]: so, uh

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.980
[Guest]: So I think that was a problem. Of course that uh, you know, there was inflationary issues

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.220
[Guest]: fiscal deficit and you know, unfortunately the way we manage fiscal deficits in the country and

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:43.220
[Guest]: I think this was true in our times too and more I think so even in this government's time

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.540
[Guest]: You know, you'll sell you'll basically

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.340
[Guest]: You know, you'll take one

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.100
[Guest]: government-owned

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.100
[Guest]: entity and then

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.380
[Guest]: Take up a position in some other government take up the government stake in

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.380
[Guest]: Some other entity and then you say we balance the books and you know

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.340
[Guest]: I think those kinds of things ultimately hurt hurt india

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.820
[Guest]: Or hurt an economy. The other issue is that even we did not

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.300
[Guest]: focus on

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.300
[Guest]: You know, what would sustain?

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.140
[Guest]: progress

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.780
[Guest]: And to my mind, you know and here amartya sen has been talking about it all the time

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.340
[Guest]: And I know he gets a lot of good parts

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.820
[Guest]: uh from the right

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.980
[Guest]: But you know unless we invest in human capital human development

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.940
[Guest]: There is no chance for india to succeed in today's world. There's absolutely no chance

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.860
[Guest]: Uh, so if you do not invest in health if you do not invest in education the right way if you do not actually

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.260
[Guest]: Spend the money properly. I have this

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.580
[Guest]: anecdote in the book about a village called bandi paeen in baramulla where I worked uh,

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.860
[Guest]: For two years before the 2014 election and bandi paeen has eight government schools

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:58.420
[Guest]: It's a one kilometer long half kilometer wide at its widest village with eight government schools

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.700
[Guest]: One high school three middle schools four primary schools. I don't know what the current situation is at that time

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.340
[Guest]: That was the situation. None of the schools had adequate

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.740
[Guest]: teachers or students or there's no furniture

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.060
[Guest]: so

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.340
[Guest]: We should have had one school

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.260
[Guest]: Maybe even that may not have been viable for that village. You could kind of create a model

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.340
[Guest]: You could kind of consolidate you could bring in

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:25.380
[Guest]: You know teachers to uh work in one place. So teachers there would be enough teachers

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.020
[Guest]: There'd be enough students, but that's not how we've done things

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:34.420
[Guest]: We've just kind of so before we increase the budget for these things. I really would like to see more efficient spending also

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:41.860
[Guest]: so so I I think that um sustaining that progress, you know, of course I talked about the number of things that happened that led

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.380
[Guest]: ultimately to our terrible defeat, but I think we should have paid more attention to sustaining that progress and

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:54.900
[Guest]: And we should have also been more careful about the sugar high. We had to kind of calibrate that better

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.300
[Guest]: I think we we did not and frankly i'm not in a position to tell why that

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.780
[Guest]: May have been the case what they were thinking at that time. I was in the us at that time

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.660
[Guest]: I can tell you that at the world bank and the imf we were

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.820
[Guest]: Very very worried extremely worried that the global economy was falling off a cliff

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.540
[Guest]: And everybody was panicking frankly

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.900
[Guest]: So I can't I can imagine that in india the policy makers must have been like wondering

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.900
[Guest]: What can we do to save this crisis off and they they did what they did

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.540
[Guest]: But I wonder if we put enough thought into how progress could be sustained

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:34.900
[Guest]: Maybe we could have gone with a slightly lower growth and then uh, you know, uh, that meant smaller fiscal stimulus

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.580
[Guest]: Uh, maybe calibrated that better of course, uh,

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.700
[Guest]: The scandals that hit us. I mean, you know, that is something that and the other thing is that if the scandals hit us

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.540
[Guest]: Where is the accountability?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:51.620
[Guest]: So I think that we don't really have accountability mechanisms that are that really, you know, we should have something right?

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.740
[Guest]: I mean something happened and uh, but uh, even this comment has not been able to kind of

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.140
[Guest]: Hold people accountable. Uh, and uh, so I think it's all about

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.180
[Guest]: Political kind of maneuvering then uh, so keeping people bogged down

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:12.020
[Guest]: But i'm afraid that's not the way, you know, india can reach its potential. I just don't I had a recent episode with

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.060
[Amit Varma]: Pooja Mehra recently where you know, we spoke about the political economy of those years in a fair bit of detail

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.060
[Amit Varma]: I'll put that link on my episode page for the listeners

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.500
[Amit Varma]: Uh, you know just a brief detour on education while you were talking about that

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.140
[Amit Varma]: I think one thing that both parties have consistently gone got wrong on education is something that in fact

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.020
[Amit Varma]: You referred to at the start as something that you know

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.860
[Amit Varma]: The world bank taught you not to do which is to focus on inputs instead of outcomes

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:40.100
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you you had the bjp in the 2014 manifesto saying we'll spend six percent of gdp on education

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.100
[Amit Varma]: And I think the congress made a similar promise

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:47.620
[Amit Varma]: Uh this time but that's just looking at the input and outputs are miserable and for that you need to look partly

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:53.540
[Amit Varma]: At the way education is structured the incentives in play the fact that the private sector is completely

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.700
[Amit Varma]: shut out through

00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.660
[Amit Varma]: You know an immense amount of over regulation, but you know, leaving that leaving that aside

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.900
[Amit Varma]: There's a broader philosophical question really that I wanted to ask you about the political economy

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.900
[Amit Varma]: That doesn't apply to this party or to that party

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.300
[Amit Varma]: But you know the thought came to me when I uh, i'll just quote from your book

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.980
[Amit Varma]: You quote these economists quote while ghatak and ghosh who pointed out. Um

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.100
[Amit Varma]: About what the upa was going through in 2014

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:24.500
[Amit Varma]: Quote, it is a unique misfortune for any party to be charged with both crony capitalism and unbridled welfarism

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.340
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote and uh, you know the thought that came to me was that

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:35.700
[Amit Varma]: This is actually an inevitable accusation for any government become because of the imperatives of politics on the one hand

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:42.820
[Amit Varma]: You have interest groups who have funded you whom you have to satisfy. So crony capitalism seems inevitable and on the other hand

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.620
[Amit Varma]: You know, you need to buy vote banks

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:50.500
[Amit Varma]: So you need to appeal to voters and the populism that leads to welfarism also seems inevitable

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.580
[Amit Varma]: So just as a broader question not as a member of one party or any party

00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:00.100
[Amit Varma]: Because I think this is a dilemma that the whole political system faces. How does one get past this?

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.980
[Amit Varma]: The analogy to this is the following

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.420
[Guest]: When you talk about somebody who's a reformer

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:12.660
[Guest]: They say do you want reforms? Do you want someone who's a pro business person? Or do you want someone who's a pro market person?

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.420
[Guest]: From my perspective pro market, right? You don't want to be pro business. You don't want anybody to be pro business

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.060
[Guest]: You want somebody to be pro business?

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:25.700
[Guest]: You don't want anybody to be pro business. You want somebody to create a level playing field?

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.980
[Guest]: You want markets to flourish and then people can compete that is what I've learned in my life

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.460
[Guest]: That is what my training is. I don't know. I think the evidence indicates that

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.100
[Guest]: That is where people should be

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.180
[Guest]: Make these markets let them grow let them flourish and let people compete

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.100
[Guest]: Don't try to pick winners. Don't try to support one

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.980
[Guest]: business versus another

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.160
[Guest]: Similarly as far as you know, you want to promote capitalism. Yes

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.320
[Guest]: But crony capitalism is this kind of disease that that is just not going to allow you to

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:05.000
[Guest]: Make decisions that would help you become a pro market reformer

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.960
[Guest]: So it's all very well to say, you know

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.800
[Guest]: We need funding and we need funding to kind of fight elections because that's what we need

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.280
[Guest]: And then we can once we are in government, we can kind of do welfare politics. The trouble is

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:23.080
[Guest]: It doesn't really work that way in reality what what happens ultimately is that these interest groups

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:30.520
[Guest]: They capture it's part of this elite capture, right? I mean, there is a reason we have high inequality in india and growing

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.160
[Guest]: And that is because we we are perhaps not

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.600
[Guest]: Leveling the playing field. We're not supporting markets. We may be supporting mr

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.840
[Guest]: X we may be supporting mr. X or mrs. Y because they may fund us through through whatever means

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.960
[Guest]: Uh, but we never tell people exactly what they're doing, uh, you know for us

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.600
[Guest]: So as a citizen, I want to know

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:01.720
[Guest]: Who is paying the government off and what is the government doing in return for this person?

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.760
[Guest]: We don't know

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.520
[Guest]: We simply don't know and I don't i'm not blaming the multi-government for this or you know

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.840
[Guest]: This is like a cross-government kind of thing now with electoral bonds

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.300
[Guest]: It's kind of legalized corruption to my mind. This is legalized corruption

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.840
[Guest]: We can't have these kinds of things

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:24.200
[Guest]: If we can't see the destitution in which so many millions of indians live

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.600
[Guest]: And then we don't correlate that with what is happening at the upper levels upper income levels

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.460
[Guest]: Then we're just basically saying okay, you know what it's good to have you know, at least we see that some people are progressing

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.820
[Guest]: But that is not a model that india can really work with but that is a model that we're working with

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.900
[Guest]: and

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:50.620
[Guest]: This cronyism is is a special kind of disease. I mean, why can't our corporates they already have a lead, right?

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.460
[Guest]: They're already running ahead

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.780
[Guest]: Why can't they just uh, you know

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.820
[Guest]: Uh, if they want to contribute to a party

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:04.300
[Guest]: Fine contribute tell people what you're doing and then we'll see whether there is any uh quid pro quo

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.300
[Guest]: but

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.740
[Guest]: You already have a lead and you want you want to pad that lead

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.260
[Guest]: through

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.420
[Guest]: Influence peddling and all that stuff. I think that's what

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.380
[Guest]: To my mind that hurts that hurts growth

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:22.780
[Guest]: That is not pro-growth and we must find ways and you know, I keep telling my colleagues in the congress party as well

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.620
[Guest]: We've got to find well, we've already said that we're going to do away with electoral bonds

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.800
[Guest]: But we want to bring a lot more transparency

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.100
[Guest]: to political finance

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:36.380
[Guest]: Because uh, because without that I think this cronyism will continue you'll continue to see jobless growth

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.500
[Guest]: You'll continue to see higher inequality and that is ultimately going to lead to some

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.620
[Guest]: Cataclysm in the future which I worry about

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.420
[Guest]: So if we don't change course, this is what we'll get we'll get more of the same

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:54.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I I could agree with you more about the need for transparency and and the problem here, you know

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.700
[Amit Varma]: as public choice service would say is one of

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.540
[Amit Varma]: a diffuse costs and concentrated benefits because

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.140
[Amit Varma]: You know, that's right. You know the people who really lose out from

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:10.940
[Amit Varma]: The government being pro-business instead of pro-markets are the people at large and the costs are diffused and invisible often the unseen as it were

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.740
[Amit Varma]: Uh, whereas, you know, you have these interest groups who have you know concentrated benefits

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.740
[Amit Varma]: So obviously they will lobby for whatever

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.980
[Amit Varma]: Let's let's kind of move on to the Modi years and you know

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.980
[Amit Varma]: One of the things that kind of struck me

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:27.820
[Amit Varma]: About your book is that reading it it did not seem to me at all that this is coming from someone partisan as you'd expect

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.160
[Amit Varma]: You know given that the author is a congress spokesperson

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.540
[Amit Varma]: But it didn't feel that way at all

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:38.940
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I want to quote a couple of sentences from your book on how you felt after Modi came to power

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:44.220
[Amit Varma]: Quote I for one was certain that transformation was around the corner given Modi's sweeping victory

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.800
[Amit Varma]: The massive defeat of my own political party his oratory and genuine popularity

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.480
[Amit Varma]: As well as his stature as the undisputed leader of the bjp

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:58.640
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote and later on in the same page. You say quote the secret is out despite serious reservations

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I wanted Modi to succeed in transforming the indian economy

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I also hoped he would reign in the worst impulses of his political support base that were damaging to the country

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:14.400
[Amit Varma]: Uh stop quote and you know one the basic thesis of your book which you set out is that given what he promised?

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.140
[Amit Varma]: What he has delivered is a great disappointment

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.860
[Amit Varma]: Which of course is true and you make that case very well

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:24.500
[Amit Varma]: Uh, but all of this also seems to indicate that you actually liked some of what he promised

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.260
[Unknown]: Oh, yeah, I mean, of course, I mean, you know, uh, the

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.380
[Unknown]: The talk was of reforms the talk was of uh transforming, you know

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.080
[Guest]: The economy in ways that you know, uh, basically taking a different trajectory

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.340
[Guest]: So, you know whenever you hear about reform somebody like myself has been trained

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:51.140
[Guest]: uh in this area and you know, we always hope that uh leaders come in and they or governments come in and they

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:57.540
[Guest]: Enact the kinds of reforms that are needed because in india, of course, you know, uh, we still are looking

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.900
[Guest]: For some of those reforms. So I think uh those kinds of things one couldn't disagree with right?

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:07.620
[Guest]: I mean, uh, they talked about the banking sector at problem. They talked about fixing those problems

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.620
[Guest]: I mean who could disagree with that?

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:15.940
[Guest]: They talked about ease of doing business and how they wanted to improve uh on that and who could disagree with that

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.980
[Guest]: I mean because you knew that those are the kinds of things that are needed

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:25.860
[Guest]: So the rhetoric was a lot of the rhetoric was uh good, right? I mean who would disagree with uh, you know

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:32.180
[Guest]: Streamlining a food supply chain, you know from the farms to the dining table. I mean the rhetoric was great

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.300
[Guest]: uh, it was excellent, uh, but uh

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.900
[Guest]: Um, and that is what I you know was saying. Yeah

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.540
[Guest]: Agriculture needs reforms

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.840
[Guest]: I mean, that's where so many of our people are employed and that needs reforms

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:51.140
[Guest]: So and you know talking about government needs to uh be reformed government needs to be uh more efficient

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:56.580
[Guest]: And this was all that we heard during the 2014 election. So of course, you know, let's face it

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:01.220
[Guest]: I mean people like us. I mean, we are we have a very uh comfortable life

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.900
[Guest]: But there are so many millions of people who are very very poor

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.300
[Guest]: They they are like second class citizens and there's very little hope for them

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:15.380
[Guest]: And and then you have something where you say, okay, you know what if the economy does well if the growth is broad-based

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.620
[Guest]: If it is inclusive

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:22.980
[Guest]: These people have a chance that if not them at least the children will see a better a better life

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.660
[Guest]: That's what you want. That's what you aspire for. That's what you aspire to. That's what you you know

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:33.220
[Guest]: It's always dream of and I think in that sense. Yeah, I was I was very hopeful

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.160
[Guest]: Um, and that is why I can call it the great disappointment

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.660
[Guest]: Because those things did not pan out the way I had hoped they would now

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:47.380
[Guest]: Or the way we had been, you know led to believe I know, you know during the launch of this book in delhi raghav bhail

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:53.800
[Guest]: At the quint he was on the panel and he said that this is the great betrayal not the great disappointment

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.920
[Guest]: And I think i've heard something similar from other people. Why did you call it the great disappointment?

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.720
[Guest]: Why didn't you call it the great betrayal or worse and I said because I was hopeful and

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:11.400
[Guest]: I mean as somebody who wants reforms who wants good for who wants, uh, something positive to happen to

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:17.080
[Guest]: Those who don't have a voice in a political discourse who are living in on the margins

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.440
[Guest]: Uh, you want something good to happen for them? And uh, yeah, so that's I wanted

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.920
[Guest]: Uh to believe it and that's the truth. I also worried of course

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.840
[Guest]: I worried about the rss bjp politics and that never ends well, frankly of dividing

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.280
[Guest]: People polarizing people and that by the way, it can be detrimental to the economy as well

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.480
[Guest]: And I think that's what we will see that in the future too. If this continues it is going to have an impact

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:49.320
[Amit Varma]: right, so, you know the sentiment that raghav expressed of it being a great betrayal is one that I totally get because

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.120
[Amit Varma]: a lot of free market supporters and

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.760
[Amit Varma]: Uh, you know conservatives and that sense reformers, uh had a lot of hope of modi

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:03.240
[Amit Varma]: For example to quote from your book you have something about his manifesto here quote the manifesto boldly declared bjp to be a modern and inclusive

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:10.120
[Amit Varma]: Party relegating its pet projects such as the ram temple uniform civil code and cow protection to the peripheries of the document

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.560
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote and one thing i've kind of wondered is now that you know

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:19.980
[Amit Varma]: They've turned the other way. They've completely turned their back on reform and everything comes down to the kind of polarizing politics

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.480
[Amit Varma]: Uh that they seem to have, you know put on the back burner

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:30.680
[Amit Varma]: What i'm wondering is that why this rebranding as a conservative thatcherite in the first place?

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.760
[Amit Varma]: It was obviously a false rebranding

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:38.200
[Amit Varma]: But what drove the rebranding was it the visual thinking of free market supporters like raghav?

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.720
[Amit Varma]: Or was it his own shrewd positioning and if he was repositioning himself in that way?

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:51.160
[Amit Varma]: I'm a little confused about why because there aren't too many of us. So, you know, where did he see the advantage in that?

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.360
[Guest]: I think I tackled this part

00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.120
[Guest]: In part two of the book where I kind of talk about his rise and you know i've written about this

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.560
[Guest]: And others have too that you know gujarat. It isn't as if when you know, andre modi gujarat

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:11.960
[Guest]: Was so exceptional that gujarat was never like that. Gujarat had been growing at high high rates for a long time

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.720
[Guest]: and

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.080
[Guest]: but of course

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.120
[Guest]: Modi somehow there was this I don't know I

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.480
[Guest]: I found all these disparate kind of loose kind of connections to people kind of

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.520
[Guest]: Coming up with this idea of oh, there's a reformer

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:33.240
[Guest]: He's doing great things in gujarat the vibrant gujarat summits and he really wants he's a limited government guy

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.240
[Guest]: and I talk about

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:42.200
[Guest]: Actually, there's an interesting google hangout that I mentioned with sadanand dhume and milan vashnav and nehil sharma and

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:49.160
[Guest]: James crabtree and they're all kind of debating this idea whether this guy is a thatcherite or is he something else and

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.000
[Guest]: But there was an effort and I think the effort was it was in some ways to my mind

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.440
[Guest]: It was about evolving a different image

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.320
[Guest]: I mean, of course modi's image had been tainted by gujarat 2002

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:09.400
[Guest]: and I think there was a concerted effort to kind of build him up as something different and

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.400
[Guest]: Maybe even somewhat liberal

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:15.640
[Guest]: Somewhat, you know, he's a reformer and he wants

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:22.760
[Guest]: An efficient government. He's anti-corruption. He talks about bringing in power supply. He talks about daughters

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:30.120
[Guest]: So I think there was clearly an attempt and I think some people did it because they wanted to help him and

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.560
[Guest]: Maybe that was part of the rebranding others. Maybe needed someone to latch on to like I think

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.880
[Guest]: frankly

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.880
[Guest]: Agwati wanted to

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.040
[Guest]: Basically say that yes, finally. We have someone who understands us

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:49.160
[Guest]: Maybe bhagwati went with that hope that this is what i've been advocating. There's a guy

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.920
[Guest]: You know who talks like this at least and maybe this is this guy is truly a reformer

00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.040
[Guest]: Without going deeper into whether or not he was a reformer or not and also sidelining what his past was

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.960
[Guest]: In 2002 and before that so maybe there was hope for people like bhagwati, you know

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:12.040
[Guest]: Because they've been desperately looking for someone who is right of center in a country that is deeply left of center

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.120
[Guest]: Or has been for a long long time. So, uh, I don't know maybe it's a combination

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:22.520
[Guest]: A concerted effort to refurbish a tinted image and then also hope on the right

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.080
[Guest]: of the economic spectrum that

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.560
[Guest]: We finally found somebody who who is our own and I think

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.760
[Guest]: That did not really work. Well

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:38.520
[Amit Varma]: And and you know one of the things that is almost poignant in a sense for me is that a lot of these supporters

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.520
[Amit Varma]: Um, you know who might have supported him for good reasons at the time

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.640
[Amit Varma]: Once it all began to unravel they continued rationalizing their support for him

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, for example bhagwati wrote an article in support of demonetization after it happened

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.800
[Amit Varma]: And demonetization had a bunch of other cheerleaders who really should have known better because it's you know

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.920
[Amit Varma]: econ 101 tells you that that's a disaster and

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, which is kind of sad

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.320
[Amit Varma]: But in general like you said you were hopeful at the start in 2014 and so were a lot of other people

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.800
[Amit Varma]: At what point did one begin to realize that it wasn't as you know

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.520
[Amit Varma]: There wasn't so much reason for hope like you have a quote in your book from patabhanu metha who writes in 2015

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.760
[Amit Varma]: Uh quote instead of clarity there is confusion you get the sense

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.640
[Amit Varma]: There is no coherence to the economic narrative. It will swirl with the wind not giving confidence to anyone

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.240
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote and and things have already changed by then

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.400
[Amit Varma]: When did you begin to realize that all this was just rhetoric and nothing was going to happen?

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.600
[Amit Varma]: I think for me it was

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.040
[Guest]: I don't know. I mean I I can't really pinpoint the date, uh, because

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.760
[Guest]: I I felt that the honeymoon didn't last as long as I thought it would last

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.760
[Guest]: frankly

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.760
[Guest]: and

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.800
[Guest]: When he went into the land fight

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.720
[Guest]: You know remember they started going out after the land fight

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:07.320
[Guest]: Uh early on I wasn't quite sure. Uh, you know whether it was a reformist move

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.280
[Guest]: Or was it because it wasn't being done?

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.000
[Guest]: Uh at the behest of some particularly large groups of businesses

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.520
[Guest]: So I wasn't sure about that for me, I think

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:25.880
[Guest]: Uh when I saw the first year the first year didn't seem like anything special because uh, there was nothing, you know

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.240
[Guest]: I would have liked to see you know, you know, the the the the

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:34.040
[Guest]: There's nothing, you know, I would have liked to see even then a little bit on the banking sector

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.280
[Guest]: I didn't really see a lot on that

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:42.280
[Guest]: And I think there was this move to kind of get pro installed projects moving. I I you could see that

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.520
[Guest]: Land act, you know, you could have gone both ways, you know, yeah, maybe it's a reformist move

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.200
[Guest]: Maybe he's just doing it as part of helping some uh, friends

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:55.560
[Guest]: uh, but when he started kind of uh, uh, you know when he

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.680
[Guest]: uh, when rahul gandhi landed that jab

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.480
[Guest]: Of the suit booth

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.360
[Guest]: And by the way that whole suit thing

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.520
[Guest]: I think that really worried me actually the suit thing was emblematic of what i've been seeing in other places actually

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.440
[Guest]: So that the suit thing bothered me because the suit thing told me that maybe this guy is not as

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.600
[Guest]: as

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.120
[Guest]: Big as he uh appeared to be, you know, maybe he's

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.800
[Guest]: You know, uh, he's like a regular strongman who is insecure

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.560
[Guest]: Who likes these cheap things and if that is the case, maybe this is not a broad-minded kind of person

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.320
[Guest]: So the suit thing really did bother me a lot. It came as a warning sign

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:41.160
[Guest]: I must tell you that uh, it was not about uh, oh, it's 10 lakh rupees suit and all that it was more about

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:48.520
[Guest]: What the thinking is behind wearing and if someone were to give me a million dollar suit, which is salman and his souls

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.640
[Guest]: I would never wear it. It's just it's I don't know. I wouldn't know i'm sure you would not wear it

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.720
[Guest]: I mean who does that?

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.440
[Guest]: Only somebody who's kind of has some sort of an

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.160
[Guest]: Some sort of a complex. I don't know and strongmen do come with those kinds of things and they do kind of ultimately land

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.240
[Guest]: themselves in trouble

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:14.360
[Guest]: I think that was it the revision of the gdp in january of 2015 and not having the back series

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.800
[Guest]: Within a matter of months. I think that also told me something, uh about the government. I think that was

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:24.280
[Guest]: Many people did not talk about it then but I felt that was a problem

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.320
[Guest]: and

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.760
[Guest]: So, yeah, I think there were some warning signs early on

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:38.920
[Guest]: Uh, by the way, I documented the book that some of his closest supporters were even more pressured because they kind of showed unease

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.920
[Guest]: Early on not people like me his own supporters

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:49.320
[Guest]: Uh, so maybe they were more impatient. Uh, I was maybe willing to uh, you know go along and see how it pans out

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:55.560
[Guest]: But I would say within the first year itself. I think it was clear that this wasn't going to be a reformist government

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:02.600
[Amit Varma]: Right. So let's talk about like, you know, you've got a very detailed breakdown of all the things that

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.760
[Amit Varma]: Went wrong. So let's let's kind of start talking about them one by one

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.360
[Amit Varma]: And and and one of them of course is the whole make in india project

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:16.120
[Amit Varma]: And you know as part of when you're talking about the analysis of the make in india project and how it went wrong

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.960
[Amit Varma]: You also quote raghu ram rajan from uh, you know

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.840
[Amit Varma]: Contrasting india with china and saying that look what worked for china may not work well for us. We're developing differently

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.240
[Amit Varma]: It's a different time and quote we should be agnostic about what will work stop quote

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.280
[Amit Varma]: And and this seemed to me to be a very profound point

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Especially, you know, you could quote hayek at the start of the chapter and it seems that one of the things that

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.160
[Amit Varma]: And it seems that one quality which policymakers should always

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:49.480
[Amit Varma]: Have when they're making policy is epistemic humility that you can't actually control everything and you have to

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.520
[Amit Varma]: You know let society and the market work

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.000
[Amit Varma]: some things out and and this is completely and the make in india seems to sort of

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.760
[Amit Varma]: um

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:05.080
[Amit Varma]: Showcase some of this top-down drive that modi has tell me a little bit about what was wrong with it and what went wrong

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:11.560
[Guest]: Well, there's something it's a very basic point I think when china and uh,

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.360
[Guest]: of course korea, uh started

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.920
[Guest]: Their labor intensive push

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.280
[Guest]: That was 40 years back. The world has changed

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:26.840
[Guest]: The world is very different now compared to what the world was then I mean at a at a very basic level

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.240
[Guest]: You've got to at least pause and think

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.160
[Guest]: Uh, and you know, this is not just for modi. This is for my own party

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.720
[Guest]: This is for my own party. This is for other policy makers

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.340
[Guest]: Let's face it

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.260
[Guest]: 2020 is not 1918

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:51.240
[Guest]: Okay, if it is not a lot has changed and technology has a lot to do with that you cannot start thinking of

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.520
[Guest]: Developing the way some country did in 1980. You can learn some lessons from that

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.880
[Guest]: But you cannot just say okay now i'm going to replicate that model

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.640
[Guest]: Because that's not who you are. That's not that's not the time you're living in

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.080
[Guest]: So I don't really get why it is so hard for people to

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:13.080
[Guest]: Understand that uh, you know, oh we can't just replicate this country's model that that country's model

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:18.840
[Guest]: Yes, you can adapt things and all that but you you must kind of also look at you know, there's plenty of

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.720
[Guest]: material written on this about how

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.440
[Guest]: developing countries

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:30.280
[Guest]: Are are not able to uh, not just india other countries are not able to replicate the chinese model

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.800
[Guest]: And there are good reasons for that. So

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.500
[Guest]: This whole idea that I have to push this manufacturing

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:44.360
[Guest]: Output to 25 percent of gdp i'm going to do this that I think perhaps there is some hubris about

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:52.360
[Guest]: How one person one strong government can do this and that you know, I can dictate this level of

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.020
[Guest]: this level of

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.100
[Guest]: manufacturing output, but that's not how

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.740
[Guest]: Decision makers who are at the at the firm level make the decisions

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:05.220
[Guest]: Their decisions are about whether or not they're going to make some money out of it. They don't care if um

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:11.780
[Guest]: They may vote for modigy, but they're not going to vote by they're not going to you know, pay for it

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:16.580
[Guest]: They're just going to do what is in their self-interest and their interest is in making money

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:23.000
[Guest]: Their interest is not in losing money just because they have to vote for modigy or to make his make in india project successful

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:31.700
[Guest]: so I think uh, frankly the biggest reason I think was that uh, the indian economy is very different, you know,

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.580
[Guest]: Structurally, uh, and the time is very different

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.940
[Guest]: And setting these targets of only within five years or ten years. We're going to do this and it's going to be 25

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:47.220
[Guest]: percent and knowing that it has been stagnant for a while despite all effort and knowing that there's

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:53.140
[Guest]: Technology that actually is and india is a capital intensive country to begin with at least its manufacturing sector is

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.820
[Guest]: so

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:59.080
[Guest]: Knowing all that still trying to kind of say are we going to have labor intensive industrialization?

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:04.260
[Guest]: And I don't know. I think it's just basically you're not willing to accept

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:10.500
[Guest]: That there is a reality that you must contend with and you think that you can just change reality because you're in government

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.180
[Guest]: It doesn't work that way

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.980

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen i'm chatting with salman soz about his book the great disappointment

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:10.740
[Amit Varma]: And how modi let all of us down, you know another opportunity missed perhaps by the modi government was

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.380
[Amit Varma]: Uh, which you mentioned was a remarkable windfall

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.100
[Amit Varma]: They got with the low oil prices like in your book

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:23.720
[Amit Varma]: You talk about how between 2011 and 2014 crude prices averaged 108.5 dollars per barrel between 2015 and 2017

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:31.400
[Amit Varma]: They averaged only 59.3 dollars per barrel and um the modi government could have chosen to pass this or a significant part of this

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:37.720
[Amit Varma]: To the consumers, uh so that we would have more money to spend, uh, but he didn't tell me a little bit about this

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:43.320
[Guest]: Yeah, actually i'm i'm a little puzzled by this, you know, of course, I mean there are

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.400
[Guest]: deficit talks because people believe that fiscal deficits can uh,

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.200
[Guest]: Land you in deep trouble that that was the experience after the global financial crisis

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.960
[Guest]: And of course you want to protect the macro economic situation

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
[Guest]: But you know

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:07.000
[Guest]: Like I talked about earlier, you know when the up was in power and perhaps the fiscal stimulus, uh ended up being too much

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.080
[Guest]: In this particular case, I think the fiscal restraint was just too much

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:17.320
[Guest]: I mean you think of what was going on and you know, i've spoken about this earlier in other conversations in

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.960
[Guest]: 2014 and 2015

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.120
[Guest]: Uh, there were two successive droughts

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.840
[Guest]: When you have successive droughts

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:31.000
[Guest]: What is the policy framework that you employed you actually went with the minimum support prices that you had you actually?

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.320
[Guest]: kept them

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:37.960
[Guest]: You know pretty low, uh, the growth was pretty low. In fact, so reason palla wrote

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:44.280
[Guest]: Wrote a column on how this is amazing and it's kind of you know, in fact, there's uh, you know, uh, he's very happy

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.440
[Guest]: so when you have

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:53.340
[Guest]: A demand compression you your policy response at that time was that uh, you it was contractionary

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.480
[Guest]: then

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.360
[Guest]: You had this great windfall and the

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.160
[Guest]: Prime minister called himself nibala

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:07.640
[Guest]: Wonderful fine, of course. It's helping you. Uh, lower your inflation. It's helping you maintain your fiscal deficit at

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:13.960
[Guest]: Reasonable levels you're going on the glide path towards a three percent fiscal deficit target

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.960
[Guest]: But then why do you?

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.480
[Guest]: Why do you uh, take this entire windfall?

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:26.200
[Guest]: And um, you know, uh take it for the government. I don't really get it. It's not as if government spending is very efficient

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:32.760
[Guest]: I mean, I would get it if government spending was more efficient than household, uh spending but it isn't I think we all know that

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.680
[Guest]: So what I thought should have been done was because the economy was uh, you know

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.120
[Guest]: Facing some headwinds in terms of the agricultural sector

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.720
[Guest]: Not doing well

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.600
[Guest]: You kind of say, you know what we'll loosen the purse strings a little bit

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:51.720
[Guest]: We keep some of the windfall but pass some of the windfall over to consumers let them spend

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:58.200
[Guest]: But they instead what they did was they actually, you know, this was the second contractionary policy

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.600
[Guest]: So it was exactly the opposite of what I felt should have been done

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.800
[Guest]: So you took msps and you know in some ways flatline them

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:12.280
[Guest]: Then you took uh, the oil windfall and you basically kept it for yourself

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.720
[Guest]: And of course i'm sure wasted a lot of money and sure enough

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.600
[Guest]: Your investments were not doing well. Anyway

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.280
[Guest]: Your exports were not doing well. Anyway, and of course

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.260
[Guest]: You charted a path towards demonetization

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.760
[Guest]: And I think there were five quarters of declining growth before demonetization if i'm not mistaken

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.960
[Guest]: So I don't get it. I don't understand. I really don't understand why this path was followed

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.000
[Guest]: I don't understand why they needed a contractionary policy

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.560
[Guest]: At a time when the economy was not doing well

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.520
[Guest]: I could understand it if the economy was overheating

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.960
[Guest]: And then they wanted to curb the growth but here there was no evidence that the economy was overheating

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:56.440
[Amit Varma]: So i'm puzzled. So I want to again ask you a broader question, but taking off from this issue

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, i'll quote again from your book where you say quote

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.400
[Amit Varma]: I am not convinced that more revenues in the hand of the government is a good thing

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.560
[Amit Varma]: The quality of government spending is dubious and at a time when the economy was

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Recovering from the blows of demonetization on the gst a little bit of help for consumers

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:17.560
[Amit Varma]: Could have had a salutary effect on the economy stop quote and I was very struck by this sort of first line of

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.320
[Amit Varma]: More revenues in the hands of the government not necessarily being a good thing because

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:27.320
[Amit Varma]: Very often you see governments, especially the modi government recently boasting about higher tax revenues

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.720
[Amit Varma]: And whenever I hear that boast I always think that hey, that's a bad thing because you've got more

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.200
[Amit Varma]: Money passing from the productive part of the economy to the parasitic part of the

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:43.880
[Amit Varma]: Economy what what is your is that your general philosophic view or did you mention or did you mean it only in this context?

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:50.680
[Guest]: No, I mean look, I mean, uh, it's a tricky part for me, right? I mean on the one hand, uh, you know

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:56.280
[Guest]: I I do feel that government spending can be pretty uh, you know is relatively inefficient

00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:02.600
[Guest]: Especially in countries like india in many other countries. It may be somewhat inefficient, but it's also you know

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:07.960
[Guest]: You provide the kinds of services that people really need and so it's kind of a social contract, right?

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.920
[Guest]: I mean you pay me money. I deliver you certain services and the government has a role

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:18.680
[Guest]: Of course the public sector has a role and i'm happy to by the way note here just a bit of a plug for the congress

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:24.680
[Guest]: Manifesto that we talk about uh the role of uh, the private sector as a lead for

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:30.600
[Guest]: Investments and and growth the government being in a supporting role for the provision of public goods

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:37.320
[Guest]: Now in india's case, I think there is plenty of evidence which suggests that we don't spend the government doesn't spend money. Well

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:43.560
[Guest]: Uh, and so to say that oh now we have a lot more money to spend unwisely

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.560
[Guest]: I think is uh, you know

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.160
[Guest]: Not a good thing. In fact, I think we've created this whole

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.720
[Guest]: Environment where we say oh

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.560
[Guest]: Everything is corruption. Everything is black money. Everything is bad

00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:01.160
[Guest]: And I think that is that is hurting the economy frankly, uh, because

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:07.560
[Guest]: You know when you have money in the hands of people in a country like india where government spending is not very efficient

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:11.160
[Guest]: I think it's okay. I think that's where you might create opportunities

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.800
[Guest]: In fact, if you leave more money in the hands of people

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:18.680
[Guest]: And let them make their decisions and you as government actually really

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.640
[Guest]: Let them do their work get get out of the way

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.200
[Guest]: India might actually progress faster

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.760
[Guest]: Because india is not

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.640
[Guest]: Europe india is not america. India is india

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.360
[Guest]: India's government systems

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.880
[Guest]: Are have very limited. I think implementation capacity

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:42.840
[Guest]: So in that kind of a scenario, I think letting the people do their own heavy lifting might be better

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.920
[Guest]: So, um, i'm all for it. I think that's a good point

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:53.480
[Guest]: So, um, i'm all for leaving more i'm i'm not convinced by the argument that the government should have more revenues and then will do amazing

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.360
[Guest]: things

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.240
[Guest]: uh

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.560
[Guest]: Because if that were the case then the money that the government had would be spent much more

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.800
[Guest]: Wisely and we would not have you know, eight government schools in bandipan

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:10.280
[Guest]: Or by the way, we would not have a middle school right in the heart of a baramulla town

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.280
[Guest]: where there were

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.600
[Guest]: nine kids in eight grades and 12 teachers

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.680
[Guest]: I mean

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.680
[Guest]: so, uh

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.360
[Guest]: We we have to keep in mind

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:28.760
[Guest]: That in india in india's context, we're not talking about other countries. We're talking about india in india's context

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.120
[Guest]: Uh where by the way accountability is limited anyway

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.720
[Guest]: More money in the hands of government is not necessarily a good thing

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.560
[Guest]: So I when people talk about higher tax revenues i'm not this whole tax business is just uh, it's become too much

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:46.440
[Guest]: It's like a it's another kind of uh vested interest, you know, you know how to

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.280
[Guest]: how how money exchange, uh, you know,

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:57.000
[Guest]: money changes hands in india through this tax system and uh tax officers and all that so

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.160
[Guest]: I really think that that was not a good policy move. Uh, you know in terms of uh, yeah

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:09.080
[Guest]: I mean you want you want of course you want the government to provide uh public services good services

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.520
[Guest]: But then there should be evidence that that is being done. I don't think that is being done

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:18.280
[Amit Varma]: Right moving on. I mean as as we talk about uh, you know, all the different uh policies

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Of the modi government the one where i'm not going to spend much time though

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.400
[Amit Varma]: You've written very eloquently about it in your book is demonetization for the simple reason

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.460
[Amit Varma]: That i've had I think three episodes on demonetization

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.600
[Amit Varma]: That's fine, you know manmohan singh called it organized loot and legal plunder. Ajay shah called it macroeconomic trauma

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:40.360
[Amit Varma]: Macroeconomic trauma I described it at the time in a column for the times is the largest assault on property rights in human history

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.920
[Amit Varma]: It's just such a disaster that I don't even think there is a need for sensible people

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.560
[Amit Varma]: You know

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.320
[Unknown]: Have to be convinced

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:56.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so we'll kind of pass uh over demon but now, you know, the gst is very interesting because you know

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:02.460
[Amit Varma]: Demon was just a bad idea period but gst is actually a very good idea, which was badly implemented

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:09.820
[Amit Varma]: In fact, yashwant sinha once referred to the implementation of it as a potential harvard case study for what not to do

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.060
[Unknown]: and

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.620
[Amit Varma]: You know as you've quoted him in your book, which is where I get it from

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:21.500
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about what went wrong with gst and and my sort of uh follow-up question to that also is

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.500
[Amit Varma]: that uh

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:29.900
[Amit Varma]: even if you like a lot of the things that went wrong were due to political imperatives because different states were saying no put this

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.980
[Amit Varma]: Rate and put that rate on this and this rate on that and you had interest groups in the picture

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:39.580
[Amit Varma]: So if the gst is to be fixed like let's say if the congress comes to power inshallah and the gst is to be fixed

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.540
[Amit Varma]: Will the political imperatives allow that to happen?

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.780
[Guest]: well

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:49.020
[Guest]: first a broad philosophical point on gst or indirect taxes, I think

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:56.780
[Guest]: We've taken the easy way out on tax policy and the easy way out is just impose an indirect tax and

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:01.580
[Guest]: Then everybody gets to pay but you know you and I know from economic theory that this is

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.180
[Guest]: uh, these are regressive taxes and I think we are

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:10.300
[Guest]: The share of indirect taxes has been growing even if it was growing earlier as well. It's now

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:15.100
[Guest]: Well past 50 percent. We're really putting an undue burden on

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:21.180
[Guest]: Poorer sections and lower income sections and I think we must reverse course on

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.580
[Guest]: indirect taxation

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:29.740
[Guest]: Or at least we should you know as a share of tax revenues. I think direct taxes should be higher and

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.380
[Guest]: The interesting thing is that very few people in india talk about it and I don't know why

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.420
[Guest]: But be that as it may the gst

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.460
[Guest]: again, it goes to

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.500
[Guest]: Look at the state the state

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.620
[Guest]: Has very limited capacity and then you're asking the state to implement a tax system

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:54.060
[Guest]: That is inherently very complicated because of all the different rate structures you have

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:58.460
[Guest]: Additional kind of cessus and other things and what is this and what is that?

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:03.100
[Guest]: What rate do you apply here? You've got to you know, keep things a little simple and

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.340
[Guest]: They they called it the good and simple tax, but it wasn't it was anything but good and simple. So

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.580
[Guest]: The other thing is that I don't think enough homework was done

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:19.180
[Guest]: In terms of how other countries have I think we refuse to learn from other countries. I just

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:22.220
[Guest]: It's almost as if we know everything we don't know everything

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:29.580
[Guest]: Malaysia by the way had been trying to implement this thing and their gst they prepared their I think there was a

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.300
[Guest]: preparation time of about

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.820
[Guest]: 18 months maybe longer, you know from the time they took the decision here

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:41.740
[Guest]: We're just kind of here that I think they spent more time on kind of figuring out how to do a midnight

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.340
[Guest]: parliamentary session

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:48.300
[Guest]: To roll this out then they didn't try to figure out whether the technology backbone would really work

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:54.060
[Guest]: You know, there's there's a wealth of information on on these kinds of

01:03:54.780 --> 01:04:00.140
[Guest]: Taxes around from around the world. Look at what the experience has been but we spend much more time

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:07.980
[Guest]: Debating whether we should have it or not have it and far too little time to discuss how it would be done

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.420
[Guest]: What would make sense and it was almost as if

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.420
[Guest]: Just do gst and you'll have a two percentage point increase in your gdp growth

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:20.540
[Guest]: Honestly, I think many of the somebody would talk about golden goldman sachs doing a report and

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.100
[Guest]: Saying that this would be a bump

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:28.300
[Guest]: Of this much to growth and all that. I think people were far more enamored of that

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.020
[Guest]: Oh gst is going to come and suddenly everything's going to be okay

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.460
[Guest]: I think this for for the next government of our future governments

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:38.220
[Guest]: The lesson is you know, the pretty much whatever you do

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:43.260
[Guest]: Things are not going to pan out the way you had hoped for now. The thing is what

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:49.820
[Guest]: Exactly should you be doing in advance to plan and you know, see the kinks

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:53.260
[Guest]: But actually we should have already kind of seen what happened if you think about demonetization

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.420
[Guest]: I don't want to go back to that details or that

01:04:55.420 --> 01:05:01.820
[Guest]: Uh, uh crazy policy, but how they implemented even that they implemented that bad idea

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:07.580
[Guest]: Terrible idea in a terrible way kept coming up with new notifications and changes. They did the same for gst

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.660
[Guest]: Of course in gst now you have this council and everybody says oh

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.980
[Guest]: This pet food of mine should be exempted that that thing should not be exempted

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:21.340
[Guest]: So this is a crazy kind of uh crazy tax in a very kind of uh

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.260
[Guest]: To be implemented by a disorganized bureaucracy with a low implementation capacity

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.980
[Guest]: And what can go wrong? Everything can go wrong. And that is what happened

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.700
[Guest]: This acted as yet one, you know, one big huge speed bump for the economy

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:39.820
[Guest]: I don't think we can come out of this anytime soon if it continues this way. I'm not

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:44.300
[Guest]: Confident that this is going to increase. Uh, I don't think this is going to be good for the country

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.300
[Guest]: Frankly if they continue with this structure

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:51.100
[Guest]: Uh, this is a crazy structure. It needs to be disbanded or abandoned

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.460
[Guest]: Uh, by the way, some other countries did abandon the gst as a whole forget

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:59.580
[Guest]: Uh reforming it. They just abandoned it

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:06.220
[Guest]: It's a very you know, you have a country that is so diverse and then suddenly you're trying to you know

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.820
[Guest]: Reform the system and you try to do it in one fell swoop

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:16.220
[Guest]: And without any planning without any proper planning preparation, you'll have a disaster. That's what happened

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:21.020
[Amit Varma]: One of the areas in which people had a lot of hopes of the modi government was privatization

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:26.700
[Amit Varma]: You heard a lot about how we have so many psus and people would do draw graphs of okay

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:32.060
[Amit Varma]: Here's how the number of psu ppsus have increased through the decades and they've actually increased even more

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:36.220
[Amit Varma]: And you know my good friend sadhanand dhume you've quoted him in your book

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.620
[Amit Varma]: Summing it all up and i'll quote him as well

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:47.100
[Amit Varma]: Start quote in effect india's privatization program has become a dodgy accounting exercise in which one government owned entity buys stakes in another

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:51.500
[Amit Varma]: Rather than an attempt to streamline the economy by selling unproductive assets to private bidders

01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:59.180
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote and this is really so bizarre because at least in privatization one assumed that there were a lot of low-hanging fruit

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.540
[Amit Varma]: That they could just get rid of and they did absolutely nothing

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.620
[Guest]: well

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:10.540
[Guest]: yeah, and and uh again i'm puzzled because uh, I don't understand you know, if

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.620
[Guest]: Prime minister modi

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.100
[Guest]: Uh in his first year had made the case

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:20.700
[Guest]: Imagine prime minister modi when he became prime minister, uh at the peak of his popularity said to the country

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.660
[Guest]: Look, the congress left me a terrible

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.460
[Guest]: uh problem with banks

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:29.180
[Guest]: And I need to do something drastic

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.180
[Guest]: And I need to fix this system

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:35.900
[Guest]: It'll mean taxpayer money will going to be used for whatever and but I had to do it

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.740
[Guest]: It's not my fault, but I have to rescue this country. I have to rescue that's what i'm here for

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.180
[Guest]: I don't think people would have blamed it. I think people would have been happy

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.620
[Guest]: I mean they would have at least given him a chance in a similar vein if he had said

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:52.300
[Guest]: You know what air india has been bleeding money for a long time. This is not a viable way to do business

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.100
[Guest]: It doesn't seem to be working

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.660
[Guest]: I have said myself that we we've been to kind of uh, reform some of these things

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.860
[Guest]: We're going to sell this thing off. I don't think people would have said

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:09.180
[Guest]: Modi you're wrong. They would have you know said okay, you know, he came to reform things and he's reforming reforming things

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:13.820
[Guest]: But as I write in the book people did not believe that he was a reformer of that sort

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:18.140
[Guest]: In fact, I don't think he believes in a smaller public sector, you know

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:22.540
[Guest]: I believe in a more efficient public sector. I believe in a more

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.380
[Guest]: Constrained public sector because I want the government to focus on things that the private sector is not able to deliver properly

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:33.980
[Guest]: The private sector cannot deliver your national defense the private private sector will not to my mind

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:37.340
[Guest]: Do a good job with you know, say

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.380
[Guest]: Police forces or justice and all the stuff, right?

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:42.940
[Guest]: I don't think he believes that I think he's just

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.540
[Guest]: He thinks that government can do everything and his government can do everything

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.500
[Guest]: So maybe I should not be puzzled after all these years. I think that's who he is

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:57.660
[Guest]: I don't think you know and by the way, that's what maybe most politicians in india think that we should have these kinds of

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:03.340
[Guest]: Things in air india is great and you know, we should have a flag carrier and all this stuff. I don't know

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:07.820
[Guest]: I think people may think like that. I personally do not believe that taxpayer money

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:14.220
[Guest]: Should be spent when there is no hope of you know, recovery in some of these enterprises

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:20.300
[Guest]: Now there are some things where you really need big public sector kind of giants to kind of

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:26.380
[Guest]: Do certain types of businesses they can be strategic in nature other countries have them too and they do they seem to do well

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.700
[Guest]: They some of them are doing well in india as well

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.340
[Guest]: But I can't make that case for most of them. I think so if I can't make that case for most of them

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.140
[Guest]: You know, you know what my feeling would be about disinvestment

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:41.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean I I often make the case that what india needs is a strong and limited government that does a few things

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.740
[Amit Varma]: Very well instead of a large and diffuse government that does nothing well

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:49.100
[Amit Varma]: I mean we effectively don't have a rule of law in most of the country

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:54.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, I I did an episode recently with puja mara who's also written a book about by the same publisher the last decade

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.700
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, uh, she talks about the

01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:02.860
[Amit Varma]: Modi years and the and the point that she kind of makes was that it was political imperatives that caused him number one to move

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:08.860
[Amit Varma]: Away from reforms because many of these reforms were complicated thing around which you couldn't build a simple narrative

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:15.660
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, why bother if there's no short-term political payoff and at the same time which drew him towards

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:23.900
[Amit Varma]: Disasters like demonetization for example, not because of what impact it would have which he didn't give a damn about but because of how it could

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:29.340
[Amit Varma]: Be packaged as something that is anti-black money and will help the poor and so on and so forth

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:36.620
[Amit Varma]: And how far do you think modi was driven purely by political imperatives and and you know that

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.140
[Amit Varma]: Was responsible for what has happened?

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:45.100
[Guest]: I think uh, modi is nothing if he's not a political animal. I think uh,

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:49.180
[Guest]: Clearly, uh politics plays a large role in

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:53.820
[Guest]: The decisions he's taken. I think in that sense puja is right, you know

01:10:54.460 --> 01:11:00.860
[Guest]: Politics did drive say demonetization because it was packaged as a hit against black money and all that

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500
[Guest]: Then you know the question is

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.380
[Guest]: then

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:08.380
[Guest]: Basically, we were all kind of

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:15.660
[Guest]: Hoping for something that would never happen because if a person like that who by all accounts is you know

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:22.060
[Guest]: Liked for his oratory and all that and can convince people to go with him pretty much

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.500
[Guest]: Very often or at least used to be if that person is not going to kind of

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.740
[Guest]: Level with the country and say look this makes sense to me

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.620
[Guest]: We are wasting

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.140
[Guest]: the hardened

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:39.260
[Guest]: Taxpayer money on things that we should not be spending on

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.500
[Guest]: Then in that sense, we never really want us, you know, we should then be

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:49.580
[Guest]: Careful about what we uh think of in the future. We should basically be hoping for coalition governments, honestly

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:53.740
[Guest]: Because we don't really need a strong central character because a strong central character

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.540
[Guest]: Can be much more destructive for india

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.420
[Guest]: With the weight for this benign dictator

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:04.220
[Guest]: Can take a lifetime and who knows how that will pan out and these things don't pan out

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.940
[Guest]: Well now in modi's case, I really thought that he might make some decisions which

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:12.940
[Guest]: I mean what what is tough about you know, telling the country that you know

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:17.900
[Guest]: The upa gave me a bad deal on banks and I need to fix it. Otherwise, you will not have jobs

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:21.580
[Guest]: That's a pretty simple argument to make I think people would have believed it

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:25.660
[Guest]: It was just that he was not focused on that. I think he was focused on

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:31.020
[Guest]: Administrative efficiency and how projects that were stalled would move forward. I think he was thinking small

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:35.740
[Guest]: He was not thinking big. He was really I think he was thinking very small

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.460
[Guest]: So somebody must have told him that you know, if we have a higher tax, people are not paying taxes

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.700
[Guest]: We need to increase the tax revenues

01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:48.460
[Guest]: So yeah, okay, you know, let's let's go after that. But that's thinking small. That's not thinking broad

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:52.140
[Guest]: That's not thinking big. So I don't know maybe he's uh,

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.260
[Guest]: He's a victim of uh his own kind of

01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:02.780
[Guest]: Ambitions in terms of in policy. Maybe he's a small, you know, he has a narrow base to think on

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:06.220
[Guest]: I think that's the only explanation I can come up with. I I don't really know

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:13.980
[Guest]: Why he did not make even the simplest no, it's some easy decisions. I don't know. I don't get it

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.220
[Guest]: I'm honestly i'm puzzled right, you know, and i'm just thinking aloud here

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:23.420
[Amit Varma]: It's something that a friend of mine who was very close to modi once upon a time in his gujarati years once told me

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:28.780
[Amit Varma]: And she mentioned how there was a social gathering at his house and he started to

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:32.780
[Amit Varma]: Telling a story at one point about how when he was a kid his mother was very ill

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.780
[Amit Varma]: And he was a boy then and he went to switch on the fan

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:40.080
[Amit Varma]: And when he flicked the switch he realized that there was no electricity

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.920
[Amit Varma]: And then he decided that if there's one thing I can do i'll focus on electricity

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:49.740
[Amit Varma]: And therefore when he becomes cm of gujarat, you know, he focuses on electrification and all my friends point in telling me

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:54.220
[Amit Varma]: The story basically was that his view of the world is very experiential

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:59.040
[Amit Varma]: If he has experienced something directly then he gives it importance like the lack of electricity

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:05.120
[Amit Varma]: Or roads or so on those physical things where he can see with his own eyes that yes, this makes a difference

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:12.060
[Amit Varma]: But for a man who doesn't apparently read too many books either when it comes to higher abstract concepts

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:15.180
[Amit Varma]: Which you need to grasp when you talk about how an economy functions

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.860
[Amit Varma]: Especially when so many of the fundamental economic truths you and I know like

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:25.900
[Amit Varma]: You know like all trade being positive some instead of zero some or spontaneous order the way markets organize themselves

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.980
[Amit Varma]: All of these higher level concepts is not something he would ever have grasped

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:34.460
[Amit Varma]: Because he hasn't experienced it directly and he has no way of doing so

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:39.580
[Amit Varma]: And and for this reason I sometimes call him the akhodeki prime minister and again i'm just speculating here

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Do you think there is something to this that he has no way of doing so?

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:50.940
[Amit Varma]: And again, i'm just speculating here. Do you think there is something to this that I mean in the sense that a politician

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:58.300
[Amit Varma]: Therefore also needs to be well read and well versed in abstract ideas. So you get a better sense of all of this

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:05.660
[Guest]: Uh, you know, you can't wing economic development, you know, this is uh, this is far too complex

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.880
[Guest]: I mean anybody who who basically decides to do demonetization

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:13.760
[Guest]: Has clearly not spent much time thinking about policies and their implications

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.640
[Guest]: You know, I think you're right. You may find it easier to say look

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.360
[Guest]: There's open defecation. I'm going to build more toilets

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:28.080
[Guest]: We need more girls education because that's what i've been told is, you know, we need more girls education where i'm studying or

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.720
[Guest]: There's no busily here and I would need to kind of flick a switch and so that there's power

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.280
[Guest]: I think yes, but uh

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:39.680
[Guest]: In today's world policy making is so complex. There's so much going on

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.960
[Guest]: There are so many you press one button and something else goes wrong and then you're trying to control for that and you can't control

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.400
[Guest]: for that and

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.680
[Guest]: You know, not everything is in your own kind of hands. You will have quantitative easing in the u.s

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760
[Guest]: That'll have an impact on your currency

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.920
[Guest]: Uh, you that'll have an impact on flows of capital

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.120
[Guest]: So you need obviously no single person

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.080
[Guest]: Would have all that experience clearly

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.600
[Guest]: uh

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.600
[Guest]: But you should have some basic

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.280
[Guest]: Uh humility to know that you don't know everything

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.920
[Guest]: That's one second that you build a team or you have a team of people advisors and all that who can kind of

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.040
[Guest]: Give you different perspectives

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.040
[Guest]: You must listen. You should be a good listener

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.720
[Guest]: I think and you should be willing to take advice and you should be willing to say, you know what i'm wrong. This is not

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.280
[Guest]: I thought of it in the incorrect way. This expertise is really

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:41.040
[Guest]: Uh useful here, but I don't think you know from what I gather. I don't think people are that keen to give him advice

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.080
[Guest]: Because maybe they're scared of giving him advice

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.880
[Guest]: Or maybe he doesn't listen to advice who knows?

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:53.280
[Guest]: I mean if you can do demonetization without taking the rbi or your finance minister into confidence, which is alleged

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.640
[Guest]: Then then you know that we're in trouble, right? I mean

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.120
[Guest]: So

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:02.560
[Guest]: Yeah, you may be right about this experiential kind of uh instinct

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:08.160
[Guest]: But you know making policy based on that because those are things that you can do you can deliver

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.640
[Guest]: but in terms of if you cannot

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:17.120
[Guest]: In economic development in in governance in policy making you have to have a broad-based team

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:23.440
[Guest]: Uh who can actually help inform you who can help educate you and you know, that would be anybody

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.800
[Guest]: It's not just you know tomorrow. I mean you could be the prime minister of the country, but even you would need tons of

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.960
[Guest]: You know support no matter how broad-based your economic training has been so I think in that sense he too

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:41.120
[Guest]: You know, I think needs a lot of help. I'm not sure he thinks he needs it, but I I do think he needs it

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, yeah, as I said earlier

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.360
[Amit Varma]: I think the most important quality for anybody in a position of power is epistemic humility

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:51.280
[Amit Varma]: And and that's something that we've kind of consistently lacked you've you know

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:56.880
[Amit Varma]: So you've got a couple of great chapters on what the policies and programs of the government were and what the results were and i'll just

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.720
[Amit Varma]: Encourage all my listeners to um buy the book and read that there's some great

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.080
[Amit Varma]: Detail in there. I want to sort of stick to broader questions

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.240
[Amit Varma]: One of which being what did he get right in that time? I know that's a hard question

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.600
[Guest]: No, no, I mean, you know

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:18.800
[Guest]: To my mind some of the things that I think he deserves a good credit for is something like bringing attention

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.040
[Guest]: to you know

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:27.040
[Guest]: Clean india right swachh bharat. I think that kind of personal attention and relentless attention

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.840
[Guest]: I think that's a kind of a national level kind of even I mean forget what happens on the ground and all this

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.080
[Guest]: just creating awareness, I think

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.400
[Guest]: Leaders should be creating awareness about issues of national importance

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.800
[Guest]: Uh, you know educating the girl child

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.520
[Guest]: These kinds of things are I think these are things that are aspirational in some ways for a country like india

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.160
[Guest]: And it's good to kind of you know for leaders to kind of wear their

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.560
[Guest]: Kind of thoughts on their sleeves in some ways and say look this is important to me

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.360
[Guest]: I really want and especially if you're a popular leader and you

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.960
[Guest]: Use your popularity to kind of bring awareness because a lot of the times we're simply not aware

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.360
[Guest]: Despite all the smartphones and technology and everything

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:15.120
[Guest]: Most people you know, we just we get used to seeing things from our own perspective. We never kind of

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.120
[Guest]: It's hard for us to kind of you know

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.560
[Guest]: Look at things from a broader perspective and having a leader like that talk about these kinds of issues

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.760
[Guest]: I think is very very important and I think it's very helpful

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.120
[Guest]: So I would say on these kinds of issues. I have kind of in my book also going to said that yes

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.840
[Guest]: He's talked a good game and he's kind of uh led on these and I think he should get credit for these kinds of things

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.120
[Guest]: um

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.280
[Guest]: You know coming up with these indices for cities

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.880
[Guest]: Which one is clean which is not, you know may not pay immediate dividends

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:51.360
[Guest]: But ultimately may prove that there's some competition and you know, maybe it may help cities to kind of you know

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.600
[Guest]: Take pride in the work that they're doing in terms of keeping the cities clean

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.040
[Guest]: Creating a more welcoming kind of environment for people

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.480
[Guest]: Um, he's talked a good game on tourism and but you know, uh in terms of you know

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.800
[Guest]: Ease of visas and all that stuff making india feel more welcome

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.320
[Guest]: But you know, of course the other the flip side is that we need to do a lot more on

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:21.440
[Guest]: Safety, I think that has fallen by the wayside because you know, we need uh, we our police is still a force not a service

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:27.760
[Guest]: And I think there I think that it's both a positive in terms of trying to create a better image for india

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.360
[Guest]: But at the same time not doing the basics that are needed. So you

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:36.960
[Guest]: You know that that's the kind of I sometimes get frustrated why this whole good talk

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.720
[Guest]: Aspirational talk and then under delivery of the basics. I think that's where I feel

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.920
[Guest]: A little bit of frustration with the government

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.680
[Guest]: But there are other things too, you know, they did finally push through ibc

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.440
[Guest]: Yes, they did the gst. Of course the gst is a mess

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.920
[Guest]: But at least uh, you know

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.920
[Guest]: He was able to push it through now

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.280
[Guest]: We'll have to kind of you know

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:02.000
[Guest]: Now we have it in the constitutional framework and now we can kind of maybe

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.400
[Guest]: Do wholesale reform not once and for all but at least in a major way. I think ibc happened a bit

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:15.600
[Guest]: Late in my view, but even then I think ibc is now hampered. Uh, I mean, you know the bankruptcy code

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:19.040
[Guest]: I don't know if how well that is being implemented right now

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.760
[Guest]: I don't know but at least you know he moved on that ease of doing business. I think

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.320
[Guest]: Frankly, they're trying to game the system

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.040
[Guest]: Genuinely ease of doing business would be when everybody

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.960
[Guest]: Around the country would feel that yes, it's easier to do business. I don't think that's happening. I think because

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:38.480
[Guest]: There's more coercion these days i'm told on businesses than used to be the case

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.760
[Guest]: So even though the world bank has recognized india

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.640
[Guest]: As having done a lot on ease of doing business. I think that may be more

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.760
[Guest]: Through gaming the system, you know putin once told his officials that he wanted russia to be

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320
[Guest]: In the top 30 by a certain number of years

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:59.200
[Guest]: And I think they're all scurrying to figure out how they would do it within the stipulated time and they did it

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.280
[Guest]: So, you know when you have the threat of putin, uh, hanging over your head

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.240
[Guest]: You can you can do that and I think in modi's case too

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.720
[Guest]: They managed to gain this

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.720
[Guest]: I think managed to gain the system a little bit

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.240
[Guest]: But honestly, I don't think there's a lot that i'm happy about. I really think this is a missed opportunity

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.720
[Guest]: really missed opportunity

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.520
[Guest]: And uh people like you and I will be okay

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.960
[Guest]: But people who could have benefited disproportionately, I think they're not going to be okay

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.960
[Amit Varma]: So before I ask you about you know, the state of the economy today just a tangential thought

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously you're right about uh, you know when I saw the eodb, uh, the things I figured that yeah

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.680
[Amit Varma]: Wherever there are metrics, they can be gamed

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:40.800
[Amit Varma]: So this is like an evolving game where you have to keep taking the metrics deeper and deeper

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.200
[Amit Varma]: But so here's a tangential question because you mentioned the ibc the bankruptcy code

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.520
[Amit Varma]: That where it's apparently at is that while the ibc is not in the market

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.400
[Amit Varma]: But where it's apparently at is that while the ibc is a welcome

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:56.880
[Amit Varma]: Uh reform where we are stuck is that state capacity simply isn't enough

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.560
[Amit Varma]: So now now because of state capacity not being enough you're kind of stuck now

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:05.860
[Amit Varma]: You're someone who could hopefully, you know, maybe be in government one day and in a position to carry out reforms

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:11.860
[Amit Varma]: When you are in that position besides the immediate considerations of the political economy

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.120
[Amit Varma]: Do you also have to take into account whether there is enough state capacity for those reforms to happen at all?

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.800
[Guest]: Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I I I mentioned it earlier in this

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:27.280
[Guest]: We've limited capacity, you know, we we talk about our civil service officers and how hard they're working and all this stuff

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:33.520
[Guest]: But for the most part in government, and by the way, when we talk about government, we're not talking about just the central government

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.360
[Guest]: We're talking about state governments as well. The public sector is very limited capacity

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.840
[Guest]: So, uh when you try to implement things it takes so much more effort so much more time, you know, I was just recently

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.000
[Guest]: visited

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
[Guest]: um the Hoover Dam

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
[Guest]: in Nevada in the US

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.320
[Guest]: Nevada slash Arizona

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:56.980
[Guest]: the Hoover Dam in was uh built from 1931 to 1935

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.180
[Guest]: In you know, just around the time of the depression

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.560
[Guest]: in five years roughly

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.280
[Guest]: There's a flyover and Hoover Dam is huge

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.740
[Guest]: There's a flyover in Hyderpore of Srinagar

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:15.700
[Guest]: Which was built over seven years the length of the flyover is maybe about a kilometer less than that

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:18.180
[Guest]: It's not even a flyover. It's a kind of an overpass

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:22.740
[Guest]: Hoover Dam five to six years and this flyover

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.620
[Guest]: Seven years a small little thing

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:29.060
[Guest]: This flyover was built in the 2000s

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.900
[Guest]: Now imagine where we are look at the difference now

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:37.620
[Guest]: You can't say that we we didn't have resources because we clearly had resources because we built the flyover

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:41.380
[Guest]: But how is it possible that in a modern state?

01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.620
[Guest]: It takes seven years to build a one kilometer long flyover in Srinagar

01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:48.180
[Guest]: Whereas somebody built a huge dam

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.180
[Guest]: major irrigation project

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.180
[Guest]: major power generation project

01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:54.340
[Guest]: in the 1930s

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:57.700
[Guest]: I think we need to recognize that we are still limited

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:01.780
[Guest]: And in some ways when you craft policies, you have to keep that in mind

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:06.500
[Guest]: If you don't keep that in mind, you'll have implementation disaster after implementation disaster

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:11.460
[Guest]: And and that is why I think I'm at your point of doing a few things really well

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.420
[Guest]: I think that's important

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.860
[Guest]: Let's just do a few things, but let's let the government do them really well

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:22.660
[Guest]: Let there be a contract between we call it the social contract in some ways between

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:28.580
[Guest]: The citizen and the state and say you know what you want to do schools. You want to do education public education?

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:33.300
[Guest]: Yeah, okay, but we want you to deliver along these parameters

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:40.580
[Guest]: These are the indicators of success. These are the learning outcomes we want. This is how we want our children to grow

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:43.220
[Guest]: If we could have that

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:47.300
[Guest]: I mean, I refer to the PISA kind of system of

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:51.860
[Guest]: Testing across countries as far as education attainment is concerned

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.900
[Guest]: I think the last time it was done under the UPA government

01:25:55.460 --> 01:26:00.500
[Guest]: Then we abandoned it because our kids from I think Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.340
[Guest]: Which was supposed to be the better states at that time participated and turned out

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:07.380
[Guest]: we performed worse than

01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.860
[Guest]: Students in Kyrgyzstan and I think after that the government said no we're not going to do this anymore

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.780
[Guest]: As in stop participating now, they're going to restart that participation

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:20.900
[Guest]: But what that tells me is that we are we if we're going to do education, let's do it

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:27.460
[Guest]: Well, let's focus on that. Let's focus on fewer things. Let's not focus on everything and that's the problem

01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:32.500
[Guest]: I think and by the way, this is not Modi's creation. I'm not can't blame Modi for this. This has been going on for

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.300
[Guest]: one government after another

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.740
[Guest]: but we now need a situation where we can actually, you know, if

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:45.220
[Guest]: If we're serious about the country's progress if you're serious about our young people if you're serious about creating opportunities for them

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.000
[Guest]: Then you know, we have to take some tough decisions

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:53.140
[Amit Varma]: Right. So I I want to move beyond economics and beyond your book right now

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:59.860
[Amit Varma]: Your book is really about uh, Modi's being a great disappointment or a great betrayal as Raghav would say in terms of economics

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:05.860
[Amit Varma]: but I want to go beyond that for a moment and ask you about Kashmir because it seems pretty evident to me that

01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:12.340
[Amit Varma]: A lot of things have gone wrong there in the last five years and in fact were going wrong for from even much before that

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.820
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about what's happening

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.660
[Guest]: well

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:18.660
[Guest]: you know, actually

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:25.860
[Guest]: During Prime Minister Malishpa's time and then even Dr. Manmohan Singh's time, I think there was a semblance of return to

01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:33.380
[Guest]: Some level of normalcy things had eased off, you know, there's a greater participation in kind of, you know

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:38.740
[Guest]: Elections and all that just because people felt that thing it was safer

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.580
[Guest]: and

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.900
[Guest]: the rich of the militants had kind of

01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:47.480
[Guest]: You know had subsided. I mean all of their power had subsided

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.480
[Guest]: then in

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.020
[Guest]: 2013-14

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:59.560
[Guest]: Militancy we started hearing the militancy was beginning to pick up a little bit more. This was in the aftermath of the Abdul Guru hanging

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:05.080
[Guest]: But it was still very limited. The estimates would be 100 or 200 people and all that stuff and

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.040
[Guest]: That's it killings had come down

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.760
[Guest]: civilian or soldiers

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.880
[Guest]: Fewer people were dying. But I think when the 2014 election came up

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:19.160
[Guest]: And the verdict was pretty lopsided, you know

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.400
[Guest]: The People's Democratic Party led by Mufti Syed at that time

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:29.160
[Guest]: Won heavily in Kashmir the BJP won heavily in Jammu. In fact, the Congress did not have a single

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.420
[Guest]: MLA from the Hindu regions of Jammu, which was pretty astonishing

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.280
[Guest]: It was a total kind of polarized verdict

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:43.080
[Guest]: And of course the government, you know came up and the BJP and the PDP at that time formed the government that created

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:49.480
[Guest]: I think a lot of disquiet in Kashmir and it was almost like oh now the BJP is going to rule us

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:54.920
[Guest]: The same BJP that the PDP had vilified and fought against during the assembly election

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.720
[Guest]: So I think the space for political discourse actually shrank

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.640
[Guest]: So again, there was polarization in that sense that militancy started creeping up and

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:10.760
[Guest]: If you remember in the last four or five years a rhetoric on television

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.960
[Guest]: And obviously political rhetoric has been pretty much about

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.040
[Guest]: Kashmiris as terrorists, Kashmiris as terrorist lovers, this thing, that thing

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.600
[Guest]: I think it was this vilification campaign that kind of put Kashmiris in a corner

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:28.200
[Guest]: So in some ways it was like I'm not surprised that there's so much anger and resentment in Kashmir now

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.840
[Guest]: There's more violence now

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:37.640
[Guest]: And because I think Kashmir suits BJP's politics greatly personally. This is what I think, you know

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:42.120
[Guest]: The Congress party has always had this philosophy that in J&K

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:48.520
[Guest]: The Congress party should not try to kind of bring in its central dominating kind of politics

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:53.480
[Guest]: Because regional parties are better able to kind of deal with regional aspirations

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:56.120
[Guest]: And it's a very, I think it's a very deliberate kind of thing

01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:03.240
[Guest]: As far as the BJP is concerned, the BJP views Kashmir as a lever for national politics

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:07.720
[Guest]: It's the exact opposite of how the Congress sees J&K

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:14.600
[Guest]: So I'm not at all surprised by how things have deteriorated in Kashmir

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.400
[Guest]: And they have, you know, more people. I mean, I think everybody's kind of seen the numbers now

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:25.800
[Guest]: More soldiers died in 2018 than in any year since 2008

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:29.640
[Guest]: So more civilians dying

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:34.760
[Guest]: There's no end to this conflict, you know, and it's been going on for 30 years

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:39.480
[Guest]: I think the best hope was when Prime Minister Vajpayee was in control

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:45.320
[Guest]: And then also to some extent where the Musharraf was bouncing, you know, that formula

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:51.080
[Guest]: But then everything since then has kind of, you know, petered out, things have gotten worse

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.520
[Guest]: And so I don't know. I mean, I think BJP has to be very careful

01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:00.280
[Guest]: In not making everything political

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:06.680
[Guest]: National interests cannot be, you know, in some ways I feel that BJP doesn't think of

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:11.880
[Guest]: It places the party political interest above the national interest as far as Kashmir is concerned

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:17.400
[Guest]: And by the way, for that, I think it may be that BJP does not view the national interest

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:21.960
[Guest]: The same way the rest of us do, because maybe they think that the state of the nation right now

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.960
[Guest]: This is not the nation that we want to be

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:28.920
[Guest]: They want a different type of nation. So, you know, if you don't think that this is the kind of nation you wanted

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.400
[Guest]: Then you can place political interest above what we consider the national interest

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:37.240
[Guest]: Because you're trying to get to a different nation state and different national interest

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:40.040
[Guest]: So in that sense, it makes sense from their political perspective

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:45.320
[Guest]: It makes sense. Maybe they want a different India and Kashmir suits that purpose

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:49.400
[Guest]: And also in the popular rhetoric these days party is equal to nation in their rhetoric

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:54.360
[Amit Varma]: So if you're anti-BJP, you're automatically considered anti-national

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:59.800
[Amit Varma]: So Salman, now that I've got you on the show, I also have to ask you questions about the Congress

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.880
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is for a democracy to be healthy, you need a healthy opposition

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:09.880
[Amit Varma]: And the decline of the Congress is something that has, you know, I mean, I used to write against the Congress all the time

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:14.360
[Amit Varma]: When they were in power and now, of course, I write against the BJP all the time because they're in power

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:18.840
[Amit Varma]: But one of the things that has happened is in 2016, you know, the Congress has been in power

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:25.640
[Amit Varma]: And in 2014, Congress declined massively to 44 seats and the health of the party is something that is called in concern

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:31.560
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that dismays many of us about it is that unlike the BJP

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:37.800
[Amit Varma]: That doesn't really seem to be an active grassroots and a cadre from which leaders spontaneously emerge

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:41.480
[Amit Varma]: What you instead have is a continuation of a series of dynasties

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:47.720
[Amit Varma]: Like I look across the party today, even apart from Rahul Gandhi, you have Shindia and Pilate

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:53.720
[Amit Varma]: And if I may say so, even yourself, you know, who are part of dynasties

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:59.000
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, Rahul Gandhi himself used to talk about inner party democracy once upon a time

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.880
[Amit Varma]: But we don't see that and even if it was there, where are the cadres? Where are the grassroots?

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:09.560
[Guest]: Okay, so these are actually two different questions because first, let's talk about the dynasty part

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:14.440
[Guest]: And you're right, my father, like I said earlier, has been a politician for a long time

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:21.240
[Guest]: And to be totally transparent, of course, when I joined politics, you know, I got immediate recognition

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:25.320
[Guest]: Because of my father, right? Because they knew who he was

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:29.160
[Guest]: Now in politics, you know, you really have to prove yourself

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:34.440
[Guest]: And ultimately, people will, you may make it to a certain point and say, okay, you know

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.080
[Guest]: I'm going to compete for this particular seat or whatever

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:41.400
[Guest]: But ultimately, it's the people who decide whether you're the right person for them or not

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.120
[Guest]: So I think in that sense, this dynasty part is not specific to Congress

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.720
[Guest]: I mean, of course, you see similar things in other political parties as well

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.560
[Guest]: And in other countries as well

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:58.920
[Guest]: What matters is whether or not whoever is in politics, at least to my mind, are they delivering for the people?

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:03.400
[Guest]: If they're not, they'll be, you know, you can't really, you can't keep them

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:08.440
[Guest]: As in, you know, people, it is up to the people ultimately to whether or not they keep them or not

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.480
[Guest]: Of course, and by the way, this isn't going to go away

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.640
[Guest]: Just because we may feel a certain way about it

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:20.840
[Guest]: Because it's, you know, this has been happening historically

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.880
[Guest]: It's going to continue happening in India and elsewhere

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.040
[Guest]: So that's the one part about dynasty

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:33.640
[Guest]: Yes, do we have other leaders who are coming in who are not related to politicians?

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:37.880
[Guest]: Of course, I mean, I'm sure that, you know, we tend to focus on dynasties

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.880
[Guest]: Because they're easy to kind of comprehend

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.560
[Guest]: They're easy to calculate

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.000
[Guest]: But there's so many people that I know of in our party, in other parties

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.040
[Guest]: Who have nothing to do with politics

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.960
[Guest]: They're first-time politicians and they're doing extremely well

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:55.320
[Guest]: So on the dynasty part, frankly, I don't really see it as something that is inherently bad

01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:01.160
[Guest]: Unless you feel that dynasties can be sustained without people's support

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:04.840
[Guest]: Ultimately, people will have to weigh in in a democracy

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.880
[Guest]: And when they do, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.080
[Guest]: Depends on how well you've done

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.600
[Guest]: I lost an election myself

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.200
[Guest]: My first election, I lost myself despite the fact that, you know

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.560
[Guest]: I felt that I was a good candidate

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:16.760
[Guest]: I'd gone to the World Bank

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.040
[Guest]: I had a lot of policy experience

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.720
[Guest]: Had no scandals per se

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.680
[Guest]: I was well-meaning

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.840
[Guest]: But, you know, people saw it different

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.880
[Guest]: People felt that a different candidate was better for them

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.480
[Guest]: Because maybe he came from their part of the world or whatever

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:34.920
[Guest]: So democracy has that equalizing effect, I think

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.720
[Guest]: As far as the carders and where are the carders, what's happening

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.800
[Guest]: Why isn't the Congress, you know, people say

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:43.000
[Guest]: The RSS is everywhere

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.360
[Guest]: Where is the Congress party?

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.080
[Guest]: You know, there is this thing about, to my mind, about liberal politics everywhere

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.880
[Guest]: That it seems that when it comes to being on the ground

01:35:53.880 --> 01:36:00.600
[Guest]: They seem to be less kind of active than, say, people who are on the far right

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.520
[Guest]: I don't know why that is the case

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.760
[Guest]: I mean, I hear about similar complaints in the US, in Europe

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.840
[Guest]: That is, you know, the carder-based political parties

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.840
[Guest]: Which are typically left of center

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.880
[Guest]: They don't seem to be as active as the far right

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.960
[Guest]: Now, it has been my experience

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.720
[Guest]: That even if you don't see the kind of same visible RSS ground game

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:29.560
[Guest]: I've seen in my own experience, Congress supporters are in the unlikeliest of places

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.280
[Guest]: In Kashmir, I can't tell you, there are these

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.240
[Guest]: I bet so many people who support Congress

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.440
[Guest]: And for no, I mean, and it kind of really puzzled me

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:42.920
[Guest]: I was like, you guys never, you know, PDP and NC always win here

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:45.320
[Guest]: How are you still with the Congress?

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.520
[Guest]: Very different reasons

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.040
[Guest]: But they're still there

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:53.880
[Guest]: So I think in this particular election, we're going to see a different kind of outcome, I think

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:57.400
[Guest]: And that outcome is not possible if you don't have feet on the ground

01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:00.360
[Guest]: But we need to pay a lot more attention to this

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:03.000
[Guest]: I think now, politics is changing

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.520
[Guest]: The threat from the far right is far too significant

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.680
[Guest]: It cannot be kind of, it cannot be disregarded

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.920
[Guest]: I think time has come for political parties to be more active

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:19.160
[Guest]: Political parties like the Congress to pay a lot more attention to organization

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.680
[Guest]: And mobilizing resources

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:26.920
[Guest]: But, you know, we are in a difficult situation right now

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.520
[Guest]: Because we have limited resources

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.200
[Guest]: And we are fighting this election

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.640
[Guest]: And it's not that easy

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.800
[Guest]: But let's see what the outcome is

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, if I may speculate, I mean, on the one hand, it's

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.800
[Amit Varma]: If I may say so, the Congress in recent years has seemed to be a party

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.440
[Amit Varma]: Which just wants to come to power, doesn't really believe in anything

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:47.960
[Amit Varma]: What are really the core beliefs, if I may take a skeptic's view

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.360
[Amit Varma]: But if I, you know, on the other hand, to be a two-handed economist

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:56.120
[Amit Varma]: If I, you know, one reason if I may speculate

01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:00.200
[Amit Varma]: Why liberal parties have less of an impact at the grassroots

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:05.800
[Amit Varma]: And far right parties do is that because hate is a bigger motivating factor than hope is

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, hope can become very diffused

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.320
[Amit Varma]: And there is a free rider effect and all of those things

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Whereas, you know, the more you whip up hate, the better the turnout you're going to get

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:19.800
[Amit Varma]: Which is, you know, really worrying

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, I have another question

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.560
[Amit Varma]: You guys just released your manifesto

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:27.640
[Amit Varma]: And my other question sort of goes back to the BJP manifesto of 2014

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:28.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote from your book

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.320
[Amit Varma]: Quote, the manifesto accused the UPA of not maintaining that growth

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.040
[Amit Varma]: And leaving the next government with sub 5% growth

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.520
[Amit Varma]: The BJP charged that the UPA pushed the country backwards by 20 years

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And that millions of men and women were jobless

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:44.680
[Amit Varma]: Arguing that the country had lost hope

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:47.880
[Amit Varma]: The BJP cast itself as a party that would act decisively

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.000
[Amit Varma]: To address the country's challenges on a priority basis

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:51.720
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, what strikes me is that one, obviously, that their manifesto

01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Had a lot of things in it which were good as you yourself said

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.520
[Amit Varma]: But the other thing is that this could

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.640
[Amit Varma]: This exact sentence could be used for today

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Just changing the UPA and the BJP

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Just switching them

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.400
[Amit Varma]: Where you have the Congress talking about how the BJP has done such a miserable job

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.960
[Amit Varma]: Over the last few years, which is absolutely true

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.440
[Amit Varma]: And equally promising drastic action

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, my question is, why should anyone take manifesto seriously?

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.080
[Amit Varma]: Because as we've seen, the BJP did not follow up on their manifesto of 2014

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.400
[Amit Varma]: And you know, if I can ask a specific question that struck me from your manifesto

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.720
[Amit Varma]: Like, there's lots in your manifesto to like

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:34.760
[Amit Varma]: For example, one of the promises you guys make is that

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:39.480
[Amit Varma]: Cities will be empowered and, you know, empowered mayors will be elected

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.400
[Amit Varma]: And therefore governance will be better

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.560
[Amit Varma]: But the question that struck me when I saw this was that

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.480
[Amit Varma]: Wait a minute, this is a state subject

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.920
[Amit Varma]: This is, you know, the national government has nothing to do with this at all

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.800
[Amit Varma]: The Congress is already in a power in a number of states

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.200
[Amit Varma]: And they could do this now if they wanted to

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:57.160
[Amit Varma]: So what is it in this manifesto for? Is it just posturing?

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.680
[Guest]: Well, I think it's not posturing per se

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.800
[Guest]: I think it is in some ways trying to draw a philosophical line

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.760
[Guest]: Because decentralization, like the one you talked about in terms of urban governance reforms

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.880
[Guest]: First, you know, urban governance reforms are needed, necessary

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.400
[Guest]: Without that, you can't really do much

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.320
[Guest]: At least you have to have a statement which says, look, this is important

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:22.440
[Guest]: And it is important, especially if India continues to urbanize

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:27.320
[Guest]: And by the way, I don't really believe the figure that India is 70% or 69% rural right now

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.520
[Guest]: I think a lot of what has happened is that the landscape has transformed

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.800
[Guest]: Cities and villages are getting fused together through other settlements

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.080
[Guest]: So I think India may be a bit more urbanized than we think it is

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.320
[Guest]: And for that, we need new governance systems

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.680
[Guest]: We do need decentralization

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:48.440
[Guest]: And in some ways, this is part of the Congress Party's core philosophy

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.480
[Guest]: Going back to the 73rd and 74th Amendment

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:57.000
[Guest]: Going back to what Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had wanted to do through Panchayat Raj and all that

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.600
[Guest]: So I think the aspiration remains

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.520
[Guest]: I think the philosophical statement remains

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:09.160
[Guest]: I think what we have to do a far better job of is to actually implement the thing, right?

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.560
[Guest]: To persuade governments at the state levels to say, look, we have to do this

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:20.920
[Guest]: It is, you know, in some ways, you can't really dictate to state governments these days, obviously

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:24.520
[Guest]: I mean, unless you're a BJP and you control more than half the country

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.560
[Guest]: And maybe you can

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.160
[Guest]: And that would have made it easier

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.160
[Guest]: But, you know, in some ways, you have to persuade governments

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:32.920
[Guest]: And you had to kind of create models in other states and say, look, I mean, this is working really well here

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.840
[Guest]: People are benefiting here

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.760
[Guest]: Other states should follow suit

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:41.400
[Guest]: But it is not, you know, I do think that manifestos are serious documents

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:45.640
[Guest]: If you look at the BJP's manifesto, also, they try to follow up on a lot of different things

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:51.960
[Guest]: But I think what, you know, like electrification and this thing and that thing

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.880
[Guest]: But I think what BJP missed out on was the broader kind of policy reforms

01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:03.320
[Guest]: So, in fact, if you look at all the promises, there's so many that they actually did try to follow up on

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.160
[Guest]: Whether that was the right thing or not, that's different

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.240
[Guest]: But they tried to follow up on a lot of things

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.200
[Guest]: The Congress Party, too, will, you know, this is one way to hold political parties accountable

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:21.000
[Guest]: But I do think that this particular Congress manifesto has some very important

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.040
[Guest]: Statements and that have to do with the role of the state

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:28.040
[Guest]: To my mind, I have not come across any Congress manifesto which actually says

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.880
[Guest]: That the private sector will lead through investment

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.000
[Guest]: And the public sector will focus on public goods

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.480
[Guest]: Or, you know, for the most part

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.480
[Guest]: I mean, that's a pretty interesting statement to make, right?

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.560
[Guest]: I mean, this is what people like me like

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:47.560
[Guest]: I'm sure, Amit, you also want something similar where the private sector is

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:51.160
[Guest]: At least in a statement, unleashed

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:55.880
[Guest]: And then the public sector is redefined for public goods

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.600
[Guest]: So, I think very important, very important

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:03.800
[Guest]: Also, our commitment to individual freedoms in this manifesto

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.880
[Guest]: I think that is very important

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:09.880
[Guest]: And I think part of it may be born out of our experience with the current government

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:16.840
[Guest]: And how this government has actually threatened a lot of our personal freedoms

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:22.360
[Guest]: So, maybe the next government that we hopefully have something to do with

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.360
[Guest]: Will kind of implement an agenda where we can strengthen these freedoms

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.680
[Guest]: So that whichever government comes in the future

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.320
[Guest]: At least will face the pressure from citizenry as well as institutions alike

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:36.600
[Guest]: So, I know there's a lot of cynicism

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.920
[Guest]: I know it's not misplaced

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.800
[Guest]: But at the same time, you know, we have to have some hope

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I've been writing from say the early 2000s

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.920
[Amit Varma]: About our free speech laws

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.160
[Amit Varma]: Not just the sedition law, which you guys have said you will abolish

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:52.760
[Amit Varma]: But also 295A, 153A, things you haven't mentioned

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.760
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the Congress after all was the party that banned the Satanic verses

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.880
[Amit Varma]: Which remains banned

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.440
[Amit Varma]: But I completely buy your point that it's important to change the rhetoric

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:07.800
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, that the commitment that you guys have explicitly made to individual rights

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.480
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the primacy of the private sector is great

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Let's see how much of that really happens

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:15.160
[Amit Varma]: I'll kind of...

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.120
[Amit Varma]: And regarding what you said about urban development

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.320
[Amit Varma]: Obviously, I agree with you

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.240
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode a few weeks back

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:24.280
[Amit Varma]: Which I'll link from the episode page with Ruben Abraham and Pritika Hingorani

01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:25.720
[Amit Varma]: Of the IDFC Institute

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.560
[Amit Varma]: On how India is far more urban than we think

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:33.240
[Amit Varma]: And what we should do to smooth that process

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, I've taken a lot of your time

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.240
[Amit Varma]: Sort of a final question to end with

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:45.480
[Amit Varma]: Which is, again, I ask you to answer this not wearing your hat as a Congress spokesperson

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.720
[Amit Varma]: But as wearing your hat as an Indian citizen

01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:51.880
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, much of the book is written with that hat, frankly, as I was surprised by

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.200
[Amit Varma]: But just wearing the hat of an Indian citizen

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:57.320
[Amit Varma]: If you look forward to, say, the next five years

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.800
[Amit Varma]: What gives you hope and what gives you despair?

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:07.800
[Guest]: Well, what gives me hope is that, frankly, we really need to change the rhetoric

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:12.760
[Guest]: Frankly, we've reached a bit of a crisis point as far as the economy is concerned

01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.640
[Guest]: I think the inequality, the rising inequality

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:21.320
[Guest]: And the kind of lack of good, decent job creation

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:25.080
[Guest]: Along with this demographic kind of imperative

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.160
[Guest]: I think is creating a situation where we have no choice but to act

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.880
[Guest]: So remember how sometimes we act because there's a crisis

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.200
[Guest]: I think the crisis point is reached

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.760
[Guest]: And I think we have to do something

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.200
[Guest]: I mean, no matter what government comes, I think we have to do something drastic

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.240
[Guest]: Otherwise, we're in trouble

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.520
[Guest]: I think India is in trouble otherwise

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:43.400
[Guest]: So I think I'm hoping

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:52.040
[Guest]: The hope is that policymakers understand and realize that there is a serious situation in India

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.800
[Guest]: Especially on the employment front

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:56.120
[Guest]: And by the way, that is direct linkages to inequality

01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.000
[Guest]: And that something has to be done

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.800
[Guest]: And so that gives me hope

01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.360
[Guest]: Of course, what causes me concern is that

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:07.080
[Guest]: Policymakers may not get it

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:12.280
[Guest]: And like has happened in this government's term

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.520
[Guest]: That they may actually end up doing more harm than good

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:17.880
[Guest]: In fact, one of the principles

01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:22.280
[Guest]: I actually talked about four principles of policymaking

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:25.720
[Guest]: And one of them is, you know, do no harm

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.640
[Guest]: I never thought I would have to write something like that

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.960
[Guest]: Do no harm as a principle of policymaking

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:35.480
[Guest]: But I think, you know, after the experience of this government

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:39.000
[Guest]: I'm, you know, I think it's sensible to include something like that

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:46.680
[Guest]: So yeah, so hope and caution are both linked to this moment in our history

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.040
[Guest]: And there are clear dangers ahead

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.080
[Guest]: There's a crisis

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:53.320
[Guest]: In my view, there's a crisis in the country

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.640
[Guest]: And it's only going to get worse, by the way

01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.560
[Guest]: It's not going to improve if we don't do something

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.800
[Guest]: And that gives me hope that we may end up doing something

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.240
[Guest]: Because when it's this crisis time, when it's crunch time

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:06.040
[Guest]: Some of us step forward and do something about it

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:07.960
[Guest]: And that's what I hope from the next government

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.600
