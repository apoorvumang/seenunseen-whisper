00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640
[Amit Varma]: Among the many memories I have of childhood, there are memories of food. Some of it is

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.280
[Amit Varma]: the food my mother used to cook. In that generation, alas, you won't find many fathers who did.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.760
[Amit Varma]: I loved her short shabatta much, and I also loved her fish ala kheev and the fish pulao

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.200
[Amit Varma]: she sometimes packed in my school tiffin box. I can almost taste them as I say these words.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.680
[Amit Varma]: Like any good Bengali boy, I was not a big fan of vegetables, but I did like the aloo

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.940
[Amit Varma]: posto she made. I hated pothole and kathal though, and developed a taste for begoon only

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.680
[Amit Varma]: later in life. I remember being a child in Chandigarh in the 1980s, and once in a while,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
[Amit Varma]: my dad would go to empire stores and pick up some packets of salami. My god what a treat

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.920
[Amit Varma]: that was. My college years were in Pune, and I remember the special masala dosa of Vaishali

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.520
[Amit Varma]: and the banwara of the Ferguson college canteen, and the million cups of cutting chai at the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.640
[Amit Varma]: katta. Food carries such memories with it, and is part of our emotional cells. That's

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.560
[Amit Varma]: why we have a phrase like comfort food. There is food that gives us comfort, and it does

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.280
[Amit Varma]: so because it takes us to a special place, an earlier place, maybe even when we were

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.880
[Amit Varma]: different people, or lived simpler lives, uncomplicated by our modern madness. What's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.600
[Amit Varma]: your comfort food? What food is there in your happy memories? Close your eyes. Can you smell

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.680
[Unknown]: it?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.840
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.400
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guests today are Sameer Seth and Yash Banage, who

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.760
[Amit Varma]: created waves in Mumbai a few years ago when they started the cult restaurant, Bombay Canteen.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.080
[Amit Varma]: They also went on to start my favorite restaurant in Mumbai, O Pedro, as well as Bombay Sweet

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.280
[Amit Varma]: Shop, which takes a modern look at Indian sweets, and it is so so good. Their partner

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.520
[Amit Varma]: and mentor, the great chef Floyd Cardoz, passed away in the early days of COVID. But Sameer

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: and Yash kept it together and kept it going. Sameer got in touch with me earlier this year

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.760
[Amit Varma]: to discuss a project, Enthoo Cutlet, a bi-monthly food magazine that has just launched. The

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.120
[Amit Varma]: link is in the show notes. Meeting him, I realized that all his projects originated

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.040
[Amit Varma]: from a place of passion. Sure, he turned his restaurants into successful businesses, but

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.240
[Amit Varma]: they began out of a love for food and an appreciation for the role that food plays in our lives.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.560
[Amit Varma]: And he was now looking to trace a connection between food and stories, food and identity,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.520
[Amit Varma]: food and memory. That's why Enthoo Cutlet began. I thought Sameer and Yash have had

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.720
[Amit Varma]: a fascinating journey. I invited them on the show and here they are. We spoke about how

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.120
[Amit Varma]: the culture of dining out has changed in India, how it's different from the West where both

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.520
[Amit Varma]: of them have worked, why service should not be confused with servitude, why entrepreneurs

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.840
[Amit Varma]: should not obsess about scaling, what the food industry has in common with the creator

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.920
[Amit Varma]: economy, and just their personal journeys, which I found so fascinating and instructive.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.760
[Amit Varma]: When Sameer left his corporate job to get into this business, his grandmother told him,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.240
[Amit Varma]: bang chhor ke parathe beshne ja rahe ho. My response to that is, no banker has ever been

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.840
[Amit Varma]: on the scene and the unseen. Before we begin this conversation though, let's take a quick

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840
[Amit Varma]: commercial break.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.200
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.760
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.800
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.640
[Amit Varma]: face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.440
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.000
[Amit Varma]: awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.440
[Amit Varma]: by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.640
[Amit Varma]: Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.400
[Amit Varma]: I discovered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.280
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.200
[Amit Varma]: a little better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.680
[Amit Varma]: Sameer and Yash, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you for having us. Yeah,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, I've got to say this is almost like a second take. I'll inform my listeners because

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.680
[Amit Varma]: I just started a couple of minutes ago, and we are recording in my home studio. And the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.320
[Amit Varma]: cable wasn't attached to Sameer's mic. So we've kind of had to start again. And my first

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.920
[Amit Varma]: question is no longer a surprise, but it's still going to be my first question. Before

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.480
[Amit Varma]: we started, Yash, you mentioned that, you know, I should ask you anything, you have

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.800
[Amit Varma]: nothing to hide, right? So I'm going to take you up on that. Could each of you tell me

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.840
[Amit Varma]: one thing about yourself, which the other doesn't know?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.880
[Guest 2]: Yash, you want to go first this time? As in, I honestly have nothing to hide. I think being

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.800
[Guest 2]: a true co founder, I've shared everything with you. So if you have something, then it's

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:48.560
[Guest 1]: going to hurt my heart. Truly set it up for all the drama. You sound like a married couple.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.800
[Guest 1]: I think the one tick of mine, which I was sharing with you before we discovered the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.040
[Guest 1]: lack of a wire, was that I have to do everything in even numbers. So like when I'm having a

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.160
[Guest 1]: bite of something, like it has to be two bites or four bites. And obviously, Yash is finding

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.680
[Guest 1]: this hilarious right now with jokes brimming through his brain, which he will keep to himself.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:16.320
[Amit Varma]: So many legal problems if I crack that joke. You do have two great restaurants. But yeah,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.640
[Amit Varma]: exactly. So there you go. And one great sweet company, you'll have to start another one.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.160
[Guest 2]: But is that why you didn't want to do anything on your own and you found me? Exactly. Exactly.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:35.080
[Amit Varma]: So sweet. Yeah, he completes you. My life has been meaningless. Yeah. So how did this

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.920
[Amit Varma]: habit come about? Were you always like this? As long as I can remember. And there's no

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.160
[Amit Varma]: OCD element otherwise. No, that's it. This is everything twice. Yes. What is the weirdest

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.040
[Guest 1]: thing you've done twice? That I don't know. You're leading into these jokes, I'm sure.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.840
[Guest 1]: But like, I don't think there's anything. It's just the simple everyday things that

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.680
[Guest 1]: just need to be done in twos. So even if you taste something and it's shitty, you'll still

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.680
[Guest 1]: taste it again? Probably not. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. Okay. So I'm curious

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.000
[Amit Varma]: to find out about sort of both of your childhoods and your journeys and whatever. Who should

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.080
[Guest 2]: we start with first? Let's go with Yash this time. All right. Yeah. Quick one. I was born

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.440
[Guest 2]: in Bombay. When I was a week old, my parents thought we should move to Pune. I'm in just

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.480
[Guest 2]: a quick background. My father is a neurosurgeon. My mom's an architect. And I had a brother.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.480
[Guest 2]: I have a brother. Sorry, Yuri. Who's told you not to mess this up. Who's messed my head

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.320
[Guest 2]: up before. But yeah, he's one year older to me. So we grew up in Pune. It was a beautiful

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.280
[Guest 2]: city to grow up in. And being the youngest son out of the two, my brother took the easy

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.720
[Guest 2]: way out and decided to do chemical engineering. So there's a lot of pressure to be a doctor.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.120
[Guest 2]: And I think I took the easiest way out and told people I want to do hotel management.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.960
[Guest 2]: And everyone now asks me this question, like, why did I do it? And this is pre internet,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.320
[Guest 2]: where you could make a wiser decision. And I think it was some book I read, you know,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.240
[Guest 2]: like a career counselor book, which just told you different careers. And I know my mom at

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.680
[Guest 2]: that time had already signed me up for medical entrance exam classes. And it wasn't her fault,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.080
[Guest 2]: because I also hadn't said that I don't want to do it. So yeah, but I was as lucky both

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.520
[Guest 2]: my parents were very understanding to let me go into this. This was pre when restaurants

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.160
[Guest 2]: were sexy and glamorous. So I did that I did a three year course on hotel management out

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:47.200
[Guest 2]: of Goa. And post that I started working at the reception of a hotel in Bombay for a month,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.000
[Guest 2]: got bored doing that, then moved to restaurants. And I never worked in a restaurant, a lively

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.080
[Guest 2]: restaurant and it just like the hustle and bustle just was something I really enjoyed.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.280
[Guest 2]: So I worked as a server for a good year and a half became a supervisor did that for a

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:12.400
[Guest 2]: year and then went to Cornell to do my master's. That's when I met Sam. Post that I think being

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.960
[Guest 2]: in the US like changed the way I was looking at hospitality and how I was treated like

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.520
[Guest 2]: a robot in India like you were working long hours and just yes or no. So I just like I'd

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:30.240
[Guest 2]: never traveled abroad and it was my first outing. And it just changed the way you looked

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.520
[Guest 2]: at restaurants the way they were looking at restaurants. So I decided I wanted to go back

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.120
[Guest 2]: into the industry. So after my master's, I started working as a bartender in Chicago,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:46.960
[Guest 2]: the same company I we got along really well. They moved me to Singapore to work as a jazz

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.200
[Guest 2]: bar manager. So you're 25 years old managing a jazz bar was quite glamorous.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.720
[Amit Varma]: You know who else managed a jazz bar when he was 25? Haruki Murakami. Before he became

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.200
[Amit Varma]: a novelist in the late 1970s. He owned a jazz bar and he ran it but yeah, so you're in good

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:12.120
[Guest 2]: company there. And I had no idea what jazz music is. So I think he did better. So yeah,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.920
[Guest 2]: did that I worked with this hotel group for another three years. In this time, I've been

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.960
[Guest 2]: a jazz bar manager. I've been a poolside manager. I've been a quality assurance manager. I did

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.960
[Guest 2]: a lot. And it was great experience. And I have some really, really funny stories from

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:34.320
[Guest 2]: the hotel ecosystem from figuring out what systems to use to keep birds away from eating

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:42.200
[Guest 2]: butcher muesli off a buffet to why we had to kill honeybees. So it's great, great stories

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:48.800
[Guest 2]: over drinks, but did that and I think it does one point that Sameer and me were just tired

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.960
[Guest 2]: and exhausted of working these long hours, but doing it for someone else. And he was

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:58.560
[Guest 2]: one tired call that he called me saying, and I still remember it was like, kuch karte hai.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.260
[Guest 2]: I was like, yeah, sure. And that's how the journey started.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.800
[Amit Varma]: So just to sort of double click on a few of those, it struck me when I was thinking about

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.040
[Amit Varma]: food and your journeys, that for a lot of us, obviously, you get drawn to a particular

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.720
[Amit Varma]: thing because you fall in love with some aspect of it. And then you realize that there's a

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.720
[Amit Varma]: lot of hard work and it's not so glamorous and all of that. But most things still have

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.280
[Amit Varma]: basically one dimension. You know, people might want to be a writer and then they find

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.000
[Amit Varma]: writing is hard work and that's fine. Right. But in this particular hospitality industry,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.920
[Amit Varma]: there are so many aspects to it. You could fall in love with cooking and decide to become

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.800
[Amit Varma]: a chef and then you find out that shit, it's it's not what you thought it would be. Or

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.160
[Amit Varma]: you could fall in love with cooking and come towards hotel management and then find out

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.200
[Amit Varma]: that hey, the hospitality business is a whole different thing as you must have found out

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.520
[Amit Varma]: when you were serving in Bombay and all of that. So what drew you? What made you do hotel

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.040
[Amit Varma]: management in the first place? And like, did you want to cook? Did you just like that whole

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.600
[Amit Varma]: sense of building a hospitality ecosystem environment, whatever?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:05.800
[Guest 2]: Again, like, this question gets asked a lot. And there's a couple of memories I had. So

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.920
[Guest 2]: we have a very small family in Pune. And so it was a good occasion that you went to a

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.120
[Guest 2]: restaurant like a good restaurant to eat. And our father used to take us to this hotel,

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.840
[Guest 2]: which later became the Taj, which in Pune is called the Blue Diamond. And they had a

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.800
[Guest 2]: coffee shop. I still remember we used to go there for the chicken sesame fingers. And

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.680
[Guest 2]: there used to be this manager there wearing a suit and was always orchestrating the team.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.280
[Guest 2]: And I feel I always looked up to him being like, no, seems like guy knows what he's doing.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:41.160
[Guest 2]: Like, that's one memory I have, to be honest. And apart from that, like, unlike when I look

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.960
[Guest 2]: at Sam's family and the way they eat every meal talking about the next meal, it wasn't

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.320
[Guest 2]: the same. We had great Maharashtrian food, like great fish fry, great chicken curry,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.520
[Guest 2]: so good food. But I was never a foodie as such. So I don't know if it was that image

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:04.040
[Guest 2]: of that person that really inspired me. I'm going to give a 10 second gap for your editor

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.040
[Guest 2]: to tell you a funny story on that, because I feel you might have to edit it.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.160
[Guest 2]: No, I'm not editing it out.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.360
[Guest 2]: So my first or second day of hotel management, like you said, you know, in a lot of government

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.880
[Guest 2]: colleges, ragging still continues. And there were different forms of it happening. But

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:29.160
[Guest 2]: we were served food. So as a part of our curriculum, as you go when you're senior, you have to

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.440
[Guest 2]: cook food in huge quantities. So instead of just throwing it away, you serve that in the

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.800
[Guest 2]: cafeteria. So your seniors used to serve you food. So if you were a junior, you used to

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.800
[Guest 2]: get a lot of rice and like one drop of dal. And now to get the sabzi, you would have had

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:51.880
[Guest 2]: to answer a question. So generally, it was just nonsense questions. But I remember this

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:58.920
[Guest 2]: one because I know this guy and I still know he's in the industry. And he asked me, why

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:07.520
[Guest 2]: did you join the hotel industry? And I was like, I love interacting with people. That's

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:14.000
[Amit Varma]: why and he's like, toh chinal bante the, what chinal, I'm sorry, a prostitute. Oh, okay.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.160
[Unknown]: So I mean, I laugh because I knew it was funny. But yeah, and here's the one fact I didn't

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:27.160
[Amit Varma]: know. Yeah. Which is demeaning to prostitutes, honestly, because it's an honest profession.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.760
[Guest 2]: And like, yeah, so that's like, it's been a like, for me, it's been a very heartwarming

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:40.160
[Guest 2]: journey since since then, it couldn't have gotten any lower. But I still I, in whatever

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.360
[Guest 2]: we do, I know a lot of us, I spend a lot of time now in ideation and like behind the scenes.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.920
[Guest 2]: But when we are in our restaurants, and like, just the drama unfolding and operations going

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.360
[Guest 2]: on food going out, it's just that energy, I think that keeps me going. I think that's

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:02.440
[Amit Varma]: what drove me towards it as well. And was there also an element of then learning how

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.360
[Amit Varma]: to get along with people figuring out all of those dynamics, because it's one thing

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.680
[Amit Varma]: to an abstract, say, right here, like hanging with people are like coordinating things.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.680
[Amit Varma]: But when you're like, what was the reality like when you actually got into the industry

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:23.520
[Guest 2]: here and in the US, for example. So reality here is, it's in a non censored way, it was

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:31.080
[Guest 2]: very, very difficult. I also think as I joined, started to work when I was 20, I was a very

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.880
[Guest 2]: naive 20 year old. So when I was working, and I'm not kidding, when I was working 16

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.720
[Guest 2]: hours a day, I still was energetic after 16 hours a day, and I was just enjoying it. Now,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.880
[Guest 2]: what happens is a lot of hotels in India, especially come from international brand standards.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.360
[Guest 2]: So there is someone in Canada saying, cappuccino needs to be served in four minutes, fine.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.720
[Guest 2]: But if I'm serving breakfast to 500 people, and the Indian owner decided that this restaurant

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:06.720
[Guest 2]: of 100 covers, or 100 seats for everyone can have only one cappuccino maker. And in India,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.880
[Guest 2]: cappuccino is the one common coffee order. It just can't happen. So you have to be on

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:17.920
[Guest 2]: roller skates. That hustle of you know, we, for me at that time, I was like a horse in

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.240
[Guest 2]: a race with those blinders on. And my target was five minutes of cappuccino. Like those

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:29.520
[Guest 2]: things got instilled in me in the Indian restaurant system was a standard, you have to follow

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.280
[Guest 2]: it. There's no idea why it was we've never saw the bigger picture. We used to have a

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:42.520
[Guest 2]: white asparagus festival, Italian festival, we never tasted that white asparagus, we never

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:48.040
[Guest 2]: got to taste the food to explain it. So if I'm explaining it to a guest at the restaurant,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.080
[Guest 2]: then I would use to say, this pizza is going to have cheese and don't have white asparagus.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.760
[Guest 2]: I'm not going to tell him that the texture is going to be it's going to be nice and crunchy,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.800
[Guest 2]: the white asparagus will be a little bit sour. All those things never came to your mind because

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:06.440
[Guest 2]: you never tasted the food. But then, and I feel now it's changed a lot. There was no

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:14.800
[Guest 2]: respect given to you from team members. And from guests in team members, there was always

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.600
[Guest 2]: that we've come up the ranks the hard way. So you have to do it as well. I feel that's

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:26.080
[Guest 2]: there in every industry in India. But I honestly feel that's changed a lot. But from the guests

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:33.520
[Guest 2]: also, it was the same. There's a slight like you are a lower entitlement and like that

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.800
[Guest 2]: sense of entitlement. I remember serving someone a bowl of French fries. And this is that like

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.440
[Guest 2]: one in the morning. So definitely that person was also nursing a hangover or drunk. And

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.160
[Guest 2]: you know, there's one fry which will have that one dark brown into it. And it was right

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.800
[Guest 2]: on top of the fire. And the first thing he points out and he says, it's burnt. And the

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.360
[Guest 2]: first thing you're taught is just to apologize. And I was like, I'm sorry. So he stood up

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.600
[Guest 2]: and he didn't he didn't slap me, but he moved his arm and he's like, if I slap you right

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.600
[Guest 2]: now and say sorry, that's fine, right? And like you again, say sorry, and just like,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.080
[Guest 2]: you know, take it away. As in there are instances like that, for me in that moment, didn't mean

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.040
[Guest 2]: anything like I was obviously a bit nervous. And when I start thinking back into it, like

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.240
[Guest 2]: if it was someone who was a bit more sensitive to that situation could have thrown him out

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:33.520
[Guest 2]: of the industry. And it's happened to many 90% of my my classmates. In the first year

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:39.320
[Guest 2]: of us graduating, I feel 50% of them would have joined a call center, or maybe the airline

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:47.400
[Guest 2]: industry. But within the next two, three years, I would say 90% of them were out of the industry.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.200
[Amit Varma]: So sort of related question to both of you, like, one thing that people often say quite

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.080
[Amit Varma]: correctly is that if you want to understand, like one way to figure out the real character

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:01.080
[Amit Varma]: of a person is to see how he or she treats people lower in status to them, like the wait

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:07.480
[Amit Varma]: staff and all that. And in India, honestly, most people would fail that test, right? And

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:13.320
[Amit Varma]: there is, and I'm just wondering about why, you know, of all people, you'd imagine that

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.840
[Amit Varma]: we would be though we are desperately poor country, you know, we would be the most sensitive

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:24.040
[Amit Varma]: to that, and the most empathetic to that. And yet we are the most rudest, most entitled

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.040
[Amit Varma]: bunch of, I mean, I'm sorry for generalizing and it's on my limited experience of what

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:33.320
[Amit Varma]: I've seen you guys no doubt have a far bigger sample size to judge from. But why do you

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:38.320
[Amit Varma]: think that is? And is it generally the case that Indians do tend to be more entitled and,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, the class and status plays such a big part in this?

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.400
[Guest 1]: We've spoken about this so much over the last eight years that we've been running Hunger

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:52.720
[Guest 1]: Inc, which is the company. We always say in India, like service equals servitude. Wow.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.760
[Guest 1]: And that is what you've been taught up to do, right? Like the thought that someone serving

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.000
[Guest 1]: you is beneath you in a certain way, just because of the class distinctions we've all

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.880
[Guest 1]: grown up with around us. That's the model we've always seen. And that is so ingrained

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:14.360
[Guest 1]: that it's very hard to break. And one of the biggest things which we have, I feel, worked

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:21.040
[Guest 1]: on is like, how do you instill that confidence in whoever is serving you or making you your

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.600
[Guest 1]: drink or cooking that dish for you, to have that conversation as an equal? It's hard,

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:32.320
[Guest 1]: it's not easy to sort of break years and years of conditioning to someone walks into a restaurant,

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.560
[Guest 1]: they're obviously of a different socioeconomic class, you are serving them, you know your

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:42.800
[Guest 1]: life and it's a confidence gap there in having the conversation. And funnily enough, it's

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.160
[Guest 1]: the same people who go abroad and like, wow, the service and like, oh my god, like these

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.720
[Guest 1]: guys showed me such a great time, they treated me like an equal, they showed me around, they

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.480
[Guest 1]: give us their recommendation lists, etc, etc, because it's a conversation between equals.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.360
[Guest 1]: And that so often doesn't happen here because of just the conditioning we've all gone through.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:09.880
[Guest 1]: Like I remember when I switched out of banking and was joining the hospitality world, like

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:16.280
[Guest 1]: it or not, my grandmom said, bank chhod ke parathe beshne jaa rahe ho. And that is, and

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.560
[Guest 1]: she said it in the sweetest possible way, but it's that same conditioning that you're

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.400
[Guest 1]: used to. And that's just the reality of it, right? Like you can't...

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a great title for your biography also, bank chhod ke parathe beshne jaa rahe ho,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
[Guest 2]: lovely.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.880
[Guest 1]: I love this Ferrari.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.340
[Guest 1]: So and I think it's so true, you can make out so much of a person in seeing them sort

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:46.800
[Guest 1]: of deal with someone in a restaurant. It says more than any conversation does, in my opinion.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.280
[Amit Varma]: And how do you train your guys to deal with the exact kind of situation that you just

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.800
[Amit Varma]: described Yash that you have someone and you can't even if you even politely tell him please

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.320
[Amit Varma]: don't talk like that, he'll lose it even more, right? So how do you?

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.080
[Guest 2]: So you know, one of the things and I completely agree with what Sam said, and Sam's always

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:11.560
[Guest 2]: been the much more calmer, level headed, mature person in it. And...

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.560
[Guest 1]: It's on the record.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:19.840
[Guest 2]: The worry is, it's happened. And I say it's improved a lot. Like, I see a drastic change

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:25.040
[Guest 2]: in the way all of us interact. But I still remember one of the early incidents which

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:32.880
[Guest 2]: scarred me. And I was 28, 29. And it was at Bombay Canteen. But the girl who was working

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.800
[Guest 2]: with us, standing next to me was her first job. So she must have been 20. And we were

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.640
[Guest 2]: both at the desk and this guest just went at me and he wasn't going at her, he was going

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:50.560
[Guest 2]: at me. And it was about us not giving a table to one of his friends who didn't have a reservation.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:56.880
[Guest 2]: But someone else got it and he looked at that person's socioeconomic class and said, like,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.820
[Guest 2]: you need to realize in life, some people need you need to be given better treatment too.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.960
[Guest 2]: And he was using words like that. And when you look at these people, these are people

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.300
[Guest 2]: who are well educated, who've grown up in a great family, and that's the least expected

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.280
[Guest 2]: thing from their mouth. But what I'm more worried about is this girl, who's just got

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.960
[Guest 2]: into the industry, and she's going to be scarred for life. So there are some instances, to

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:28.120
[Guest 2]: be honest, where it then needs us to counsel the employees after. But before it, we always

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:34.240
[Guest 2]: say is something that industry leaders or hospitality leaders called Danny Meyer, Sameer

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.360
[Guest 2]: worked with him, said, and he's written a book, it's called setting the table, which

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.240
[Guest 2]: I is the first book I tell people when they want to join the industry. And he came about

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:49.880
[Guest 2]: this about hospitality first, is treat your team how you would like to be treated or treat

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.720
[Guest 2]: their employees how you would be treated. And his whole thing was as an owner, if you

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.800
[Guest 2]: treat them with respect, they will treat your guests with respect. So it starts with us,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:03.000
[Guest 2]: right. And it starts with as simple as if we are having lunch, or if you're having dinner

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.400
[Guest 2]: with them, pick up your own plate and go and keep it in the back area. You can't, you know,

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.680
[Guest 2]: we have we are all sitting together, everything is a signal, everything is a signal, right.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.280
[Guest 2]: And it needs to start from there. I also we say this a lot, our restaurant team today

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.160
[Guest 2]: don't see us as often helping them out, because there's so many things on our book. But first

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.200
[Guest 2]: two years of Bombay Canteen, like we were there every day, we used to take the we had

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:33.200
[Guest 2]: a phone like a thing, we used to take it home one day and with the book. So at night, if

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.360
[Guest 2]: anyone called, we used to take reservations, like people were calling at odd times used

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:43.640
[Guest 2]: to be like, why? And seeing you in the trenches with them, the way we are talking to guests,

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.600
[Guest 2]: and we used to always tell them at any point, you feel that there's a sense of abuse or

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:54.120
[Guest 2]: something that is unfair. Come to us. Don't, don't tell me after and we've had and they've

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.080
[Guest 1]: seen us telling guests to politely leave the restaurant being like, and that incident that

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.320
[Guest 1]: Yash referred to was the start of our blacklist. Like if you are rude to anyone, we don't want

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.600
[Guest 1]: your business. And you're definitely not welcome back. Amazing. And you've actually kicked

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.040
[Guest 1]: people out of the restaurant. We've actually told people to leave. Yeah, we've told people

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.680
[Guest 1]: to leave. And especially like it, you know, when you're starting off as your own business,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.480
[Guest 1]: you're unsure about so many things. Like I think it took us two, three incidents, especially

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.080
[Guest 1]: in the early days of Bombay Canteen, it was mayhem, like, you know, good way for us. Like

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.040
[Guest 1]: it was everyone wanted to be there. And everyone wanted to come in. And, but we realized very

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.400
[Guest 1]: quickly, like if we didn't draw a line in the sand at that point, like the signal it

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.320
[Guest 1]: would send to our teams that we don't stand by them was far worse in the long run. And

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.800
[Guest 1]: for the culture we were hoping to build than anything else. And that's something like we

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.440
[Guest 1]: just took a conscious decision to sort of follow through on. And so and every, every,

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.500
[Guest 1]: every situation is different. So you have to treat it as such. But I think it's something

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:03.200
[Guest 1]: we've tried to stand by at every given point that especially if you are, if you have a

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.480
[Guest 1]: right to, if you've done something wrong, 100%, we should make amends. But that does

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.920
[Guest 1]: not give you the right to be abusive. It does not give you the right to be rude at all.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.480
[Guest 1]: There's nothing you've done or bought to the restaurant that gives you that entitlement

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480
[Guest 1]: that we're clear on.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.960
[Guest 2]: But do you know that same thing you spoke about? Like there's that saying that the way

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.080
[Guest 2]: someone treats someone at a restaurant, I think in today's day and age, today's day

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.440
[Guest 2]: and age, India, it should be about how we treat the delivery guy, right? The Amazon

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.520
[Guest 2]: guy when they call. So we've, both of us have done, we do a lot of deliveries, especially

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.880
[Guest 2]: when Bombay Sweetshop opened during COVID, like we just didn't have people, right? So

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:50.320
[Guest 2]: as in, orders needed to go out, they needed to go out. So obviously, like I have a car.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.760
[Guest 2]: So then I used to be sitting and then he used to be the navigator. And like, we did like

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.600
[Guest 2]: 25 deliveries a day. So it was painful. But we had the luxury of sitting in a car and

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:06.200
[Guest 2]: going. So most security guards, when they saw the car, used to think I'm a guest. And

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest 2]: then when I said, no, I've come for a delivery, the tone also changes. Right now, I was just,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.880
[Guest 2]: we used to always discuss this, that, imagine we are sitting in a car, still there's a,

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.280
[Guest 2]: but complete difference. And like, even the simpler things, yaha jao, waha jao, like even

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.400
[Guest 2]: the way that because that's such a big industry now, right? Like the way delivery guys are

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:30.440
[Guest 2]: treated. We've changed a lot of things on our side, once we started doing deliveries

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.440
[Guest 2]: on how do you make their lives a bit easier? Because first, even we used to think that,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.520
[Guest 2]: you know, why can't they do more deliveries, x, y and z? How do you make the load lighter

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:45.360
[Guest 2]: for them? Because once we did it, and we're like, this is not easy at all. And we've done

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.360
[Guest 2]: like every peak festival, may it be Raksha Bandhan, Diwali, we have to do it. So now

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:56.320
[Guest 2]: we do it in separate cars, because it's better to have him with a driver and a navigator

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:01.080
[Guest 2]: and like, just do more. But even the way like when you pick up the phone and call someone

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.640
[Guest 2]: and say, Hi, I have a delivery from Bombay Sweetshop. And they are just like, haa, chod

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest 2]: do security ke paas. Right? Like, so I think that same thing is like, for me changed the

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.560
[Guest 2]: way even I started like when Amazon calls me being like, I can't find your address because

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.800
[Guest 2]: Indians can't write addresses. Honestly, I don't know why it's so we don't put it as

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.960
[Guest 2]: per that the Google way of putting it so we'll write opposite people kajad. Google doesn't

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:31.080
[Guest 2]: pick that up on our automatic system, right? So it's changed my perception on when Amazon

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.480
[Guest 2]: will call me saying address name and our delivery. So I think that's the next learning for us

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.960
[Guest 2]: is like, how do we get better at that as well?

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.120
[Amit Varma]: That's a fantastic learning for me as well. And I'm guessing there are like, a few hundred

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:49.920
[Amit Varma]: people listening to this thinking, fuck, my delivery was brought by those guys. Why was

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.280
[Guest 1]: I rude to him? People do get shocked, like, especially first two years of Bombay Canteen

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.320
[Guest 1]: as Yash was saying, like when he and I would walk up with like the plates or take an order

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.720
[Guest 1]: and even now in the last two years at the sweet shop and we show up with the delivery.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.240
[Guest 1]: Like, it's funny, right? It goes back to the same conditioning that we were talking about.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:16.520
[Guest 1]: Like you're just, you're the owner. Are you sure? So, and I think it's just culturally

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:22.000
[Guest 1]: ingrained in us, unfortunately. And so, as in the hope and dream is that slowly but surely

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.320
[Guest 1]: like that evolves.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.680
[Amit Varma]: So let's let's talk about your journey now, Sam. And you weren't even you took a very

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.760
[Amit Varma]: different route to getting into this business. So tell me a little bit about that and what

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.760
[Guest 1]: you did before you sold parathas.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.880
[Guest 1]: I think life started with like being around food as Yash was talking about earlier, like

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.800
[Guest 1]: I come from a family that spends every meal talking about the next meal. I was born in

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:52.520
[Guest 1]: Lucknow, but grew up a little bit all over Bangalore, Calcutta, and but mostly in Delhi,

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.440
[Guest 1]: and come from a large family that's obsessed with food. And I think when I'd always seen

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.280
[Guest 1]: that, but also, I think, came from a family that was my dad was in the corporate side

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:08.400
[Guest 1]: of things in the tech industry, my mom was a teacher. And it was always expected that

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.240
[Guest 1]: you would do certain things to progress your career. So I did an undergrad in chemistry,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.440
[Guest 1]: and then went on to do an MBA from I am cozy code two years in Kerala were amazing. But

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:25.360
[Guest 1]: as a 22 year old, doing an MBA, like I didn't know the O of organize OB, which was organizational

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.120
[Guest 1]: behavior, what it meant I'd never worked before, like, so you're theoretically learning all

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.560
[Guest 1]: this, but you do have no idea. And then you did the next logical thing, you apply to all

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.880
[Guest 1]: these companies, I was fortunate enough to get a job with Citibank and came to Bombay

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:46.000
[Guest 1]: in 2005. And I think around then, I like loved working in Bombay with Citibank. And like

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.640
[Guest 1]: at that point, like, I was in the mortgage division over here. And funnily enough, my

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.600
[Guest 1]: life has always revolved around real estate as a result, whether in banking or in restaurants.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.480
[Guest 1]: And, but at that time, also realized that as I was doing it, I would move back to Delhi,

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.480
[Guest 1]: like, this thought had always struck me when I was in college that I wanted to do something

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.080
[Guest 1]: around the world of food, but had no idea how to do it. Like at every time, point in

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.080
[Guest 1]: time that I'd wanted to do something close to hotel management or food, I was always

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:22.640
[Guest 1]: told that career myth or a kuch kardo and then go look at that right. And I think in

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.760
[Guest 1]: 2007, I was like, I'm done. Like, I think this is as far as I can go. Like it was two

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.120
[Guest 1]: and a half years in as a 26 year old, I was like, really like questioning what was going

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:39.160
[Guest 1]: to happen next, because I was up for a move in the bank. And every move that was being

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:45.160
[Guest 1]: presented to me didn't make sense. And without telling my parents, I had a conversation with

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.600
[Guest 1]: a restaurant I used to, it was run by some people we knew, so went and met one of the

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:58.560
[Guest 1]: partners one day. And he was a jovial guy, like, I still remember, Sanghi uncle was like,

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.760
[Guest 1]: ha beta, ajo, like, join. So this was a small restaurant group in Delhi. And in all the

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.560
[Guest 1]: excitement that someone has given me, offered me a job, I went and without talking to anyone,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:15.760
[Guest 1]: I quit. And obviously, this is even funnier, because I went and met Sanghi uncle's partner

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.560
[Guest 1]: a few weeks later before I was supposed to join. And the guy was like, yeah, I heard

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.000
[Guest 1]: you were joining. I don't know what you're going to do. And but you join, we'll figure

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.840
[Guest 1]: out and then we'll see how much salary to give you after we figured out what and I didn't

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:36.560
[Guest 1]: have the proverbial balls to go tell my parents that I'm joining, but no money is coming in.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:43.360
[Guest 1]: I've just quit banking. And I'm joining, which is when my grandmom famously regaled, bank

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.440
[Guest 1]: chod ke parathe beshne ja rahe ho. If she'd known ki paise bhi nahi ban rahe to, next

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.240
[Guest 1]: level of conversations, but I kept that to myself for a fairly long time. And I think

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.320
[Guest 1]: at that stage, fortunately, like we were they were in the process of opening three restaurants

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.400
[Guest 1]: in Delhi. And I just deep dove into that, like and I loved every minute of it, the energy

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.320
[Guest 1]: of it, the craziness of it, there is a certain adrenaline you get when you're on the floor

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.320
[Guest 1]: of a restaurant. And I was more on the marketing finance side of things. And long story short,

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.880
[Guest 1]: these guys saw value in what I brought to the table and came in and I learned a lot

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:23.720
[Guest 1]: about what this business was about, like in the deep end of it, there was it was like

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.560
[Guest 1]: learning by doing. And the first year was amazing, opened three restaurants at complete

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.280
[Guest 1]: high and then the tides turned on them, shut almost six, seven restaurants over the next

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:38.560
[Guest 1]: two years and saw the full sort of trajectory of what to do. And at that point, I always

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:44.080
[Guest 1]: wanted to do my own thing, but had no clue about like, what it was how to do it had spent

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.240
[Guest 1]: about a couple of years in the industry, it was a confusing time. And fortunately, I had

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.760
[Guest 1]: a friend's father who was a mentor to me, who convinced me and showed me about what

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.320
[Guest 1]: the Cornell Hotel School can do. And I'm so glad I took that decision. Only because like

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.600
[Guest 1]: I feel as Yash was mentioning earlier, like it really opens your mind to step out of India

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:08.840
[Guest 1]: and go into another sort of education system. And he and I were classmates there, met the

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.040
[Guest 1]: first night, drank till four in the morning, joked about like we were on the F&B track

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.360
[Guest 1]: of our class. And we joked that even at that point that someday we'll do something together.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.800
[Guest 1]: And I think but what was amazing about Cornell was like, it just allowed you to ask questions,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:27.200
[Guest 1]: it allowed you to like just deep dive into whatever you wanted. We had a few professors

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:34.840
[Guest 1]: in the F&B system who just were great at like mentoring you to ask questions of the things

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.480
[Guest 1]: which you never thought were important. One of the first things like when and her name

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.160
[Guest 1]: Stephanie Robson, she used to teach a class called restaurant development. When she heard

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.200
[Guest 1]: my story of like having gone through the experience in Delhi, she was like, what you should do

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.000
[Guest 1]: is sounds like there were a lot of things that went wrong, but you should go do an independent

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.080
[Guest 1]: study and see what did restaurants here in the US do to avoid the same pitfalls. And

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.720
[Guest 1]: she sort of became my sort of guide at that point and allowed me to do a six month independent

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.240
[Guest 1]: study, which was just a reflection on my last three years is what it turned out to be, but

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.800
[Guest 1]: also opened the doors to have conversations with many interesting people to see how do

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.680
[Guest 1]: you do what you do in this business. And it was a complete change in terms of like, to

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.000
[Guest 1]: give you a simple example, my first job in New York was with a French restaurant group

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.080
[Guest 1]: called, which was run by the chef called Daniel Boulud. We have a ritual in every restaurant

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.720
[Guest 1]: across the world, it's followed, it's called briefing. Before every meal, lunch or dinner,

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.840
[Guest 1]: the team meets and you brief each other and what's coming up in the next few hours. India

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.560
[Guest 1]: typically it would be a grooming check, like is your uniform like straight, are your nails

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.640
[Guest 1]: clipped, is your light, those days smoking used to be allowed, is your lighter working

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.640
[Guest 1]: so that in case someone needs a light, you get that. And here on the flip side, my second

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.920
[Guest 1]: day here, and this is the point Yash was making, we were tasting the specials of the day we

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.240
[Guest 1]: were having being trained on the wine briefing was one and a half hours long, where it was

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:11.240
[Guest 1]: an education period for the entire team to see what how do you do what you do, and not

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:18.640
[Guest 1]: just check a few boxes and now go and sell some food. And it was crazy because I'd never

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.240
[Guest 1]: been in an environment like that. And following up with that is when I met Chef Floyd, I'd

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.640
[Guest 1]: met him a little earlier and the hope and dream was always to work with him and Danny

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:35.920
[Guest 1]: Meyer, who wrote setting the table because like, as I think both of us read the book

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.880
[Guest 1]: at the same time. This was something which was just like radical thinking from what we

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.680
[Guest 1]: had been brought up and I wanted to be in that system to see how it actually sort of

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.680
[Guest 1]: came to life and to be able to get a chance to work with Danny to work with Chef Floyd

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.960
[Guest 1]: to actually open a restaurant in New York City was like an unbelievable experience,

00:36:53.960 --> 00:37:00.120
[Guest 1]: like got thrown into the deep end, absolutely. And that one one year and a few months was

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.840
[Guest 1]: like, the hardest I've ever worked I feel and I think we've done many more hard things

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:12.480
[Guest 1]: but because it was so new to me, it just feels much harder. And but like the relationships

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.840
[Guest 1]: when made the like, I'm still in touch with like, my colleagues from then like, it was

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.360
[Guest 1]: almost like you went to battle together like opening a restaurant in New York was like,

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.840
[Guest 1]: you go through the review system of the New York Times, which is a whole story on itself.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.640
[Guest 1]: And like you deal with guests who expect the best and want the best and how do you give

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.880
[Guest 1]: it to them and it all boils down to like the culture, the education, like it's all sort

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.480
[Guest 1]: of slow and steady building, it doesn't happen overnight, like that was the biggest thing.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:46.600
[Guest 1]: So and all of it like kind of started informing the kind of restaurant I would hope to open

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:52.360
[Guest 1]: one day and that kind of led to that call to Yash eventually, wherein we were like,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.520
[Guest 1]: we want to do this back back home and we spent a lot of time, obviously, you have to come

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.040
[Guest 1]: up with the concept of what you're doing, but also about how we want to do it. And I

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:05.440
[Guest 1]: think we've touched on some of the topics around service and respect. All of this came

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.960
[Guest 1]: from some of those experiences that one had, because if I hadn't seen it play out firsthand,

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:17.000
[Guest 1]: where respect actually leads to better outcomes, like maybe we would have had very different

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.960
[Guest 1]: sort of outlooks to life. But I'm glad we were exposed to that we were privileged to

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.800
[Guest 1]: be exposed to that and, and better for it now.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.320
[Amit Varma]: So a bunch of things I want to double click on. And first is a personal element that when

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.640
[Amit Varma]: you decide to give up banking to make parathas, as it were, there is a push and there is a

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.920
[Amit Varma]: pull, there is a push in the sense that there is a reason you don't want to do banking anymore,

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.440
[Amit Varma]: you feel it's not for you. And then there is a pull that you want to be part of this

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.240
[Amit Varma]: industry. And as you know, in Yash's case, as he pointed out, he loved interacting with

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:51.560
[Amit Varma]: people and just that whole experience of being a guy in a suit in a hotel saying, white asparagus

00:38:51.560 --> 00:39:02.320
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about the push and the pull for you. And just in terms of sort

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.280
[Amit Varma]: of getting to understand you better, what was it that made you feel the banking world

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.600
[Amit Varma]: in the corporate world was not for you? And what was it that really attracted you to this

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.360
[Amit Varma]: food business?

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.760
[Guest 1]: I think that I think there are two aspects to it. I think in college, there was a festival

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.320
[Guest 1]: that was happening, St Stephen's used to have a festival called Harmony. And I was part

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.840
[Guest 1]: of the organization committee in it. And I think there was something about like being

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.840
[Guest 1]: on that organization committee, especially first year, I remember, where like bringing

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:38.120
[Guest 1]: something to life from the scratch, like had this aura in my mind, like it was just like

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:44.680
[Guest 1]: exhilarating. But also like, I think food for me has been a very, as I was saying earlier,

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.360
[Guest 1]: like being a very central aspect of like, no one was in the industry. But my aunts would

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:55.000
[Guest 1]: be like amazing cooks. And like, they would constantly be talking about what what's being

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.680
[Guest 1]: made, we would go out as a family more and more as we grew up. And it was amazing to

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.680
[Guest 1]: walk into like, I still remember there was this one restaurant in Delhi at the Hyatt.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.560
[Guest 1]: I think it was called Angan and they had this one kebab, which was like basically a fried

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:15.480
[Guest 1]: egg. And the yolk had been removed. And there was a kebab hidden beneath the yolk. And I

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:20.280
[Guest 1]: don't know, is this memory I have of seeing it and being like, I love eggs, I love meat,

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:25.520
[Guest 1]: this is perfect. And like it was one of those. It was one of those moments where you don't

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.200
[Guest 1]: forget, we were talking earlier at lunch as well, like there's something about the memories

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:35.960
[Guest 1]: around food, which is just so strong. And I was very clear as a 22 year old that I wanted

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.600
[Guest 1]: to be in the world of food somehow. I don't know where that push and pull as you call

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.960
[Guest 1]: it came from. I think it was just, again, just the growing up around food that has caused

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:50.760
[Guest 1]: it. And I have an uncle who is a phenomenal, phenomenal cook. So every childhood would

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:55.760
[Guest 1]: be he lived across Bangkok and Dubai, etc, would be traveling to him. And I remember

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.260
[Guest 1]: in Bangkok, like he would make some of the best Thai food, as in one had never been exposed

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:06.880
[Guest 1]: to like regional Thai food or anything, but just watching him cook would be like, unbelievable.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.360
[Guest 1]: And I think all these experiences added up to just saying that this is what I want to

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.840
[Guest 1]: do, this is what I want to do. And eventually led to that tipping point, so to speak of

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.840
[Guest 1]: taking that steps. And once I stepped behind the curtain, as I think you were saying earlier,

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.320
[Guest 1]: like people then realize it's too hard and then back off. Like I wanted to get more and

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.120
[Guest 1]: more into it. It was no turning back at that point.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.640
[Amit Varma]: And when you talk of the differences between, you know, what you saw the the asking questions

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.560
[Amit Varma]: of figuring out the why's behind everything, you know, why give a cappuccino in four minutes,

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.600
[Amit Varma]: for example, and you look at India, you know, what, how much of a mental shift was that

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:48.720
[Amit Varma]: because I imagine that if if the culture on the serving side is different, it is both

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:54.000
[Amit Varma]: by it is both caused by and a cause of the culture on the eating side being different.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.360
[Amit Varma]: So over here, my imagination would be or thinking back on the 80s and the 90s, the rare occasions

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.000
[Amit Varma]: in the 80s, when our parents would take us out, is that you're going out and you're going

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.240
[Amit Varma]: to get good food. And that's it. And nobody else really exists. You know, the experience

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.440
[Amit Varma]: per se is you know, you want to be in a fancy place with air conditioning, but that's a

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.760
[Amit Varma]: five star hotel, five star hotel. And that's a food experience and you're getting the food

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.680
[Amit Varma]: and at the same time at the serving end from what you describe and what I've heard from

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.600
[Amit Varma]: others, it can very much be a life of drudgery for everybody except the people at the top

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.600
[Amit Varma]: making the decisions or, you know, for everyone else, you're just kind of ticking boxes making

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.000
[Amit Varma]: 800 cappuccinos a day in four minutes each, for example. And I don't find that exciting.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, if I was to be part of the profession, you know, what is there to motivate me to

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.520
[Amit Varma]: say ki 20 saal baad mein chef banunga? You know, so how different is that? How different

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:49.760
[Amit Varma]: are the food cultures of these places? And would you, you know, you mentioned that you

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.200
[Amit Varma]: were excited anyway, by your experience in Delhi, setting up those restaurants and everything

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:59.360
[Amit Varma]: that happened by just the activity and the buzz of creating something new. But in general,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.120
[Amit Varma]: do you think that the industries are so different as to be almost entirely different?

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:08.440
[Guest 1]: Between the two countries? Yeah, I think so. I think but it's converging now. I think you're

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:13.680
[Guest 1]: seeing a convergence over a period of time. I think it's slow. I think it goes back to

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:20.040
[Guest 1]: the point I was making where like, if you start involving those who are serving and

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:26.200
[Guest 1]: part of the service team into the thinking behind the product and thinking behind the

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.280
[Guest 1]: food, and that's what we kind of do, right? Like, chef Hussain, for example, will go out

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:36.680
[Guest 1]: and like, talk to the team and talk about like, what was his thinking, when he was thinking

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:42.520
[Guest 1]: when he was creating the dish, and while they're tasting it. So it's starting to connect the

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:49.000
[Guest 1]: dots on that. And then you, if you have loved it, think about it, like if you are a server,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.920
[Guest 1]: you eaten something that evening, and now you have to go relay that experience, not

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.560
[Guest 1]: something you've memorized, but an experience you had yourself to a guest is going to be

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.600
[Guest 1]: a completely different conversation. And he and I always talk, Yash and I always talk

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:07.400
[Guest 1]: about like, a restaurant's instant validation, you know, when someone's enjoying themselves,

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.480
[Guest 1]: and you will feed off that energy, if you're serving someone. And I think that was one

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:17.080
[Guest 1]: of the hardest things in the pandemic, like, for our teams was, you were working, you were

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.600
[Guest 1]: doing the same work, but you were packing it in a box and shipping it out. There was

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:26.160
[Guest 1]: no one to interact with, there was no one to like, no one smile to sort of feed off

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.760
[Guest 1]: and things to deal with. They were all sort of logistical tasks that you were doing. And

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.960
[Guest 1]: I think that in itself tells you just psychologically how, what a difference it makes to be in a

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:42.440
[Guest 1]: physical world versus a digital world. And I think, slowly but surely, we see more and

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:49.320
[Guest 1]: more restaurants in this city and in other cities in India sort of moving towards this.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:56.260
[Guest 2]: And so I have a contesting view on why they've been different also, because if you look at

00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:04.400
[Guest 2]: the Western world, anyone and anyone at some point worked in a restaurant, you might be

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:10.400
[Guest 2]: a famous actor now, but when you were between 16 to 20, you've waited tables, you might

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:16.200
[Guest 2]: be an entrepreneur or a businessman, and they've done it. So that respect is there, because

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:25.640
[Guest 2]: I personally waited tables. And even now, like even when we travel, and this is I don't

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:35.520
[Guest 2]: like fancy meals at all. So even at the fun, casual restaurants, the servers who are taking

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:41.520
[Guest 2]: care of you could be a film student. So he or she is getting this amazing personality

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:47.400
[Guest 2]: to the table. And all you have to do is just train him or her to understand the dish, but

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:53.440
[Guest 2]: the way they're explaining it is so joyous, right? And it just creates a different experience.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:59.880
[Guest 2]: That doesn't happen here, you know, and I always feel like I tell Sameer, his banking,

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.400
[Guest 2]: it's been so long back, but his chain of thought or the way he thinks about something, and

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.040
[Guest 2]: he brought that into the hospitality industry is what this industry needs. We don't need

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:16.960
[Guest 2]: people who go to hotel management, right? We don't there is nothing like now, the reason

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.800
[Guest 2]: I feel the world's are getting better for us is now for my team, like even coffee earlier,

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:28.520
[Guest 2]: we were just pulling it out of a WMF machine. Now coffee also has got its own respect, you

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:34.040
[Guest 2]: can get I think Bombay is making some of the best coffee in the world right now, right?

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:39.920
[Guest 2]: So they can see their passion in that we started something called as canteen class, where on

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.120
[Guest 2]: a Saturday, we used to shut down the restaurant in the afternoons. And we used to invite students

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:52.880
[Guest 2]: from all hospitality schools. And it wasn't mandatory. And it came from when I was in

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:58.600
[Guest 2]: hospitality school in Goa. And when I started working my first job, and someone gave me

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.840
[Guest 2]: a bottle of wine to open, I didn't know how to open a bottle of wine, because I never

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.840
[Guest 2]: saw a bottle of wine in in three years of his life. I saw an empty bottle of wine, which

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:12.600
[Guest 2]: Pepsi was filled in and I was pouring out of it. So for me, when we started Bombay canteen,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.160
[Guest 2]: I remember telling him after the first year, I was like, we need to do something for these

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:22.840
[Guest 2]: students, because they might not join us. But I still feel education level in some of

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.920
[Guest 2]: these schools is not great. And I was going to some of these schools to just give some

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:34.560
[Guest 2]: kind of inspirational in quotes talks. But I was being filtered by the dean of that school

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.880
[Guest 2]: to say what actually I wanted to say. And what I actually wanted to say was hotel management

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:48.560
[Guest 2]: schools in India are conveyor belts for hotels to get robots. That's it is just a factory

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.880
[Guest 2]: robots come out of it. Whereas now if you look at the hospitality industry, you could

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.960
[Guest 2]: be making some of the best cheese at home. Someone needs to inspire these kids to think

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.800
[Guest 2]: about that you could be making the best beer. Everything has become so much more accessible.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:10.640
[Guest 2]: And we as industry leaders as such need to inspire this next generation to say, we don't

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.440
[Guest 2]: need you to come work in the restaurant, you could be making the best sardo bread at home

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:20.400
[Guest 2]: on banana bread, like we all did during lockdown. And you won't might want to work two hours

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.680
[Guest 2]: in a restaurant. And that's when these younger people start coming into the industry who

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.380
[Guest 2]: know that, okay, I need to get from x to y, and y will be making the best coffee that

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:35.200
[Guest 2]: India will be proud of. But till then, I need to work two years in Bombay candy, I'm going

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.800
[Guest 2]: to make the most of it. That's when I feel like, you know, all restaurants together will

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.000
[Amit Varma]: start improving.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.080
[Amit Varma]: One thing that I sometimes think about is how do you find passion in what you do? Like

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:52.200
[Amit Varma]: most people, there is they're going through the motions. Like today, I think I have found

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.760
[Amit Varma]: passion in a sense in podcasting, I think about it deeply, I've really trying hard to

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.480
[Amit Varma]: figure it out, so on and so forth. But most of my life, even the things that I've been

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.800
[Amit Varma]: really good at, like being a writer, being a columnist, you go through the motions, you

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.240
[Amit Varma]: got a weekly deadline, you do it, you know, when I was in cricket journalism, you watch

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.640
[Amit Varma]: a match, you write the report, there's no passion, you're kind of going through the

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.800
[Amit Varma]: drifts. Now, with both of you, it's it's kind of obvious that there is that passion and

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.320
[Amit Varma]: excitement, which is perennially present. And I want to ask about your journey of finding

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.800
[Amit Varma]: it or getting it like, when Chef Lloyd died, you had a very moving post on Instagram about

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.400
[Amit Varma]: this 45 minute meeting with him, and how you felt at the end of it, and how energized and

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:36.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, how much that meant to you. So just the same question to both of you, that, where

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.200
[Amit Varma]: is that moment? Like, was there a moment, for example, perhaps when you were working

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.480
[Amit Varma]: in India or whatever, was there a moment where it felt like drudgery? And you're like, you

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.880
[Amit Varma]: know, what the fuck is this? What did I fall in love with? And how did that awaken that

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:56.960
[Amit Varma]: thing of like, you know, going beyond that, and just being so excited and so awake and

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.320
[Guest 2]: alive?

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:07.920
[Guest 2]: So there have been bad moments in, in years of Bombay canteen also, right? Like, when

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.240
[Guest 2]: you asked me what are the things that Sameer doesn't know about me, sadly knows everything,

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:18.560
[Guest 2]: because he's also made me cry about something for such a silly reason. But he's he knows

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:24.160
[Guest 2]: I'm a very emotional person. So one of the times when I've sat outside our own restaurant,

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:30.000
[Guest 2]: and literally held my head and just like cry, it was, sadly, the Kamla mill fire tragedy

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.520
[Guest 2]: had happened. And obviously, was such a bad tragedy. But what happened after that, for

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:43.320
[Guest 2]: even honest restauranteurs who are doing business the right way wasn't fair at all. And that's

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:50.440
[Guest 2]: when like I always say it, a restauranteur in India spends more time dealing with problems

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:58.040
[Guest 2]: outside his or her restaurant than in it. And that's when sometimes we lose the passion.

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:02.680
[Guest 2]: And we start doing it like, you know, it's a it's a revenue business. And obviously,

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:08.080
[Guest 2]: business does matter a lot. And once we had gone to New York, and we helped Chef Floyd

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.120
[Guest 2]: open his restaurant, and I was there for a good month and a half. And one of our guests

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.440
[Guest 2]: who's from India who met me there, and I was working in the restaurant, he's like, you

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:21.280
[Guest 2]: look so much happier working here. And I was like, because all I do is every day come check

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.760
[Guest 2]: every guest if they're enjoying making sure the team is fine, and not worried about if

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:32.120
[Guest 2]: someone dug the road in front of us or cut off electricity for God knows what reason.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:39.040
[Guest 2]: So in the first three years of my career, 21 to 23, I would have had those days, but

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:44.280
[Guest 2]: that would have been more person related where someone treat me treated me really badly.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:50.960
[Guest 2]: But I did not lose sight at that point. I always knew I wanted to do something. My dad

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:55.800
[Guest 2]: had this saying that, as in he's a neurosurgeon in Pune, and he used to always say this, like

00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:03.880
[Guest 2]: my business and like my life, I'm a taxi driver. The day I put my meter on, I get paid. Basically,

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:09.880
[Guest 2]: if I'm not on that surgery table, no one else can do it. And I don't get paid. Right. So

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.400
[Guest 2]: he's like, always think about your life where you could do a business where you're not there

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:21.280
[Guest 2]: all the time. So that business Kida was there. But there have been moments in the last five,

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.000
[Guest 2]: six years, and I openly talk about it on my Instagram as well that there are so many failures

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.080
[Guest 2]: we've gone through, or incidents where we it wasn't our fault, and we made the brunt

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:38.880
[Guest 2]: of it. And I've just lost all hope and being like, why did I come back to this? So it does

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:45.600
[Guest 2]: happen. But it all it takes is like, maybe one email from a guest who tells us like how

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:50.120
[Guest 2]: like Chitranjan in the restaurant took care of them. And like, you know, I love when people

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:56.280
[Guest 2]: you know, I love this podcast. So far where it's for an hour, we didn't talk about a chef.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:01.680
[Guest 2]: Like we love Chef Floyd, but restaurants are more than chefs. It's a village that keeps

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.880
[Guest 2]: it going. And there are so many when people tell me, oh, I was at your restaurant yesterday

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:12.400
[Guest 2]: and Priya took amazing care of me. It means a lot to us. Because in India, it takes a

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:17.240
[Guest 2]: lot to write a positive comment, right? And to name someone that means they really took

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:22.320
[Guest 2]: good care of them. So I think it all it takes is those one moment moments, which brings

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.800
[Guest 2]: it all back for us.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:30.560
[Guest 1]: And I think, for me, like, I've thought about this a lot only because like, I think there's

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.560
[Guest 1]: some things you asked me earlier, like, when did you find out that you wanted to be interested?

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.280
[Guest 1]: Like, I think I was one of those fortunate ones where I just knew that it was food. There

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:45.560
[Guest 1]: was no like, confusion in my mind. But I think we also live in this age where there's this

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:55.280
[Guest 1]: romanticization of this thought that finding your passion is the right route to take. And

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.880
[Guest 1]: there was a cousin of mine who I was talking to a few years ago, and we were just talking

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:06.800
[Guest 1]: about this, like he he works in a completely different industry. And I think I would never

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:12.960
[Guest 1]: have discovered I love this till I went and did it. And call it naivety, call it just

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.560
[Guest 1]: like where I went up to uncle and like, give me a job and just jumped into it. And then

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.160
[Guest 1]: I found that found out that I loved it. And then it's like what you said about podcasting,

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:25.480
[Guest 1]: right? Like over a period of time, you like and that's what people forget, like try different

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:30.520
[Guest 1]: things experiment. And that passion doesn't need to be your day job either. I think that

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:35.000
[Guest 1]: is the other flip side to this where there is this notion now that your day job needs

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.640
[Guest 1]: to equal to your passion. Otherwise, you are wasting your life for some reason. No. One

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:43.680
[Guest 1]: of the things he and I always talk about passion doesn't pay the bills. So you have to find

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.280
[Guest 1]: a way to pay the bills at the end of the day and still not paying our bills. That too.

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:54.400
[Guest 1]: But I think the reality is that and we all evolve as human beings as well. Like what

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.240
[Guest 1]: I am, I still continue to be passionate about food. But through the restaurants, I have

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:04.080
[Guest 1]: found other things that are equally interesting and I'm passionate about whether it's design,

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:10.760
[Guest 1]: whether it's storytelling and the whole nine yards around it, like it's come because we

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:16.080
[Guest 1]: started doing it through the restaurants. And then you think about it and you realize,

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:22.320
[Guest 1]: I love this too. Like I'm not just one, I'm just not the function of one thing. And that's

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.120
[Guest 1]: the bare truth of it.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:30.960
[Amit Varma]: I think my musing on passion was not so much as about following your passion, which I think

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:35.520
[Amit Varma]: is dangerous advice. You know, the cafes of Warsaw are filled with people who followed

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.800
[Amit Varma]: their passion and wasted 20 years of their life. And they're looking at their peers and

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.080
[Amit Varma]: nice apartments and cars and foreign holidays. And it's like they're fucked, especially in

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:49.280
[Amit Varma]: a profession like that, where, you know, the top 1% makes anything and the rest are struggling.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:55.220
[Amit Varma]: So I think following your passion can be overrated. But what I meant it in the sense of finding

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:59.980
[Amit Varma]: something beautiful about what you do, and then being passionate about it, which is not

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:05.240
[Amit Varma]: always possible, I guess, in a lot of professions, because you know, hey, but you know, and that's

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.240
[Amit Varma]: harder.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:12.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I think for us and it's evolved, right? Like, first it was restaurants. Now it's Bombay

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:20.920
[Guest 2]: Sweetshop. And Bombay Sweetshop has just been like, started off a very emotional journey.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:27.960
[Guest 2]: But every day there, we learn new things because e commerce was something he and me have never

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:34.400
[Guest 2]: done before. But what he and me have now is a great understanding of what food products

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:40.200
[Guest 2]: in India can be. And then most importantly, we always say it what sets hunger apart even

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.320
[Guest 2]: if we come up with a iPhone of our own is the service we give after that is the customer

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:51.040
[Guest 2]: service. I think that's what links everything we'll ever do. So I think like, you are right,

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.640
[Guest 2]: like finding a passion and going after it. When someone comes to me, can I should I open

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:59.480
[Guest 2]: a restaurant? I say no. I was like, come work with us. Learn at our expense. We could use

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:05.000
[Guest 2]: some cheap labor as well. But I do agree with you. There's so many failed restaurants out

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:13.320
[Guest 2]: there. But I feel like our evolution has been really fun for us. It keeps us on our toes.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:19.920
[Guest 2]: We have fires every day to put out. But it just keeps us going energetically. I always

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.920
[Guest 2]: ask myself this question. Honestly, like how long is the energy gonna last? And I've seen

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:31.120
[Guest 2]: my personal like physical energy drop down since like we opened Bombay Canteen. But it's

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:37.120
[Guest 2]: mentally I think we are so energized by all three and the fourth thing that we launched

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:41.440
[Amit Varma]: very soon as well. Yeah, and we'll talk about that also. But before I just want to say that

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.840
[Amit Varma]: one of the great tragedies of this year for me is that right after I met Sameer, I went

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:51.040
[Amit Varma]: on a keto diet. So I had the opportunity to have some of the Bombay barks before that

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:55.200
[Amit Varma]: from Bombay Sweet Company and it is the best chocolate desert I have ever had. I've been

00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:00.320
[Amit Varma]: gifting it to friends and just raving about it. And it's just a thing of beauty. But alas,

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.680
[Amit Varma]: it is also a thing of poison for that is what sugar is. What is one to do? Tell me a little

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.880
[Amit Varma]: bit about the restaurant business per se. Like I had done an episode long, long back

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.520
[Amit Varma]: when I had these 20 minute episodes with a friend of mine who was an ex restauranteur

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.320
[Amit Varma]: called Madhu Menon, who had a restaurant in Bangalore called Shiok. And and he kind of

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.600
[Amit Varma]: mirrored what you're saying now, in the sense that, you know, problems beyond the actual

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:30.320
[Amit Varma]: restaurant would take up most of his time. And the classic example he gave was that,

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, in Karnataka, and this restaurant was in Bangalore, you had one regulation from

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:39.160
[Amit Varma]: the fire safety department that you must have multiple entrances to your restaurant, and

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:43.400
[Amit Varma]: another one from the excise department that you're only allowed one, right? And you can't

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.920
[Amit Varma]: possibly keep both of them happy because you know, it's not Schrodinger's restaurant,

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:52.280
[Amit Varma]: ki yeh inspector aa gaya toh ek darwaz aaya nahi toh. And basically, he was like giving

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:57.480
[Amit Varma]: 1000 bribes every month. And it was just a nightmare. And it was just a mess. And when

00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:02.400
[Amit Varma]: I talked to friends of mine who've run businesses in India, I'm like, why? Like, why would you

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:07.360
[Amit Varma]: do it? Jitna bhi passion hai, you know, khaane ka passion hai toh khud banao yaar. But business

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:13.280
[Amit Varma]: running a business, it is like, mind numbingly frustrating and difficult. So tell me a little

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:17.320
[Amit Varma]: bit about that. Like, at least in your case, Sameer, I'm guessing going and you knew it

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.880
[Amit Varma]: would be tough because you had experience with Sanghi Uncle as it was setting up those

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:26.200
[Amit Varma]: three restaurants. But what was it like? Was it tougher than you anticipated? Is it soul

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.880
[Amit Varma]: crushing? As I imagine it would be for someone like me, I would just give up honestly. And

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.600
[Guest 1]: then I think like what Yash said earlier, like, unless you don't have a village along

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:40.720
[Guest 1]: for this ride, it is absolutely soul crushing. So to even think of doing it on your own,

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:47.000
[Guest 1]: please don't because it's a very, very lonely journey. I'm glad we had each other plus Chef

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.800
[Guest 1]: Floyd and so many more people have joined us on this journey. We're almost 250-300 people

00:59:52.800 --> 01:00:00.800
[Guest 1]: now who work together. And I think it can be soul crushing at times as Yash was describing

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:06.800
[Guest 1]: earlier. But there is this joy which is unparalleled. And I'm only saying this because last week

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:13.560
[Guest 1]: we reopened Bombay Canteen. And even though it is now in its seventh year to see it light

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.520
[Guest 1]: up again, and to see it like there is this moment when you're building something. And

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:23.000
[Guest 1]: there are these two moments which always like strike me is the first time you do the light

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.400
[Guest 1]: testing, because you're seeing everything at the right level. And the magical moment

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:33.640
[Guest 1]: is when music comes into the space. I can't describe that feeling to you. It is like it

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.840
[Guest 1]: gives you goosebumps when you see like all the things that you've seen on paper on 3D

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:45.040
[Guest 1]: renders on this on through the dust and the construction to actually clean up and then

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.240
[Guest 1]: because you can't switch on the music till everything is spotless and it doesn't. That's

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.720
[Guest 1]: just the way the process works, right, so to speak. And then on top of that, you layer

01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:00.960
[Guest 1]: on like people in the space and you suddenly see energy and you're fuelled for a while.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.080
[Guest 1]: You're fuelled for a while. So I think it's moments like this, like I think we always

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.160
[Guest 1]: tell ourselves and our teams that chances are like 80% of the time you're going to be

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:17.600
[Guest 1]: doing stupid shit. Like that's the reality of it invoice pay GST correct gaya ki nahi,

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:23.360
[Guest 1]: some other random rubbish which will pop up from here or there. But it's that 10 to 20%

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:30.280
[Guest 1]: hopefully which fuels you and keeps you in that zone where you feel it's worth it. Because

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.480
[Guest 1]: to expect all of it to be worth it all the time, I think is unsustainable. And it actually

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:45.720
[Guest 2]: is not reality. Yeah, we say to most hires, there's 90% of the work we do is not engaging

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.880
[Guest 2]: at all. And it's the 10% that gives us the joy meaning in to going back to a question

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:57.800
[Amit Varma]: running a business in India is annoying. I feel like you've used the mildest word you

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:05.240
[Guest 2]: could think of. Yeah. It can, it annoys me the most like, you know, if I'm on a vacation

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:10.820
[Guest 2]: and Sam calls me and you know, so and so has shown up and is creating a nuisance. And that

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:15.080
[Guest 2]: annoys me the most because then you're like, trying to get three people on the phone and

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:23.600
[Guest 2]: trying to resolve a problem. But because laws have been created to create confusion, and

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:29.160
[Guest 2]: to create opportunity for certain people, if that's the best way to put it, right? That's

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:37.040
[Guest 2]: what annoys you, right? And for me, I think what is soul crushing is the is the sing song

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.880
[Guest 2]: on the other side where everyone thinks that, you know, we are heading towards the greatest

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.080
[Guest 2]: country in the world is ease of doing business. And for me, I think it's, it does go the other

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:53.080
[Guest 2]: way. So for me, I don't mind, you know, getting my hands dirty and getting things done. But

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.880
[Guest 2]: when someone else walks up to me and says, Oh, things are easier now for restaurants

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:05.200
[Guest 2]: to run licensing GST serves so good for you. And it's not honestly, the restaurant industry

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.920
[Guest 2]: is the only industry that does not get input credit for GST. And there's no reason why

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:16.600
[Guest 2]: we shouldn't. And so it is those things. Like I don't mind fighting the good fight and just

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.200
[Guest 2]: getting on with my business. And honestly, India gives us so much opportunity. Like there

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:27.000
[Guest 2]: are so many things it allows us to do. And part of the bad things is we have to deal

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.360
[Guest 2]: with all this. But when some like, enthusiastic bugger comes to me and was like, like that

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.200
[Guest 2]: annoys me. And it really annoys me when someone tells me Oh, things are getting so much easier

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.680
[Guest 2]: for you guys. You know, things are so streamlined now. I think they're worse than where we were

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.680
[Guest 2]: eight years ago.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, any achche dina daya despite the odds as it were. So tell me one more thing

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:55.880
[Amit Varma]: like the interesting thing that strikes me about food, both at a personal level of you

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.760
[Amit Varma]: know, me going and cooking something and at the sort of bigger level of running a restaurant

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.760
[Amit Varma]: is the transience of it. You know, like Varun Grover, he spoke about how he likes to cook

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.900
[Amit Varma]: every day and he'll put music and he'll cook and he'll do his thing. And I have a similar

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:15.480
[Amit Varma]: sort of routine like that now. And he talks about how I think the comparison he made was

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.240
[Amit Varma]: like with a rangoli that you create something beautiful and but then it's gone. You know,

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.820
[Amit Varma]: it's temporary, maybe like a sandcastle or whatever. And that's at the personal level

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:27.740
[Amit Varma]: of cooking a meal. And perhaps you get the satisfaction of feeding someone or eating

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:32.800
[Amit Varma]: it yourself or whatever it is. But also, it strikes me in the restaurant business that

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.620
[Amit Varma]: if I'm a creator of another sort, say if I'm a filmmaker, I'm a producer, I made a movie.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.460
[Amit Varma]: The movie is there forever. You know, I bring out books, I write books, they are there forever.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:46.480
[Amit Varma]: Even these podcast episodes hopefully will be there forever. So, you know, your brother

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:53.520
[Unknown]: can see how you messed it up for years to come. But for the restaurant business, it's

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:59.680
[Amit Varma]: like you changed the menu once, what the previous menu was. Those are the memories of people

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:04.360
[Amit Varma]: and memories are faulty and memories are whatever and we even take them for granted. You know,

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.640
[Amit Varma]: like we'll go to a restaurant and we'll have an amazing meal. And then it's like we were

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.540
[Amit Varma]: entitled to it, it happened, move on to the next meal, it's kind of gone. So how do you

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:19.480
[Amit Varma]: sort of think about the transience of it where every day in different unseen ways, you're

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:24.300
[Amit Varma]: creating your masterpiece, but it's not there tomorrow in a sense. I mean, I know the processes

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:30.700
[Amit Varma]: and people in the village, it's all there tomorrow. But you know, that dish, that dish.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:39.020
[Guest 2]: I think Sam says it whenever he wants to give this inspirational briefing is we are as good

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:45.180
[Guest 2]: as the last meal we served someone, right? Even like forget menu change, like we have

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:50.120
[Guest 2]: so many regular guests who know that we are really great place and they keep coming. But

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.500
[Guest 2]: the night before, if one thing went wrong, that's the one thing they're going to call

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:58.920
[Guest 2]: us up about the next day, right? To be honest, like the way you explained it, I've never

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.700
[Guest 1]: thought of it. Yeah, I was just thinking about the transience is something I have not consciously

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.780
[Guest 1]: ever thought about. But it's a beautiful way of looking at it. Which is great. I'm sorry

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:11.500
[Guest 1]: if I messed your minds up. No, not at all. It's great to think of it. But we actually

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:16.260
[Guest 1]: like, I'd forgotten about what Yash just mentioned. But it's so true, like you're as good as the

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:21.100
[Guest 1]: last meal or the last drink you've served someone. That's all that matters. And that

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:26.620
[Guest 1]: in itself is referencing that transience because the good part is like you get to sort of wipe

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:32.540
[Guest 1]: the slate clean every morning and like rebuild because you can, you don't have to edit yourself

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:36.900
[Guest 1]: every day, but like you get to continuously create and I think one of the things the Bombay

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.940
[Guest 1]: Canteen did very early on is like, it was built into the structure of the restaurant

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:48.100
[Guest 1]: that we will keep making new things and making mistakes and but also like we were one of

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:52.260
[Guest 1]: the first restaurants in the country to have seasonally changing menus like it's a given

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:59.060
[Guest 1]: all over the world now. But in 2015, we were probably the only restaurant doing it and

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:03.560
[Guest 1]: we were actually told by like seasoned people in the industry, don't try doing that because

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.060
[Guest 1]: here people want what they want and they want to come back for the same thing. And I'm like,

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:13.580
[Guest 1]: no, let's change it because something tastes best in that season. So let's celebrate that.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:18.400
[Guest 1]: That's the whole purpose of like being a restaurant inspired by India that we celebrate the food

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.460
[Guest 1]: of the country in every way, shape and form. And that was an important aspect of it. And

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:29.300
[Guest 1]: I think we've always looked at like saying like thinking about like, how do we keep creating

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:35.740
[Guest 1]: and that's what drives us on a daily basis that 10-20% we were referencing earlier like

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:40.060
[Guest 1]: part of it is like that process of creation is what is very much in the center of the

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:46.860
[Guest 1]: 10-20% because without that creation, this is drudgery. Like then you are not like working

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:52.220
[Guest 1]: that mind to do anything new. But at the same time, we spend a hell of a lot of time talking

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:56.620
[Guest 1]: about consistency, because that's the only thing that's going to bring Amit back the

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:01.460
[Guest 1]: next time because he can consistently believe, but hopefully then over a period of time,

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:06.780
[Guest 1]: he also believes that whatever new thing these guys create is also worth trying out, which

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.380
[Guest 1]: has taken a little more than a little bit of time.

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:14.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, the common thread I'm getting out of that is that earlier you could go to a restaurant

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:19.260
[Amit Varma]: for food and you would get the food and the food is what is holding it together. But today

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:24.500
[Amit Varma]: it's also maybe an experience and maybe just a shared ethic. So I guess what would run

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.620
[Amit Varma]: through your restaurants is your ethic, a certain way of doing things. And I want to

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:32.740
[Amit Varma]: ask about that next, because I'll often get people telling me why don't you do one hour

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:37.820
[Amit Varma]: episodes or why don't you have this guest or that guest? And I'm like, No, I'm not chasing

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:42.820
[Amit Varma]: listeners. I am although I'm lucky enough to have enough of them, but I'm not chasing

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:47.340
[Amit Varma]: them. I know how I can expand my audience if I want to, but I don't want to, this is

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:50.820
[Amit Varma]: what I want to do, right? So I'm coming there with that ethic. Similarly, it seems to me

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:55.020
[Amit Varma]: that that approach is one that you guys share in the sense that look, if you wanted to go

01:08:55.020 --> 01:09:00.020
[Amit Varma]: mass, you could go mass in a way and get in many more numbers and all of that shit could

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:04.980
[Amit Varma]: happen. But there are some principles and there is some ethic which is dear to you guys.

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:08.420
[Amit Varma]: Like I remember in one of your interviews or something Sameer you mentioned about how

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.820
[Amit Varma]: some guests at Bombay canteen said ki yaar you have a tandoor, you have chicken, gimme

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:17.980
[Amit Varma]: chicken tikka and you said nahi nahi denge, right? Which is amazing, which is fantastic.

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:22.820
[Amit Varma]: And exactly what I would you know, want as a as part of the experience that there is

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:27.220
[Amit Varma]: something there, which is core to that and which is not just ki we'll give you whatever

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:33.260
[Amit Varma]: the hell will make you happy. So how did you arrive at that? How did you arrive at that?

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:38.020
[Amit Varma]: Like at one point you mentioned when you met Floyd, Sam, one of the questions he asked

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:42.580
[Amit Varma]: you was why are you here? And this of course, in New York, why are you here? You know, and

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:46.580
[Amit Varma]: at some level, I get the sense from reading about you guys from senior interviews that

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:50.660
[Amit Varma]: at some level, there was a thing of let's go back to India and do our thing. The way

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.940
[Amit Varma]: an American chef does America, the way an Italian chef does Italy. Let's go back and

01:09:54.940 --> 01:10:00.140
[Amit Varma]: do our thing and something more than, you know, catering to the cliches and making the

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:09.460
[Guest 2]: safe stuff. Tell me how your philosophy was born. So we started hungering with the now

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:17.100
[Guest 2]: I think we are able to elaborate it or better clearly is to say we want to celebrate India,

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:24.980
[Guest 2]: right? Now, in in our smaller worlds, we knew what hospitality is. And during the break,

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:30.260
[Guest 2]: I'm just going to check this one Instagram video I saw yesterday of a guy by the name

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:36.700
[Guest 2]: Will Gudara. And he breaks down the difference between service and hospitality. And he says

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:41.980
[Guest 2]: service is a process, the act of just someone asking for something, you're giving it and

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.220
[Guest 2]: hospitality. Making it efficient is service. Is service and hospitality is just doing it

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:54.460
[Guest 2]: with the heart. And making someone feel something. Yeah. Yeah. I think that finding that for

01:10:54.460 --> 01:11:02.140
[Guest 2]: us was important. Then also knowing and being honest to ourselves is both of us can't cook,

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:10.380
[Guest 2]: right? We can't. So finding someone who we respected when Chef Floyd came on board, like

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:14.660
[Guest 2]: for me, it was a surprise. Like, why is he joining? Like, you know, obviously, Sam and

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.860
[Guest 2]: met him before and the rapport they shared. And he just saw that I think the honesty in

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:24.700
[Guest 2]: us. And obviously, we looked up to him as someone who had radicalized Indian cuisine

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:30.740
[Guest 2]: in the United States, but more like from a mentor perspective. And that philosophy when

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:37.340
[Guest 2]: it came to food was him. Having seen those years, like being being in the United States,

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:42.820
[Guest 2]: seeing those chefs and celebrating farmers celebrating ingredients. He wanted to do that

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:49.140
[Guest 2]: in India. And he made sure that he instilled it with all the younger chefs as well. So

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:55.140
[Guest 2]: we had Chef Thomas, who grew up under him. We have Chef Hussain. We have Chef Kirish.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:12:02.980
[Guest 2]: We have Chef Shraddha now at O'Pedro. All these chefs under him learned that philosophy.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:07.500
[Guest 2]: And they are evolving that philosophy, right? Like what indigenous means to them. So when

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:11.860
[Guest 2]: we have that in the kitchen, that becomes the heart there. We have that as the heart

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:18.860
[Guest 2]: in the front of house. And I think that coming together creates that shared ethic and philosophy.

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:25.300
[Guest 2]: Like celebrating India for me in Bombay Canteen means if I come to your home, and maybe we've

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:30.900
[Guest 2]: just met once before, if I'm a relative, you still make me sit and ask for tea, coffee

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:36.260
[Guest 2]: and get a tray of snacks. It's just in our hearts. And that's all that we are to represent

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:41.620
[Guest 2]: within the restaurants is that bringing that heart out. So celebrating India was very core

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.220
[Guest 1]: to what we wanted to do.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:50.420
[Guest 1]: And to take off from where Yash left right now, I think it was definitely like as two

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.940
[Guest 1]: guys trying to start their first business never having done this before. Like it was

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:58.920
[Guest 1]: genuinely like having Chef Floyd in our corner that gave us the confidence to like go ahead

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:04.580
[Guest 1]: with this ethic. Like I think the language with which we now describe the last eight

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:11.140
[Guest 1]: years is only in hindsight. At that time, we were just putting things together to like

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:16.900
[Guest 1]: make it work on a day to day basis. And if we had not had a year and a half worth of

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:21.740
[Guest 1]: conversations with Chef Floyd, for example, that we will not serve chicken tikka, maybe

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:28.060
[Guest 1]: we would have caved, who knows, like if things had not gone the way we'd planned, like the

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:32.420
[Guest 1]: mind plays its tricks on you, like you need to get money through the door. And that happens

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.500
[Guest 1]: so often with so many restaurants, it opens with a certain concept, it doesn't go as per

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:41.180
[Guest 1]: plan. And then you start flipping, flipping, flipping, like one of the biggest things other

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.820
[Guest 1]: biggest things I learned while in the year, you can't be everything for everyone. You

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:50.460
[Guest 1]: just cannot. I think that is actually the anathema to like actually succeeding, because

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:56.100
[Guest 1]: the moment you try to do that, you no longer stand for anything. And people see through

01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:02.060
[Guest 1]: that eventually. So, and little by little, you succeed a little, I think confidence is

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:08.300
[Guest 1]: one of those things. I think it was Phil Knight's book where I read this line where it was like

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:13.900
[Guest 1]: confidence is like money, you need some to make some. And I think having Chef Floyd in

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:18.180
[Guest 1]: our corner was that first little bit that was there. And then over a period of time,

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.580
[Guest 1]: we've made some which has allowed us to have a strong ethic and culture around which we

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.940
[Amit Varma]: function today.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.460
[Amit Varma]: And to dig a little deeper into what this ethic and culture is like you've spoken about

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:34.780
[Amit Varma]: celebrating where we are from about indigenous elements and all of that. But what does it

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:39.760
[Amit Varma]: really translate to? I mean, you know, celebrating indigenous elements being who we are could

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.140
[Amit Varma]: also mean making incredible poha, right, for example, or just making traditional dishes

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:49.580
[Amit Varma]: well or like highway gomantak, which you described is also doing that, in a sense. But, you know,

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:54.500
[Amit Varma]: you guys have kind of gone beyond that in the sense that whenever I eat at your restaurants

01:14:54.500 --> 01:15:00.100
[Amit Varma]: and my O Pedro last meal last week was like heavenly. There's a, you know, if I'm eating

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:04.420
[Amit Varma]: something that I haven't had on the menu before, there is that delightful sense of surprise

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:09.620
[Amit Varma]: also, it is not just a little bit of familiarity that may be there, but it is that delightful

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:15.740
[Amit Varma]: sense of surprise. And, you know, like, honestly, it was I got to tell my listeners about this,

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:20.300
[Amit Varma]: it was a weekday night, and the place was packed. And I was sitting facing the window,

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:25.300
[Amit Varma]: I was with four of my friends, and I was sitting facing the window. And it blew my mind that

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:31.740
[Amit Varma]: there are people who are passing this restaurant. And I was like, what the fuck is wrong with

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:34.940
[Amit Varma]: you come in? You know, of course, there was no space inside either. But you know what

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:40.420
[Amit Varma]: I'm saying? It was so surprising and so delightful. And you just wanted more and more. And I even

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:46.380
[Amit Varma]: took a keto break for a day. Because who can resist? So just to kind of stop salivating

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.900
[Amit Varma]: and come back to the question, you know, so tell me a little bit more about this ethic,

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:54.380
[Amit Varma]: this philosophy, this approach.

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:58.980
[Guest 2]: So when we said celebrating India, we said very clearly, we want to celebrate India of

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:08.580
[Guest 2]: today. Right? And we want to be aspirational, right? He and me grew up in Bombay, and now

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:14.580
[Guest 2]: it's Mumbai, right? So we always have memories. And like, you might have had the best poha

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:19.420
[Guest 2]: somewhere. We didn't want to touch that poha. We wanted to recreate it and bring it to the

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:25.740
[Guest 2]: poha of today. So that's what Chef Lloyd was great at. But same thing when you walked into

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.700
[Guest 2]: Bombay canteen, you came in thinking it's gonna be an Indian restaurant. So you thought

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:34.900
[Guest 2]: of a Moti Mahal. So we've drawn Taj Mahal in a corner, there are going to be these like,

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:41.220
[Guest 2]: lamps on the table. And it was exactly opposite of that, right? Very, I wouldn't call it grungy,

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:47.700
[Guest 2]: but exposed walls, beautiful bar, a great cocktail program, stuff in like t shirts with

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:52.860
[Guest 2]: bro written on it. Eight, seven and a half years ago, that just changed the way people

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:58.540
[Guest 2]: looked at Indian food. I used to say, like, celebrating India at that point could also

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:04.540
[Guest 2]: have been I love traditional Indian food, like that's why I love highway kumantak. But

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:10.860
[Guest 2]: if I were going to, let's say a Moti Mahal or a copper chimney for dinner today, and

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:15.820
[Guest 2]: imagine our reservation at 8pm, we could decide now sitting here what we are going to eat,

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:20.940
[Guest 2]: we don't even need to look at the menu. But we also know at the end of the meal, it would

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:26.220
[Guest 2]: have been great food, but it wouldn't have been a great cocktail experience or a dining

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:31.820
[Guest 2]: experience, but you would have left satisfied, comfort, comfort. We didn't want that we wanted

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:37.700
[Guest 2]: people to come in. And yes, people are going to get angry. But that same surprises what

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:45.620
[Guest 2]: creates joy. So we said this that, and I still say it, I want to create products or brands

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:50.300
[Guest 2]: where either you love us or you hate us. I don't want you to be hurt. Because here is

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:56.540
[Guest 2]: where we play safe, right? To what Sam said, like, we came to India around, like he was

01:17:56.540 --> 01:18:00.820
[Guest 2]: in New York, I was in Singapore, and we came nine years ago or something and we were just

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:07.020
[Guest 2]: eating and believe me, we were eating good food. But every restaurant had a burger pasta

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:15.940
[Guest 2]: on its menu, right? With no context to it at that point. And I, a year ago, I was pulling

01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:22.500
[Guest 2]: his leg saying, when COVID hit us during delivery, we had burgers and sandwiches on our menu.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:28.020
[Guest 2]: But we had it because we found out that it was the best food that traveled during that

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:35.100
[Guest 2]: time. We had to change as per the circumstances, we had to evolve. That sense of evolution

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:39.740
[Guest 2]: and saying I'm going to celebrate India of today, I'm going to celebrate the Goa of today,

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:46.580
[Guest 2]: which we do at Opedro, is I think what makes us different. And honestly, it's our team

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:55.140
[Guest 2]: that gives us that confidence. Chef Hussain in the kitchen is a wizard. Like, when he

01:18:55.140 --> 01:19:00.420
[Guest 2]: tells us there's a tasting and he pulls out like 10 dishes, we are enthusiastically sitting

01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:08.180
[Guest 2]: there waiting for what's coming out. Chef Girish, who runs Bombay Sweetshop, would you

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:14.860
[Guest 2]: have asked me, would I be excited about tasting Mithai 10 years ago? Never. Like, but when

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:19.820
[Guest 2]: these guys tell us there is a tasting lined up in the evening, we are like so excited

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:24.700
[Guest 2]: because when we tasted, we are thinking how are we going to sell this? How are we going

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:31.180
[Guest 2]: to convince people? What is the story we are going to tell? Right. So I think all of us

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:37.580
[Guest 2]: like just feed off each other. Literally. I don't know if that so like the we used to

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.820
[Guest 2]: say that recreation or what was that word you used to use that that's what our hunger

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:49.980
[Guest 2]: rings like we recreate something. But we we make sure that like same like the guest told

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:56.060
[Guest 2]: you yesterday, Bombay Canteen got renovated. And she's a slightly older guest. And she

01:19:56.060 --> 01:20:02.980
[Guest 2]: said to him, I love how it looks. But I still, it still reminds me of the good memories I've

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:09.020
[Unknown]: had. So like, it's refreshing. It's refreshing. Yeah. So like, even when you might eat, for

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:14.740
[Guest 2]: example, the choris pulao in at O'Pedro. You love it. It's a surprise. But there are elements

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:19.500
[Guest 2]: in it which are comforting. Comforting is also very important to us. Like we don't want

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:24.940
[Guest 2]: you to come to our restaurants only on special occasions for that one Wow, expensive meal.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:30.180
[Guest 2]: No, not at all. I think we are very approachable in our pricing and the value we drive. We

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:33.940
[Guest 2]: will give you the surprise but it's comforting at the end of the day that room that you're

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:39.400
[Guest 2]: sitting in this energy like you feel like you could walk in wearing slippers or a suit.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:45.220
[Guest 1]: You still feel at home in that environment. And the whole thought process for us has always

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:52.220
[Guest 1]: been like, how do you strike that balance between surprise and comfort? Because think

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:56.100
[Guest 1]: about it like on different days, you feel different things and you're in the mood for

01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:02.260
[Guest 1]: different kinds of food. And you almost want to like, program the menu in a way that there

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:07.140
[Guest 1]: is a little bit of something depending on how you're feeling like you want to be surprised.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:10.740
[Guest 1]: There's something for you to be surprised. And this is something we've learned over a

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:15.580
[Guest 1]: period of eight years. I don't think this came to us aha on day one. And we've been

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:24.060
[Guest 1]: able to now articulate it as well. Like we like menu engineering is a whole field on

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.980
[Guest 1]: its own where like you're looking at the menu from the point of view that how do I make

01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:34.260
[Guest 1]: this menu in a way that it tells a story of what the concept of the restaurant is. Yet

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:39.260
[Guest 1]: it feels good whether Amit you walk in with a group of friends or you walk in with your

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:46.020
[Guest 1]: family it has an equal amount for both groups. Because this is what happens in a restaurant

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.860
[Guest 1]: otherwise you go down the route of being a multi cuisine restaurant and you try to put

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:57.820
[Guest 1]: pizza, pasta, Chinese, Indian, everything. But even what we try to think of is like,

01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:02.820
[Guest 1]: and I think you and I have briefly had a conversation about this before is form versus flavor. And

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:07.620
[Guest 1]: like if you think of it as like a quadrant on those lines, we've realized over a period

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:13.300
[Guest 1]: of time, if you take form of a dish too far or flavor of a dish too far, you still have

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:18.420
[Guest 1]: an original memory of and this is to feed off what Yash was saying about recreation,

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:23.220
[Guest 1]: there is an original inspiration for sure. But when you move too far on both form and

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:29.460
[Guest 1]: flavor, you're left with a new thing that nobody emotionally connects with. Versus in

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:34.020
[Guest 1]: if you play just with form or just with flavor, there is something to hook your mind on to

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:41.100
[Guest 1]: and then hopefully we take you down, down on a journey and tell a story of what that

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:48.300
[Guest 1]: dish was meant to be. And we find that time and time again, that works in a way that it

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:52.700
[Guest 1]: works for us, maybe for someone else, it's a different way of doing it. And our minds

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.900
[Guest 1]: now work towards sort of how do you surprise someone on form or flavor, whether it's mithai,

01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:02.300
[Guest 1]: whether it's Goan food, whether it's Indian food. And, but there are certain things we've

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:06.060
[Guest 1]: also learned over a period of time, it's about behavior, like we're constantly looking at

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:12.540
[Guest 1]: behavior, I always feel like restaurants are a live laboratory. So we've realized so our

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:18.820
[Guest 1]: menus are usually divided into small plates, large plates, chotas, badas, etc. Small plates

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.660
[Guest 1]: is where people love experimenting. So we sort of focus our energies there. But when

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:29.060
[Guest 1]: they end their meal here in India, you want comfort. So don't stop. We've said yeah, provide

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:35.340
[Guest 1]: the best possible flavor. But let's not try doing too much to it where people feel that

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:41.740
[Guest 1]: they didn't end their meal being fulfilled, or like having like that great end to the

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:45.500
[Guest 1]: meal. And then desserts again is something people love experimenting with. So you're

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:51.500
[Guest 1]: back to experimentation state. So it's almost like you have these a canvas to play on. And

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:57.060
[Guest 1]: then you keep moving the needles a little bit here and there. And every menu change,

01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:02.700
[Guest 1]: you learn something new. We try like, for example, last year, Hussain figured out a

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:08.860
[Guest 1]: way to get fresh Himalayan trout into Bombay. And we started serving that every day. And

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.100
[Guest 1]: it was it was part of it. We introduced a section after we opened after COVID just because

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:17.820
[Guest 1]: we love it. That's it. There is no reason for this to exist on the menu, except that

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:24.100
[Guest 1]: all of us love to eat it. So there was triple shea's one fried rice on it. There was a thupka

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:28.900
[Guest 1]: which is like a ramen on it, like stuff that we would love to like binge on was there on

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:33.020
[Guest 1]: the menu. So again, like finding ways, but that's a way of telling the story of why this

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:38.620
[Guest 1]: is on deserves to be on the menu. And then please come and share our love for it. And

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:42.860
[Guest 1]: so it's a constant process of how do you continuously tell that story of food through the menu through

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:49.660
[Guest 1]: the restaurant through every through the service. And it's that's what's continuously fun.

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:55.340
[Guest 2]: Yeah, for the form was his flavor. I can give you a quick example. So people Yeah, get it.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:00.020
[Guest 2]: So it's one of our dishes, which is still on the menu. Um, it's called as a gulab nut.

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:08.660
[Guest 2]: Okay, gulab nut is a gulab jamun shape like a donut with old monk for fresh pistachio

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:14.640
[Guest 2]: cream in it, right? Now the inspiration of this dish, Chef Kunali and Chef Floyd wanted

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:20.900
[Guest 2]: to create a gulab jamun with old monk in it. So the inspiration of it came from Baba Ram,

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:25.780
[Guest 2]: which is a French dessert where a brioche is soaked in rum. Now in a Indian restaurant,

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:30.900
[Guest 2]: if you put a dish called Baba Ram, one we won't be able to pronounce it because a you

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:36.540
[Guest 2]: will be like, oh, and it will just seem as a very intimidating dish to order. So when

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:41.560
[Guest 2]: you have to get the name, right, right. So gulab nut because gulab jamun and gulab nut.

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:48.540
[Guest 2]: So it comes like a donut. But the moment you break into it and eat it, you get the same

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:53.640
[Guest 2]: flavor and texture of a gulab jamun. So it's in your mind, the muscle memory is taking

01:25:53.640 --> 01:26:00.900
[Guest 2]: you there. And then the hint of old monk kicks in with the nice texture of almond of pistachios,

01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:06.100
[Guest 2]: right? So that recreation is there, but the muscle memory is already kicked in. This reminds

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:12.540
[Guest 2]: me of gulab jamun. Wow. Someone's taken my favorite dish and turned it on its head. So

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:20.100
[Guest 2]: then there are the, I love it. You destroyed my childhood favorite dish, which is great,

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:29.820
[Guest 2]: right? Like we want to play with people's emotions. And it should go on a t-shirt. That's

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:34.660
[Guest 2]: our form versus flavor and then the story to tell with it, right? And the story for

01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:39.420
[Guest 2]: us is how you write it on the menu. How does the team explain it as well? So form flavor,

01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:44.740
[Guest 2]: like now we use it completely for a lot when we are doing products with Bombay Sweet Shop.

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:50.020
[Guest 2]: And it just helps us also explain it to our team members when they are thinking of a dish

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:54.900
[Guest 2]: that use these as your quadrants to think about, because we are celebrating India. So

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:58.700
[Guest 2]: if you put a foreign object on that, they won't have any relevance to it. And they'll

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.700
[Guest 2]: think why is this part of this concept?

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:06.140
[Amit Varma]: Also fascinating how, you know, form and flavor are part of the context that helps you relate

01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:11.300
[Amit Varma]: with the dish. Like, I remember I had a vegetarian friend of mine had once agreed to try a dish

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:15.420
[Amit Varma]: I was raving about. And this was in Istanbul in the Museum of Modern Art there. And they

01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:19.740
[Amit Varma]: have this fantastic restaurant out on the balcony. And I'd ordered some veal. So she

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:23.620
[Amit Varma]: said, Okay, let me try it. And she's vegetarian, right? Never had meat before. So I was wondering,

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:28.060
[Amit Varma]: how is she going to react to it? There's no context, right? What do you do? So she had

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:35.340
[Amit Varma]: a little bit of it. And then she said, feels like paneer, right? Which to me is, you know,

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:39.380
[Amit Varma]: like what? That's not something I would have thought of. But that's where her memory took

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:44.740
[Amit Varma]: her. Yeah, I mean, devoid of any context, you know, what are you going to say about

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:49.300
[Amit Varma]: it? You have no context of texture, you have no context of taste. And it brings me also

01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:53.940
[Amit Varma]: to the phrase you guys used earlier, which was the India of today. Now, the thing is,

01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:59.820
[Amit Varma]: India, of course, one, we occupy like three centuries at the same time 1928, some of us

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:06.500
[Amit Varma]: in the 21st. And even within that 21st, we occupy, it's just so incredibly diverse, right?

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:11.300
[Amit Varma]: And everywhere for the food that you bring up, like you pointed out, there is a constraint

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:16.300
[Amit Varma]: and that constraint, I'm guessing is a constraint that there has to be some kind of familiarity,

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:21.020
[Amit Varma]: some kind of anchor for the thing, whether it is in form, or whether it is in flavor,

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:25.620
[Amit Varma]: like you said, but there has to be some kind of anchor for it. And you can't just go completely

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:30.340
[Amit Varma]: crazy. And also at the same time, you know, and this is something I've realized in many

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:34.700
[Amit Varma]: other contexts, and I'm just thinking aloud in this context, that when you're creating

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:40.660
[Amit Varma]: something, sometimes you have to have a the humility to realize that other people come

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:46.020
[Amit Varma]: from such different places, that they may not feel the same way you do about something.

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:51.060
[Amit Varma]: And also the confidence in that, that no, this is what I feel, you know, ki yeh karna

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:55.700
[Amit Varma]: hai, yeh hi karna hai, right? So what is that journey like, like when you talk of menu design,

01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:00.900
[Amit Varma]: what is that journey like of figuring out that, you know, how important is that story

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:05.060
[Amit Varma]: really, because I imagine it must be much more important than it, you know, it's not,

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:09.780
[Amit Varma]: it's not just a presentation thing or a marketing thing. It's a contextualizing thing also.

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.220
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit through your learnings on all these subjects.

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:19.980
[Guest 1]: We got a lesson on this on day one of Bombay Canteen opening, because it was funny, because

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:24.620
[Guest 1]: it was 11th of February 2015. It was, I think, one or two days after Arvind Kejriwal had

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:31.020
[Guest 1]: just come to power in New Delhi. And everyone's eat, if you've grown up in Bombay, like you've

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:36.180
[Guest 1]: gone to Willingdon Club, and you know, the story of the Kejriwal toast there with the

01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:43.180
[Guest 1]: egg hidden under the cheese, because Mr. Kejriwal wanted to hide the fact that he was

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:50.500
[Guest 1]: eating eggs in front of other guests. And we had bread leftover from a certain dish,

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:54.180
[Guest 1]: we had eggs, obviously, in the kitchen, and we had chutney from another dish, which was

01:29:54.180 --> 01:30:00.180
[Guest 1]: not going on the menu. And we thought as a day special, we will on opening day, just

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:07.300
[Guest 1]: put this as a special Kejriwal toast, we called it that. And honestly, we got reviewed that

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:12.780
[Guest 1]: day. And it got written about the next day. And everyone started asking about it. And

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:19.020
[Guest 1]: the reason why I think it still is never going to leave the menu, is because throughout,

01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.220
[Guest 1]: if you've grown up in Bombay, you know where it comes from. Otherwise, you think it's funny

01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:26.980
[Guest 1]: that something called Kejriwal is on the menu in your mind, because of news, pop culture,

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:34.180
[Guest 1]: whatever goes to Arvind Kejriwal. And therefore, it's funny to see that on a menu. And suddenly

01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:41.260
[Guest 1]: like then you are ordering this because you stuck a cord to the story. And we've had instances

01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:46.980
[Guest 1]: where a table of 20 has come and ordered 20 Kejriwals, like one for each, nobody wants

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:54.220
[Guest 1]: to share like it goes on, we couldn't make enough. Like it is hands down the most popular

01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:58.220
[Guest 1]: dish. And at the basis of it, if you think of it, what is it? It's a really yummy chilli

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:04.260
[Guest 1]: cheese toast. It's comfort all the way. And that's the reality of it. So I think for us,

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.940
[Guest 1]: like when it comes to menu design, like this was a happy accident that happened. But over

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:15.340
[Guest 1]: a period of time, I think the first six months was a huge learning curve, where all four

01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:21.780
[Guest 1]: of us who were designing the menu were good carnivorous people and every vegetarian dish

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:28.180
[Guest 1]: was an offshoot of a non vegetarian dish and it bombed and how and we realized that this

01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:33.860
[Guest 1]: we can't continue doing this and we had to spend more and more and it took us a solid

01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:39.140
[Guest 1]: six, eight months to figure out what our thought process would be. How would we create dishes

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:44.180
[Guest 1]: which would be exciting in the vegetarian realm as well and it pushed us it really pushed

01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:50.620
[Guest 1]: us to create and it was it's interesting now that some of my favourite dishes currently

01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:55.860
[Guest 1]: on the menu are some of the vegetarian ones. There is a handvo toast that we do black garlic

01:31:55.860 --> 01:32:00.220
[Guest 1]: handvo toast where the tomatoes are coming from a specific farm and like it there is

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:06.660
[Guest 1]: a rhubarb coming from a specific farm in Ooty and there's a chundo around it and like in

01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:14.420
[Guest 1]: its form it looks like a bruschetta but it's great handvo, the garlicky flavour and the

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:19.380
[Guest 1]: tomatoes the acid of the tomatoes with the sweetness of the rhubarb chundo just works

01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:24.580
[Guest 1]: and why not like it's got all the elements of it. So it's a constant journey of like

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:30.300
[Guest 1]: trial and error trial and error to get to this stage. Yeah I think it's been also like

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:38.180
[Guest 2]: we've added layers as we've learnt a lot so I think the first layer was always seasonality

01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:43.740
[Guest 2]: right then was this veg non-veg thing then was diversity one of the things we learnt

01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:51.260
[Guest 2]: in regionality in the again I'll try to articulate is partialism that comes from like partiality

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:55.900
[Guest 2]: from our minds. I'm Maharashtrian so I want to have a mandeli fry on the menu and my mom's

01:32:55.900 --> 01:33:01.500
[Guest 2]: fish curry. He's from Lucknow so we had a pathod on the menu that his mom used to make

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:07.080
[Guest 2]: then she used to do the matri then Floyd was from Goa and Bandra so those dishes Thomas

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:13.380
[Guest 2]: was from Kerala so those dishes and then we never realized that you know the menus actually

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:20.460
[Guest 2]: should be completely diverse so like when chef Hussain also took over he's from Chennai

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:25.060
[Guest 2]: so a little bit of from there now when we think of it and we are looking at the menu

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:30.060
[Guest 2]: and new dishes we are putting we always have a look at is there complete diversity on that

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:36.260
[Guest 2]: menu like it has to be north south east west anyone who walks in needs to find some familiarity

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:41.780
[Guest 2]: there it's just not the familiarity of the founders and the chefs so that has added onto

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:48.460
[Guest 2]: it then obviously there is value will people find value that's a very important question

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:52.660
[Guest 2]: for us like the cheese chilli toast you're not going to charge too much for it although

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:57.980
[Guest 2]: it's a huge seller and people are still buying it but making that a very crucial part of

01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:03.100
[Guest 2]: all our products that we do we are always going to be we are a premium but it gets you

01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:08.500
[Guest 2]: a good value for what you pay for so I think those are the layers we've grown to understand

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:13.940
[Guest 2]: much more articulate better and get it through to our teams that they also think about it

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.740
[Guest 1]: in that way and I think to add to that another layer that we've developed over the years

01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:24.660
[Guest 1]: is that of technique and how do you create flavor and I think there's a bunch of stuff

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:30.180
[Guest 1]: that the kitchen team does the bar team does to like create infusions and ferments and

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:35.380
[Guest 1]: a whole bunch of other things that we don't actively talk about but it's being used at

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:43.660
[Guest 1]: the back end to like provide a better flavor to the dish that is and I know we spoke about

01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:49.820
[Guest 1]: it a little earlier that every dish has these sort of tick marks but also there's a lot

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:55.500
[Guest 1]: of technique constantly being used to see how can we sort of amplify flavors that we

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:59.780
[Guest 1]: are doing whether it's in the cooking technique or in the way it's being presented or all

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:08.100
[Guest 1]: of that and but we're always also very careful of where if you over index on the technique

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:13.700
[Guest 1]: piece when telling the story it almost can veer on pretentious where do you know where

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:19.500
[Guest 1]: this came from from and how many days was this made for you etc. etc. which I don't

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:23.060
[Guest 1]: think necessarily always needs to be part of the story but like at the back end it's

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:28.820
[Amit Varma]: there to accentuate what you're doing anyway yeah a severe shout out these coffee beans

01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:35.180
[Guest 2]: oh yeah I always say this yesterday I was saying it was like I'm tired when I go and

01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:39.860
[Guest 2]: they tell me oh we aged this coffee being in a donkey stomach and then they shat it

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:44.780
[Guest 2]: out and then we fermented it and then it went it's just like I need a good coffee that's

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:49.660
[Amit Varma]: it yeah I mean part of it is I need a good coffee but part of it is a story kind of makes

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:55.460
[Amit Varma]: a difference yeah the story and the vibe and all of that so let's take a quick commercial

01:35:55.460 --> 01:36:01.100
[Amit Varma]: break and on the other side we'll continue this journey

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.660
[Amit Varma]: have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it well I'd love

01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:09.700
[Amit Varma]: to help you since April 2020 I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course the art of clear

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:14.460
[Amit Varma]: writing an online community has now sprung up of all my past students we have workshops

01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:19.020
[Amit Varma]: a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community interaction in the course

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:23.700
[Amit Varma]: itself through four webinars spread over four weekends I share all I know about the craft

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:28.100
[Amit Varma]: and practice of clear writing there are many exercises much interaction a lovely and lively

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:33.020
[Amit Varma]: community at the end of it the course cost rupees 10,000 plus GST or about 150 dollars

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:37.660
[Amit Varma]: and is a monthly thing so if you're interested head on over to register at indiancut.com

01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:43.300
[Amit Varma]: slash clear writing that's indiancut.com slash clear writing being a good writer doesn't

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:48.380
[Amit Varma]: require God-given talent just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:53.500
[Amit Varma]: need to do to refine your skills I can help you

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:57.860
[Amit Varma]: welcome back to the scene in the unseen I'm chatting with Sameer and Yash and so here's

01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:03.100
[Amit Varma]: a question that I have which came out of something that he was saying earlier that Yash you were

01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:06.860
[Amit Varma]: mentioning that when you train all of these people you know Saturdays you'll have these

01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:12.420
[Amit Varma]: sessions you'll call them over and one of the things you said you tell them is that

01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:17.220
[Amit Varma]: you can now experiment on your own right because the means of production are open to you you

01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:21.780
[Amit Varma]: can make sourdough bread at home and all of that and what strikes me is that there is

01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:26.100
[Amit Varma]: an analog to this in the creator economy which I know fairly well and I of course know nothing

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:31.300
[Amit Varma]: about the food industry so I'll sort of talk a bit about the creator economy and ask you

01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:36.380
[Amit Varma]: how well it goes through that in the creator economy what you have is that the means of

01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:41.740
[Amit Varma]: production are open to all of us we no longer have to go to gatekeepers to publish our work

01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:46.580
[Amit Varma]: or to produce our work or whatever so I can sit at home I can do it myself anybody can

01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:53.140
[Amit Varma]: write and once you do enough of it you become good and you become good in interesting diverse

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:58.820
[Amit Varma]: ways the content is no longer homogenized because everybody can do it can do their own

01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:04.300
[Amit Varma]: thing and they can thus discover niches which the mainstream might not otherwise even have

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:10.060
[Amit Varma]: defined as a niche or known that it existed and the way we consume content has changed

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:14.580
[Amit Varma]: completely so in the 1990s you've got your times of India and your whatever you've got

01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:19.500
[Amit Varma]: a handful of TV channels in the 80s you only have Doodh Darshan and that just expands and

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:23.940
[Amit Varma]: everything is fragmented and it's both good and bad I mean the negative aspects of it

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:28.420
[Amit Varma]: is of course increased polarization narrative warfare all of that but generally good because

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:34.620
[Amit Varma]: individuals are empowered and that's the way the whole ecosystem has developed at the creator

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:39.740
[Amit Varma]: and you're empowered and importantly at the creator and you no longer need to scale you

01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:44.860
[Amit Varma]: know I can reach a thousand by Kevin Kelly's famous essay a thousand true fans if you get

01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:48.660
[Amit Varma]: a thousand true fans are willing to give you a hundred dollars a year you're cool you don't

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:53.260
[Amit Varma]: need to scale and become really big it's not like one person at the top makes all of it

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:58.180
[Amit Varma]: so that's the way the creator economy has panned out now if we look at the ecosystem

01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:04.020
[Amit Varma]: of food I won't say restaurant just a ecosystem of food and eating it strikes me that at one

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:09.180
[Amit Varma]: level just because of comparative advantage you would imagine that logically people would

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:13.980
[Amit Varma]: cook less and less or if they would cook they would cook for creative satisfaction and whatever

01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:18.100
[Amit Varma]: but that cook less and less because economies of scale would tell you that you focus on

01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:21.620
[Amit Varma]: what you're good at and somebody else will get home-cooked food across to you or different

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:26.940
[Amit Varma]: food across to you and it'll be good to eat and all of that so you'd expect people to

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:32.660
[Amit Varma]: order in much more which is of course facilitated by technology Swiggy's Amato etc you'd expect

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:38.260
[Amit Varma]: people to eat out much more where it's not just a special occasion thing and over a period

01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:42.460
[Amit Varma]: of time and I don't know what the delivery mechanism would be but over a period of time

01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:52.340
[Amit Varma]: you'd expect more niche taste to evolve as more niche creators also evolve in a sense

01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:56.540
[Amit Varma]: right like the market which you're catering to which likes your kind of food may not have

01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:02.700
[Amit Varma]: existed or known of its own existence 25 years ago but now it's there and I can see this

01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:08.220
[Amit Varma]: becoming more and more diverse and I did an episode on Indian food with the great food

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:14.100
[Amit Varma]: writer Vikram Doctor and one of the points Doc made was about his fears of homogenization

01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:18.100
[Amit Varma]: and the example he gave was of the Cavendish banana that here's a banana we export to the

01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:22.660
[Amit Varma]: world and then somewhere in North America they figure out is great to mass-produce last

01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:27.660
[Amit Varma]: well and now it comes back to India and it's destroying all the local and regional diversity

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:32.780
[Amit Varma]: and the Cavendish banana is everywhere and that's like a first wave of capitalism thing

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:38.260
[Amit Varma]: but the second wave that I see happening now is that individuals and get empowered and

01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:44.260
[Amit Varma]: a movement can break out in the opposite direction where individuals and small groups can preserve

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:48.380
[Amit Varma]: diversity like I did an episode with Pune single the entrepreneur behind stage brought

01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:54.080
[Amit Varma]: in and I had imagined before my episode with him that that's what is happening to languages

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:59.060
[Amit Varma]: and dialects that as we urbanize more and more you know city speak languages town speak

01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:02.960
[Amit Varma]: dialects the dialects are going to die out you're going to get homogenized because incentives

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:06.980
[Amit Varma]: are you go to a big city you want to communicate you know you might speak a dialect of Hindi

01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:12.020
[Amit Varma]: but you want to fit in so you learn Hindi and you forget your dialect and homogenization

01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:16.940
[Amit Varma]: but what is happening what he's demonstrated with stage and stage is an OTT for Bharat

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.820
[Amit Varma]: but not Bharat in terms of Hindi Punjabi Bharat in terms of Haryanvi Rajasthani Marwari and

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:26.400
[Amit Varma]: so on they have those languages happening on the thing and sudden and it's flourishing

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.540
[Amit Varma]: it's doing really well commercially and industries are coming up around those dialects and you

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:36.540
[Amit Varma]: have a movement in the opposite direction and and I see that as a good thing about the

01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:41.520
[Amit Varma]: creator economy that you have a decentralization you have a change in the way people consume

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:47.900
[Amit Varma]: content you have a change in the way people produce content and you move away from you

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:53.500
[Amit Varma]: know certain cliches that become comfort food across restaurants to and you know it's really

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:59.420
[Amit Varma]: a thousand flowers blooming or a thousand herbs looming as it were so you know and I'm

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.020
[Amit Varma]: just thinking aloud and and there's possibly no analog or you know one would have to stretch

01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:11.700
[Amit Varma]: but how is the whole world of food evolving in that sense like are these broad current

01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:16.540
[Amit Varma]: something that you also see happening in some distant way in the food world and over a period

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:20.500
[Amit Varma]: of time it's not that overnight you know I will cook something that my neighbor will

01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:25.700
[Amit Varma]: pay to eat but over time you know what are the direction the directional shifts that

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:32.740
[Guest 1]: you see in this whole ecosystem. I think you're definitely seeing a bunch of these trends

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:38.300
[Guest 1]: playing out much slower of course and I think there is a reason to that in my mind at least

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:44.540
[Guest 1]: I think when we started about almost eight years ago it was not even remotely cool to

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:52.060
[Guest 1]: be going out for an Indian meal and I think we were definitely part of that journey we've

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:58.900
[Guest 1]: seen here where a lot of restaurants have now sort of jumped in and I think everyone

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:05.700
[Guest 1]: now that is also this moment where now it's a moment of pride where like you are eating

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:11.660
[Guest 1]: Indian you are enjoying the food you enjoyed at home I remember there was this point when

01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:17.460
[Guest 1]: a few years ago when we put Pakhla Bath on the menu and Odias came from all over the

01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:22.340
[Guest 1]: city to come have it in the in the city right like it's a moment of pride that food from

01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:30.940
[Guest 1]: our state is making it to a restaurant but I think to take a step forward what we while

01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:35.980
[Guest 1]: in the creator economy what you're creating can be distributed digitally I think the challenge

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:42.620
[Guest 1]: really is that how do you take the food which is being done and being made at a much more

01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:50.660
[Guest 1]: small batch level and how do you distribute it enough to be able to make it viable for

01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:54.940
[Guest 1]: someone to put it in because as you rightly pointed out like I think there is a certain

01:43:54.940 --> 01:44:00.260
[Guest 1]: decentralization that's definitely happened but we are sitting in a room right now and

01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:07.300
[Guest 1]: we are talking about all things food and everything in between and tomorrow it can be with a push

01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:13.380
[Guest 1]: of a button it can be out there into the world that is definitely much harder to think through

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:18.380
[Guest 1]: as far as the world of the food goes but I think you definitely saw that in the last

01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:24.180
[Guest 1]: couple of years because of the tailwinds that the pandemic bought in this particular regard

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:30.420
[Guest 1]: was everyone's home became their place of work and suddenly like you were looking at

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:37.380
[Guest 1]: options because and we spoke about it so much like you didn't miss movie halls because you

01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:43.580
[Guest 1]: had all the OTT platforms to go to but when you when it came to food yeah you cooked on

01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:47.540
[Guest 1]: your own but you still food is also a form of entertainment and you looked for more and

01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:53.180
[Guest 1]: more interesting options to be bought home I remember for I think there was this one

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:59.180
[Guest 1]: Marathi cook which Yash found during the pandemic and we ordered from her she was cooking from

01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:04.940
[Guest 1]: home you sent her a whatsapp and it showed up on WeFast and it was great but the reality

01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:09.020
[Guest 1]: is now that life has gotten busier again like I'm actually remembering that almost after

01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:14.300
[Guest 1]: a solid year and a half at this point so I think I would love for it to move in that

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:19.940
[Guest 1]: direction but there are definitely challenges in terms of like for it to come to fruition

01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:25.540
[Guest 1]: so to speak to be able to see that complete convergence of the creator economy and the

01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:33.860
[Guest 2]: food ecosystem so to speak so I have a slightly differing opinion I have said this that the

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:42.460
[Guest 2]: last two years of the pandemic led to democratization of a tech stack right where Hungering is a

01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:51.540
[Guest 2]: very small organization but using something like Shopify right we I don't think anyone

01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:56.700
[Guest 2]: with a tech background needs you need a tech background to use Shopify but we had never

01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:02.220
[Guest 2]: run an e-commerce channel before we were dependent on Swiggy and Zomato and we set up Bombay

01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:09.540
[Guest 2]: Sweet Shop and one member of our team took it on and we just ran with it right and we

01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:18.300
[Guest 2]: grew our business right now the same way I feel there is someone at home now who's making

01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:25.860
[Guest 2]: the best pasta in Bandra and she sells maybe 10 portions a day right and she's happy with

01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:35.180
[Guest 2]: that right but I think two years ago she wouldn't have had the right simple technological advancements

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:44.260
[Guest 2]: to help her and that has changed my only problem with India's creator economy is everyone is

01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:55.140
[Guest 2]: only looking at the Oyo's, the Baiju's and the big unicorns and the drama around it and

01:46:55.140 --> 01:47:02.380
[Guest 2]: the pressure that then every boy or girl who's doing a great Sardo at home is how do I make

01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:09.140
[Guest 2]: this that big the expectations are too high on that creator and I tell I tell so many

01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:13.020
[Guest 2]: of them who come to us who are like we are still making out of home we are still selling

01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:18.660
[Guest 2]: out every day and we want to set up a chain and I was like why is it if it's still two

01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:23.900
[Guest 2]: of you if I do the math you're making more money than I am bottom line like but you can

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:28.460
[Guest 2]: have like even with us at Bombay Sweet Shop there is aspirations of taking this brand

01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:36.260
[Guest 2]: international, we want a sweet from India to be as recognized as Swiss chocolate it's

01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:40.620
[Amit Varma]: something we believe needs to be there, Barks is better than Swiss chocolate it's much better

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:46.740
[Guest 2]: there's no comparison this is ludicrous to compare but anyway sorry carry on so but there

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:53.860
[Guest 2]: shouldn't be that pressure on every creator to be the next big thing big thing because

01:47:53.860 --> 01:48:00.900
[Guest 2]: I worry about India's big unicorns when someone takes the curtain away there's like the amount

01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:06.180
[Guest 2]: of burn that's happening there no one looks at that but young 21 year olds are looking

01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:12.180
[Guest 2]: at valuations right now but they are not looking at the whole for me the creator economy is

01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:18.020
[Guest 2]: based on and I feel India had it with artisans like making really good like even with furniture

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:24.140
[Guest 2]: we were so good at our furniture and look at our furniture now right but we are all

01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:29.220
[Guest 2]: like blinded by valuations and the pressure that the 21 year old has to feel that his

01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:36.940
[Guest 2]: startup needs to be the next OYO I feel like aspirationally if I was starting two years

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:43.620
[Guest 2]: ago I would also want to start a sweet shop which only makes 200 sweets but because now

01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:50.660
[Guest 2]: quick commerce I can sell out of those 200 sweets every day right like those mechanisms

01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:54.980
[Guest 2]: are there the mechanisms like the same lady she's still I know she's still cooking she's

01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:59.540
[Guest 2]: found a smaller kitchen because she didn't want to do it out of her home and she's still

01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:04.740
[Guest 2]: selling out and she must be making slightly more money than she did during court but it's

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:11.220
[Guest 2]: a income stream that that family never had and for them it's great so I feel that democratization

01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:18.980
[Guest 2]: of tech the this quick commerce is helping so many little this but just that pressure

01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:24.660
[Guest 2]: shouldn't be there that that Malvani lady needs to now become the next you know chain

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:31.100
[Guest 2]: chain like she the next Goli Vada Pav or whatever there is so that's what I'm worried about

01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:36.780
[Guest 2]: is this franchise like for restaurants it's the franchise model the same thing we Danny

01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:42.140
[Guest 2]: Meyer we spoke about when we speak about Danny Meyer and setting the table and hospitality

01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:47.780
[Guest 2]: first no one recognizes it but when we say Shake Shack everyone recognizes it so he is

01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:52.660
[Guest 2]: the founder of Shake Shack but Shake Shack came into being 20 years after he started

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:58.860
[Guest 2]: his first restaurant or I could get 15 20 years after right he had set a foundation

01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:05.980
[Guest 2]: how that brand came off organically and then became what it is so I I honestly love what's

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:13.140
[Guest 2]: happening in the homes right now people have tried a lot like I get really impressed with

01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:20.260
[Guest 2]: India's craft alcohol industry I feel it started with people who were making beer in their

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:24.900
[Guest 2]: bathtubs and now I'm making the best some of the best craft beer in the world is coming

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:31.100
[Guest 2]: out of our country so I feel if they are given the right tools through incentives and various

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:36.140
[Guest 2]: things the you can see it flourish you can see it flourish yeah and this is something

01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:42.860
[Amit Varma]: I vibe with so much because you know and and people who do my podcasting course for example

01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:47.540
[Amit Varma]: I will tell them this also well like they'll be thinking of gaps in the markets how can

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:53.020
[Amit Varma]: we scale I'm like no no don't do that if everyone tries to be Chetan Bhagat you know everyone

01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:59.740
[Amit Varma]: will fail or even succeed which is worse but no all respect to Chetan but no seriously

01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:06.020
[Amit Varma]: but you know the only thing that kind of makes you unique is you you know out of the 7 billion

01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:09.700
[Amit Varma]: people in this world you have only one thing no one else has that is you be authentic be

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:14.020
[Amit Varma]: true to yourself do the kind of work that you like and and you know if you're in the

01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:18.220
[Amit Varma]: food business make the kind of stuff that you like and you do not have to scale you

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:23.020
[Amit Varma]: know especially for people of my age I'm in my late 40s you know there's this mental thing

01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:29.020
[Amit Varma]: that creators or entrepreneurs or whatever you have to scale you have to get to a certain

01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:34.460
[Amit Varma]: huge size like you put it and no the reality today is you don't need to think big yeah

01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:39.500
[Guest 1]: it is been romanticized so much in all the stories we hear about us like it's like raising

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:44.500
[Guest 1]: the next round is like the moniker of success yeah someone still wants their money back

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:47.660
[Guest 1]: at the end of it you have to work to give them their money back they're not letting

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:52.780
[Amit Varma]: you off the hook so easily and that's forgotten always and it's often not about a bottom line

01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:57.700
[Amit Varma]: alone though of course that drives a lot of stuff but it's also about the value you bring

01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:02.280
[Amit Varma]: to people's lives which is intangible right people eat your food there are memories associated

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:07.860
[Amit Varma]: with that which is actually a nice segue to the next sort of theme I want to explore which

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:12.140
[Amit Varma]: is something Sameer you spoke about when you you know last came over for lunch where we

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:18.500
[Amit Varma]: spoke about food and stories and the resonance of food in our lives in terms of you know

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.340
[Amit Varma]: what it tells us about our past and about memories and all of that like I was telling

01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:27.120
[Amit Varma]: Sameer when he was last here that my dad died last year so we sold his house we were cleaning

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:32.780
[Amit Varma]: it up and and most of the stuff we chose to let go because just no space it's not practical

01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:37.260
[Amit Varma]: but one thing I did keep were a whole bunch of recipe books which both my mother and her

01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:43.580
[Amit Varma]: mother my maternal maternal grandmother had kept and a lot of these by my maternal grandmother

01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:49.660
[Amit Varma]: are recipes in English of Western dishes like souffles and pizzas and all of that and she's

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:54.620
[Amit Varma]: writing in the 50s and 60s mind you in handwriting and they're all neat and you know the first

01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:58.940
[Amit Varma]: page of the notebook will have a table of contents which you can tell is being filled

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:05.860
[Amit Varma]: up as you know the pages as the years go by and I've done tons of episodes with various

01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:10.980
[Amit Varma]: women also on you know the lives of women in India have been so different from the lives

01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:16.140
[Amit Varma]: of men the histories have been so different in terms of being constrained by so many things

01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:22.100
[Amit Varma]: being most of the time at home having a completely different vista and food becomes such a big

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:26.460
[Amit Varma]: part of everything and on the one hand it's like fucking drudgery because every day you're

01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:30.940
[Amit Varma]: cooking meals for people who will express no appreciation and it's a pain but those

01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:36.740
[Amit Varma]: food those foods the cooking that you do then also becomes a part of you know it's it's

01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:41.580
[Amit Varma]: part of a heritage it's more than just something functional and whatever so I'd love to hear

01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:45.220
[Amit Varma]: sort of your thoughts on this because I know you want you know you spoke earlier of the

01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:50.060
[Amit Varma]: India of today but I know that's not all that interests you that you know so tell me a bit

01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:58.300
[Guest 1]: more about that journey so I think for us the other sort of epiphany that hit us when

01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:04.980
[Guest 1]: Bombay canteen opened is like how people connect to stories I think we've spoken earlier about

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:09.300
[Guest 1]: like even in menu design like yes it's form flavor but like how do you tell the story

01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:16.140
[Guest 1]: of the dish is equally important and we were very much rooted in nostalgia in our first

01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:21.140
[Guest 1]: year in terms of the way we told stories I think it was something when Bombay canteens

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:24.580
[Guest 1]: original idea actually originally when Yash and I came up with the idea it was called

01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:29.100
[Guest 1]: tiffin club and then there was a restaurant called tiffin that opened somewhere in Bombay

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:34.500
[Guest 1]: and we had to quickly veer away from that from that name but I think we ended at a better

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:38.580
[Guest 1]: place because for us the reason tiffin and club made sense at that point because you

01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:43.180
[Guest 1]: grew up eating tiffin there was a club somewhere around you wherever you grew up in India it

01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:52.020
[Guest 1]: was the sort of like a gymkhana which was the beating sort of heart of that community

01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:58.940
[Guest 1]: right like you met there and for us I'm glad it evolved to the city which was Bombay which

01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:03.900
[Guest 1]: represented so much to us and canteens which represented the same thought as tiffin where

01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:08.540
[Guest 1]: you where the office where the school where the college like everyone's been to a canteen

01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:14.220
[Guest 1]: and so began that journey but like when the first year of Bombay canteen was being celebrated

01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:19.780
[Guest 1]: we were like how would we celebrate and long before collaborations were a thing in the

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:24.500
[Guest 1]: world of food like we ended up collaborating with all our mothers with the simple thought

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:30.580
[Guest 1]: that when you when it's your birthday you she cooks you your favorite food so all four

01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:35.540
[Guest 1]: five of us who run the were running the restaurant we all come from different parts of the country

01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:40.740
[Guest 1]: and all our mothers flew in cook two dishes each and it was the called the mother of all

01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:47.740
[Guest 1]: menus and honestly like it was such a visceral response to the menu like it was our first

01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:53.300
[Guest 1]: to sort of showcase of what Yash was talking about just that diversity in a menu and regionality

01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:59.020
[Guest 1]: and nostalgia memories all of it was at play in those 10 dishes and but more importantly

01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:05.100
[Guest 1]: it was at play because of who it represented that for me was one and on a more personal

01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:11.560
[Guest 1]: level I feel like as Bombay canteen was opening I was also going through a personal experience

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:19.340
[Guest 1]: where my grandmom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009-2010 and she cooked certain things

01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:24.660
[Guest 1]: for us and she made certain things for us and literally very physically we saw that

01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:29.920
[Guest 1]: disappear while she was there we saw it disappear so the thought that struck us even back then

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:34.260
[Guest 1]: was like Indian food at the end of the day is undocumented like unlike other cuisines

01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:38.740
[Guest 1]: around the world like that is it's hugely undocumented and it's all oral histories or

01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:43.380
[Guest 1]: like word of mouth that it passes on and we've been fortunate enough in the last 7-8 years

01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.660
[Guest 1]: to go into people's homes people have shared with us the only way to learn is to go cook

01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:53.020
[Guest 1]: with someone it's not possible to do that and then come full circle to 2020 where the

01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:59.660
[Guest 1]: pandemic hits us and our natural places to tell these stories of food suddenly disappeared

01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:03.940
[Guest 1]: from under our feet like there was nothing left suddenly we are left with mediums such

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:08.020
[Guest 1]: as Instagram and other social media where we have to do everything now we have to tell

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:14.860
[Guest 1]: stories we have to make us sort of the rosy roti of it and like sell every day on it it

01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:20.100
[Guest 1]: became really difficult to sort of put that together and that kind of led to this thought

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:27.020
[Guest 1]: that how do we continue telling stories of where food in India is going and I specifically

01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:32.500
[Guest 1]: say food in India not Indian food because I don't think India of today eats only food

01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:37.100
[Guest 1]: that is traditional I think for us what's really important is to be inspired from where

01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:44.660
[Guest 1]: we came from but also also be thinking of where is it going and in that sort of spirit

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:47.740
[Guest 1]: I think what we're really excited about is the next project that we've been working on

01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:53.420
[Guest 1]: for the last year which is called Enthu Cutlet where hopefully you find like unusual stories

01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:57.500
[Guest 1]: of food in India which we are able to bring to you like whether it's an opinion whether

01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:01.900
[Guest 1]: it's a fresh take whether it's a conversation and it doesn't need to be written by someone

01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:05.540
[Guest 1]: who's from the world of food like because as you were saying like food is like central

01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:11.980
[Guest 1]: to all our lives at the end of the day and everyone has a memory around it and there

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:15.660
[Guest 1]: could be a take on it which you and I might not be familiar with and hopefully through

01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:22.100
[Guest 1]: that process we are able to sort of connect and reconnect with more and more people I

01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:26.500
[Guest 1]: think the reason you and I started talking was because of this project and like as you

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:31.660
[Guest 1]: told me your stories of what you've been through I was sharing and here we find ourselves

01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:36.740
[Guest 1]: having a longer conversation about it all and I think that in a nutshell is the power

01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:43.660
[Guest 1]: of food like it allows you to really really sort of connect with another person and share

01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:48.300
[Guest 1]: something with them in a way that it makes you feel something which links back to what

01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:53.340
[Guest 1]: we've always done as through Bombay Canteen or Pedro Bombay Sweet Shop hopefully it's

01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:58.020
[Guest 1]: food that makes you feel something and hopefully Enthu Cutlet presents stories to you that

01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:03.820
[Amit Varma]: make you feel something and what did your mother's cook?

01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:15.820
[Guest 2]: My mother cooked prawn curry and it was chicken curry no wait so we made a kothu roti out

01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:22.580
[Guest 2]: of the prawn curry that was later that was much later and she had a dessert I feel clearly

01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:31.580
[Guest 1]: that prawn curry though I will not forget like it's that hue of orange in it's that

01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:33.620
[Guest 1]: flavor is just like how is it made?

01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:39.380
[Guest 2]: I can tell you how it's made go for it so it is that the color comes from obviously

01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:46.220
[Guest 2]: red chili fresh fresh coconut and then a little bit of tamarind so the mix of those colors

01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:50.260
[Guest 2]: that gives you a little bit of onions which gets sauteed at the start and then just prawns

01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:56.820
[Guest 2]: and the rest of the ingredients so it's something she makes like she's we had a limited menu

01:59:56.820 --> 02:00:03.780
[Guest 2]: at home we were good carnivores but chicken, fish, mutton but trying to remember she's

02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:07.580
[Guest 2]: going to be really angry I don't remember the other dish should just come up with something

02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:11.380
[Amit Varma]: your brother was right to warn you not to mess it up I mean this is like a family scam

02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:14.620
[Guest 1]: yeah yeah what did your mother cook?

02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:19.260
[Guest 1]: She made the dahi pakodas which there was specific like which were exploding which were

02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:23.340
[Guest 1]: like it was hard to make because there was one she's from Agra so it's a particular kind

02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:28.740
[Guest 1]: of pakoda where it's stuffed inside with something and it's hard to sort of pull off because

02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:32.900
[Guest 1]: you first fry it then you soak it and then it's put in dahi etc and the other dish was

02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:40.300
[Guest 1]: a gobi dish which I think all of us were like a gobi musallam from Lucknow so so she did

02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:42.860
[Guest 1]: a version of a musallam but with gobi.

02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:48.020
[Amit Varma]: So tell me something brief digression I am kind of learning to cook an amateur cook and

02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:53.100
[Amit Varma]: the things that I find most easy and pleasurable to cook are either western dishes or South

02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:57.580
[Amit Varma]: East Asian dishes because they're just so freaking easy right you put three four things

02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:02.220
[Amit Varma]: and it's simple and it's fast and frugal and it's kind of done the Indian stuff every time

02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:07.060
[Amit Varma]: I look at an Indian recipe I'm going mad because it is half a teaspoon of this and have one

02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:12.260
[Amit Varma]: teaspoon of that and there are like 40 spices and there are like 80 procedures and I'm like

02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:16.900
[Amit Varma]: what you know just keep it simple why is that?

02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:21.020
[Guest 2]: I was going to say but that's where the creator economy comes and now there's a maushi on

02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:26.740
[Guest 2]: whatsapp who will send you like a vindaloo masala that she's made fresh and which you

02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:32.380
[Guest 2]: can keep in your fridge and I do that in Bandra there are the whatsapp groups which so normally

02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:37.580
[Guest 2]: like the local butcher will keep most of these masalas in like regular pearl pet plastic

02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:43.060
[Guest 2]: jars and it's fantastic like I have just discovered it so it just needs onions a little bit of

02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:48.580
[Guest 2]: pork nicely sauteed and you put this and people feel you cooked it from scratch so like I'm

02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:53.380
[Guest 2]: I'm not kidding and I'll send you a packet it's unbelievable how easy it is and it will

02:01:53.380 --> 02:02:01.660
[Guest 2]: be keto because yeah of course masala is but to your point so we had and scientifically

02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:09.040
[Guest 2]: I think dock will be the best place to start but India's idea of is refrigeration like

02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:15.540
[Guest 2]: I feel the idea of spices the vinegar and stuff like the souring agents we used to use

02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:21.660
[Guest 2]: every state like Goa uses a lot of vinegar we use tamarind here they use kokum the souring

02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:28.160
[Guest 2]: agents the grounded spice because refrigeration wasn't huge in India I feel was a way of preserving

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:34.900
[Guest 2]: the curry that you made I would be quite confident on that but obviously doc would be the right

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:39.020
[Amit Varma]: person to answer on that yeah I mean that's a great point I mean one of the things I realized

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:44.260
[Amit Varma]: by doc is that the food landscape changes so fast that things you think of as Indian

02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:51.420
[Amit Varma]: today weren't Indian like just 20 years ago right it just changes so incredibly fast and

02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:56.900
[Amit Varma]: how have your taste changed like do you still like your mom's food as much or but which

02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:03.020
[Guest 1]: I'm sure everyone does no but there's certain things which we almost like look down upon

02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:10.340
[Guest 1]: growing up where which I crave now so like there is a particular with the which we would

02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:15.020
[Guest 1]: like cringe coming back from school and eating and I know she'll love it if when she hears

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:20.180
[Guest 1]: this that like that's the one meal I look forward to with that aloo ki sabzi and bhindi

02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:24.580
[Guest 1]: right like it's just the combination is just it transports you somewhere I don't think

02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:31.340
[Guest 1]: I'll ever make the move to Lockie and tinder but I think that will on the chat are thinking

02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:43.340
[Guest 1]: you're on tinder yes sure good job I think the Lockie would accept the context so I think

02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:50.180
[Guest 1]: I still love the food I get at home Yash was there last week and my mom thought she was

02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:56.780
[Guest 1]: feeding me so like she like a meal in my house is never less than like four dishes at a particular

02:03:56.780 --> 02:04:02.980
[Guest 2]: time so these guys were overfed and how like to his question I feel like let's like home

02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:11.100
[Guest 2]: food like I I don't I feel I have stuck to the same I never liked water now sir and Warren

02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:16.300
[Guest 2]: I still like I remember if I go back home my parents are still in Pune and if it's Shravan

02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:20.060
[Guest 2]: I still remember if I drive from Bombay to Pune and that is like what I know so and I'm

02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:25.260
[Amit Varma]: like I didn't drive here for this I came here for the prawn what do they think of the food

02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:31.260
[Guest 2]: that you guys serve up like my parents my mom obviously like you know like she's not

02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:39.420
[Guest 2]: very opinionated my dad is so he'll give it to me straight no matter how uneducated that

02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:47.540
[Amit Varma]: opinion can be but that's the third member of the family yeah yeah I was waiting for

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:53.940
[Guest 2]: that moment check and check opinions are a lot but they love it like they were at Bombay

02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:58.100
[Guest 2]: canteen this weekend there's really proud of both of us and what we've achieved obviously

02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:02.860
[Guest 2]: and they've seen us through the ups and downs so they love the food but to your point I

02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:08.020
[Guest 2]: just wanted to go back like if how our tastes have evolved I think it's also because we're

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:15.180
[Guest 2]: part of the industry we travel a lot and we eat a lot on those travels and the travels

02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:19.640
[Guest 2]: are two kinds one is work travel where then we are eating like three meals a day and one

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:25.220
[Guest 2]: could be like a really fine dining place where it's a fancy meal and we are not eating it

02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:29.900
[Guest 2]: to replicate it but you're eating it to get inspired right you're eating it because there

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:34.500
[Guest 2]: might be a texture in there or like a technique that was used or the way it was presented

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:39.340
[Guest 2]: or the service and you just like wow they've simplified this like we need to do something

02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:48.260
[Guest 2]: similar so I feel in in that way like four five years ago I was I was mesmerized by these

02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:55.500
[Guest 2]: fancy meals now I'm not so much I feel like it gets overdone to a certain point I just

02:05:55.500 --> 02:06:02.100
[Guest 2]: want to go have a good meal but we were at a restaurant in Brooklyn called Bonnie's and

02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:09.740
[Guest 2]: they served this cold chicken and it's basically a Hainanese chicken but they serve it cold

02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:18.740
[Guest 2]: and it's basically chicken leg as so simply done and brimming with flavor and it just

02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:24.100
[Guest 2]: blew our mind like it was nothing like what we've ever tasted before and it's a like it's

02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:29.420
[Guest 2]: a take on American Chinese food it's a nice fun casual restaurant what blew us away was

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:33.700
[Guest 2]: the server that day and he also realized we are people from the industry because we ended

02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:38.940
[Guest 2]: up ordering the whole menu and he enjoyed like you could feel the happiness in his eyes

02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:46.020
[Guest 2]: of us just like devouring the food so for me I think my like because I've been a bartender

02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:50.060
[Guest 2]: before also it used to be about whichever city you go to need to check out X amount

02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:55.700
[Guest 2]: of cocktail bars but now you're like been there done that there's only X amount of experimentation

02:06:55.700 --> 02:07:01.100
[Guest 2]: that's going to go on but you're finding those places which really like inspire you I feel

02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:07.980
[Guest 2]: my I've I think my tastes have matured obviously like 10 years ago I think I didn't have any

02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:14.140
[Guest 2]: of this at all I still don't have a wine palette at all it's I if I drink a good wine I'll

02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:21.940
[Guest 2]: say it's it's great but I'm not like hints of leather and masala chai but that's something

02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:26.400
[Guest 2]: I know I can work on so like the great thing about us like I was speaking to someone same

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:31.540
[Guest 2]: like this going back to this creator economy another new thing we want to start planning

02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:36.460
[Guest 2]: a new project but we want to have a good coffee program to it and I was very honest to the

02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:40.820
[Guest 2]: person I was speaking to saying hungering has never done great coffee but it's never

02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:45.540
[Guest 2]: been because it's always been a 1% somewhere and at this place also it's not going to have

02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:50.620
[Guest 2]: a coffee program but I need to have a great coffee so find me that guy who's now roaming

02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:55.860
[Guest 2]: all over India figuring out good estates and who will set it up and keep coming and training

02:07:55.860 --> 02:08:00.700
[Guest 2]: me also because I need to be trained before it happens so within our I feel like there

02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:04.940
[Guest 2]: are so many things for me personally like I always we say like wouldn't it be great

02:08:04.940 --> 02:08:12.780
[Guest 2]: to go to a whiskey class in in Scotland for three months right so I feel that as one of

02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:18.620
[Guest 2]: the things that restaurant owners in India get called is promoters and I hate that word

02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:22.980
[Guest 2]: when when you know it comes out Yash and Sameera are the promoters of Bombay canteen and I

02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:29.100
[Guest 2]: try using the word founders a lot because we are involved in the food the drink the

02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:34.820
[Guest 2]: service not physically as much as we used to but a lot in the ideation and we want to

02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:40.980
[Guest 2]: be involved and for us to be involved we need to keep evolving our palette or you know taste

02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:46.820
[Guest 1]: to a certain level and I think it goes back to like doing things right like I think the

02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:52.860
[Guest 1]: tastes have obviously evolved but I think it's going back to the storytelling aspect

02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:56.400
[Guest 1]: of it like this last year has been such an interesting journey where we've been working

02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:02.420
[Guest 1]: with again a little village to bring this the N2 Cutlet project to life where we've

02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:09.020
[Guest 1]: had a chance to meet so many people who are brimming with ideas whether it's here in India

02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:13.980
[Guest 1]: whether it's abroad who are passionate about Indian food and are sort of dying to sell

02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:21.140
[Guest 1]: stories about where it's going and for us now this is a period of like absolute like

02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:26.500
[Guest 1]: it's a blank slate because there is there are no rules to in our mind like we have no

02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:32.940
[Guest 1]: idea how to run a media company a content company or any of those so the question is

02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:37.900
[Guest 1]: how can we continuously be curious experiment iterate and it really brings me back to the

02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:44.020
[Guest 1]: original like your first year of Bombay Canteen where all we knew is we wanted to like open

02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:48.700
[Guest 1]: and but once you open like it's that's when the true magic happens because you see other

02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:55.000
[Guest 1]: people come in and it truly becomes like a dialogue and not a monologue like right now

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.940
[Guest 1]: it's a monologue amongst us and that dialogue of like people giving us ideas coming contributing

02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:05.620
[Guest 1]: is what we're looking forward to where to Yash's point like travel became such a huge

02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:13.940
[Guest 1]: part of our method if I can call it that because where else do you go as like entrepreneurs

02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:20.760
[Guest 1]: founders to go learn you have to go just you have to go see things feel things like look

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:25.380
[Guest 1]: at things like the other thing that I remember from this last trip that we took we were at

02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:30.980
[Guest 1]: a fine dining restaurant in New York City and the food I will say was nothing not something

02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:36.260
[Guest 1]: I will remember but what I took away from it was they bought out this beautiful leather

02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:42.340
[Guest 1]: bag and they let you choose your own chopsticks it was just the act of like just opening this

02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:48.100
[Guest 1]: bag and like beautiful like inlay work chopsticks and this excitement amongst the four of us

02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:53.620
[Guest 1]: that I want this one no no you took the one you I wanted and it brought out the kid in

02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:59.840
[Guest 2]: you and that's the beauty of the eye for detail of that person taking care of us was my girlfriend's

02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:06.140
[Guest 2]: left-handed so he quietly at some point moved the chopstick hold on to her left well you

02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:11.620
[Guest 2]: know simple things simple things that you know you have like and where it transcends

02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:16.260
[Guest 1]: from just being a meal to like an experience as we keep talking about right like I think

02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:21.140
[Guest 1]: the word experience gets thrown around so much but like the question is what today now

02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:26.100
[Guest 1]: you know in a world where all of us are privileged enough to like have these experiences what

02:11:26.100 --> 02:11:30.860
[Guest 1]: will excite us next is the question we are asking so even with whether it's the restaurants

02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:35.340
[Guest 1]: whether it's Bombay Sweet Shoppe whether it's N2 Cutlet the question we're asking is like

02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:40.020
[Guest 1]: what is it that will be exciting to someone will it be we at lunch today we're talking

02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:45.820
[Guest 1]: about how you did this trip to Mysore and like ate within a 10 square kilometer radius

02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:51.220
[Guest 1]: and you were blown away by the diversity of food within 10 kilometers yes that is truly

02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:56.340
[Guest 1]: exciting like I can you imagine like if that list existed out there in the world and like

02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:02.500
[Guest 1]: allowed for people from Bangalore or Mysore to quickly go and like experience that versus

02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:07.660
[Guest 1]: that to me would be exciting because genuinely like in today's day and age it's so hard to

02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:13.340
[Guest 1]: like sift through the clutter to actually get to things which you trust things which

02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:17.540
[Guest 1]: you feel will be good like we are all busy in our day-to-day lives you want to go and

02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:24.260
[Guest 1]: like quickly have that one amazing thing so why not why can't this be one of those experiences

02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:29.900
[Guest 1]: and hopefully and conversations like this hopefully like spark other thoughts and and

02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:35.140
[Guest 1]: then you're on it on to something hopefully which is like a journey which is amazing yeah

02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:40.180
[Amit Varma]: and one of the sort of the important needs of our times where we are surrounded by an

02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:46.180
[Amit Varma]: abundance of sensation and abundance of content is also filters so just that thing that okay

02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:52.260
[Amit Varma]: I am in this city where should I eat and what should I eat and to have a sense of that you

02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:56.980
[Amit Varma]: know not just like a trip advisor top five rated restaurants but to have a sense of what

02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:01.540
[Amit Varma]: would I like and where do I get that experience we'll talk a lot more about into cutlet but

02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:08.780
[Amit Varma]: first I have some broader questions and one of them is about what I see as an interesting

02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:14.660
[Amit Varma]: dichotomy that perhaps doesn't exist in other areas like you guys have done my writing course

02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:19.980
[Amit Varma]: so one of the things I talk about there is that style must always be a slave to substance

02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:24.260
[Amit Varma]: right you don't want style to overwhelm the substance and yes you pointed out a moment

02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:29.260
[Amit Varma]: ago that you know you're not into flashy food anymore you're not into all the drama in the

02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:35.020
[Amit Varma]: theater ultimately now you just the taste the substance of it matters so that's one

02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:40.940
[Amit Varma]: way of looking at it but where food is different from everything else is that you're a person's

02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:46.180
[Amit Varma]: experience of the food they are eating is also shaped by the theater is also shaped

02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:50.980
[Amit Varma]: by the perceptions right the fact that you're choosing your chopstick in that elaborate

02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:56.140
[Amit Varma]: act from a leather bag does affect your experience at some level you are definitely going to

02:13:56.140 --> 02:14:02.940
[Amit Varma]: find the food a little more elevated yeah elevated as opposed to if that experience

02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:09.860
[Amit Varma]: hadn't happened so unlike in anything else the you know these extra trappings are also

02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:16.260
[Amit Varma]: kind of important so how does one draw this balance to you know to figure out that what

02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:21.580
[Amit Varma]: element of the theater or the gimmicks or whatever are necessary to the food being elevated

02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:31.420
[Guest 2]: and what our superfluous to it great question and the same the challenge with all of this

02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:39.500
[Guest 2]: is when people think that everything around the food is what's making the experience right

02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:47.100
[Guest 2]: and India's gone through this painful and it's going through this painful gimmicky phase

02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:52.940
[Guest 2]: where the smoke and mirrors of things we're hopefully peeking out of it at this point

02:14:52.940 --> 02:15:02.180
[Guest 2]: as in hope is the smoke and mirrors is what people think will drive people back right

02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:10.420
[Guest 2]: restaurants are being built on trends right Instagram images Instagram images Pinterest

02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:16.820
[Guest 2]: boards are what define a restaurant right now well whereas you create we've been lucky

02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:23.660
[Guest 2]: our restaurants have stood the test of time let's be honest but we have put in that effort

02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:30.180
[Guest 2]: that there is a philosophy first there's an experience around it and the philosophy with

02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:36.820
[Guest 2]: the experience keeps evolving right we didn't set out to say that a modern Indian got rent

02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:43.260
[Guest 2]: on a let's jump on it make your own trend right like you said like you're a one in seven

02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:51.940
[Guest 2]: billion people show who you are and the reason why I feel like the superfluous or like what

02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:56.660
[Guest 2]: you described is people have forgotten that yes the act of selecting the chopsticks was

02:15:56.660 --> 02:16:02.680
[Guest 2]: amazing but I use that chopsticks to have the best bowl of ramen if that doesn't exist

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:11.460
[Guest 2]: then none of this makes sense right and it's you know what I miss in India is an educated

02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:23.180
[Guest 2]: opinionated review of the work we do in terms of like if I were in New York a review happens

02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:29.180
[Guest 2]: after three between three to six months why because and they come at least thrice certain

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:33.980
[Guest 2]: publications yeah it's because they want the restaurants to settle right a restaurant at

02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:39.300
[Guest 2]: the end of the day is like kind of like a factory like everything needs to fall like

02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:44.460
[Guest 2]: a domino effect and it takes time right you have to be fair to the restaurant I always

02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:50.300
[Guest 2]: tell people we have been so lucky that the whole ecosystem supported us we've had bad

02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:56.380
[Guest 2]: reviews as well which is fine give us reviews based on the product the experience and that's

02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:01.140
[Guest 2]: what it should be and as an entrepreneur you have to take it in your stride in India the

02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:10.460
[Guest 2]: that power went directly to the Zomato reviewer right which is fine it's also a measurable

02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:18.740
[Guest 2]: attribute for a restaurant and we I've never replied to Zomato reviews only because I don't

02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:25.140
[Guest 2]: think it's an informed review right but if 10 people on Zomato tell me that service is

02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:33.540
[Guest 2]: bad I need to look at it right so right now restaurants are being dictated by if the reel

02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:39.260
[Guest 2]: of it looked good if the Instagram lighting worked but that's not going to last long it's

02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:47.860
[Guest 2]: going to last six months and you're going to fade away so a good warm bowl of food comforting

02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:54.060
[Guest 2]: food if you start there build all these little experiences around it and make it come together

02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:58.300
[Guest 2]: I think that's what makes a restaurant or any food place for me at least yeah and I

02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:02.540
[Guest 1]: think the question you asked is a great one because like what is the filter you use to

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:08.340
[Guest 1]: say that this is me and this is not me right like you can again going back to that original

02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:12.540
[Guest 1]: thought we discussed some time ago you can't be everything for everyone and I think it's

02:18:12.540 --> 02:18:21.980
[Guest 1]: something we'd maybe have unconsciously always felt like if this is making sense in the so

02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:27.260
[Guest 1]: one of the first experiences we created at Bombay canteen I still remember was and it

02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:32.780
[Guest 1]: just came right we were busy looking for colorful bottles to put on the table and we were in

02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:37.820
[Guest 1]: Muhammad Ali Road in our bottle suppliers this thing and he was showing us colorful

02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:42.620
[Guest 1]: bottles because we felt the design needed and then suddenly like someone in the stove

02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:49.300
[Guest 1]: pulled out an old Ruwafza bottle and it struck a memory that water bottles always used to

02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:57.340
[Guest 1]: be old reuse bottles in home our core our storytelling was nostalgic in nature and Ruwafza

02:18:57.340 --> 02:19:02.500
[Guest 1]: bottles were what we chose they didn't have any color but and I kid you not in the first

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:05.620
[Guest 1]: six months a number of people who tried to steal those bottles and like we've stopped

02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:09.780
[Amit Varma]: people at the door can you please keep are you serious yeah I feel those bottles yeah

02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:14.340
[Guest 1]: how do you steal bottles as in you you'll be shocked at how people think they can and

02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:18.380
[Guest 1]: but to get caught anyway they would literally put it under their under their jacket and

02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:27.020
[Guest 1]: try to walk out and it's funny right but again like is it gimmicky maybe but it fit into

02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:31.820
[Guest 1]: the story we were trying to tell at that time and I think that may be the filter like we

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:38.860
[Guest 1]: sort of try and apply because there is things that make sense like I remember this molecular

02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:44.580
[Guest 1]: gastronomy has been a thing and when we were opening Bombay canteen it was really a thing

02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:48.860
[Guest 1]: like anything modern related to Indian food at that time had to have liquid nitrogen thrown

02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:53.620
[Guest 1]: on it otherwise it was not modern it was a blockchain of the food world oh yes couldn't

02:19:53.620 --> 02:20:00.340
[Guest 1]: have said it better yeah and I remember going to a restaurant where which was an obvious

02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:06.460
[Guest 1]: riff of Heston Blumenthal's dish at the Fat Duck I'd never been to Fat Duck at that point

02:20:06.460 --> 02:20:12.460
[Guest 1]: but like he just tasted bad because like it's basically this one dish where there's sand

02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:17.260
[Guest 1]: and above that there's a glass and you place few dishes and then I had the opportunity

02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:22.700
[Guest 1]: to go to Fat Duck a few couple of years after I'd had that and you realize what they're

02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:26.580
[Guest 1]: doing at the Fat Duck is telling the story of Heston's childhood of going through an

02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:33.260
[Guest 1]: English countryside and stopping in the beach at wherever in south of England and this was

02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:37.220
[Guest 1]: his memory being told and you're wearing these headphones and you're listening to the waves

02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:42.820
[Guest 1]: crash and then it all suddenly makes sense but suddenly because you put a piece of like

02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:48.460
[Guest 1]: tandoori prawn on a on sand and you're serving it and because it looked good on Instagram

02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:55.140
[Guest 1]: it is never going to work ever and that's the that's the difference between like what

02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:59.660
[Guest 1]: Yash was talking about like hopefully we like move beyond like at the end of the day it

02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:05.620
[Guest 1]: starts and ends with the food it has to be that and then you layer above that but if

02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:08.980
[Guest 1]: you don't have the basics right it's never going to work.

02:21:08.980 --> 02:21:13.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah and I guess a test for this is the same test as in writing like what I talk about

02:21:13.460 --> 02:21:18.980
[Amit Varma]: in writing is like sure you want to make it vivid you'll try various things but the time

02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:23.340
[Amit Varma]: you realize you failed is when the reader notices a piece of prose for itself their

02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:27.940
[Amit Varma]: attention is drawn to the reader to the writer where they'll say oh you know Yash is so witty

02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:32.180
[Amit Varma]: I must follow him on Instagram instead of actually following the narrative but if it

02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:37.540
[Amit Varma]: fits into the narrative like the reverse a bottle does you know then then it's great

02:21:37.540 --> 02:21:44.620
[Amit Varma]: and that sort of makes a lot of sense to me I'm also interested in bars right now I am

02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:50.500
[Amit Varma]: not much of a drinker my notion of drinks is that it should be a pretty straightforward

02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:57.060
[Amit Varma]: process it you know this much of the alcohol this much of the mixer this much of the whatever

02:21:57.060 --> 02:22:04.900
[Amit Varma]: you mix it ultimately every good cocktail bar will basically be competent right but

02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:09.820
[Amit Varma]: you opened Antidote in Singapore which won quote-unquote best bar in Singapore in the

02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:17.140
[Amit Varma]: year 2014 so you know tell me what makes a good bar what is in your philosophy as a bartender

02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:23.140
[Amit Varma]: as a cocktail mixer you know how do you sort of elevate it above and I am the most lay

02:22:23.140 --> 02:22:27.540
[Amit Varma]: person lay person you could speak to on this because I literally you know have no idea

02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:35.300
[Guest 2]: so so I feel like even like the my Antidote journey was very very small but since then

02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:42.380
[Guest 2]: like my even before and after the journey of learning good cocktail making lessons or

02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:48.660
[Guest 2]: even like bringing it in into Bombay canteen where we were also on the Asia's top hundred

02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:56.060
[Guest 2]: list is there are simple things that you need to do right and which we and we in India were

02:22:56.060 --> 02:23:02.000
[Guest 2]: getting wrong like the kind of ice you use even the simplest equipment that you use your

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:10.300
[Guest 2]: mixing techniques your stirring techniques a lot of that earlier was more on the kind

02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:15.660
[Guest 2]: of glassware you are using and how fancy that can be but that's a later thing that brings

02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:26.260
[Guest 2]: in the experience as we spoke about bartending is very similar to even cooking but the benefit

02:23:26.260 --> 02:23:29.340
[Guest 2]: chefs have is they have 20 minutes to pull out a dish and with a drink you have to have

02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:35.020
[Guest 2]: it in five minutes no one waits 20 minutes for a drink but the same level of technique

02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:42.900
[Guest 2]: goes into it and I feel like right now Indian bars are some of them are on level with international

02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:50.980
[Guest 2]: bars is because earlier and it's going to be a slightly long answer earlier Indian chefs

02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:55.380
[Guest 2]: never really traveled now chefs have all traveled over the world come back and standards in

02:23:55.380 --> 02:24:00.820
[Guest 2]: India have improved same is happening in the bar industry a lot of great bartenders work

02:24:00.820 --> 02:24:05.940
[Guest 2]: out of India and and international guys are coming coming in as well a lot of bar pop-ups

02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:12.900
[Guest 2]: happen so the measuring like just so important because at the end of the day it's a sweet

02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:18.820
[Guest 2]: sour balance right so sweetener normally is your sugar syrup and your acidity either comes

02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:24.040
[Guest 2]: from a citrus or typically that's lime or lemon juice right those are the basics of

02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:28.260
[Guest 2]: any cocktail with balance then you layer it up with a sense of you add a little bit of

02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:32.940
[Guest 2]: bitters there's a sense of you add a little bit of liquors into it which gives that taste

02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:41.180
[Guest 2]: to it there are those in India we love bartenders who like flair and like don't use any kind

02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:49.260
[Guest 2]: of measures in world over that's gone away where you use a measure to like 5ml 10ml 12ml

02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:55.300
[Guest 2]: that level because it does make a huge difference it's a recipe chilling your cocktail to the

02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:58.620
[Guest 2]: right temperature chilling your glassware to the right temperature and then shaking

02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:05.420
[Guest 2]: or stirring it as required they're very simple techniques I also feel India needs to just

02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:11.180
[Guest 2]: wipe its slate clean and say we'll just do classic cocktails and we'll do it really well

02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:17.700
[Guest 2]: but we directly went to the spherified masala chai martinis and I feel that's what threw

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:22.500
[Amit Varma]: people off there's the first time hearing of it so I think it's a figment of Yash's

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:28.820
[Guest 1]: imagination but no but just to add to what Yash is saying again like it's funny how as

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:33.220
[Guest 1]: we are almost this has been an interesting reflection on the last seven years and I don't

02:25:33.220 --> 02:25:37.780
[Guest 1]: think we've spoken about so many and memories are coming back I feel the first year of Bombay

02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:44.300
[Guest 1]: Canteen opening was again like such a learning curve in terms of the drinks program because

02:25:44.300 --> 02:25:48.420
[Guest 1]: we had we were fortunate enough to meet this one gentleman his name is Dimitri he lives

02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:55.100
[Guest 1]: here in Bombay and he's an amazing bartender has worked with liquor companies across the

02:25:55.100 --> 02:26:01.020
[Guest 1]: world and he helped set up the first cocktail menu at Bombay Canteen and as we were setting

02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:06.060
[Guest 1]: up I'd come back from New York Yash had come back from Singapore and we had fallen in love

02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:09.540
[Guest 1]: with the Negronis of the world the Manhattans of the world like the classic cocktail the

02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:16.020
[Guest 1]: alcohol forward martinis etc but funnily enough we forgot to take into context the context

02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:22.780
[Guest 1]: of India at that point think about it in 2015 we were still in the Mojito Long Island Ice

02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:30.120
[Guest 1]: Tea heyday fruity drinks were the call of the hour we were just seeing the molecular

02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:37.700
[Guest 1]: stuff starting to come in which was still sugary sweet and here we were presenting these

02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:45.260
[Guest 1]: sort of drinks which the palette didn't exist so to speak for it and I remember he and I

02:26:45.260 --> 02:26:50.600
[Guest 1]: went to the US for a trip and we ended up in San Francisco at this bar called Chick

02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:56.520
[Guest 1]: Dog since then they have come down and worked with us here a couple of years back and what

02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:03.700
[Guest 1]: blew us away was again they had a menu which was telling fun stories it had nothing to

02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:09.420
[Guest 1]: do with the cocktails their menu was like a stolen CIA dossier and it just had fun with

02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:14.980
[Guest 1]: that like it was nothing to do with cocktails or anything it was making you have fun while

02:27:14.980 --> 02:27:19.060
[Guest 1]: you were reading a menu and therefore you ordered a cocktail and we came back with that

02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:25.020
[Guest 1]: inspiration and then we took it to our partners at Please See where Pritha like came up with

02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:30.500
[Guest 1]: the thought that what if we tell stories of Bombay through the cocktail menu and our first

02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:37.480
[Guest 1]: cocktail menu which we did as a result was a pop-up storybook of the Art Deco buildings

02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:42.880
[Guest 1]: of Bombay and literally we still have a few copies where you as you unfold it you see

02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:48.580
[Guest 1]: all these heritage buildings which we created this beautiful map where you could walk around

02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:54.740
[Guest 1]: to these buildings and explore the Art Deco district in South Bombay and what was interesting

02:27:54.740 --> 02:28:01.100
[Guest 1]: was people were like I've been to that building I want that cocktail and suddenly you've transported

02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:06.380
[Guest 1]: them into rather than thinking about the alcohol etc and what simultaneously happened to what

02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:11.420
[Guest 1]: Yash was referring to earlier was like the craft liquor industry was coming in where

02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:17.780
[Guest 1]: the quality of overall the input like the raw materials being used was going up which

02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:23.420
[Guest 1]: were more affordable like it or not alcohol is taxed at what it is in India so the inputs

02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:28.860
[Guest 1]: are really really sort of high cost and I think it was a question in the last four years

02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:32.980
[Guest 1]: four five years it's been all boats rise with the tide where many things in the ecosystem

02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:38.380
[Guest 1]: have happened for it to reach the level it has including bartenders going out and being

02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:45.060
[Guest 1]: more exposed to world-class technique all of it has happened to slowly layer it on and

02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:49.380
[Guest 1]: become what it is today and I think it's a very exciting time to be in the sort of cocktail

02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:53.980
[Guest 1]: bar space in Bombay in India right now because of the amazing work being done by so many

02:28:53.980 --> 02:29:01.620
[Guest 2]: people like I'll just give a quick thing like and it's also we've I feel Covid was a difficult

02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:07.020
[Guest 2]: time for us but there were silver linings on the way we looked at things so to his point

02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:14.660
[Guest 2]: like all boats rise with the tide we've been lucky like India's the craft gin revolution

02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:21.560
[Guest 2]: has helped bartenders tremendously like gins like stranger and sons short story gin is

02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:26.980
[Guest 2]: something that you need for like all cocktails I would say like a great martini but these

02:29:26.980 --> 02:29:31.640
[Guest 2]: companies have also let bartenders travel internationally through them and telling the

02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:38.220
[Guest 2]: story of Indian gin abroad we've had a number four bar in Asia now in India which is the

02:29:38.220 --> 02:29:45.060
[Guest 2]: Tashoro which is run by Arijit and Pankaj and since January we said that we want to

02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:50.900
[Guest 2]: work on an online mentorship program with them through zoom for our teams at hunger

02:29:50.900 --> 02:29:56.100
[Guest 2]: inc because we know that we can't have people of their expertise on our payroll all the

02:29:56.100 --> 02:30:02.660
[Guest 2]: time and they would not want to be restricted by that but I also know my team needs mentorship

02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:09.380
[Guest 2]: and needs it from the best in class so now everyone's so used to using zoom why not they

02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:13.900
[Guest 2]: are based out of Goa start using it and it's such an inspiring thing for the team to be

02:30:13.900 --> 02:30:18.780
[Guest 2]: even spend one hour a week just talking to them asking them okay I tried making this

02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:24.860
[Guest 2]: cocktail the balance was off can you help me so even things like that have like helped

02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:30.420
[Guest 2]: and I think the industry is going to just get better from there so you guys mentioned

02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:34.660
[Amit Varma]: palates the challenge being that you know you start something new but people's palates

02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:39.780
[Amit Varma]: are palates aren't evolved there and so on and earlier you spoke about how a lot of Zomato

02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:45.540
[Amit Varma]: reviews of your restaurant will just be uninformed right and you know so I just bought this Korean

02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:50.220
[Amit Varma]: sauce from urban platter called gochugaru Korean spice rather called gochugaru and when

02:30:50.220 --> 02:30:54.540
[Amit Varma]: I was reading the reviews of it on the reviews page it was immediately obvious that all the

02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:59.300
[Amit Varma]: negative reviews are for people who don't get what it is they are expecting it to be

02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:06.260
[Amit Varma]: like an Indian spice and they are saying garlic and it's like like come on you know but that

02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:10.580
[Amit Varma]: context isn't there yeah and hopefully you would imagine that over a period of time their

02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:14.900
[Amit Varma]: palates also get trained like when we were at lunch we were you know I was telling you

02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:18.860
[Amit Varma]: about this restaurant I used to go to and yes you mentioned you used to go to also in

02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:24.100
[Amit Varma]: the 90s we won't mention it but Bombay sizzler joint we won't take the name and I used to

02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:28.260
[Amit Varma]: love it back then but I went recently and it was shit it was like shocking it's like

02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:31.860
[Amit Varma]: you know and it's probably exactly the same food and what's happened is our palate has

02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:37.780
[Amit Varma]: developed right so when you get into that situation that you've traveled the world you're

02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:42.620
[Amit Varma]: coming with a certain sensibility but that sensibility isn't shared by people here for

02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:47.220
[Amit Varma]: no fault of their own it's just that they've made a different journey to a particular point

02:31:47.220 --> 02:31:52.100
[Amit Varma]: how does one approach that do you say that let us find a palatable meeting point and

02:31:52.100 --> 02:31:56.620
[Amit Varma]: then gradually bring them up or do you say no let us do what we are doing because we

02:31:56.620 --> 02:32:00.780
[Amit Varma]: are expanding their universe of tastes and experiences that way and they'll eventually

02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:06.380
[Amit Varma]: come here so how does one think about it and in your journey so far you know through Bombay

02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:11.540
[Amit Varma]: canteen and O.Pedro and all of that have you found that there has been that a change in

02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:16.260
[Amit Varma]: palates or a change in taste where you know less people will have unfair expectations

02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:23.660
[Guest 2]: of what your work brings out so I'll give you like couple of very dish related examples

02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:29.700
[Guest 2]: because I think it helps year one of Bombay canteen we never truly had a ceviche on the

02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:36.060
[Guest 2]: menu right and ceviche is just for everyone it's it's a dish which uses raw fish in it

02:32:36.060 --> 02:32:42.180
[Amit Varma]: but it's cured fish with any acid and by the way and your O.Pedro ceviche last week was

02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:50.460
[Guest 2]: like mind-blowing yeah exactly right I wouldn't have expected that reaction six years ago

02:32:50.460 --> 02:32:58.580
[Guest 2]: honestly and we've seen the it now O.Pedro has three ceviches on the menu also because

02:32:58.580 --> 02:33:05.060
[Guest 2]: people one understand the idea behind it is I think the one you've had is the the red

02:33:05.060 --> 02:33:10.700
[Guest 2]: snapper ceviche which comes with the coconut milk on the side is the sense of balance there

02:33:10.700 --> 02:33:15.980
[Guest 2]: is but the original idea of that for Chef Hussain came through house fish eaten in Goa

02:33:15.980 --> 02:33:21.420
[Guest 2]: right and there's always acidity that acidity can be kokum or tamarind there's can there's

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:25.060
[Guest 2]: always crispiness because the semolina on top and that's why we do a little fritters

02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:30.780
[Guest 2]: on top that story someone comes and tells you when you're eating it so it relates but

02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:37.660
[Guest 2]: you need to pick the right guest to suggest it to right and that's the server's expertise

02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:42.380
[Guest 2]: and it's taken us time for them also to get there so there have been times when we've

02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:49.820
[Guest 2]: seen dishes there's a beef tongue a buffalo tongue prosciutto on the menu at real tongue

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:55.820
[Guest 1]: yeah real tongue that's beautiful yeah with those up crispy potatoes on it right we debated

02:33:55.820 --> 02:34:02.020
[Amit Varma]: so much when that was on your god you did thank you personally yeah that was on year

02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:07.460
[Guest 2]: one of O.Pedro's opening menu takes a lot of effort to bring that dish to life because

02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:13.380
[Guest 2]: we make the tongue prosciutto ourselves and it's a lot of curing that goes it's a very

02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:21.180
[Guest 2]: like long process and but inspired by the way from a tongue sandwich which you get on

02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:26.760
[Guest 1]: the streets of Panjim right like so yeah that's the original inspiration like it's not again

02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:31.140
[Guest 1]: going back to form versus flavor this was same flavors being bought in a different form

02:34:31.140 --> 02:34:36.100
[Guest 2]: yeah so there's like a pintos bar in Panjim where all you get is beer and tongue sandwiches

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:42.500
[Guest 2]: wow so that's where it had come from and in the first two months like we were first two

02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:47.460
[Guest 2]: months you get the food enthusiasts who come in who love that dish right and then you have

02:34:47.460 --> 02:34:52.140
[Guest 2]: the crowd on which your restaurant is going to sustain over time we saw that dish just

02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:57.940
[Guest 2]: die out because people were just not ready for it like at that point we've just got back

02:34:57.940 --> 02:35:05.420
[Guest 2]: O.Pedro finishes five years in October yeah and it's doing phenomenally well it's because

02:35:05.420 --> 02:35:15.220
[Guest 2]: I genuinely feel India's this transition into food curiosity is is faster than it was before

02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:21.660
[Guest 2]: I also feeling more people want that same quality I think also it's Netflix chef's table

02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:29.820
[Guest 2]: masterchef it's content being shown it's the likes of like even like Saranjh Goyla Ranveer

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:34.500
[Guest 2]: Brar all these guys traveling India talking about it and YouTube algorithms make all the

02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:38.460
[Guest 2]: difference you watch one video about cooking something exotic you will get recommended

02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:47.100
[Guest 2]: five others exactly so people are getting much more curious so it's I forgot the original

02:35:47.100 --> 02:35:51.260
[Guest 2]: thought I had but the ceviche for example that's what I was saying like it's proved

02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:55.900
[Guest 2]: to us that we do have mushroom ceviche now at O.Pedro if you have asked me eight years

02:35:55.900 --> 02:36:00.460
[Guest 1]: ago can we have a I would have felt hell no and it's actually if you look at it a decade

02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:06.060
[Guest 1]: ago to have like three or four cold dishes on a menu in India in itself because there

02:36:06.060 --> 02:36:12.580
[Guest 1]: is actually a huge association khana hai fresh hai garam hona chahiye as in I still go out

02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:17.020
[Guest 1]: with my parents and my parents will always be like soup like most restaurants now don't

02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:21.460
[Guest 1]: have soup on the menu unless you're going to a but think about it 20 years ago every

02:36:21.460 --> 02:36:26.780
[Guest 1]: restaurant in an Indian restaurant would be a shorba there would be a cream of mushroom

02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:32.180
[Guest 1]: cream of tomato or like obviously Chinese restaurants that associate manchow soup is

02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:36.540
[Guest 1]: like hot yeah I remember the last time I had soup at a restaurant so think about it like

02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:41.700
[Guest 1]: they are no longer soup sections on menus that's the evolution of the palette because

02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:47.460
[Guest 1]: clearly there is there obviously a generation that still asks for it but we now can have

02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:52.060
[Guest 1]: a whole section dedicated to cold dishes when Bombay canteen opened we had a soup we did

02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:55.700
[Guest 1]: and we said we the reason we had that soup on the menu we were like people will ask for

02:36:55.700 --> 02:37:00.820
[Guest 2]: soup that was the thinking was it an onion seeds no no it was a drumstick soup drumstick

02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:09.860
[Guest 1]: soup it was like it was a great dish but again it didn't last because for many reasons but

02:37:09.860 --> 02:37:15.180
[Guest 1]: I think that's been the interesting and I think it's a interesting rabbit hole we've

02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:19.740
[Guest 1]: gone down right now where like this is going to constantly keep evolving so the question

02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:24.220
[Amit Varma]: is can you be curious enough to keep up yeah and I think I'm reminded of something that

02:37:24.220 --> 02:37:28.940
[Amit Varma]: is said about futurists and I often say about creators that they tend to overestimate the

02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:35.460
[Amit Varma]: short term and underestimate the long term and would it be fair to say that perhaps with

02:37:35.460 --> 02:37:38.940
[Amit Varma]: reference to a few of these things that you were trying you were disappointed that people

02:37:38.940 --> 02:37:43.300
[Amit Varma]: didn't catch on and palettes were different but now it's changed so dramatically you know

02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:49.840
[Guest 1]: so does that kind of fit just thinking aloud yeah it does it does where I think now certain

02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:55.460
[Guest 1]: things this is one dish we always go back to which we thought would be like a runaway

02:37:55.460 --> 02:38:00.020
[Guest 1]: hit and we really should be but we keep talking about bringing it back it was basically a

02:38:00.020 --> 02:38:07.120
[Guest 1]: prawn head rasam and we had done a spaghetti with a prawn head rasam and to us the umami

02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:13.100
[Guest 1]: of the prawn head rasam was similar to that of maggie and therefore noodles made sense

02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:17.700
[Guest 1]: because the whole play on nostalgia maggie but form but the form was different the flavor

02:38:17.700 --> 02:38:22.700
[Amit Varma]: was different no one connected I totally love to have it I had a prawn rasam in some restaurant

02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:27.020
[Amit Varma]: in car a while back which was really good and I thought the combination was fantastic

02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:32.180
[Guest 2]: yeah so you keep talking about bringing it back maybe as a protein is a great to use

02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:36.780
[Amit Varma]: because the flavors you get from the shells is just amazing yeah yeah yeah and that wheel

02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:41.340
[Unknown]: thing like both your faces are turning into wheel right now because it was amazing that

02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:46.140
[Amit Varma]: was just so good I feel like like just stopping this interview and just going back there and

02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:52.060
[Guest 2]: kind of next podcast recording at opetro let's do a yeah live podcast recording yeah why

02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:58.540
[Guest 2]: not yeah gives give give the chef keeps getting food till the podcast recording happens

02:38:58.540 --> 02:39:07.100
[Amit Varma]: tell me a long time boss you are aware of this let's talk about the experience of you

02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:11.540
[Amit Varma]: know you start bombay canteen and it's incredibly hectic and luckily you've had the bias for

02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:15.060
[Amit Varma]: action you've kind of done it you're learning from the doing it and I love the way you described

02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:19.540
[Amit Varma]: it Sam where you said it's like you know a monologue becomes a dialogue and then it evolves

02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:24.180
[Amit Varma]: into what it is what's like the next step in the journey like what makes you think of

02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:29.060
[Amit Varma]: opetro what are you guys feeling about bombay canteen and most importantly what have you

02:39:29.060 --> 02:39:33.980
[Amit Varma]: learned about bombay canteen in in the doing of it and how does that shape the journey

02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:40.500
[Guest 2]: to come so year one of bombay canteen I'll be honest we weren't thinking much it was

02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:45.660
[Guest 2]: just like let's get people in people out um let's get you know table set up reservations

02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:50.020
[Guest 2]: done we were trying to get our systems in place like simple things like online reservation

02:39:50.020 --> 02:39:55.780
[Guest 2]: systems and all that but obviously year one like look it was a heartwarming response we

02:39:55.780 --> 02:40:00.860
[Guest 2]: never said we always stay away from the word success because year one does not dictate

02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:05.380
[Guest 2]: success at all it was just heartwarming to see people enjoying food we were getting things

02:40:05.380 --> 02:40:11.020
[Guest 2]: wrong there were failures but just the emotions that were getting were amazing and then you

02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:17.060
[Guest 2]: had the people walking in being like open in Andheri, open in Juhu, I have a place in

02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:24.460
[Guest 2]: Dubai open there and I think Sam was so grounded at that time to say guys no distractions two

02:40:24.460 --> 02:40:30.380
[Guest 2]: years this all we do no one gets distracted and this was based on actually reflecting

02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:35.420
[Guest 1]: on the period in Delhi where scale we spoke about scale early scaling too fast is what

02:40:35.420 --> 02:40:40.400
[Guest 1]: caused us everything to fail and we were like if there is no foundation there will never

02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:48.460
[Guest 2]: be any scale so I'll give you the quick fire of how O.Pedro came about so we've finished

02:40:48.460 --> 02:40:53.500
[Guest 2]: a year and a half we see this space where O.Pedro is now one of the things that Sam

02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:58.260
[Guest 2]: and me really believe in for restaurants is natural light we really believe like even

02:40:58.260 --> 02:41:04.140
[Guest 1]: when we work I feel like there needs to be an openness there needs to be a sense of space

02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:09.600
[Guest 1]: so while Bombay canteen never had the natural light coming in it that's that mill that mill

02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:15.620
[Guest 1]: compound itself allowed us to light it up in a beautiful way so we saw the space beautiful

02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:22.740
[Guest 2]: natural light it's me chef Thomas chef Floyd standing there are these chaffa chaffa is

02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:29.900
[Guest 2]: what frangipani trees outside so we're standing there looking in we've loved the space and

02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:36.580
[Guest 2]: Floyd says let's do Mexican and all of us say yes now four of us have never really agreed

02:41:36.580 --> 02:41:41.220
[Guest 2]: to anything so far especially when it comes to food that night chef Floyd is traveling

02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:47.060
[Guest 2]: back to New York Samir is going on a trip to Portugal for like a leisure trip and we

02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:51.740
[Guest 2]: say okay agree let's start doing some research now when we had done Bombay canteen actually

02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:56.780
[Guest 2]: we had done a lot of groundwork before like you know like we used to literally stand in

02:41:56.780 --> 02:42:03.820
[Guest 2]: kamla mill and follow people where is he eating lunch where is he going like you know we used

02:42:03.820 --> 02:42:11.340
[Guest 2]: to just stand and like do a lot of that research now with BKC we knew as a market it existed

02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:16.580
[Guest 2]: there were restaurants around so we didn't need to prove the market we were wanted to

02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:20.980
[Guest 2]: say okay let's go out and get data to see what cuisines in India are doing well you

02:42:20.980 --> 02:42:26.420
[Guest 2]: know like just and honestly there's no data available for this and at that point like

02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:31.060
[Guest 2]: I remember Thomas and me I think were in the restaurant and we just start okay Mexican

02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:36.700
[Guest 2]: we all love but what could the issues be and this was thinking six years ago right one

02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:44.460
[Guest 2]: is avocado at that point one avocado was selling at some 200 rupees right which just like kills

02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:54.380
[Guest 2]: it two is the idea of Mexican food then were cheesy nachos creamy corn something and just

02:42:54.380 --> 02:42:58.580
[Guest 2]: the idea that we will have to go through this education phase and we said like you know

02:42:58.580 --> 02:43:05.780
[Guest 2]: what made Bombay canteen get that heartwarming was that it was always relatable food was

02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:11.960
[Guest 2]: Mexican relatable to us so we left it at that and I started thinking and I sent Sam and

02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:17.540
[Guest 2]: Floyd an email that we all love Mexican food and obviously there's a huge presentation

02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:22.700
[Guest 2]: to this to say that Mexico as a country I have not been to Sam's window and Floyd has

02:43:22.700 --> 02:43:28.900
[Guest 2]: actually done a Mexican joint before as a country you feel a sense of delight you know

02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:34.620
[Guest 2]: it's so colorful people are so warm they have their own culture the Americans went there

02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:38.340
[Guest 2]: for spring break they'll go for a honeymoon they'll go for a wedding you come they would

02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:43.660
[Guest 2]: come back with then the cuisine transcended like even if like I remember being in in Sydney

02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:48.740
[Guest 2]: and with an industry friend and he said let's go for Mexican tonight I knew it's gonna be

02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:53.180
[Guest 1]: a fun night you know it's gonna be margaritas you're gonna be drunk it already gives you

02:43:53.180 --> 02:43:57.420
[Guest 2]: an image of what the night is going to be like right and in the sense of BKC that made

02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:04.060
[Guest 2]: sense because for us architecture and design plays a huge part in a workplace for me BKC

02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:10.020
[Guest 2]: is like man-made steel towers first day you go to these fancy offices you love your office

02:44:10.020 --> 02:44:15.100
[Guest 2]: you're taking photos taking photo of the view seventh day you're sleeping on your keyboard

02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:20.980
[Guest 2]: right but for that person who sleeps on his keyboard how does he really relate to Mexico

02:44:20.980 --> 02:44:25.660
[Guest 2]: right so but Mexico was the happy place for Americans so the question was what is our

02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:32.060
[Guest 2]: happy place and that's how Goa came about like if I am sitting in an office in a bank

02:44:32.060 --> 02:44:38.140
[Guest 2]: in in BKC if I close my eyes and start what is the place I dream about and it's Goa it

02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:43.100
[Guest 2]: just brings a smile on our face right we've like for me I studied there Chef Floyd grew

02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:47.940
[Guest 2]: there like Sam's had various vacations like anytime even our team goes there they come

02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:52.940
[Guest 2]: back with a smile on their face like and Goa has also changed for the worst but still you

02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:57.740
[Guest 2]: come back with a smile on your face and that's what we went about creating like O Pedro would

02:44:57.740 --> 02:45:02.820
[Guest 2]: be our happy place and that's how we like every brand description out of that came out

02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:09.020
[Guest 2]: of those two words let's create a happy place for the community around us and Goa then like

02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:13.140
[Guest 2]: they didn't take me to Portugal they went for 20 days very sad very sad to do a lot

02:45:13.140 --> 02:45:18.580
[Guest 1]: of research you still get shit for it five years later yeah someone oh yeah actually

02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:29.420
[Guest 2]: good someone and someone had to build the actual restaurant so yeah so I genuinely enjoyed

02:45:29.420 --> 02:45:34.060
[Guest 2]: like I am very involved when the restaurant gets built on the site and we built I feel

02:45:34.060 --> 02:45:38.940
[Guest 2]: a really happy place for people like it and I think that was really like when I think

02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:43.780
[Guest 1]: about it I think your original question was where are we going and how are we thinking

02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:51.260
[Guest 1]: about it it truly triggered the next stage like if step stage one to us was Mumbai Canteen

02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:58.740
[Guest 1]: O Pedro opening O Pedro triggered stage two because I think for us we started seeing like

02:45:58.740 --> 02:46:03.620
[Guest 1]: building another three four thousand square foot space was like then we really started

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:08.180
[Guest 1]: asking ourselves the question like is this where we see our lives going from one to two

02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:13.120
[Guest 1]: to ten and it was just a question at that point like and there's a reason for that question

02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:17.980
[Guest 1]: was again our minds kind of works in terms of behavior as well as like what are you seeing

02:46:17.980 --> 02:46:23.900
[Guest 1]: on the ground India is actually a culmination of like 26 different countries like taste

02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:28.260
[Guest 1]: change like there's no homogeneity like when you going back to the question of scale where

02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:33.580
[Guest 1]: everyone says scale scale scale like India doesn't have the ecosystem to scale because

02:46:33.580 --> 02:46:37.340
[Guest 1]: like you need to go change your menu in every city Delhi versus Bangalore versus Bombay

02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:43.460
[Amit Varma]: in itself our three biggest markets potentially are our 15th largest state by population if

02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:51.860
[Guest 1]: it was a country would be number 42 in the world yeah so it's massive it's massive and

02:46:51.860 --> 02:46:57.900
[Guest 1]: the use of the same spices changes every hundred kilometers or so they say right and more than

02:46:57.900 --> 02:47:02.400
[Guest 1]: that like there is no availability of affordable real estate to continuously keep building

02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:08.560
[Guest 1]: with enough demand around them and so I think as we were looking at that is when and I'll

02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:13.340
[Guest 1]: throw it back to Yash on this because it was again insight by him that triggered our next

02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:19.740
[Guest 2]: stage which led to Bombay sweet shop so he Sam brought up the question saying we need

02:47:19.740 --> 02:47:25.640
[Guest 2]: to get into people's homes right and obviously we were doing Swiggy Zomato and at that stage

02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:30.500
[Guest 2]: a restaurant company's way of getting into someone's home was a offshoot of something

02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:37.460
[Guest 2]: you made at the restaurant so hot sauce or a Makhani sauce or XYZ and we'd never really

02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:44.460
[Guest 2]: saw that as a transition and believe me we tried also we tried to put the Kejriwal sauce

02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:50.100
[Amit Varma]: into a bottle and we were just not happy with where it was going so many people aren't happy

02:47:50.100 --> 02:48:00.460
[Guest 2]: with where Kejriwal is going so we that was looming and the quick fire thing was we as

02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:04.820
[Guest 2]: the best part of being you asked us what keeps passion going in this industry I think is

02:48:04.820 --> 02:48:09.940
[Guest 2]: is the people in this industry so if Sam and me today even right now decide to go to Singapore

02:48:09.940 --> 02:48:15.780
[Guest 2]: and we message any person in the industry that person even if they've worked a 12-hour

02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:20.820
[Guest 2]: shift will take their time out to show us the city in from their eyes and like take

02:48:20.820 --> 02:48:27.060
[Guest 2]: us to their bar or their place and that list you get of places to go like basically find

02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:31.780
[Guest 2]: the into outlet of that city is what makes this industry special and same when so when

02:48:31.780 --> 02:48:37.540
[Guest 2]: we had moved to India we used to get a lot of these guys in and we always wanted to give

02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:42.620
[Guest 2]: them something we were super proud of to take back right so normally what you do you give

02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:47.980
[Guest 2]: masalas same now if you can't cook a masala here in India how is that guy in London figuring

02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:55.540
[Guest 2]: it out masala chai they brew tea we cook tea so they are like this doesn't taste how so

02:48:55.540 --> 02:49:02.220
[Guest 2]: that started and it I was flying for chef Floyd's restaurant opening and he had booked

02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:07.260
[Guest 2]: me on Turkish Airlines and I was passing through the Turkish airport and I've never been to

02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:13.020
[Guest 2]: Turkey and there's a guy at the airport a Turkish guy like fully dressed up and he's

02:49:13.020 --> 02:49:18.700
[Guest 2]: selling me Turkish delights and baklava was like his life dependent on it just taste it

02:49:18.700 --> 02:49:24.920
[Guest 2]: like you know he's just like tasted this was water and like his heart was in it and I went

02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:31.420
[Guest 2]: and I was at the Forbes conference where Maria Sharapova is talking about her candy brand

02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:35.980
[Guest 2]: she has a candy brand called Sugarpua now when you know a celebrity starts any brand

02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:43.500
[Guest 2]: you just think perfume but she started because she grew up in Chernobyl and with poverty

02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:49.500
[Guest 2]: like how much a snicker bar like a meant to her she described that and she's like at some

02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:54.680
[Guest 2]: point in my life I wanted that gave me happiness I want to start a candy brand right so flying

02:49:54.680 --> 02:50:00.020
[Guest 2]: back like I remember like sending Sam a note like we've always said celebrate India celebrate

02:50:00.020 --> 02:50:04.940
[Guest 2]: India why are we not doing something with Indian sweets like I remember first time my

02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:11.600
[Guest 2]: presentation had a cheeky dressed like a candy bar right it's like how do you make Indian

02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:18.900
[Guest 2]: sweets of today like how do you make them fun how do you make it relatable and that's

02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:25.920
[Guest 2]: the journey that led us into Bombay sweet shop where we knew yes people had stopped

02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:31.300
[Guest 2]: eating Indian sweets due to various reasons but we knew that our expertise at that point

02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:37.460
[Guest 2]: from two spaces was one creating an offline experience and we had understood the form

02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:43.540
[Guest 2]: flavor analogy by then so we're like there is something here we've never made Indian

02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:50.420
[Guest 2]: sweets neither at chef light so chef Girish had worked in New York studied there had come

02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:54.380
[Guest 2]: in India was working with the olive group when it's one of the best pastry chefs in

02:50:54.380 --> 02:50:58.620
[Guest 2]: India and an offshoot meeting with him we just asked him what's your dream and he's

02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:05.580
[Guest 1]: like I want to create the new Ayangar bakery and then he's grown up in Manipal and like

02:51:05.580 --> 02:51:12.300
[Guest 1]: he and he'd had this he'd gone to culinary school there and six and eventually went to

02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:15.900
[Guest 1]: the Culinary Institute of America and but in between he happened to work at a mithai

02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:21.020
[Guest 1]: shop for six months and he just had that one experience and it had triggered this thought

02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:27.700
[Guest 1]: in him that what if you applied like French technique to Indian sweets and Floyd would

02:51:27.700 --> 02:51:32.580
[Guest 1]: always say that unless you don't take time to understand tradition you can't sort of

02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:38.380
[Guest 1]: evolve it and I think so there's so many you can go into a different rabbit hole talking

02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:42.420
[Guest 1]: about authenticity and what it means I don't think there is anything such as authenticity

02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:48.220
[Guest 1]: only because it needs to be relevant to that time and place and it someone's tradition

02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:53.100
[Guest 1]: becomes someone else's sort of inspiration at some point and everything evolved out of

02:51:53.100 --> 02:52:00.140
[Guest 1]: something else exactly and so Girish joined us in 2018 for two years we spent he did most

02:52:00.140 --> 02:52:05.500
[Guest 1]: of like work we joined him as we were running the other stuff when we could but at different

02:52:05.500 --> 02:52:10.340
[Guest 1]: points like he basically spent two years understanding how to make traditional sweets from halwais

02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:16.740
[Guest 1]: across the country and that is the basis of like so even the bak was inspired by Sohan

02:52:16.740 --> 02:52:22.940
[Guest 1]: halwa which he ate in Delhi and so Sohan halwa has this butterscotchy flavor and he went

02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:26.540
[Guest 1]: originally was trying to make an inside out chikki as he called it which eventually turned

02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:33.140
[Guest 1]: into the baks and it was the process of iteration through that that we were able to sort of

02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:39.220
[Guest 1]: again look at this to us Indian the Indian sweet market represented the same white the

02:52:39.220 --> 02:52:43.700
[Guest 1]: canvas which Indian food represented where nothing had been done to contemporize it at

02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:48.860
[Guest 1]: that point but do it in a way that it stays true to where it came from so which is why

02:52:48.860 --> 02:52:54.580
[Guest 1]: like Yash was saying our strength always lay in creating these sort of offline experiences

02:52:54.580 --> 02:53:00.140
[Guest 1]: so our first step was that we took an old factory in Baikala and we said let's create

02:53:00.140 --> 02:53:04.780
[Guest 1]: Willy Wonka's mithai factory here so that when you walk in you feel that like there

02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:09.900
[Guest 1]: is like something happening like one of the other exercises we do is like when we are

02:53:09.900 --> 02:53:14.380
[Guest 1]: getting into a new concept we make a list of everything related to that concept it could

02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:19.580
[Guest 1]: be hundred things we made listed everything about a mithai shop that we could think of

02:53:19.580 --> 02:53:24.180
[Guest 1]: and then we slowly struck away everything we didn't like and that's how you reach where

02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:28.500
[Guest 1]: you want to what you want to keep of tradition where you want to take it so what were the

02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:31.860
[Guest 1]: kind of things you liked and didn't like one of the biggest things is all you interact

02:53:31.860 --> 02:53:37.340
[Guest 1]: with is a glass shelf you don't see anything beyond that you never see it being made you

02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:41.980
[Guest 1]: know so if when you walk into Bombay sweet shop in Baikala like everything is being made

02:53:41.980 --> 02:53:45.820
[Guest 1]: in front of you from the hot kitchen to the finishing to the way it's being packed to

02:53:45.820 --> 02:53:52.500
[Guest 1]: all of it and all of it was bought out into the open because we felt like making a motichoor

02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:58.700
[Guest 1]: ladoo is as beautiful as a croissant being sort of layered and cut and yeah it's just not spoken

02:53:58.700 --> 02:54:04.180
[Guest 1]: about unfortunately because it's not cool it's not sexy to do that and that really led

02:54:04.180 --> 02:54:10.500
[Guest 1]: us into an as life would have it we opened in the first week of March of 2020 and then

02:54:10.500 --> 02:54:17.060
[Guest 1]: the life happened and it kind of like took us into a whole different realm we lost Floyd

02:54:17.060 --> 02:54:23.660
[Guest 1]: at that point obviously and it took us a while to recover but I think more than anything

02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:29.020
[Guest 1]: else like Bombay sweet shop has also turned into a silver lining because it forced our

02:54:29.020 --> 02:54:34.620
[Guest 1]: hand into being in the online world in a very different way to what Yash was referring to

02:54:34.620 --> 02:54:42.700
[Guest 1]: earlier like tech was like a POS system for us at that point like nothing more and he

02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:49.340
[Guest 2]: is really sort of caught caught it by the collar yeah so like I you know again I hungering

02:54:49.340 --> 02:54:56.500
[Guest 2]: is really small you know we speak really aspirationally on what we've created because we love it but

02:54:56.500 --> 02:55:02.140
[Guest 2]: for me Bombay sweet shop is the best space we've created because with Shonan who's designed

02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:08.020
[Guest 2]: it there was like restaurants always there so you had a layout with this we didn't have

02:55:08.020 --> 02:55:16.740
[Guest 2]: a layout right and yes now we say you know we need more space but we didn't know that

02:55:16.740 --> 02:55:22.500
[Guest 2]: like and it's when people walk in they are just they're like wow because someone's told

02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:27.340
[Guest 2]: them go to by color there's an amazing mithai shop and they are not expecting what they

02:55:27.340 --> 02:55:33.140
[Guest 2]: see like it's it's like for me it brings a smile to my face now so like to his point

02:55:33.140 --> 02:55:37.620
[Guest 2]: like we wanted to make Willy Wonka's mithai factory and the idea was you come in and see

02:55:37.620 --> 02:55:45.140
[Guest 2]: how everything's made when we lost Floyd and I don't think we'll ever recover emotionally

02:55:45.140 --> 02:55:52.860
[Guest 2]: out of it like for him for us it was he's he'll always be a father figure right but

02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:56.740
[Guest 2]: one thing is to always tell us was storytelling and that was the idea the space was to be

02:55:56.740 --> 02:56:02.460
[Guest 2]: the storytelling but this democratization of tech also led to democratization of content

02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:09.580
[Guest 2]: now that space is become our content hub like everything we produce we show it on our reels

02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:14.420
[Guest 2]: it's being done in this beautiful space we don't need to like dramatize it at all it

02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:21.700
[Guest 2]: just gets people so excited about Indian sweets again and we've done small things with regards

02:56:21.700 --> 02:56:27.940
[Guest 2]: to tech where we track every piece of ingredient to when that mithai got made and the idea

02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:33.060
[Guest 2]: is the good thing for us is you order and then we make so you get fresh stuff right

02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:38.700
[Guest 2]: all data is here like unlike restaurants when four people come to dine we have the info

02:56:38.700 --> 02:56:43.060
[Guest 2]: of only one person who makes the reservation whereas because we are now in the online world

02:56:43.060 --> 02:56:47.820
[Guest 2]: we know what people are liking what they're not liking I as a founder have a crew of hundred

02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:54.420
[Guest 2]: people who get first tasting options so we make whatever gets they get sent like an FBI

02:56:54.420 --> 02:57:00.220
[Guest 2]: packet there's a type form with a survey form they give us their feedback chef Girish gets

02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:05.080
[Guest 2]: a chance to talk to them okay you found it salty why this why that it's a more collaborative

02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:09.380
[Guest 2]: process with our those hundred people like you were talking about to take it to the next

02:57:09.380 --> 02:57:15.780
[Guest 2]: thousand people right one of my dreams is like I as a kid in Pune used to think Cadbury

02:57:15.780 --> 02:57:26.820
[Guest 2]: is Indian I just I just assumed it yeah right I would love to make an Indian sweet chocolate

02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:32.140
[Guest 2]: bar that we all just eat at home so we launched Indy which is our chocolate bar which has

02:57:32.140 --> 02:57:39.980
[Guest 2]: patisa in it and it looks for me really beautiful and we've just launched it but now we want

02:57:39.980 --> 02:57:45.260
[Guest 2]: to launch like a flat bar so we had launched a mango flavored one and people liked it so

02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:51.700
[Guest 2]: what we are doing is we've got six flavor combinations that we've tried and we've liked

02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:56.780
[Guest 2]: so we threw my Instagram basically put it out there that the same form flavor thing

02:57:56.780 --> 02:58:02.300
[Guest 2]: is that's where my joy is and I want to share it with all of you hundred people need to

02:58:02.300 --> 02:58:08.120
[Guest 2]: sign up but you're going to pay for this you're going to pay for one bar a month one chocolate

02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:13.780
[Guest 2]: bar which will have Indian mithai in it to be delivered to you you have to give us feedback

02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:19.580
[Guest 2]: right at the end of the six bars we'll do a zoom call with all of you it's not mandatory

02:58:19.580 --> 02:58:24.500
[Guest 2]: where chef Girish is going to ask you all why what so that it's more collaborative for

02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:30.780
[Guest 2]: your benefit and ours we will get please see who's Pritha who's super inspirational to

02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:37.700
[Guest 2]: do a fun workshop with you on how to design a chocolate wrapper like imagine we would

02:58:37.700 --> 02:58:42.140
[Guest 2]: have never done this two years ago like like being able to share our things with with the

02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:52.380
[Guest 2]: guests through zoom we have a hundred slots filled up yeah and then like a fun thing where

02:58:52.380 --> 02:58:57.260
[Guest 2]: we get to design that banner with them now Cadbury can't do that and I hope they're not

02:58:57.260 --> 02:59:03.900
[Amit Varma]: listening so we are doing that the big companies will never do that you'll only be disrupted

02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:08.580
[Guest 2]: from below yeah so we are doing that we've just sent out the first chocolate bars everyone's

02:59:08.580 --> 02:59:12.260
[Guest 2]: given us feedback already and it's we tell them also the packaging coming to them is

02:59:12.260 --> 02:59:19.540
[Guest 2]: a normal brown box right now and it's such a fun journey to be on because like I am also

02:59:19.540 --> 02:59:22.980
[Guest 2]: being honest to them to say you are some of it is going to come melted to you because

02:59:22.980 --> 02:59:27.500
[Guest 2]: we've not worked on the R&D yet we need to get that firm flavor right and let's see what

02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:33.780
[Guest 1]: ends up at the end of six months the funny part what we find ourselves talking about

02:59:33.780 --> 02:59:39.340
[Guest 1]: now is like you have to do inherently unscalable things to figure out where you're going if

02:59:39.340 --> 02:59:45.060
[Guest 1]: you only do things for scale you have you will never get the love right for it you will

02:59:45.060 --> 02:59:51.500
[Guest 1]: never get the product right you will never get the thought right because you were always

02:59:51.500 --> 02:59:59.820
[Guest 1]: building to distribute it to a thousand different places if you hear any of the stories of the

02:59:59.820 --> 03:00:03.540
[Guest 1]: brands we love they all started somewhere but over a period of time those stories have

03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:10.700
[Guest 1]: been forgotten and that's and I think that's an important reminder to us as I think what

03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:14.180
[Guest 1]: Yash was just referencing to is like we are realizing the importance of community and

03:00:14.180 --> 03:00:20.740
[Guest 1]: building anything and I think that really brings us to where we want to go next in hopefully

03:00:20.740 --> 03:00:27.300
[Guest 1]: what would be the third stage of hopefully a long journey is where Enthoo Cutlet becomes

03:00:27.300 --> 03:00:31.060
[Guest 1]: an important peg in it right like where at one level we've got the restaurants we've

03:00:31.060 --> 03:00:37.740
[Guest 1]: now got Bombay Sweetshop which is an online business but also now we need to tell stories

03:00:37.740 --> 03:00:42.860
[Guest 1]: in a way that it makes people fall in love with food in India that's it that's the only

03:00:42.860 --> 03:00:47.660
[Guest 1]: thing that we want to do we don't want to like this is not like a branded community

03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:53.340
[Guest 1]: which is here to like sell you things because the reality is people today are see through

03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:59.260
[Guest 1]: that stuff in two seconds as in you've been running a content based business for a while

03:00:59.260 --> 03:01:04.340
[Guest 1]: if you were going to peg brands left right and center listeners would see through it

03:01:04.340 --> 03:01:09.860
[Amit Varma]: I think the moment you're cynical people become cynical of you right so you have to yeah and

03:01:09.860 --> 03:01:14.420
[Guest 1]: I think this is going to be a whole different journey which we've been fortunate enough

03:01:14.420 --> 03:01:19.100
[Guest 1]: to have an amazing team sort of come on board in the last year on all fronts and it's been

03:01:19.100 --> 03:01:24.780
[Guest 1]: a truly a process of rebuilding in the last year or year and a half and we're finally

03:01:24.780 --> 03:01:29.700
[Guest 1]: super excited about where it's going I think it took us a while to get there emotionally

03:01:29.700 --> 03:01:33.780
[Guest 1]: but like actually super excited about all the things falling in place currently and

03:01:33.780 --> 03:01:39.440
[Guest 1]: I'm sure there'll be more more and more issues that'll drop like hot potatoes on us but so

03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:46.880
[Guest 1]: be it that is life so yeah long story to a short question no I think that's a beautiful

03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:51.420
[Amit Varma]: insight about how the moment you try to scale you lose your soul so it's it's just you know

03:01:51.420 --> 03:01:57.260
[Amit Varma]: scale of thinking of scaling can be dangerous and and what I love about the sort of work

03:01:57.260 --> 03:02:02.620
[Amit Varma]: you guys do or anybody who kind of moves away from the beaten path is that what you do is

03:02:02.620 --> 03:02:07.240
[Amit Varma]: not just valuable for the doing of it but also that it gives others the permission to

03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:11.980
[Amit Varma]: think beyond the boundaries you are in a sense shifting the window of possibility for them

03:02:11.980 --> 03:02:17.980
[Amit Varma]: you know by expanding the palettes of certain people you you know you also give someone

03:02:17.980 --> 03:02:23.060
[Amit Varma]: else a chance to come and take that a little bit further and that leads me to this thought

03:02:23.060 --> 03:02:27.780
[Amit Varma]: I did a recent episode on a cinema perhaps the most joyous episode I've recorded with

03:02:27.780 --> 03:02:32.980
[Amit Varma]: Jai Arjun Singh and Subrat Mohanty and one of the points Subrat made about the Hindi

03:02:32.980 --> 03:02:39.780
[Amit Varma]: film music of the 50s and 60s and early 70s is that in his view it was a golden era and

03:02:39.780 --> 03:02:45.380
[Amit Varma]: it was a golden era that happened because of a confluence a lucky confluence of talented

03:02:45.380 --> 03:02:49.780
[Amit Varma]: people who thought the same way about their work so you had the music directors that is

03:02:49.780 --> 03:02:55.420
[Amit Varma]: you had the composers you had the lyricists you know the whole shebang everything kind

03:02:55.420 --> 03:03:00.060
[Amit Varma]: of just came together and then it kind of went away and I asked him why it went away

03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:04.220
[Amit Varma]: and it's partly I guess circumstances or whatever because I was a little baffled by it if it

03:03:04.220 --> 03:03:08.460
[Amit Varma]: worked so well if it was so successful it would have given rise to more people like

03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:12.660
[Amit Varma]: them and all of that but then that didn't really happen a bunch of really talented people

03:03:12.660 --> 03:03:17.900
[Amit Varma]: lived they worked together for a while it was a beautiful melding of talents and then

03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:24.100
[Amit Varma]: it was gone and when I think of for example what you've described of your journey so far

03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:30.060
[Amit Varma]: the key element in it really seems to be people you know having people who share the same

03:03:30.060 --> 03:03:34.660
[Amit Varma]: ethic who share the same whatever and Floyd really seems to be a driving force in this

03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:41.980
[Amit Varma]: so can you talk a bit about him you know and what is left after that as well in all of

03:03:41.980 --> 03:03:49.820
[Guest 1]: you I think there's so many sort of in my mind when I think of Floyd now is you're left

03:03:49.820 --> 03:03:56.220
[Guest 1]: with so many memories and so many sort of roles that he played he started off as the

03:03:56.220 --> 03:04:01.020
[Guest 1]: guy who interviewed me so this sort of larger than life figure I would say who interviewed

03:04:01.020 --> 03:04:07.180
[Guest 1]: me to being my boss to being the guy who would call me every time his iPad wouldn't work

03:04:07.180 --> 03:04:12.860
[Guest 1]: to who then becoming a mentor and guiding us through this journey of opening our first

03:04:12.860 --> 03:04:22.260
[Guest 1]: restaurant to then becoming a father figure in our lives at large about just we lived

03:04:22.260 --> 03:04:26.900
[Guest 1]: a decade together and I think we lived and I'm really glad that we got to spend that

03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:32.700
[Guest 1]: time together so I think at various stages he's played different roles in the most beautiful

03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:38.620
[Guest 1]: possible manner and I think that really sort of roots us today I think a lot of what we

03:04:38.620 --> 03:04:45.100
[Guest 1]: are trying to do is in our work is sort of take forward the things he stood for in his

03:04:45.100 --> 03:04:51.340
[Guest 1]: legacy so to speak so for instance we now run what we call the Floyd Cardo scholarship

03:04:51.340 --> 03:04:58.900
[Guest 1]: with Manipal University where we try to get one student with from an underprivileged background

03:04:58.900 --> 03:05:03.180
[Guest 1]: to go through their beautiful culinary arts program I think it's one of the best programs

03:05:03.180 --> 03:05:09.380
[Guest 1]: right now in the country and I think we're starting in small ways to sort of bring his

03:05:09.380 --> 03:05:14.220
[Guest 1]: legacy forward we hopefully have some other exciting projects that come on board in the

03:05:14.220 --> 03:05:19.860
[Guest 1]: next few months which again sort of celebrate him and I think that the change for me has

03:05:19.860 --> 03:05:26.220
[Guest 1]: been like to go from mourning him in a way to celebrating him in every way because I

03:05:26.220 --> 03:05:35.660
[Guest 1]: think he was equally mischievous like he would play pranks all the time to being this obviously

03:05:35.660 --> 03:05:41.740
[Guest 1]: very serious thinker about where food in India and Indian food and technique and how do you

03:05:41.740 --> 03:05:46.780
[Guest 1]: teach and mentor like there's a whole spectrum that needs to be celebrated and I think that's

03:05:46.780 --> 03:05:52.580
[Guest 1]: the beauty of it and we hope we're able to do justice to it as the years go by I think

03:05:52.580 --> 03:06:00.740
[Guest 1]: for us Floyd will always be a very very strong sort of influence in our lives yeah as in

03:06:00.740 --> 03:06:07.180
[Guest 2]: we have so many stories I feel like and we always make it a point also to our we call

03:06:07.180 --> 03:06:12.820
[Guest 2]: it a founders meet on whichever employees join if it may be the restaurant in the first

03:06:12.820 --> 03:06:19.460
[Guest 2]: 30 days they have to sit with us and we walk them through what we call our values and we

03:06:19.460 --> 03:06:26.060
[Guest 2]: talk about our values by saying these are not poster values we don't have beautiful

03:06:26.060 --> 03:06:31.460
[Guest 2]: corridors where there's a poster with someone standing with their hands you know like namaste

03:06:31.460 --> 03:06:36.020
[Guest 2]: saying respect below it you know like how you go to a bank and but when you go to the

03:06:36.020 --> 03:06:41.780
[Guest 2]: bank tell her the zero respect that's given to you we we talk about it through what employees

03:06:41.780 --> 03:06:48.760
[Guest 2]: have done in the last eight years to show that right and all of that has come about

03:06:48.760 --> 03:06:57.340
[Guest 2]: through Floyd like he had every right to act like a celebrity but he never did he was super

03:06:57.340 --> 03:07:05.460
[Guest 2]: humble like when this was our first trip to New York after he left us and we still meet

03:07:05.460 --> 03:07:10.220
[Guest 2]: restauranters will tell us about how Floyd came to the restaurant and even after did

03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:15.900
[Guest 2]: his dinner maybe spend like an hour and a half telling them about his where what was

03:07:15.900 --> 03:07:21.420
[Guest 2]: some of his failures and how they could learn from it the fact that he was an open book

03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:30.540
[Guest 2]: to like teach always very calm me and Sam have fought only once when he made you cry

03:07:30.540 --> 03:07:37.380
[Unknown]: no that's a whole different story that's a very drunk story but yeah we were fighting

03:07:37.380 --> 03:07:43.900
[Guest 2]: in the first week of Bombay canteen over something he had seen in New York work as a process

03:07:43.900 --> 03:07:48.140
[Guest 2]: and I was fighting him to say the team is too new we can't handle this right now we

03:07:48.140 --> 03:07:53.900
[Guest 2]: were going at each other in front of the team and he took us aside and just gave us a lesson

03:07:53.900 --> 03:07:59.060
[Guest 2]: that day and I think we still remember it and we fought for different things but we've

03:07:59.060 --> 03:08:03.820
[Guest 2]: never really raised our voice after that because we still remember what he said said to us

03:08:03.820 --> 03:08:10.220
[Guest 1]: so I think those things will continue I think he basically made a point that you guys can

03:08:10.220 --> 03:08:14.980
[Guest 1]: disagree but like I think again goes down to signaling right like the perception of

03:08:14.980 --> 03:08:18.780
[Guest 1]: the team thinking that you guys are not on the same page should never happen in front

03:08:18.780 --> 03:08:26.740
[Guest 1]: of them yeah and and obviously argue but argue with respect yeah and as a fact that you have

03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:31.420
[Guest 2]: been talking to the team about not raising voices or teaching it with respect but that's

03:08:31.420 --> 03:08:36.500
[Guest 2]: not what you all are signaling right now it's a very simple thing but sometimes like in

03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:43.060
[Guest 2]: the heat of the moment of especially operations it gets to you but his wife Barkha is carrying

03:08:43.060 --> 03:08:49.060
[Guest 2]: forward his legacy with what she we've called Floyd Cardo's legacy as well she recently

03:08:49.060 --> 03:08:56.340
[Guest 2]: spoke at there's a I would say the best hospitality conference in in you in New York it's called

03:08:56.340 --> 03:09:02.420
[Guest 2]: welcome conference hosted by Will Gudara and she spoke at it and the courage she showed

03:09:02.420 --> 03:09:08.220
[Guest 2]: because it wasn't easy what she went through so she's with someone we always in touch with

03:09:08.220 --> 03:09:13.300
[Guest 2]: and she's carrying forward his legacy as well and at the end of the day we just want him

03:09:13.300 --> 03:09:19.820
[Guest 2]: to be proud I know chef Hussain says it every day to his team as well that whatever we do

03:09:19.820 --> 03:09:25.700
[Guest 2]: we should always make sure that he's proud of what we do what I often think about is

03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:33.300
[Amit Varma]: how what we do and the people we do it with shapes who we are right it changes you fundamentally

03:09:33.300 --> 03:09:40.020
[Amit Varma]: I would imagine that someone who joins you as a young server and imbibes your values

03:09:40.020 --> 03:09:46.740
[Amit Varma]: would actually be a different person than had she joined you know some standard restaurant

03:09:46.740 --> 03:09:51.580
[Amit Varma]: which you know serve chicken tikka how have you changed as people because one thing that

03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:56.020
[Amit Varma]: I imagine an experience of running a restaurant where you're fighting fires all the time would

03:09:56.020 --> 03:10:02.140
[Amit Varma]: be in terms of teaching your humility and another way of actually managing people I

03:10:02.140 --> 03:10:09.020
[Amit Varma]: think when you manage people if you learn to do it well you again have to learn humbleness

03:10:09.020 --> 03:10:14.100
[Amit Varma]: learn how to respect everyone and all of that how has this whole experience changed you

03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:18.540
[Amit Varma]: as people like I would imagine Sam that had you still been a banker you would have been

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:23.260
[Amit Varma]: a different person not passing a value judgment good bad this whatever but just a different

03:10:23.260 --> 03:10:28.620
[Amit Varma]: person so what can you look back on your personal growth through this period and think about

03:10:28.620 --> 03:10:34.660
[Guest 2]: how you would have been different as people or how you have been shaped I first disclaimer

03:10:34.660 --> 03:10:43.060
[Guest 2]: is hunger inc has bad days of even culture you can't be at a hundred percent like I just

03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:49.060
[Guest 2]: want to say to all startup founders out there like we are not 100% every day we have employees

03:10:49.060 --> 03:10:55.300
[Guest 2]: we have servers who come in just didn't get the right treatment for various reasons but

03:10:55.300 --> 03:11:00.100
[Guest 2]: I tell my leaders and tell the team today was a bad day tomorrow you need to walk in

03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:06.060
[Guest 2]: knowing that we'll give a hundred percent tomorrow and in India culture gets gets very

03:11:06.060 --> 03:11:12.280
[Guest 2]: mistaken with morale right people think culture changes overnight it doesn't the morale changes

03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:22.100
[Guest 2]: overnight and the last two years were hard rollercoaster and then some yeah so as a person

03:11:22.100 --> 03:11:30.940
[Guest 2]: I feel year one when Floyd like for me hospitality first the thing that he imbibed because he

03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:35.620
[Guest 2]: worked with Danny Myers for so long he brought it into the thing was very new for me because

03:11:35.620 --> 03:11:42.180
[Guest 2]: I had worked with hotel restaurants all my life and I used to always say me and he always

03:11:42.180 --> 03:11:49.100
[Guest 2]: used to say you have to say we we are in this together so the first year like I drank the

03:11:49.100 --> 03:11:54.060
[Guest 2]: Kool-Aid fully and we are like in there in the trenches doing this doing it the right

03:11:54.060 --> 03:12:00.020
[Guest 2]: way but I used to get really angry when an employee used to leave us and we should be

03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:05.580
[Guest 2]: like we are doing this like you know I have been where they were 10 years ago serving

03:12:05.580 --> 03:12:09.420
[Guest 2]: a table and I know we are giving them the best treatment we are paying them well why

03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:16.780
[Guest 2]: are people leaving us or even now my difference being is you need to keep giving the right

03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:26.540
[Guest 2]: culture and be less cynical about the the result of it right you keep investing in that

03:12:26.540 --> 03:12:31.820
[Guest 2]: culture but you will still have employees who are not going to be happy with what they

03:12:31.820 --> 03:12:37.580
[Guest 2]: see and feel at work and they are going to leave and at that moment you are like why

03:12:37.580 --> 03:12:45.140
[Guest 2]: am I still investing in this culture mentally physically financially but give up that and

03:12:45.140 --> 03:12:52.140
[Guest 2]: go back to keep doing it because people keep leaving one thing like I have learned is in

03:12:52.140 --> 03:12:57.460
[Guest 2]: if someone works with us for two years I'm really grateful like it's we've got we've

03:12:57.460 --> 03:13:05.660
[Guest 2]: obviously COVID destroyed our great retention numbers like it completely changed it but

03:13:05.660 --> 03:13:10.780
[Guest 2]: now I'm like if anyone gives me two years I'm fine but I tell them please take a step

03:13:10.780 --> 03:13:18.300
[Guest 2]: up in your next place go to a better organization see what will what leader you will work under

03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:23.100
[Guest 2]: there don't look at just the organization because it's happened to me like when I gave

03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:29.620
[Guest 2]: my first campus interview the HR director of the hotel was the nicest genuine person

03:13:29.620 --> 03:13:36.660
[Guest 2]: but the leader I was reporting to was not a nice person at all so there was a couple

03:13:36.660 --> 03:13:43.220
[Guest 2]: of things like for me I feel like I used to be very hot-headed I've become less hot-headed

03:13:43.220 --> 03:13:48.700
[Guest 1]: now I've been able to like mom calls him the angry young man for a reason angry not so

03:13:48.700 --> 03:13:54.180
[Amit Varma]: young but I've been able to channel my emotions much better you can't even remember what she

03:13:54.180 --> 03:14:00.180
[Amit Varma]: cooked for you yeah I mean yeah she shouldn't be angry I feel it was jelly custard like

03:14:00.180 --> 03:14:07.020
[Unknown]: it was yeah so yeah I think I don't know if that answers the question but I've become

03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:15.460
[Guest 1]: less cynical about that part of it not saying I'm zero but for me I think it's been a it

03:14:15.460 --> 03:14:21.260
[Guest 1]: used to hurt a lot when people used to criticize or like like again I feel in India you're

03:14:21.260 --> 03:14:27.780
[Guest 1]: not really taught how to give feedback or receive feedback in a very healthy manner

03:14:27.780 --> 03:14:35.340
[Guest 1]: and you realize that very quickly that going through especially running restaurants in

03:14:35.340 --> 03:14:40.980
[Guest 1]: India someone has an opinion every day like if you decide to start like taking everything

03:14:40.980 --> 03:14:48.180
[Guest 1]: to heart you're done for you'll be in a sort of emotional wasteland for a long time I remember

03:14:48.180 --> 03:14:54.740
[Guest 1]: the debates we had when we got our first negative review and like it would because you've put

03:14:54.740 --> 03:14:59.580
[Guest 1]: your heart and soul into it like it mattered and not to say that it doesn't matter like

03:14:59.580 --> 03:15:04.620
[Guest 1]: I think we now tell ourselves about how look for the trend within what people are saying

03:15:04.620 --> 03:15:09.940
[Guest 1]: versus what people are saying I think we react to it less emotionally and react to it more

03:15:09.940 --> 03:15:16.020
[Guest 1]: from a data point of view versus like just taking it like who the fuck are you to talk

03:15:16.020 --> 03:15:21.700
[Guest 1]: about this right and I think for me like I think it's also been a personal journey to

03:15:21.700 --> 03:15:26.580
[Guest 1]: figure that out also because like I'm someone who like I realized this about myself like

03:15:26.580 --> 03:15:30.580
[Guest 1]: I like people to like me right like and you can't please everyone and you just have to

03:15:30.580 --> 03:15:36.980
[Guest 1]: be comfortable in your shoes that not everyone's gonna like you and so be it like move on you

03:15:36.980 --> 03:15:41.980
[Guest 1]: need to be doing what you need to do and they need to be doing what they need to do and

03:15:41.980 --> 03:15:46.420
[Guest 2]: I didn't know that about you that you like to be liked there you go now you know now

03:15:46.420 --> 03:15:51.140
[Amit Varma]: you do things two things two things and I know you yeah and he had to give you two things

03:15:51.140 --> 03:15:58.780
[Guest 2]: you don't know right yeah I think we should do this as a weekly podcast I feel like yeah

03:15:58.780 --> 03:16:02.660
[Amit Varma]: what was covid like did it change like covid obviously hit the restaurant business very

03:16:02.660 --> 03:16:09.820
[Amit Varma]: very very hard right how did you manage to kind of stay afloat and did it sort of I won't

03:16:09.820 --> 03:16:15.300
[Amit Varma]: say expand your horizons that's unfair but in what new ways did you have to think did

03:16:15.300 --> 03:16:19.940
[Amit Varma]: you find yourself thinking because of covid like yeah she already spoke about understanding

03:16:19.940 --> 03:16:24.140
[Amit Varma]: the technology and you know getting a little deeper into that figuring that part of it

03:16:24.140 --> 03:16:30.460
[Amit Varma]: out but just in general thinking about you know what you want to do with your lives what

03:16:30.460 --> 03:16:35.740
[Amit Varma]: makes you happy and earlier a lot of that would have had the physical component of running

03:16:35.740 --> 03:16:42.020
[Amit Varma]: a successful restaurant and here for almost a couple of years that game is kind of you

03:16:42.020 --> 03:16:46.940
[Amit Varma]: know shut down for the moment so so what are you going through how how do how do things

03:16:46.940 --> 03:16:54.420
[Guest 1]: change I think again like losing Floyd played such a emphatic role in the way covid hit

03:16:54.420 --> 03:17:00.780
[Guest 1]: us I think I think so many people lost so many near India ones and I think we went through

03:17:00.780 --> 03:17:08.580
[Guest 1]: the same way so I think the first I would say the first lockdown was just spent operating

03:17:08.580 --> 03:17:14.540
[Guest 1]: out of fear like it was you'd already gone through the worst of losing someone who was

03:17:14.540 --> 03:17:20.300
[Guest 1]: so close to you and then you potentially had everything on the line you've built you had

03:17:20.300 --> 03:17:25.060
[Guest 1]: no clarity in terms of whether what will come about we went through one of the most stringent

03:17:25.060 --> 03:17:30.060
[Guest 1]: lockdowns that ever were and we were going through the motions we opened for delivery

03:17:30.060 --> 03:17:35.500
[Guest 1]: we put some things in a box we did the best we could at that point in terms of like delivering

03:17:35.500 --> 03:17:43.040
[Guest 1]: it tried to add our sort of thoughts to it and I think there was a point for me personally

03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:49.840
[Guest 1]: where I think a few months in like it just came to me like we need to stop operating

03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:54.340
[Guest 1]: out of fear and we kind of spoke about this so and we were having this conversation quite

03:17:54.340 --> 03:18:00.580
[Guest 1]: actively when the second delta wave hit us and I remember we came together eight nine

03:18:00.580 --> 03:18:05.260
[Guest 1]: people of us who were the leadership team like we got together in my home I still remember

03:18:05.260 --> 03:18:12.020
[Guest 1]: and we said guys this time let's play it by our own on our own terms what we love to do

03:18:12.020 --> 03:18:17.260
[Guest 1]: is to create that's what gives us we spoke about this earlier also like it's the creative

03:18:17.260 --> 03:18:23.760
[Guest 1]: instinct that like brings the joy and we were like we need to make some money to survive

03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:28.440
[Guest 1]: so every restaurant every place that we have will operate two brands the original one and

03:18:28.440 --> 03:18:34.740
[Guest 1]: something new and that led to like a series of ideas being thrown out we ended up with

03:18:34.740 --> 03:18:40.260
[Guest 1]: multiple delivery ideas from kingfu canteen which was indian chinese to sandwich shack

03:18:40.260 --> 03:18:46.180
[Guest 1]: which was comfort sandwiches to pita shack which was a mediterranean place to brunnen

03:18:46.180 --> 03:18:51.540
[Guest 1]: babka which was an online sort of bake house and i'm missing any thai there was same same

03:18:51.540 --> 03:18:55.220
[Amit Varma]: but different which was a thai like within like four months we created five different

03:18:55.220 --> 03:19:02.340
[Guest 1]: concepts do a keto shack also next time we actually had like keto versions of like lettuce

03:19:02.340 --> 03:19:07.900
[Guest 1]: wrapped and and but that you know i don't think it may it gave us survival money for

03:19:07.900 --> 03:19:14.660
[Guest 1]: sure but like more more than that to what yash was referring to it boosted morale at

03:19:14.660 --> 03:19:19.940
[Guest 1]: that point in a way that i don't think any like us having a conversation with the team

03:19:19.940 --> 03:19:23.860
[Guest 1]: is not going to do it like you're everyone's in the same boat at that point and there were

03:19:23.860 --> 03:19:29.420
[Guest 1]: some very hard decisions which i hope no entrepreneur ever has to make and we'd never go back to

03:19:29.420 --> 03:19:34.620
[Guest 1]: that time you had to let people go and then that and more right like i think there were

03:19:34.620 --> 03:19:42.660
[Guest 1]: tough decisions along every step of the way and i think that really was the tipping point

03:19:42.660 --> 03:19:48.020
[Guest 1]: for us where coming out of the second wave is when we were also and we were very fortunate

03:19:48.020 --> 03:19:53.580
[Guest 1]: i will say this our family supported us our investors supported us all our partners our

03:19:53.580 --> 03:20:00.660
[Guest 1]: landlord supported us like we wouldn't be here if but for this there is no way by no

03:20:00.660 --> 03:20:04.380
[Guest 1]: stretch of imagination am i saying like there was some stroke of genius that led us here

03:20:04.380 --> 03:20:10.660
[Guest 2]: it took the village again so like yeah in my point quickly like i still remember the

03:20:10.660 --> 03:20:19.700
[Guest 2]: first we didn't get time to so floyd passed away restaurants we actually shut our restaurants

03:20:19.700 --> 03:20:28.420
[Guest 2]: before the lockdown came in because samir was sick like normal sick and my girlfriend

03:20:28.420 --> 03:20:35.380
[Guest 2]: nico was in singapore doing this bombay canteen pop-up with chef thomas end of feb maybe and

03:20:35.380 --> 03:20:38.540
[Guest 2]: we used to live in singapore so we had a lot of friends and she called me on the second

03:20:38.540 --> 03:20:43.580
[Guest 2]: day of the pop-up saying this thing is hit here and singapore's this was the end of february

03:20:43.580 --> 03:20:49.300
[Guest 2]: yeah singapore's really coming down straight and they've asked us to leave the country

03:20:49.300 --> 03:20:52.220
[Guest 2]: and i think we should think about what is going to happen in india and you know at this

03:20:52.220 --> 03:20:58.380
[Guest 2]: point in india we are like nothing can like stop us right come now we've opened bombay

03:20:58.380 --> 03:21:04.140
[Guest 2]: sweet shop come middle of march friends who run places in london have already have spoken

03:21:04.140 --> 03:21:10.180
[Guest 2]: to and they are like it's bad you need to start figuring out what's going on and that

03:21:10.180 --> 03:21:17.180
[Guest 2]: sense of like not feeling safe enough started coming in for me personally and i decided

03:21:17.180 --> 03:21:22.420
[Guest 2]: that we're gonna shut all three places and just imagine like you're standing doing this

03:21:22.420 --> 03:21:27.780
[Guest 2]: town hall telling your teams that they had never heard of this so we also showed a presentation

03:21:27.780 --> 03:21:33.540
[Guest 2]: on what i had got someone from london to send us like wash your hands do xyz y'all are gonna

03:21:33.540 --> 03:21:41.460
[Guest 2]: get paid just go home don't worry go home and i remember telling them we'll be back

03:21:41.460 --> 03:21:46.260
[Guest 2]: like that was the best information you had at that point like we made that decision a

03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:51.380
[Guest 2]: very gut decision and helped because they all went home home they didn't get stuck in

03:21:51.380 --> 03:21:55.780
[Amit Varma]: the city they weren't stuck in bombay yeah so because i think three or five days later

03:21:55.780 --> 03:22:02.140
[Guest 2]: the city got shut luckily all team members who weren't from bombay had left then obviously

03:22:02.140 --> 03:22:07.900
[Guest 2]: the end of the month chef lloyd passed away and that sent us down a very emotional thing

03:22:07.900 --> 03:22:14.980
[Guest 2]: but i remember april we were like we have to get out of this it used to be me samir

03:22:14.980 --> 03:22:23.100

03:23:02.180 --> 03:23:08.700
[Guest 2]: just like it felt unsafe honestly coming into work because also you were driving on roads

03:23:08.700 --> 03:23:15.100
[Guest 2]: like empty you had that stupid pass on your car but every day just went past i i was lucky

03:23:15.100 --> 03:23:22.860
[Guest 2]: to go home to nico and an amazing dog i think that my that close circle of this team and

03:23:22.860 --> 03:23:29.380
[Guest 2]: nico and tux like just made me realize that we we have everything we need right now and

03:23:29.380 --> 03:23:34.860
[Guest 2]: we just kept doing that just kept the first lockdown we just like just keep it simple

03:23:34.860 --> 03:23:39.540
[Guest 2]: keep it like chef heena used to make cakes at a house shannon used to go with a car pick

03:23:39.540 --> 03:23:44.060
[Guest 2]: up the cakes bring it to the restaurant we used to sell the cakes by delivery so we we

03:23:44.060 --> 03:23:48.780
[Guest 2]: were like we have to survive there's no choice guys we are going to make this survive and

03:23:48.780 --> 03:23:55.060
[Guest 2]: that's what we did i feel like that hustle that our team has is what sets us apart and

03:23:55.060 --> 03:24:00.100
[Guest 2]: the support we got from everyone around us like even our regular guests who i don't think

03:24:00.100 --> 03:24:04.180
[Guest 2]: should be ordering with from us three times a week but they were they knew they had to

03:24:04.180 --> 03:24:10.460
[Guest 2]: contribute and it's all to thanks to landlords like landlords were really nice to us if you

03:24:10.460 --> 03:24:15.380
[Amit Varma]: delivered to andheri and i knew about your wheel i'd order it three times a day so does

03:24:15.380 --> 03:24:21.420
[Guest 2]: tux get better food than other dogs yes but not from the restaurants make it at home he

03:24:21.420 --> 03:24:26.940
[Guest 2]: does get he actually eats better food than i do if i tell you his diet tell me his diet

03:24:26.940 --> 03:24:32.940
[Guest 2]: so right now he's on beef like ground beef that is sauteed he's on french beans he's

03:24:32.940 --> 03:24:40.180
[Guest 2]: on torai he's on red snapper what's the right to rice is uh cucumber it's like a cucumber

03:24:40.180 --> 03:24:47.500
[Guest 1]: and zucchini that's a good diet for a keto friendly diet yeah yeah no carbs that dog

03:24:47.500 --> 03:24:52.300
[Amit Varma]: has more like privilege than anyone else yeah if you ever need a second dog yeah i can dress

03:24:52.300 --> 03:24:56.980
[Amit Varma]: up and bark and you know just saying bark reminded me of the best desert in the world

03:24:56.980 --> 03:25:04.900
[Amit Varma]: basically so and to cutlet you know so tell me a bit more about that you know when you

03:25:04.900 --> 03:25:09.100
[Amit Varma]: when you came home for lunch a couple of months back you told me a bit about it i think you

03:25:09.100 --> 03:25:14.380
[Guest 2]: should challenge him to tell you in one sentence which is not more than six this is the scene

03:25:14.380 --> 03:25:21.260
[Amit Varma]: in the unseen we don't do one sentence there you go love it yeah no no take an hour as

03:25:21.260 --> 03:25:27.060
[Guest 1]: long as you want but tell me everything no i think as i was explaining to you earlier

03:25:27.060 --> 03:25:32.220
[Guest 1]: like it i think it's been a culmination of the things we've done which has led us to

03:25:32.220 --> 03:25:38.380
[Guest 1]: this point and this realization of the importance of something that is n2 cutlet now hopefully

03:25:38.380 --> 03:25:45.300
[Guest 1]: we are able to sort of see the light of day on it very soon but the idea really behind

03:25:45.300 --> 03:25:51.100
[Guest 1]: it was like just the way the restaurants were also while they were rooted in a concept they

03:25:51.100 --> 03:25:57.060
[Guest 1]: were also the kind of restaurants we wanted to go to this is a symblematic of like the

03:25:57.060 --> 03:26:02.900
[Guest 1]: kind of stories i want to read yash wants to read the team wants to read and be a combination

03:26:02.900 --> 03:26:10.900
[Guest 1]: of like it should be fun it should be unusual it should be things that are offbeat things

03:26:10.900 --> 03:26:16.340
[Guest 1]: which you don't just find with a google search that's the hope and dream and we are constantly

03:26:16.340 --> 03:26:21.020
[Guest 1]: striving towards that but there is like we were talking earlier there is no sort of playbook

03:26:21.020 --> 03:26:25.020
[Guest 1]: to this yet only when we start doing it is when we are going to start figuring it out

03:26:25.020 --> 03:26:31.240
[Guest 1]: in fact we spent a couple of hours this morning debating vociferously like what is the sort

03:26:31.240 --> 03:26:36.380
[Guest 1]: of format of it how will we distribute it how will we do all of those and i think all

03:26:36.380 --> 03:26:41.700
[Guest 1]: of us bring very diverse points of view and i can see yash already sort of itching to

03:26:41.700 --> 03:26:51.300
[Guest 2]: as in for me n2 cutlet will hopefully be like the gully boy of indian food and india stories

03:26:51.300 --> 03:26:56.740
[Guest 2]: the reason i say gully boy is because kaliba is that one hindi movie that all of us around

03:26:56.740 --> 03:27:03.820
[Guest 2]: this table watched and enjoyed and so did my parents like you know my parents love the

03:27:03.820 --> 03:27:11.220
[Guest 2]: old and also love these new ones which are like brahmastra types but like i really respected

03:27:11.220 --> 03:27:17.980
[Guest 2]: gully boy for the way they showed what they did right so for me like n2 cutlet should

03:27:17.980 --> 03:27:24.520
[Guest 2]: be something that's going to be like opinionated informative but like unusual food stories

03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:31.900
[Guest 2]: and we we need to start small like so we'll we feel like we can give you like a netflix

03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:37.300
[Guest 2]: style binge where we'll just drop like i don't know eight six to eight stories at a time

03:27:37.300 --> 03:27:42.340
[Guest 2]: that will come out bi-monthly for you but is this text is it a mix of stuff yes it's

03:27:42.340 --> 03:27:47.660
[Guest 1]: a quick it's uh it's text and visuals to start with and the whole idea is that it's rooted

03:27:47.660 --> 03:27:54.260
[Guest 1]: in a season and the season to begin with is say curiosity and curiosity around food and

03:27:54.260 --> 03:27:59.780
[Guest 1]: like we've spoken to people who uh who beautifully contributed around their curiosities around

03:27:59.780 --> 03:28:06.940
[Guest 1]: food and the and we're playing around with other ideas where every every two months the

03:28:06.940 --> 03:28:12.020
[Guest 1]: season changes and as the season changes hopefully the conversation changes so that yes it's

03:28:12.020 --> 03:28:16.260
[Guest 1]: still talking about like what i was what we've been talking i think through this show is

03:28:16.260 --> 03:28:22.460
[Guest 1]: like where our food has come from but also hopefully where it can go and i think to yasha's

03:28:22.460 --> 03:28:27.340
[Guest 1]: points like it should be opinionated it should be argumentative but it should also be a fresh

03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:36.100
[Guest 1]: take on stuff it hopefully should be fun and that will be sort of the like the culmination

03:28:36.100 --> 03:28:40.900
[Guest 1]: of i think a lot of things we anyway do at the restaurant but taking it into different

03:28:40.900 --> 03:28:48.700
[Guest 1]: spaces than we are used to and but do it in a way that like it makes someone think yeah

03:28:48.700 --> 03:28:52.460
[Guest 1]: to your point like again we are not thinking about scale like this is not like a hundred

03:28:52.460 --> 03:28:58.140
[Guest 1]: thousand subscribers like if i can get a thousand people to read it great yeah and we'll take

03:28:58.140 --> 03:29:04.580
[Guest 1]: it from there like there is no like grand like unified theory around this like hopefully

03:29:04.580 --> 03:29:08.960
[Guest 1]: it builds in steps as we are doing it more ideas will come more people will join the

03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:15.420
[Guest 2]: community that we're trying to build and then it goes from there like in in my world when

03:29:15.420 --> 03:29:20.500
[Guest 2]: we had written a long time back and we didn't we didn't have an enthoo cutlet even this

03:29:20.500 --> 03:29:25.660
[Guest 2]: idea of what this thing is we had started writing a document which we used to call hungering

03:29:25.660 --> 03:29:32.820
[Guest 2]: digital and i think those were some of the good things that we picked up during lockdown

03:29:32.820 --> 03:29:37.060
[Guest 2]: was putting our thoughts down on a piece of paper and then making it like a runway for

03:29:37.060 --> 03:29:42.340
[Guest 2]: six months let's just do that right so we put down this document for hungering digital

03:29:42.340 --> 03:29:46.180
[Guest 2]: where everyone in india right now is talking about community and i just don't like other

03:29:46.180 --> 03:29:52.300
[Guest 2]: than watching community the show and laughing i just don't know how to define it so i used

03:29:52.300 --> 03:29:57.700
[Guest 2]: i had said this and i typed it out to say the best thing about bombay canteen is when

03:29:57.700 --> 03:30:02.220
[Guest 2]: you come to bombay canteen as a family or as a friend you're all sitting around the

03:30:02.220 --> 03:30:07.780
[Guest 2]: table and there's food on the table but what is more engaging is the environment that we've

03:30:07.780 --> 03:30:14.780
[Guest 2]: created within those four walls for all of you to exchange stories right like dinner

03:30:14.780 --> 03:30:19.580
[Guest 2]: or lunch is yes it's about the food but that atmosphere where you've tasted something and

03:30:19.580 --> 03:30:23.780
[Guest 2]: you start telling a story then he starts telling a story so we felt that we've created that

03:30:23.780 --> 03:30:30.140
[Guest 2]: environment within the four walls of of bombay canteen and we're really proud of that but

03:30:30.140 --> 03:30:35.980
[Guest 2]: how do you do that when you remove the four walls and like taking it to an online medium

03:30:35.980 --> 03:30:43.140
[Guest 2]: and that's what the hope into cutlet becomes is where all of us share unusual food stories

03:30:43.140 --> 03:30:49.220
[Guest 2]: but they are research like like the food at bombay canteen there is a opinion that the

03:30:49.220 --> 03:30:54.820
[Guest 2]: chef has there's research from a region that's gone into it and that's what we want to do

03:30:54.820 --> 03:31:00.260
[Guest 2]: but it won't have anything to do with our restaurants with what we do it's just something

03:31:00.260 --> 03:31:06.820
[Guest 2]: that i feel sam has been wanting to do for the longest time and like if through this

03:31:06.820 --> 03:31:11.860
[Guest 2]: podcast you would realize he himself is like an n2 cutlet about food because he's like

03:31:11.860 --> 03:31:19.860
[Guest 2]: born in it i feel it's for those n2 cutlets to come there and like n2 cutlets unite mature

03:31:19.860 --> 03:31:24.180
[Amit Varma]: n2 cutlet is what it kind of seems like yeah you've you know been seasoned by life as it

03:31:24.180 --> 03:31:30.300
[Guest 1]: were you know that's a bit as in as a 40 year old they've definitely been seasoned quite

03:31:30.300 --> 03:31:34.340
[Amit Varma]: a bit yeah i'll link it to n2 cutlet from the show notes you know i'll just tell my

03:31:34.340 --> 03:31:38.400
[Amit Varma]: listeners we are recording this near the end of september and but the episode will release

03:31:38.400 --> 03:31:42.980
[Amit Varma]: when n2 cutlet releases basically we'll kind of time it for the same time because i'm really

03:31:42.980 --> 03:31:48.740
[Guest 1]: looking forward to it and to seeing you know what the best part about i feel is like again

03:31:48.740 --> 03:31:52.860
[Guest 1]: conversations such as ours which i don't think would have happened in the absence of us doing

03:31:52.860 --> 03:31:57.940
[Guest 1]: this right and i think that's the beauty of it like and are you from the world of food

03:31:57.940 --> 03:32:01.980
[Guest 1]: no but like there are strong memories you have there are strong opinions you have and

03:32:01.980 --> 03:32:07.860
[Guest 1]: they i think food is a device to have conversations about many things that are happening around

03:32:07.860 --> 03:32:14.140
[Guest 1]: us whether it's politics whether it is culture whether it is lifestyle at large like that

03:32:14.140 --> 03:32:20.740
[Guest 1]: is the beauty of food like it is the center of the world in a way and so many people associate

03:32:20.740 --> 03:32:26.340
[Guest 1]: with it i think one of the most exciting things for me is like the conversations we are having

03:32:26.340 --> 03:32:31.420
[Guest 1]: as a team with people right now and seeing the possibilities right now we are imagining

03:32:31.420 --> 03:32:35.260
[Guest 1]: the possibilities and hopefully in the next few months we actually see those possibilities

03:32:35.260 --> 03:32:39.140
[Amit Varma]: come to life yeah and what kind of struck me even when you sort of reached out in the

03:32:39.140 --> 03:32:43.380
[Amit Varma]: cold and said let's meet i want to you know share an idea with you what struck me there

03:32:43.380 --> 03:32:49.140
[Amit Varma]: was the openness and the humility to you know instead of kind of sitting back and saying

03:32:49.140 --> 03:32:53.140
[Amit Varma]: that hey we've nailed it we've made these cult restaurants we've got this great sweet

03:32:53.140 --> 03:32:57.660
[Amit Varma]: company happening to actually talk to people and try and figure shit out and just have

03:32:57.660 --> 03:33:03.660
[Amit Varma]: that sort of hunger to do something new is something i love some final questions really

03:33:03.660 --> 03:33:09.100
[Amit Varma]: two final questions for each of you for both of you which is that what advice would you

03:33:09.100 --> 03:33:14.660
[Amit Varma]: have to give to young entrepreneurs from your experience because you've kind of you've seen

03:33:14.660 --> 03:33:18.780
[Amit Varma]: the ups you've seen the downs you've you've been disruptors you've tried to do something

03:33:18.780 --> 03:33:25.420
[Amit Varma]: no one has done before you know what advice would you have i think i already said it don't

03:33:25.420 --> 03:33:31.020
[Guest 1]: try and do it alone and don't try to scale and then i don't think don't try to scale

03:33:31.020 --> 03:33:35.940
[Guest 1]: i think scale where it fits the context makes sense scale for the sake of scale is wrong

03:33:35.940 --> 03:33:40.820
[Guest 1]: like i think we've understood that the restaurants in itself are difficult to scale because the

03:33:40.820 --> 03:33:46.780
[Guest 1]: kind of restaurants we built but bombay sweet shop deserves the scale yeah because of again

03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:52.020
[Guest 1]: it is of what it has been think about it like mithai was always meant to be enjoyed at home

03:33:52.020 --> 03:33:56.860
[Guest 1]: so if i can distribute it and think of ways to make it interesting and fun to be enjoyed

03:33:56.860 --> 03:34:04.120
[Guest 1]: at home why not we have to give it its due so i think that would definitely i think understanding

03:34:04.120 --> 03:34:08.980
[Guest 1]: the context in which you're talking about scale is important yeah and i've you know

03:34:08.980 --> 03:34:12.220
[Amit Varma]: i keep raving about the box but i've tried a bunch of your products i think our good

03:34:12.220 --> 03:34:16.060
[Amit Varma]: friend roshan abbas was joining us for drinks in a little while he'd you know gifted me

03:34:16.060 --> 03:34:21.300
[Amit Varma]: a hamper of your stuff and they're all brilliant and i hope they kind of become ubiquitous till

03:34:21.300 --> 03:34:30.020
[Guest 2]: people forget ke box pehle kahan hua tha i feel any entrepreneur i would say people invest

03:34:30.020 --> 03:34:38.820
[Guest 2]: in people and enjoy the grind because it never stops might as well accept it yeah wise words

03:34:38.820 --> 03:34:43.380
[Amit Varma]: so final question almost a predictable one if you heard my show which is you know i'd

03:34:43.380 --> 03:34:48.860
[Amit Varma]: like you to recommend to me and my listeners books that mean a lot to you but could also

03:34:48.860 --> 03:34:52.820
[Amit Varma]: be films could also be music and even the books need not be about food but they can

03:34:52.820 --> 03:34:56.660
[Amit Varma]: be but you know whatever means the most to you through your life and which you'd love

03:34:56.660 --> 03:35:02.100
[Guest 1]: to share with others so i think we've spoken about setting the table obviously because

03:35:02.100 --> 03:35:08.060
[Guest 1]: of just the nature in which it changed our thought process when it comes to the world

03:35:08.060 --> 03:35:14.660
[Guest 1]: we inhabit and i think it's applicable to many many sort of other areas for me the other

03:35:14.660 --> 03:35:19.740
[Guest 1]: book which i love is one called creativity inc by ed catmull who was one of the founders

03:35:19.740 --> 03:35:24.140
[Guest 1]: of pixar and i think what struck me i think i read it one or two years after bombay canteen

03:35:24.140 --> 03:35:31.880
[Guest 1]: opened and it like like the parallels between the world of film theater and food is just

03:35:31.880 --> 03:35:39.660
[Guest 1]: it it's obvious once you get into it but like really the thought there was like how do you

03:35:39.660 --> 03:35:45.020
[Guest 1]: scale creative thought and that's what i took away from it like how do you build an organization

03:35:45.020 --> 03:35:50.900
[Guest 1]: which supports new thought coming in how do you not lose your soul if you think of pixar

03:35:50.900 --> 03:35:56.540
[Guest 1]: like there's so much love created over such a long period of time which is unheard of

03:35:56.540 --> 03:36:01.360
[Guest 1]: and it's because like it was built for that in a way and like getting a peek into that

03:36:01.360 --> 03:36:08.740
[Guest 2]: thinking was amazing for me for me and the book you'll remember the name the book by

03:36:08.740 --> 03:36:16.240
[Guest 2]: the founder of zappos delivering happiness delivering happiness is just every founder

03:36:16.240 --> 03:36:22.000
[Guest 2]: needs to because it talks a lot about just customer service and i feel you might be starting

03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:26.700
[Guest 2]: a sas company or you're starting the next oeo or you're starting it has to be the basis

03:36:26.700 --> 03:36:32.880
[Guest 2]: of everything you do then the second one i feel specifically for indian entrepreneurs

03:36:32.880 --> 03:36:40.480
[Guest 2]: is because i feel we've never been trained to be extroverted and present our ideas we

03:36:40.480 --> 03:36:45.620
[Guest 2]: have a dream in our head and we we make the worst power points in the world i feel the

03:36:45.620 --> 03:36:51.880
[Guest 2]: most cluttered there's a book called how to talk like ted it's basically ex ted speakers

03:36:51.880 --> 03:36:57.600
[Guest 2]: who've put in very simple things it's a really nice book with examples and you can go to

03:36:57.600 --> 03:37:03.140
[Guest 2]: youtube links and see it it's helped me personally a lot like whenever i present an idea to sam

03:37:03.140 --> 03:37:09.180
[Guest 2]: also i put it on a simple white presentation and present it because it some things in your

03:37:09.180 --> 03:37:13.960
[Guest 2]: brain you need to be able to put it out in a better way and is there a great idea from

03:37:13.960 --> 03:37:23.260
[Guest 2]: you that sam hasn't responded well to i wanted to start a ladoo concept called ladoo ray

03:37:23.260 --> 03:37:33.000
[Amit Varma]: it's gonna happen now yeah and i've seen an instagram idea of yours that i was a prank

03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:38.760
[Guest 2]: which was coffee box called cox yes namita wasn't namita wasn't too happy with that yeah

03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:45.760
[Guest 1]: my mother that was a prank on her yeah yeah she's still rolling her eyes at me no but

03:37:45.760 --> 03:37:51.320
[Guest 1]: to be fair like to talk about clarity or ideas like i think at that time both of us along

03:37:51.320 --> 03:37:56.240
[Guest 1]: with another colleague of ours we did your writing course and i think it was just a great

03:37:56.240 --> 03:38:02.560
[Guest 1]: way to sort of again like are we both going to ever write anything or meaningful meaningful

03:38:02.560 --> 03:38:09.200
[Guest 1]: probably not but i think the the principles behind it which was super important right

03:38:09.200 --> 03:38:14.920
[Guest 1]: like the clarity of thought thinking of who's reading the thinking around like those i think

03:38:14.920 --> 03:38:20.040
[Guest 1]: it's that principles of the thinking which was really amazing and like which is what

03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:23.800
[Guest 1]: is like driving a lot of what we are doing right now like what is behavior who are we

03:38:23.800 --> 03:38:27.960
[Guest 1]: talking to like maybe it's through a restaurant maybe through it's through the written medium

03:38:27.960 --> 03:38:32.600
[Guest 1]: of enducutlet maybe it's through the neck like it's funny like i'm thinking as i'm thinking

03:38:32.600 --> 03:38:37.600
[Guest 1]: i'm remembering like we used to have a chikki which used to be called the everything chikki

03:38:37.600 --> 03:38:43.280
[Guest 2]: because we so basically when you go to a mithai shop the sweet and the savory farsan kachori

03:38:43.280 --> 03:38:49.280
[Guest 2]: and stuff chakli wafer so we took all that with jaggery and made it into a a chikki because

03:38:49.280 --> 03:38:52.720
[Unknown]: i think i've had it yeah yeah yeah so we used to call it everything chikki because it's

03:38:52.720 --> 03:38:58.800
[Guest 2]: everything in the in the store yeah and we like i love it because it's like like chakpatan

03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:04.960
[Guest 2]: is in it and it never really took off so we like through a competition sent it out to

03:39:04.960 --> 03:39:11.040
[Guest 2]: people and said you name it for us and everyone came out with bombay bhel chikki which is

03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:15.760
[Guest 2]: actually such a nice simple answer we should have thought of it before but people told

03:39:15.760 --> 03:39:20.560
[Guest 2]: so for diwali like we are today sitting in september yeah we've sold out of it it's the

03:39:20.560 --> 03:39:24.800
[Amit Varma]: first product to already get sold out for diwali and we are like a good month away not

03:39:24.800 --> 03:39:28.760
[Unknown]: surprised you haven't sold out of barks no like that should be perennially sold out what

03:39:28.760 --> 03:39:32.640
[Unknown]: is wrong with people they're not eating them fast enough there should be a resale market
