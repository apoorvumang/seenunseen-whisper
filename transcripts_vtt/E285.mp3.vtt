00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.220
[Amit Varma]: I've always distrusted the state, especially the Indian state. I was born in the 1970s,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.720
[Amit Varma]: I grew up in the 80s and 90s. I had a close up view of government. My distrust of the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.880
[Amit Varma]: state was given an intellectual framework when I got into political philosophy. And

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.680
[Amit Varma]: when I learned public choice theory, a branch of economics that studies how everyone in

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.000
[Amit Varma]: politics should be looked upon as a human being responding to incentives. The incentives

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.200
[Amit Varma]: of a politician are always to win the next election. They need money for this. Money

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.000
[Amit Varma]: demands a quid pro quo. The next election is always nearby. So all the incentives are

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.920
[Amit Varma]: short term incentives. And politicians soon realized that governance doesn't matter, especially

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.040
[Amit Varma]: when his benefits are unseen, and narratives matter. Voters are also self interested and

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.240
[Amit Varma]: their apathy is rational. Since their one vote will seldom decide an election, why waste

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.520
[Amit Varma]: too much time educating yourself on governance and economics and policy and so on. When they

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.960
[Amit Varma]: do vote, it may be because of other incentives, like signaling loyalty to their tribe, or

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.040
[Amit Varma]: just to get a free bag of rice. And the third piece of this puzzle are bureaucrats. bureaucrats

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.200
[Amit Varma]: also respond to incentives. According to the economist William Niskanen, what they really

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.600
[Amit Varma]: care about are court, salary, perks of the office, public reputation, power, patronage,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.640
[Amit Varma]: and the ease of managing the bureau, stop good. They also want to play it safe. Continuing

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.400
[Amit Varma]: the status quo is a safe option, and reforms are risky and could backfire. From all this,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.720
[Amit Varma]: we can conclude that the state is an oppressive beast that just grows and grows and grows.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.840
[Amit Varma]: It accumulates power and never gives any of it away. Every state is on a slow lurch towards

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.600
[Amit Varma]: becoming a predatory state akin to a colonial power with native rulers. And yet, despite

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.280
[Amit Varma]: these dark words, there is hope, because human beings contain multitudes, and they respond

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.920
[Amit Varma]: to a multitude of incentives, not just those that arise from their position. Some are animated

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.880
[Amit Varma]: by principles they hold dear. Some would genuinely like to make the world a better place. I would

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.400
[Amit Varma]: hold in my cynical way that this is an exception. But when these outliers express themselves,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.320
[Amit Varma]: my God, it's beautiful. This is what happened in 1991, when we opened up large parts of

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.040
[Amit Varma]: our economy. For once, the government got out of the way of society, and immediately

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.400
[Amit Varma]: our economy boomed. And in the next 20 years, hundreds of millions of people were lifted

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.520
[Amit Varma]: out of poverty. I used to mistakenly believe that these reforms happened only because of

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.280
[Amit Varma]: our balance of payments crisis and the conditions EIMF set to bail us out and so on. But I have

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.520
[Amit Varma]: since discovered that a group of bureaucrats and wonks within the government spent almost

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.080
[Amit Varma]: a decade, the whole of the 1980s, preparing the master plan that was eventually put in

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.440
[Amit Varma]: place in 1991. I've had episodes on the reforms and on PV Narasimha Rao who made them politically

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.560
[Amit Varma]: viable. And right now, I want to draw your attention to the following names, many of

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.640
[Amit Varma]: which you may not even have heard of. Rakesh Mohan, Amarnath Verma, IG Patel, Vijay Kelkar,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.520
[Amit Varma]: Ashok Desai, Naresh Chandra, Montek Singh Aluwalia. And there are many more like this

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.400
[Amit Varma]: unsung heroes whose actions put food in the plates of unseen millions and gave hope to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.120
[Amit Varma]: a nation. My guest today is one of these remarkable men.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.520
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:20.600
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.640
[Amit Varma]: today is Montek Singh Aluwalia, who lived the Indian dream of the 50s and 60s and 70s

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.280
[Amit Varma]: when he went abroad, studied at Oxford, got a job in the World Bank, escaped his circumstances.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.840
[Amit Varma]: But Montek then did something unusual. He came back to India and joined the government

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.960
[Amit Varma]: in the late 1970s determined to be a force for good. He bided his time for a decade,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.360
[Amit Varma]: pushed reforms where he could, made alliances, combined thought and action wherever it was

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.720
[Amit Varma]: possible and came out with a legendary policy paper in 1990 called the M document. It laid

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.720
[Amit Varma]: out a detailed roadmap of what India needed to do to lift the country to a better place.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.480
[Amit Varma]: He got his chance in 1991 and worked closely with his friend and mentor Manmohan Singh

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.280
[Amit Varma]: to carry out many of these reforms. He remained a key player for the next couple of decades

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.400
[Amit Varma]: and even wrote a fabulous book about his experiences called Backstage, the story behind India's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.960
[Amit Varma]: growth years. His wife, the late Ishwarja Aluwalia was also a formidable economist and

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.240
[Amit Varma]: I recommend her memoir as well called Breaking Through. Montek is 78 today and still full

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.760
[Amit Varma]: of ideas, still full of hope for our great nation. I learned a lot from my conversation

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.880
[Amit Varma]: with him and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well. But before we go there, let's take a quick

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.240
[Amit Varma]: commercial break. And as so often, I don't actually have a commercial, but what the hell,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.520
[Amit Varma]: let's do this for love.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.080
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.760
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.200
[Amit Varma]: Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.140
[Amit Varma]: workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community interaction.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.480
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.660
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.080
[Amit Varma]: a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.760
[Amit Varma]: or about $150 and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.400
[Amit Varma]: at IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. That's IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. Being

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.680
[Amit Varma]: a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.680
[Amit Varma]: idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Montek, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
[Guest]: Nice to be here. Thank you.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, I just want to, I don't want to embarrass you, but I want to start off by

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.360
[Amit Varma]: saying that to me and to many of my listeners, no doubt, you know, you and that your entire

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.240
[Amit Varma]: band of, you know, reformers who did what they did 91 onwards are heroes for us. I mean,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.000
[Amit Varma]: we might live different lives if not for you. So

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.720
[Guest]: Very nice. Very nice to hear good things. Thank you.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And it's such a privilege for me that, you know, you made the time to come here today.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.960
[Amit Varma]: I'd like to sort of start by asking you about your early life because one of the things

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.040
[Amit Varma]: that sort of fascinates me and one of the themes I examine with my guests is, is sort

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.180
[Amit Varma]: of the texture of their lives and their growing up years because one of the mistakes I made

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.120
[Amit Varma]: and I'm 48 and one of the mistakes I make sometimes is that I assume that the things

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.680
[Amit Varma]: that I know and the things that I've lived through are shared experiences by everyone.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.760
[Amit Varma]: But I think more than 60 and close to 70% of the country is actually born after liberalization.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.360
[Amit Varma]: They don't have lived experience of the times before it. And I was just struck with this

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.360
[Amit Varma]: factoid when I was reading about your life, that actually, the US Civil War is closer

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.480
[Amit Varma]: to your birth than we are now. You know, that's kind of, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.600
[Amit Varma]: you kind of feel old, but I'm and you you are older than India, you are older than our

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.480
[Amit Varma]: nation state. So tell me a little bit about, you know, where were you born? What was your

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480
[Amit Varma]: childhood like?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.800
[Guest]: Okay, well, you know, I was born in Rawalpindi. That time, it was part of undivided India.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:06.160
[Guest]: And my parents moved from Pakistan without, my father was in any case, posted in India,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:13.440
[Guest]: as we now know it. And he used to be in defense accounts. He joined the civil service as a

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.160
[Guest]: clerk in those days, British times, that was a probably higher up the ladder than it is

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.920
[Guest]: now. But you know, we were not privileged, privileged family, typical, what would then

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.760
[Guest]: be called middle class, lower than the middle of the middle class, if you like. I have no

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:39.160
[Guest]: recollection, therefore, of partition. My earliest memories are really of Sikandar,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:47.280
[Guest]: not Sikandarabad, Ambala. Just after independence, we were in Ambala. And then after the police

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.440
[Guest]: action in Hyderabad, the army moved into Hyderabad. And my father being in defense accounts, the

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.520
[Guest]: accountants moved in the wake of the army. So I was there in Hyderabad, that was really

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.400
[Guest]: when I grew up in Sikandarabad, which is a twin city, as you know. And I was there till

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.960
[Guest]: 1957 when we moved to Delhi.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.440
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about your father, Mr. Jagmohan Singh. I was struck by this paragraph

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.880
[Amit Varma]: in your book backstage where you write, my father Jagmohan Singh graduated from Khalsa

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.200
[Amit Varma]: College Amritsar and joined the Department of Defense Accounts as a clerk. He was a reclusive

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.000
[Amit Varma]: person with a strong moral conscience and an abiding sense of duty. He put whatever

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.120
[Amit Varma]: little savings he had in a bank account, strictly avoiding investments in stocks, which he viewed

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.920
[Amit Varma]: as a form of speculation, stop quote. And you know, one thing that I sometimes speculate

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.000
[Amit Varma]: on is how much our character and the things that we do is determined in a sense by circumstance.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.840
[Amit Varma]: That when you are in a circumstance like that, where you have a family to look after, and

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.080
[Amit Varma]: the nation's going through so much turmoil, you would in a sense, naturally be inclined

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.360
[Amit Varma]: to be cautious and to be careful and to kind of, you know, give importance to all of those

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.800
[Amit Varma]: things. Later on in your book, you mentioned about how when you were in Oxford, when that

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.560
[Amit Varma]: phase got over, you'd been offered a plush job in the private sector over there. But

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.360
[Amit Varma]: you chose not to do it because you felt that you had to give something back to the country

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.200
[Amit Varma]: and in some way, work within the government, work in development, economics, and so on.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And that again, being something that I think you mentioned in your book that your wife

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.680
[Amit Varma]: speculated that you probably got it from your dad. So in hindsight, when I look back on

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.240
[Amit Varma]: my own childhood, I can see the various ways good and bad, in which I was sort of shaped

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.360
[Amit Varma]: by my parents. And one is of course shaped by many things, not just parents, peers, and

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.880
[Amit Varma]: so on. But as you were a traveling family, you know, first Saharanpur, then Ambala, then

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.240
[Amit Varma]: Secunderabad, then at the age of 14, Delhi, I guess that your parents must have been a

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.120
[Amit Varma]: really big influence on you. So tell me a little bit about that, that when you look

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.320
[Amit Varma]: back in hindsight, what are the when you, you know, look at the young Monte kind of

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.880
[Amit Varma]: growing up in that kind of house in those kind of times? What do you see now?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:05.400
[Guest]: Well, I think my upbringing, both my parents are very concerned to bring us up as best

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:12.520
[Guest]: they could. It was a mother who actually did most of the, what you would call child caring.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.840
[Guest]: But my father was very concerned about our education. Also, I mentioned in the book that,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.780
[Guest]: you know, my mother lost her younger brother, who was actually a lieutenant in the army.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:30.600
[Guest]: He died to an accident in a mountaineering expedition. So we came to Delhi for about

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.880
[Guest]: 10 days. And my father felt I mean, I was like at that time, maybe only about nine or

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:44.880
[Guest]: 10 years old. But my father felt that missing out my school for 10 days is bad. And he was

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:51.760
[Guest]: very concerned that I shouldn't slip in mathematics, because like many people, he regarded that

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:58.360
[Guest]: as critical. And I was really surprised that he got permission from his office. I mean,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:05.040
[Guest]: he was very dedicated, office going type, to take two hours leave in order to sit in

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.440
[Guest]: my class and take notes so that I wouldn't miss anything on the maths front. It was my

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.400
[Guest]: first indication that he really cared a lot about what happened to my education. I mean,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:25.040
[Guest]: the next similar indication was, you know, towards the end of his service, he was very

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.120
[Guest]: well thought of. And he had worked his way up from being a clerk to being an officer,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:37.320
[Guest]: but he was not in the Indian Defense Account Service, which is the grade A service of that

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:44.040
[Guest]: system. And so they said to him that, look, we'd like to make you a promotee. So you know,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:50.920
[Guest]: for those guys becoming and having IDAS after your name was a big thing. But they said,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.880
[Guest]: look, if we make you IDAS, you'll be in charge of a defense accounts office. You're here

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:03.560
[Guest]: in Secunderabad, but you'll be sent to a much smaller place where, you know, the head of

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:10.600
[Guest]: the office is the junior most IDAS person. The alternative, if you don't want that, is

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.840
[Guest]: we could send you to Delhi for the last two years of your career. And well, you'll be

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.080
[Guest]: able to settle your family before retiring and so on. And you know, my father thought

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:27.440
[Guest]: about that. And he said that he chose that consciously giving up the IDAS because he

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:34.000
[Guest]: felt we would get a better education. And I mean, he was right that I moved into Delhi

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.560
[Guest]: Public School. I enjoyed it. It was a better school than the school I was in Secunderabad.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.800
[Guest]: Results and all were better. And you know, when I look back, it's quite possible that

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:51.720
[Guest]: if we hadn't moved, I don't think I would have had as good an academic career as I ended

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:58.680
[Guest]: up having. I may not have got the Rhodes Scholarship. So really a very critical decision on the

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.720
[Guest]: part of my father. And I'm the biggest beneficiary of it. So there was a lot of concern, a lot

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:11.720
[Guest]: of principles, deeply believed in simple life. And I think that did influence me. You know,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.800
[Guest]: you mentioned this business of giving back to the, that's not how I viewed. I think I

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.000
[Guest]: belong to the generation immediately after independence, which actually believed that,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.360
[Guest]: you know, the government was going to, so to speak, develop the country. So the task

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:35.320
[Guest]: of joining a development oriented government that would remake the country was a very exciting

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.800
[Guest]: task. And you know, I, when I went, even when I went to Oxford, I thought I would just sit

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:47.360
[Guest]: for the IAS. And I even began preparing for it. But you know, I'd done well in Oxford

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:54.600
[Guest]: and job offers came. I wasn't at all interested in the private sector. It just wasn't my thing.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.240
[Guest]: But I got tempted when the World Bank started recruiting and they said, well, we need people

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.200
[Guest]: who can work on what's going on in different developing countries. So I felt that that

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.360
[Guest]: might actually help me in my desire to work on development. And I thought I was going

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:20.400
[Guest]: there for three years and stayed on for nine, which was quite a long time. But anyway, I

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.640
[Guest]: didn't regret it. And I thought I enjoyed, not nine, actually, I think I stayed for 11

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:32.440
[Guest]: years, between 68 and 79. And then finally came back. I think both my wife and I wanted

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:38.640
[Guest]: to come back. And she was particularly concerned that as soon as our kids were born, we should

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.840
[Guest]: come back. I mean, she also wanted to do work, her own work. She was an economist, was in

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.360
[Guest]: India. But I think the bringing up children was crucial. So our oldest son had been born,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.840
[Guest]: and the younger one was about to be born. And she felt this is the time to go. And an

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.320
[Guest]: opportunity opened up in the finance ministry, and I took it.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.040
[Amit Varma]: Going back to your childhood, one of the things that I was sort of struck by while reading

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.160
[Amit Varma]: backstage is you describe how after DPS Mathura, you had to wait for a year before you could

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.200
[Amit Varma]: join Delhi University. So because you were, you know, two months short of the minimum

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.240
[Amit Varma]: age. So you write, quote, I use the time to delve into some books on economics that I

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.120
[Amit Varma]: borrowed from the British Council Library on Rafi Mark. This gave me a feel for the

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.200
[Amit Varma]: subject and helped convince me of for the BA Honours course in economics in Delhi University,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.840
[Amit Varma]: stop quote. And I was struck by this because I've had many economists on the show. No one

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.760
[Amit Varma]: read economics for fun when they were kids. Right. So it's almost as if, you know, you'd

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.840
[Amit Varma]: expect people to read racy novels or comics or whatever.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.880
[Guest]: I did all of that too. Okay. Remember, I had a whole year to waste. So compared to these

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.680
[Guest]: other economists that you're talking about, I had more time. And I didn't want to spend

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:54.120
[Guest]: all that time reading novels and comics. So having time, I said, look, economics was a

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.520
[Guest]: new subject. We never did any economics in school. So, you know, before taking the plunge

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest]: into economics, I really wanted to see what, what would the books be like?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.840
[Guest]: What did you read? Do you remember?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.400
[Guest]: Actually I don't come to think of it. It wasn't one of these standard textbooks. It was this

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:19.720
[Guest]: older generation of, you know, things written in the 1930s and 40s. For example, I don't

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:26.200
[Guest]: remember reading Alfred Marshall's Principles. That was a kind of heavy textbook of the time.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.160
[Guest]: And you know, people like Samuelson and so on hadn't quite made the impact that they

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:37.640
[Guest]: obviously they dominated textbooks later on. But it wasn't textbooks so much as books on

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:44.240
[Guest]: economics. Not very interesting, but it sufficiently convinced me that it's a subject that I think

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.080
[Guest]: I would enjoy, basically.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.060
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit more about that period. Like, what is the other stuff you were reading,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:57.000
[Amit Varma]: what you were doing? Like, I enjoy sort of looking back on, you know, just thinking about

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.560
[Amit Varma]: how every 15 year old holds a seed, in a sense, for the 40 year old, for the 75 year old,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, when you look back on the young 15 year old, you or the 12 year old, you or

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.840
[Amit Varma]: whatever, you know, what is that seed? And at one level, that seed leads you to the part

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.600
[Amit Varma]: that you took. But are there other seeds that lead you down other paths?

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.480
[Guest]: Well, I think I was quite interested in history, even then. And again, I owe that a little

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.200
[Guest]: bit to my father. I mean, when we were in Secunderabad, for example, he had brought

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.960
[Guest]: home from his library, K. A. Nilakanth Shastri's History of South India, which, you know, later

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.640
[Guest]: on we never read. But it was interesting in Secunderabad, reading about the history of

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:47.720
[Guest]: South India. I think it's one of the gaps, if you like, in the regular educational process,

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:53.240
[Guest]: that we don't give enough attention to the fact that there's not necessarily an Indian

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.960
[Guest]: history. I mean, this is a big country and different parts of it have sort of had different

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:05.360
[Guest]: histories. So I was always interested in history and then historical novels. But of course,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.080
[Guest]: most of the historical novels I read were really Western. And actually my favorite in

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:16.080
[Guest]: those days, I read through the whole of Alexander Dumas, for example.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.640
[Amit Varma]: And what was your conception of yourself at that time? Like, what did you want to be?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I don't think a 14 or 15 year old ever says, I'm going to be an economist, I'm

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.080
[Amit Varma]: going to be a policy wonk, I'm going to do all these things.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.000
[Guest]: Oh, I think at that point, I didn't really think I wanted to be a policy wonk. I think

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.440
[Guest]: at that point, I just thought I would sit for the IAS and do good and participate in

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:44.480
[Guest]: the development of the country. The realization that there's a profession that one could follow

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.440
[Guest]: came quite a bit later.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.560
[Amit Varma]: In your wife's excellent autobiography, she mentions that when she first met your dad,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.640
[Amit Varma]: they bonded immediately because of his because he could talk about both English, English

00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:01.680
[Amit Varma]: literature and Punjabi poetry, you know, so one senses that there is a multilingual kind

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.840
[Amit Varma]: of upbringing happening here that at one level, you are sort of rooted, she's spoken, and

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.440
[Amit Varma]: I think you've mentioned as well, you know, being part of the Sikh community, and it's

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.240
[Amit Varma]: something that you take seriously. At the same time, there is a certain westernization

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.920
[Amit Varma]: also in that upbringing, where like you mentioned, you're reading Dumas, and later on, when your

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.480
[Amit Varma]: wife mentions in a book that you would watch a lot of European cinema, when you were in

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.480
[Amit Varma]: the US, you'd watch, you know, in the Sika and Fellini and all of that. And it's just

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.120
[Amit Varma]: a sort of mixture of these two. So that, you know, when I look back on how I kind of grew

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.600
[Amit Varma]: up, and I also had a privileged upbringing, my dad was an IAS officer born a couple of

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.680
[Amit Varma]: years before you, in fact, again, in what is now Pakistan. And one of the things one

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.760
[Amit Varma]: of the negative aspects of my upbringing was that it was unfortunately so westernized,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.920
[Amit Varma]: that I wasn't too rooted as a young person in the sense that I would actively look down

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.760
[Amit Varma]: on, you know, I'd have this snobbish attitude about, say, Hindi cinema, or about other aspects

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.840
[Amit Varma]: of our culture. And then it took to kind of getting a little bit older and with time figuring

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.760
[Amit Varma]: out that, you know, that that attitude was fundamentally wrong, that on the contrary,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.400
[Amit Varma]: it's a privilege to be surrounded by the richness of different languages and different cultures

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:28.280
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. So how did you sort of navigate those different cultural influences? And do

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.160
[Amit Varma]: you think, therefore, that in a fundamental way, it makes an Indian economist different

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.680
[Amit Varma]: from, say, a European economist, in the sense that they have one language or at most two,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:45.080
[Amit Varma]: while you have different languages and a much richer web of sort of influences to draw upon?

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:52.240
[Guest]: That's a very good, very good question. Let me give you a considered answer. First, you

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.680
[Guest]: know, when I was growing up, I don't think I was adequately aware of the richness of

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:05.200
[Guest]: this cultural tradition, to a large extent that came to me through my wife. Because Isha

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.240
[Guest]: used to say that she herself was what they used to call a Hindi medium type. She was

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:17.360
[Guest]: not comfortable in English through most of her school days, because she went to Shikshayat

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:24.920
[Guest]: school in Kolkata, which had Hindi medium. It's only when she went to presidency in Kolkata

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:30.440
[Guest]: that she started getting an education in English medium. And she felt that she was a little

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.200
[Guest]: behind the other kids. She worked hard at it, of course, and made up, but she was very

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.520
[Guest]: conscious of that. And, you know, part of the bonding between her and my father was

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:48.000
[Guest]: that he was very interested in Punjabi poetry, not religious stuff, but Punjabi poetry. And

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.280
[Guest]: since he read, he could read, he used to do the reading of poetry, he read it in the Arabic

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.200
[Guest]: script, Urdu script, because in, you know, Punjabi men in those days, the women would

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.920
[Guest]: learn the Gurmukhi script, the men would learn the Arabic script, because after all, a lot

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:11.200
[Guest]: of the official recording, etc. was in Urdu. In Ranjit Singh's court, the official language

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.600
[Guest]: was Persian. So you know, it gives you a sense that we don't kind of adequately realize.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:23.600
[Guest]: So I think Isha interacted very nicely with my father, because she had a very strong grounding.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:30.120
[Guest]: In her case, Punjabi, in terms of what she got from Gurbani, the religious part, and

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.920
[Guest]: he was much more interested in Heer Ranja and that kind of stuff. So I think they bonded

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:43.240
[Guest]: quite well. Now, you know, linguistic variety is, of course, one thing. It reflects a much

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:49.920
[Guest]: more substantial economic structural variety in the country. I mean, you know, people don't

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.000
[Guest]: realize that the difference between the richest states of India and the poorest states of

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: India, in terms of per capita GDP, something like five is to one. So I mean, and these

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.060
[Guest]: are huge areas. So each one of them in the United Nations would be in a separate country.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:14.720
[Guest]: So when you're running a country with such a wide disparity of economic structure, you

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.800
[Guest]: need to have a different approach to how all this is going to pull together. And you know,

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.760
[Guest]: in my book, I do mention, when I was deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, it struck

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:35.560
[Guest]: me that we were not analyzing the structural constraints of each state, which were distinct

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:43.280
[Guest]: to it. There was a tendency to basically describe economic problems as the same. I mean, everybody

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.200
[Guest]: has to have infrastructure, everybody has agriculture, that's important. But you know,

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:54.040
[Guest]: in some parts of the country, agriculture is very powerfully influenced by extreme shortages

00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:00.400
[Guest]: of water. In other parts of the country, water is not a problem. And I don't think that we

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:06.200
[Guest]: took adequate, paid adequate attention to these differences. So in that sense, I think

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.320
[Guest]: that's partly a reflection of how much the country varies. And you know, this has to

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:17.260
[Guest]: be then combined with the fact that there's a lot of migration that takes place. So people

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.680
[Guest]: from the poor parts of the country migrate to the richer parts of the country, and they

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:29.160
[Guest]: send back, if you like, messages or perceptions about what's it what's it like elsewhere.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:37.880
[Guest]: And this is a very strong sort of substructure cultural interaction that's taking place,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.400
[Guest]: which as an economist, you should know more about. And this is where sociology also comes

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.400
[Guest]: in. And I would say that, when I think about it, we should have been more aware of these

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.400
[Guest]: things than we were.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Manmohan Singh is saying in the book at one point, that you can't take 10% of the population

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.120
[Amit Varma]: into the 21st century, leaving the remaining 90% in the 19th century. And this is one striking

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.160
[Amit Varma]: thing about India that there are parts of it in the 19th century 20th, and a small set

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.320
[Amit Varma]: of elites, you know, who are fortunate enough, like us to enjoy the 21st. And we normalise

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:19.480
[Amit Varma]: it. And because we normalise it, I sometimes feel that we may be blind to the fissures

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:25.140
[Amit Varma]: that sort of develop in our society, because of these differences. And these differences

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.240
[Amit Varma]: go deeper than just talking about say, economic inequality between states, like you mentioned,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, they exist at a social level, a cultural level. And of course, our society

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:41.680
[Amit Varma]: these days is, you know, deeply divided in different ways. But there are, you know, divisions

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.680
[Amit Varma]: that have kind of always sort of existed. And I don't even mean in the pure sense of

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.600
[Amit Varma]: the potential for conflict or all of that, or the adversarial nature of some of these

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:58.880
[Amit Varma]: divisions, but just in the sense that there is then a danger for an elite governing class,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.720
[Amit Varma]: for example, to have an idea of India, that is based too much on what they kind of see

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.760
[Amit Varma]: around them and what they study in books, and so on and so forth. And this is almost

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.560
[Amit Varma]: in some senses, it seems even if you're well intentioned, and you try to make an effort,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, the nuances and complexities are way too much. And therefore, just thinking

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:26.560
[Amit Varma]: aloud, this would even be an argument for a much greater degree of local governance.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:32.920
[Amit Varma]: And in some senses, saying that a country as large and varied as this is fundamentally

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:38.920
[Amit Varma]: ungovernable from the center from in a top down kind of way. And that might be a fundamental

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.760
[Amit Varma]: mistake that we made. So I'm just thinking aloud. But what are sort of your thoughts?

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:50.480
[Guest]: Well, no, I certainly that when you have a country with wide differences within it, and

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:56.600
[Guest]: it starts to open up and interact with the world, that is likely to increase the extent

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:03.200
[Guest]: of the differential. I mean, the country as a whole benefits, and those that benefit early

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:09.240
[Guest]: are the ones that are already in a good position. Hopefully, the others watch what's happening,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:14.440
[Guest]: and they start emulating them, and they also grow. The solution, in my view, is not that

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.200
[Guest]: you shut yourself off. It's certainly true that if you shut yourself off, you can just

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:25.160
[Guest]: keep stagnating. But here you open up. The ideal thinking, of course, is that when you

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:32.360
[Guest]: open up, an economist will say that, look, your growth rate will go up from 5% to 7%,

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:39.000
[Guest]: which is what happened. But you know, in a politician's mind, when he's addressing a

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.160
[Guest]: big audience, he'd like that to mean that every one of you was benefiting at 5%. Now

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:51.800
[Guest]: you're all going to benefit at 7%. Inequality is one thing, but if everybody's benefiting,

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.800
[Guest]: that can kind of make people accept it. But the truth is, that's not what happens. Some

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:03.120
[Guest]: of you are going to benefit not 7%, but 8%, 9%. And some of you probably only 2%. And

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:08.160
[Guest]: you know, in an extreme case, you can even theoretically imagine that you might get worse

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.480
[Guest]: off. Although, of course, as a family, you don't necessarily get worse off. I mean, in

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:20.160
[Guest]: the sense that the guys who used to run tongas in Delhi basically lost their jobs. Maybe

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:26.120
[Guest]: some of them found some other jobs. But their kids probably run taxis. There's a bit of

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.080
[Guest]: an internal redistribution within a family, which tends to moderate that. And we have

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:38.760
[Guest]: to accept the fact that in a market economy, it is very difficult for a change that will

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:45.560
[Guest]: do well for the economy to actually lead to an equal benefit across the country. That's

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.640
[Guest]: why you have to be watchful. What are you doing for those that are left behind? And

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.760
[Guest]: to be fair, in all our thinking, that's been driven home to us right from the beginning.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.600
[Guest]: I mean, this whole focus that poverty must be a focus, you must reduce poverty, and all

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:07.280
[Guest]: this kind of stuff, which was there for the last 20, 30 years, reflects that. But I think,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:14.800
[Guest]: you know, poverty tends to focus only on whatever the bottom 20, the bottom 30, the bottom 40%.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:21.200
[Guest]: It doesn't sort of reflect the unevenness of benefits in, let's say, the top 50. So

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:27.480
[Guest]: in a structure where somebody was maybe not poor, maybe they were in the 50th percentile,

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.920
[Guest]: but they don't do very well. And somebody in the 60th percentile does very well. Poverty

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:40.880
[Guest]: is not affected, but you can get a sense of discomfort, and that can lead to social tension.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:47.480
[Guest]: Now this is why the only factor that you have that can counter that is a well-functioning

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:53.000
[Guest]: democratic system. Because democracy sends that message back, and politicians know how

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.160
[Guest]: to read it. They know that some things they can manage, and some kind of things they can't

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:05.640
[Guest]: manage. And therefore, how fast they respond to those things determines the end result.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:12.840
[Guest]: And I mean, we have to recognize that whoever's running a complex country like this has to

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.140
[Guest]: keep this in mind. Now the second issue which you raised is, does all this have to be looked

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:24.720
[Guest]: at by some centralized government? You know, in India, it cannot be, because the Constitution

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:31.720
[Guest]: itself allocates certain things entirely to the states. I think the real issue in India

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:38.200
[Guest]: is that we don't have really good devolution below the state level. And I mean, a state,

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:44.160
[Guest]: the largest state in the country is 200 million people. That's too large. I'm very much in

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:50.760
[Guest]: favor that we should multiply the number of states. If every state was kind of reduced

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:58.040
[Guest]: to maybe, if the largest state did not exceed 30 million, we would be a lot better off.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.000
[Guest]: And frankly, if you think about it, that's probably the only way of getting a lot of

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.020
[Guest]: cities developed. Because if you produce another 30 states, you'd have another 30 capitals.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:15.680
[Guest]: And automatically, a kind of energy would go towards developing these capitals. And

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.880
[Guest]: frankly, India needs, I mean, you know, in the next 30 years, urban population is going

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:28.120
[Guest]: to double. I mean, it's what most estimates suggest that from about 300 and something

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:36.920
[Guest]: million into 2011, the urban population will be 800 million by 2050. Now, this is going

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:45.120
[Guest]: to just to accommodate this, you need many, many more of our medium cities to become bigger

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:51.040
[Guest]: cities. And the best way of making them bigger cities is to create new states. We've created

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.280
[Guest]: a few, but you know, we could create many more.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I couldn't agree with you more. And just to underscore that point about the

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.120
[Amit Varma]: importance of local knowledge of governance being as local as possible. I did an episode

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.200
[Amit Varma]: with Abhinandan Sekhri, the journalist, and he was telling me about this experience where

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.960
[Amit Varma]: they went to some village in the northeast with a TV crew, they were shooting something

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.600
[Amit Varma]: and he asked the people there, okay, what do you really want from your government? What

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.580
[Amit Varma]: is the one thing you want? And, you know, somebody sitting in Delhi would imagine they

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.880
[Amit Varma]: want schools or they want hospitals or they want roads or whatever those kind of things.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.960
[Amit Varma]: And they said, we want a cinema theatre. And he said, Why do you want a cinema theatre?

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.040
[Amit Varma]: He said, because all the boys in this village, they have nothing to do in their spare time.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.320
[Amit Varma]: So they go to the nearby place nearby, near a city to watch movies. And the roads are

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.160
[Amit Varma]: so bad. And there are so many accidents that the mortality rate is too high and they keep

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.200
[Amit Varma]: dying. So we don't want them to go, we want a cinema theatre here. And there's such a

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.480
[Amit Varma]: profound insight, which you know, can only arise locally.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:57.120
[Guest]: I have a very nice story of a parallel kind. When the Soviet Union cracked up, in 91, all

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:04.720
[Guest]: these new republics were created. I was sent to some of the stans around our neighborhood,

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.080
[Guest]: because they'd become independent countries. And we had long relationships with the old

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:15.360
[Guest]: Soviet Union. So we wanted to let each one of these know that, listen, is there something

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.960
[Guest]: we can do for you? So I was told to tell them that, you know, maybe you want to send some

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:26.600
[Guest]: of your people to our banking training school, our diplomatic training school, all kinds

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.240
[Guest]: of things. And you know, the one thing that they all said was, you know, what would be

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.760
[Guest]: really good? Why don't you be more Indian movies, because they're incredibly popular.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:42.720
[Guest]: I mean, this was an extremely low cost thing to do. But I was struck that in places like

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:50.800
[Guest]: Turkmenistan, and so on, when I had gone to, I think some carpet weaving outfit, and there

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.640
[Guest]: was the person weaving a carpet, and they had a few of our film stars photos on the

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:08.080
[Guest]: looms. So Indian soft power was there. I think we have a very goods and manufacturing oriented

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:16.160
[Guest]: approach to life. But actually, services is becoming an extremely important part of the

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:23.040
[Guest]: economy. So entertainment is a very critical service. And I can well imagine that. And

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:29.440
[Guest]: mind you, this must have been before smartphones and so on. Because today, I mean, all these

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.480
[Guest]: kids who want to see movies, will see them on the smartphone through Netflix, and not

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:42.040
[Guest]: really go into a theater. So that's another factor, which you have to keep in mind.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.720
[Amit Varma]: Another sort of question, which comes up from what you were, you know, speaking about earlier

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:52.320
[Amit Varma]: about the nuances between poverty and inequality, like one point I often make is that inequality

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.800
[Amit Varma]: is a sort of a Western obsession. And what is a moral imperative in India is to focus

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.600
[Amit Varma]: on poverty. And, you know, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt wrote a book called on inequality,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:09.040
[Amit Varma]: where he pointed out that for him, it wasn't inequality so much per se, as what he called

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.520
[Amit Varma]: the doctrine of sufficiency, which is a moral responsibility of a state to make sure that

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:20.340
[Amit Varma]: each of his citizens has, you know, however you define it, a sufficient amount to sort

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:25.680
[Amit Varma]: of live a reasonable life. And you know, what the reform certainly did in India was that,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, my friend, Nitin Pai gives a figure that for every 1% growth in GDP, 2 million

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:36.160
[Amit Varma]: people came out of poverty, right? And that has such moral force to me, that is, you know,

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.160
[Guest]: just so much.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:45.280
[Guest]: There's no question that the removal of poverty is a should be a moral imperative. Because

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.380
[Guest]: the case for doing that is the belief that the society owes everybody a minimum standard

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:57.240
[Guest]: of living. And you should run your economy in such a way that nobody falls below it.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.040
[Guest]: But that doesn't mean that inequality is not important, because inequality is relevant,

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.880
[Guest]: if you want to bring in a concept of fairness. You know, you could have a situation, for

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.380
[Guest]: example, that on the poverty front, you're doing quite well. And every year, you're taking

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:19.800
[Guest]: more and more guys above the poverty line. But as you know, when 70% are below the poverty

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:25.600
[Guest]: line, that's the most important thing. Once you get maybe 20, maybe 15, I don't know what

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:31.280
[Guest]: is the number correct, it depends on what poverty line you use. But if 85% of the people

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:38.000
[Guest]: are above the poverty line, you cannot say that how these guys, the relative outcome

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.520
[Guest]: of these guys is of no importance, because it's of importance in terms of fairness. Now

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:54.560
[Guest]: remember, here too, see, inequality, static inequality is one thing. But in a statically

00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.920
[Guest]: unequal system, suppose you had a situation where everybody's kid sort of just gets stuck

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:07.480
[Guest]: in the same groove, and nobody improves. That's one thing. The other is there's a lot of churn.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:13.360
[Guest]: Many people lower down and kind of move up, and some guys higher up move down. Probably

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.480
[Guest]: people will regard the second as a little bit fairer. So I think the whole concept of

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:24.960
[Guest]: justice and fairness is actually very complex. And I think a society always tells you what's

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:30.400
[Guest]: bugging it. I mean, you may get hung up on poverty, and say, look, poverty is going down.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.840
[Guest]: So what's your problem? The fact is, in a democratic society, what people want will

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:43.380
[Guest]: manifest itself in their political demands. And as long as you're watching those and responding

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.440
[Guest]: to them, you won't go too wrong.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's, you know, one question I often ask people when I think about inequality and

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:55.000
[Amit Varma]: poverty is that where would you rather be poor today in the US or in Bangladesh? And

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
[Amit Varma]: of course, the answer is you'd rather be poor in the US, but the US is, you know, a far

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.520
[Amit Varma]: greater inequality than Bangladesh does, for example. So the dilemma here is that often

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.700
[Amit Varma]: these go in sort of different directions, that inequality may increase as poverty goes

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.320
[Amit Varma]: down, because everybody is getting better off, but at a different rate, where the people

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.160
[Amit Varma]: at the top are getting better off very fast, and people at the bottom are getting better

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:24.520
[Amit Varma]: off, but not quite as fast. So inequality kind of increases. And for a policy person,

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.920
[Amit Varma]: then that creates a dilemma, because there are trade offs involved. You know, on the

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:34.440
[Amit Varma]: one hand, like you say, there is a moral imperative that we have to do something about poverty.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.680
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, there is also the imperative that you might have political constituencies

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:44.800
[Amit Varma]: that are demanding, you know, different kinds of policies, and the two might often go in

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.160
[Amit Varma]: opposite directions. Like, it would seem to me that, and correct me if I'm wrong, that

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.220
[Amit Varma]: inequality probably went up after reforms, but I'd say poverty went down so much that,

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, that was your immediate sort of imperative. And then as you stabilize, like

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.440
[Amit Varma]: you said, and it, you know, you then start focusing on fairness within society and all

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:09.840
[Amit Varma]: that. But most of the popular demands that I see from electorates in India, are really

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:17.160
[Amit Varma]: not about inequality. It's more about different kinds of scarcities, like lack of jobs, or

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.080
[Guest]: poverty itself, and so on and so forth.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:24.120
[Guest]: Well, you know, these are ways in which the deficiencies surface. I mean, I would agree

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:30.640
[Guest]: with what you just said, that before the pandemic, it was probably true that poverty was going

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:36.880
[Guest]: down, no doubt about it. And inequality was probably increasing. This increase in inequality

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.840
[Guest]: is a pretty universal phenomenon around the world. So it's not just in India, it's been

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:47.840
[Guest]: happening elsewhere. And societies partly take care of it through taxation. I mean,

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.720
[Guest]: after all, taxation is a very powerful way of redistributing from the top to the bottom.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.640
[Guest]: And a lot of public programs are essentially financed by taxation. So you could argue that,

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.920
[Guest]: you know, we should use the taxation instrument a little bit more effectively, that is a legitimate

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:13.680
[Guest]: point. But you know, I think the the issue of what's happening above the poverty line,

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.860
[Guest]: I mean, a lot of the unhappiness today, again, around the world, is that there's an incredibly

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:25.720
[Guest]: faster growth in the top 1%. You know, in the old days, people used to talk about the

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:32.760
[Guest]: top 20%. What has happened is that, for a variety of reasons, the incomes and the wealth

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:40.360
[Guest]: of the top 1% have really shot up. And that is causing unhappiness everywhere. Now, you

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:46.960
[Guest]: know, how to respond to this in a sensible manner is an open question. What do you do?

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.240
[Amit Varma]: And you one can go into that.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:54.280
[Amit Varma]: Is some of it perhaps because of bad policy in the form of easy money, like I think about

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.360
[Amit Varma]: the Cantillon effect. And I'll just explain that for my listeners. And if I get it wrong,

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.200
[Amit Varma]: you can correct me because who better. But the Cantillon effect basically is that typically,

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:07.360
[Amit Varma]: you would imagine that say when a government prints money or money floods into the system,

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.760
[Amit Varma]: you're going to have inflation because the money supply goes up and the goods and services

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.560
[Amit Varma]: at that moment are the same. And therefore the price of everything goes up. But what

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:20.120
[Amit Varma]: the Cantillon effect does is that money doesn't percolate down to society at an equal rate.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:25.120
[Amit Varma]: It's people at the top who get hold of it and they benefit first, while people at the

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:30.160
[Amit Varma]: bottom are basically having their wealth sucked away because inflation after all, is a tax

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:36.000
[Amit Varma]: on the poor. And therefore, you know, this easy money would therefore explain what is

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.480
[Amit Varma]: happening in say, what has happened in the past, there's normal correction, of course

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.680
[Amit Varma]: happening, but what has happened in the past with stock markets where the economy does

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.840
[Amit Varma]: really badly, but the stock market is booming. And as you mentioned, people in the top 1%

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.960
[Amit Varma]: are making a lot of money, but nobody else is really seeing the benefit of the easy money

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:56.680
[Amit Varma]: coming in. And that is the kind of inequality I do worry about. And it's kind of caused

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.200
[Amit Varma]: by government policy by central banks taking the easy route.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:06.400
[Guest]: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, you know, for a long time, people used to think that monetary

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.680
[Guest]: expansion by the central banks, if it's not actually leading to inflation, shouldn't be

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:18.080
[Guest]: a cause of concern. In the United States, they worked out that inflation doesn't include

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:24.120
[Guest]: the inflation in asset prices. So it's commodity prices that are measured. If you have a huge

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.960
[Guest]: expansion of money and a credit system where actually it's only the rich that can access

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.760
[Guest]: this, and they put it all into assets, either real assets or financial assets, and assets

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:40.120
[Guest]: are only held by wealthy people, poor don't have assets, you can have a very big increase

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:47.280
[Guest]: in inequality suddenly taking place. And that I think what in the US, after the great financial

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:56.360
[Guest]: crash 2008, the real anger was that, you know, the economy was badly hit after the Lehman

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:02.560
[Guest]: brothers collapsed, output contracted, but the guys at the top were completely unaffected.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:10.100
[Guest]: And even Christine Lagarde, then I think managing director of the IMF commented that nobody

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:16.840
[Guest]: went to jail. And yet what was going on in the financial sector was gross mismanagement,

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:24.240
[Guest]: very often more than mismanagement, but wrong intentioned fiddling, and no one suffered.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:30.400
[Guest]: I think this has been a bit of a lesson. Anyway, it does show the other thing is that public

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:38.440
[Guest]: opinion now can be whipped up much easier than was the case earlier. So it's not just

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.400
[Guest]: that you're affected, but you're subjected to a great deal of social media messaging

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:51.280
[Guest]: on what's going wrong. So I mean, people have to be careful that the opinions of people

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:57.760
[Guest]: are now being driven by actors which earlier didn't have that much influence on opinion

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:04.420
[Amit Varma]: making. That's an extra factor. Yeah, like a friend of mine recently mentioned that he's

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:09.080
[Amit Varma]: never going to invest in crypto, as long as Elon Musk has the power to make prices go

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.980
[Amit Varma]: up and down with a single tweet, which kind of speaks to what you're saying about how

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:19.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, everybody's in the narrative battle game. Let's kind of, you know, go a little

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.060
[Amit Varma]: back in time, like, you know, one of the things that you mentioned, which I completely agree

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:29.240
[Amit Varma]: with about the need for greater urbanization is something that would have been frowned

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.940
[Amit Varma]: upon by economists maybe 30 years ago, or at least a sword that you would get in India.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:39.500
[Amit Varma]: And also, there was the notion here, and this is still a widely held notion that our population

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:44.260
[Amit Varma]: is a problem, where to me, you know, people's our brains, not stomachs. Population is our

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:49.500
[Amit Varma]: greatest resource. And throughout history, you know, people move from the history of

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:54.660
[Amit Varma]: humanity is a history of migration from places with less population density to more population

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.560
[Amit Varma]: density, from villages to towns and cities. And this, this notion of population being

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:04.720
[Amit Varma]: one of our problems strikes me as, you know, one of those little bits of conventional wisdom

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:09.820
[Amit Varma]: that we kind of grew up believing and that we can now reconsider and we sort of know

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:15.400
[Amit Varma]: it isn't true. So, you know, in your early years, when you're getting an education first

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.500
[Amit Varma]: at Stephens, and, you know, then at Oxford, and you're learning about economics and all

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:25.380
[Amit Varma]: that, how much do you think the economics you learned back then is at odds with what

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:30.860
[Amit Varma]: we know today? Because it's very easy in the benefit of hindsight, to judge the actions

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:35.900
[Amit Varma]: of people back then. But I think you have to also view the actions of people back then,

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:40.380
[Amit Varma]: in the light of what the available knowledge was, and what the available conventional wisdom

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.340
[Amit Varma]: was. So tell me a little bit about, you know, that sort of

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:49.060
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, there's no question that economic perspectives have changed. You know, some

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:54.860
[Guest]: basic things don't change, in the sense that if you want to grow, you got to have investment.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:46:00.660
[Guest]: But in those days, the only concern was investment. It was felt that the simplest way of having

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:06.580
[Guest]: investment is to expand the public sector, the government can get the resources and invest.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:12.020
[Guest]: There was very little concern that the government would be a very poor investor, and would not

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:19.580
[Guest]: be able to ensure efficiency. So what economists call the capital output ratio would rise,

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:23.580
[Guest]: so you could have more investment, but with a higher capital output ratio, you wouldn't

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:29.580
[Guest]: get more growth. So that was the, when I was in St. Stephen's College, this was not even

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:36.140
[Guest]: an issue. I mean, it was just assumed that, you know, growth, the Harrod-Domar model,

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:40.500
[Guest]: you want higher growth, you have more investment, the government is there to do the investment,

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:45.620
[Guest]: why do we want the private sector? Then I think over time, the fact that the private

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:52.180
[Guest]: sector was much more efficient, began to be realized. And so a kind of shift took place

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.900
[Guest]: in the rest of the world. Now, you know, in the rest of the world, the shift took place

00:46:55.900 --> 00:47:03.220
[Guest]: very early. I mean, in the 1980s, I think Reagan, Reagan in the US and Margaret Thatcher

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:08.600
[Guest]: in the United Kingdom kind of led this sort of anti-public sector, bring in the private

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:17.100
[Guest]: sector. We never did anything like that. But you know, in fact, we did it much more slowly.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:23.340
[Guest]: It's possible they did it too fast. Reagan's famous comment that the nine most dangerous

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:30.420
[Guest]: words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help. So created

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:36.140
[Guest]: an atmosphere in which the government is the problem, just shrink it. Now we, I never thought

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:40.540
[Guest]: that that was the right thing for India. I think the problem in India was that government

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:47.300
[Guest]: had to do more in certain areas, health, education, building infrastructure, especially rural

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:54.020
[Guest]: areas and so on. The government didn't have to do what it was otherwise trying to do.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:48:00.740
[Guest]: Even steel, for example, we wrongly, I think, call steel infrastructure. You know, my definition

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:07.220
[Guest]: of infrastructure is that which is not tradable. If it's tradable, it's not infrastructure.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:11.540
[Guest]: I mean, roads are infrastructure because you can't import roads. You want roads, you got

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:17.420
[Guest]: to build them. So you can, if you make that distinction that what you can't import is

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:23.020
[Guest]: infrastructure. In that case, since we're not next to any surplus electricity producing

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:28.180
[Guest]: nation, generation of power is infrastructure because if you don't generate it, you're not

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:33.020
[Guest]: going to be able to get it. But if you were a small country next to a very big country,

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:38.380
[Guest]: then electricity doesn't have to be infrastructure because you can buy it from a neighbor. Now,

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:44.260
[Guest]: I think we needed to redefine the role of government, not to scale it down. In fact,

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:51.700
[Guest]: by any metric, you know, like the size of total government expenditure to GDP, we are

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:58.900
[Guest]: too low. I mean, elsewhere in the world, people have social services, pensions, old age pension,

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:06.460
[Guest]: higher education, more research. A lot of the research that led to the U.S.'s dominance

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:12.020
[Guest]: in so many commercial areas was actually funded by the government, probably connected with

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:16.460
[Guest]: defense. So instead of doing these things, our government was building hotels. Now that's

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:22.260
[Guest]: just ridiculous. I mean, if somebody were to take a decision today to privatize every

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:27.180
[Guest]: single hotel owned by the government, I haven't the slightest doubt that the country would

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:32.500
[Guest]: be a lot better off. But if you said that publicly, you would not get much support.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:37.260
[Guest]: And I think the main reason you won't get support is that those employed in the public

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:45.020
[Guest]: sector somehow feel that privatization will make their jobs insecure. And I think we have

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:52.740
[Guest]: to address that question. I mean, if the thing becomes more efficient and therefore expands,

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:57.780
[Guest]: more jobs will be created. But it's quite possible that they'll expect you to do some

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:03.060
[Guest]: work and you won't be able to just kind of sleep on the job and have an easy time. So

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:08.220
[Guest]: that's kind of trade off that is necessary. I think those are the changes that we needed

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:14.260
[Guest]: to bring in. We did start it. I don't think we did enough. But, you know, I have no hesitation

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:20.640
[Guest]: in saying that in 91, the reforms that were brought about were late. We should have done

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:26.900
[Guest]: it in the mid 80s. As a matter of fact, Rajiv Gandhi said in Parliament, and I quote that

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:32.040
[Guest]: in my book, I mean, he said that, look, how can we be competitive with other countries

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:37.880
[Guest]: if we are running systems that are 20 years out of date? But the sad thing is he wasn't

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:44.460
[Guest]: able to change any system. All that happened was little incremental changes. The start

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:51.140
[Guest]: of systemic change happened in 91. Narsimha Rao as Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh as Finance

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:57.660
[Guest]: Minister. Even they didn't actually get done in the first three years, all that could have

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:03.780
[Guest]: been done. Again, because, you know, a country that has been fed for 40 years on a certain

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:10.220
[Guest]: approach to policy takes a long time to change. But the good news, I think, is that when other

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:15.440
[Guest]: governments came in, you know, the Narsimha Rao government was succeeded by the United

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:21.180
[Guest]: Front government, sort of a more left oriented government, but it had Chidambaram as the

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:29.080
[Guest]: Finance Minister, sort of an element of continuity. The Communist Party of India was a member

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:35.020
[Guest]: of the government. CPM was not, but CPI was. But still, they more or less continued the

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:41.500
[Guest]: same strategy of the previous government. When Mr. Vajpayee formed the NDA government,

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:46.420
[Guest]: there was concern, look, will they continue? Because they were critical of certain aspects

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:51.460
[Guest]: of the policy, not other aspects, but certain aspects. But actually, the Vajpayee government

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:57.420
[Guest]: also continued the same thrust. So from 91, right through the end of Vajpayee government,

00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:04.820
[Guest]: then you had the UPA, which had the same characters coming back, a long continuity of change,

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:10.460
[Guest]: in my view, in the right direction, but in my view, too slow. I mean, like what we did,

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:16.980
[Guest]: what we did over a period of 20 years, we should have done in 10 or 12. I'm not a believer

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.820
[Guest]: that we should have done it in one year or two years, but we should have done it twice

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:21.820
[Guest]: as fast.

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:26.020
[Amit Varma]: I love the way you, you know, mentioned UPA and said, which had the same characters coming

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.300
[Amit Varma]: up because you were one of those characters as well.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:35.180
[Guest]: I was continuous. In the UPA, I had a, I had a political appointment, although I, I'm not

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:41.780
[Guest]: a politician. So I used to sit in the cabinet and observe coalition, balancing off different

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.940
[Guest]: parties and different interests and so on.

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:48.620
[Amit Varma]: So we'll talk about all this in detail. And I also want to continue talking about your

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.500
[Amit Varma]: life story, but I'll take a digression. But before I take a digression, you know, you

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.540
[Amit Varma]: were speaking of about Rajiv Gandhi wanting to modernize and there's a lovely anecdote

00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:01.340
[Amit Varma]: in your book about which is almost like a metaphor for this, where you speak about how

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:05.820
[Amit Varma]: Madhavrao Shindia came to him to make a presentation. And there were a lot of numbers involved,

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:09.940
[Amit Varma]: you know, he wanted to play around with the numbers and see what effect it would have.

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.740
[Amit Varma]: So he said, why don't you just get me a spreadsheet, right? And as you point out, this is three

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:17.580
[Amit Varma]: years after Lotus Notes has been released and all that. And the next day, Mr. Shindia

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:21.660
[Amit Varma]: and all the bureaucrats come with these actual physical spreadsheets and Rajiv is like, what

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:27.180
[Amit Varma]: is this? And that almost seems in a sense, metaphorical. I want to take a digression

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:33.020
[Amit Varma]: into talking about the state itself for a moment. Like there are two frames that I find

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:37.940
[Amit Varma]: useful when I think about the state. One is Francis Fukuyama's frame of thinking about

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:44.980
[Amit Varma]: the scope and the strength of the state, where my argument would be that in terms of scope,

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:48.940
[Amit Varma]: the Indian state is far bigger than it should be in the sense that it does a lot of things

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:55.620
[Amit Varma]: it should not like you pointed out, from running hotels to, you know, making sex toys and condoms,

00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:00.140
[Amit Varma]: it was a company for that as well. But leaving that aside, the scope is much larger than

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:05.280
[Amit Varma]: it should be. But the strength is much lower than it should be. So it does a lot of things

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.740
[Amit Varma]: and it does them very badly. While what it should do is it should do a few things like

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:13.500
[Amit Varma]: the ones that you mentioned, you know, rule of law, public goods, all of those things

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:18.140
[Amit Varma]: and do them well. And we have this mismatch where both in terms of scope and strength,

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:23.540
[Amit Varma]: we've kind of got it completely wrong. The other frame that I find useful is James Buchanan's

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:28.740
[Amit Varma]: public choice theory framework, where a state on the one hand is supposed to be protective

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:34.380
[Amit Varma]: and productive. But the natural tendency of a state because of the incentives of the people

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.780
[Amit Varma]: within a state to accumulate power can take it to a point where it becomes predatory.

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:44.380
[Amit Varma]: And you know, predatory to me defines the Indian state much better than the other terms

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:49.660
[Amit Varma]: do when most common people on the street will kind of tell you that as well. And so one,

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:55.620
[Amit Varma]: what do you think of these frameworks? And two, my sense also is that most common people

00:54:55.620 --> 00:55:00.580
[Amit Varma]: when they think of the state, they are apathetic to it, they know it is dysfunctional. They

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:06.260
[Amit Varma]: know it is, you know, they know that it's wrong at so many levels. But they also feel

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:11.980
[Amit Varma]: that abhi toh kuch nahi badlega, apna dekho, you know, and that again itself becomes an

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:16.580
[Amit Varma]: impediment to fundamental change, because fundamental change will only happen when there

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.500
[Amit Varma]: is a demand for it. And if people are apathetic, there won't be a demand for it.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:26.780
[Guest]: No, I think this is absolutely correct. Look at education. One view is that people don't

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:32.780
[Guest]: care about education, but that's not actually true. I mean, even the poorest person scrounges

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:39.260
[Guest]: around in order to get a good education for their kids. They need not spend that much

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:44.860
[Guest]: money if they could make sure that the government provides good education. I think some of those

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:50.020
[Guest]: messages are now coming across, but it's very late in the day. You have to remember that

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:58.500
[Guest]: when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru made his twist with destiny speech in 1947, that's 75 years

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:03.820
[Guest]: ago, more or less, the phrase he used, what are the things we should do? And he talked

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:10.660
[Guest]: about the age old burden of ignorance, poverty and disease. So poverty, of course, we've

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.760
[Guest]: been trying to do, and I think we've done something about it. But you know, ignorance

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:20.260
[Guest]: and disease, these are the, that's health, I mean, education and health. These are things

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:26.820
[Guest]: that the state by now, I mean, if the Indian state had done half as good a job on education

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:33.620
[Guest]: and disease, as it has in many other areas, we would be in much better shape. But it hasn't.

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:40.220
[Guest]: Now why is that? One answer, by the way, is that theoretically, neither of these is controlled

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:45.140
[Guest]: by the center. They're actually controlled by the states. I think part of the problem

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:53.060
[Guest]: is that politics at the state level does not subject the politicians to a kind of performance

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:59.060
[Guest]: accounting in those areas that are squarely in their hands. And I think we need to think

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:05.580
[Guest]: why, but the solution really is better education. I mean, if people are scrounging from their

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:11.060
[Guest]: meager budgets to send kids to private schools, in the belief that private schools are actually

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:15.820
[Guest]: better, they may not be, but that's the belief, then why don't the same people say, look,

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:21.460
[Guest]: make the public schools that much better. Very often, it's connected with bad systemic

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:28.180
[Guest]: choices. I mean, for example, for many years, in many states, state governments would not

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:34.500
[Guest]: allow English to be taught at a young enough age in school. And yet most people felt that

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:41.420
[Guest]: if you want to become employable, facility in English is helpful. Now, many people felt

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:46.420
[Guest]: that there were contradictions in state behavior. The local politicians will be sending their

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:52.300
[Guest]: kids to private schools, where they'd be learning English. But for the armed junta, they're

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.940
[Guest]: enforcing a completely different system. Now that has changed. I mean, state governments

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:02.460
[Guest]: now have changed so that kids are learning English at a much earlier age. But you know,

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:13.780
[Guest]: I think this requires, there's no substitute to states simply deciding, a, the public deciding

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:20.700
[Guest]: that look, we're going to judge you by what you do in this area. And states also, politicians

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:26.980
[Guest]: deciding that they're going to give this top priority. And that hasn't, it is beginning

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.540
[Guest]: to happen, I believe, in some states, hasn't happened enough.

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:34.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, that point you make about the poorest of the poor sending their kids to

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:39.100
[Amit Varma]: private schools is one I keep making repeatedly, because people have this impression of private

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.020
[Amit Varma]: schools that it's all, it's for the richie richies. It's like DPS Mathura, where you

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:47.980
[Amit Varma]: went and that's sort of the stereotype. But the truth is that, you know, studies have

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:53.020
[Amit Varma]: found in Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, that the poorest of people, people who live in slums,

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:57.580
[Amit Varma]: auto drivers, domestic help, they would, instead of sending their kids to a free government

00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:02.500
[Amit Varma]: school, they'd rather spend money that to them is a lot, but in absolute terms is not

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:06.220
[Amit Varma]: that much to send their kid to a budget private school, which is operating outside the ambit

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:10.580
[Amit Varma]: of the law and very often is illegal if you look at the kind of regulations on it, which

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:15.100
[Amit Varma]: is where the whole school choice movement comes from, which argues that, you know, instead

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:19.660
[Amit Varma]: of spending our money on schools, we should give school vouchers to parents so they can

00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:24.380
[Amit Varma]: choose the school that kid goes to because who better than a parent to decide. And that

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:29.900
[Amit Varma]: at least puts the incentives in the right place that only the schools that provide quality

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:34.780
[Amit Varma]: can sort of survive. I had a long episode on education with the economist Karthik Mulyadharan,

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:38.620
[Amit Varma]: where one of the things he did point out was that you're right that private schools aren't

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:43.620
[Amit Varma]: necessarily better off in terms of quality of education is pretty much the same as studies

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:48.540
[Amit Varma]: seem to show, but they provide far more bang for the buck. And there's just a lot more

00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:54.580
[Amit Varma]: money getting wasted per student in government schools. And people, you know, and poor parents

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:59.580
[Amit Varma]: just choose to spend money and vote with their feet. You know, a final sort of follow up

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:05.900
[Amit Varma]: question on the nature of the state in that case, that, you know, when it comes to say,

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:11.620
[Amit Varma]: changing economic policies and all the profound ways that you did, part of it in 91 was that

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:17.540
[Amit Varma]: there was a crisis, some of it you've termed as reformed by stealth. And, you know, and

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:22.540
[Amit Varma]: there was some gradualism also happening there. And we'll discuss all of those concepts later

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:28.420
[Amit Varma]: also. But now in hindsight, it seems almost like low hanging fruit when compared to the

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:33.780
[Amit Varma]: massive task of transforming the Indian state to reduce his scope and to increase his strength

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:39.700
[Amit Varma]: in the things that it should do. So, you know, you've been part of the state for, you know,

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.900
[Amit Varma]: years, you know, what is your sense of the enormity of the problem? And is it even possible

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:48.900
[Amit Varma]: when the incentives of the people in power will always be to not, you know, give give

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:54.460
[Guest]: any of it away? Well, you know, that's a good question. I mean, first point I want to make

01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:01.980
[Guest]: is that many of my structuralist friends, when we started the liberalization, said that

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.900
[Guest]: there's no way this is going to succeed, because these ministries will never give up power.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:13.380
[Guest]: But that's not what happened in 1991. I mean, we just got rid of import licensing big time.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:17.300
[Guest]: And that was a huge amount of power in the Ministry of Commerce. And it was the ministry

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:24.220
[Guest]: itself that was willing to do that. Now, I think the intellectual atmosphere was such

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:30.300
[Guest]: that and we were in the middle of a crisis that faced with the crisis, the technocracy

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:36.260
[Guest]: at the time, and it's not just me, this would not have happened if we didn't have at least

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:42.380
[Guest]: five or six key players at different levels of seniority, who more or less were convinced

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:49.020
[Guest]: that this needs to be done. And it did lead to a change. So I remain of the view that

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:55.980
[Guest]: if you zero in on the key things, and you can't change the state in every dimension,

01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:00.220
[Guest]: but if you know that for the next 10 years, this is what we're going to concentrate on,

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:06.900
[Guest]: I think you can. Now, to do that, by the way, at the political level, there has to be a

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:14.060
[Guest]: comparable perception that this is the important thing to do. And if you look at health and

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:19.140
[Guest]: education, these are not central government subjects, these are state government subjects.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:25.980
[Guest]: So it's only if political heavyweights are put in charge of education and health, and

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:32.940
[Guest]: driven to perform by a chief minister who highlights these areas as the areas by which

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:39.740
[Guest]: he's going to be judged, and a political process that encourages the electorate to say, look,

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:44.540
[Guest]: these are worthwhile things to do, and we're going to do them. I don't think it's not possible.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:50.300
[Guest]: It is possible. But I think we have to recognize that it won't happen in every dimension. That's

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:56.180
[Guest]: why we need to, in the 91 reforms, there were two or three things that we zeroed in on.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:01.620
[Guest]: We want to move to a flexible exchange rate, get rid of import controls, and get rid of

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:06.700
[Guest]: industrial licensing, and open up to foreign direct investment. Now, this foreign direct

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.140
[Guest]: investment took a long time, because there was a lot of hesitation. But the other things

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:17.220
[Guest]: were done very quickly. So similarly, I think we ought to prioritize what we want, and put

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:22.220
[Guest]: it at the center of the political agenda. The problem is most of the crises that we

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:34.100
[Guest]: have, people do not link those crises to fixing these areas. I mean, nobody thinks, for example,

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:40.500
[Guest]: that if we can get a much better educational structure in place, much better educational

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:47.300
[Guest]: outcomes, then with everything else, growth rate will be higher, and employment will be

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:51.940
[Guest]: higher. On the other hand, the demand is give us jobs, which usually means either you do

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:57.260
[Guest]: some reservation, or you announce some government jobs. Nobody says, look, we need to improve

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:03.060
[Guest]: the quality of education. And I think there's a there's a bit of a lag lag there, which

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.740
[Guest]: we need to somehow overcome.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:10.500
[Amit Varma]: So many aspects I'd like to double click on. And the first of them is about 91 itself.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:16.020
[Amit Varma]: Like, I've done an episode in the 91 reforms with Shruti Rajgopalan and Ajay Shah. I spoke

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:21.100
[Amit Varma]: with Vinay Sitapati recently on his book on Narasimha Rao. You know, I've, you know, read

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:25.700
[Amit Varma]: the different books on that period, including your wonderful book. And what it strikes me

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:32.220
[Amit Varma]: is that there is a series of happy accidents happening there in terms of this confluence

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.900
[Amit Varma]: of remarkable policy minds and economists who happen to be coming together, and who

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.460
[Amit Varma]: happen to be building the groundwork for this to happen right from Rakesh Mohan writing

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:47.100
[Amit Varma]: a note in 86, your M document in 1990, people like Amarnath Verma, and, you know, Naresh

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.580
[Amit Varma]: Chandra, and later Ashok Desai joining the cabinet, you know, you being in the right

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.940
[Amit Varma]: the right place where you're in the Commerce Ministry to begin with, with Mr. Chidambaram,

01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:00.660
[Amit Varma]: and then you shifted to the Finance Ministry. And even at a political level, you know, Narasimha

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:07.220
[Amit Varma]: Rao getting the job instead of say, other contenders like an ND Tiwari or any pick any

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:11.380
[Amit Varma]: compromise candidate like that. And you know, one of the things that Vinay Sitapati told

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:15.380
[Amit Varma]: me, you know, reveals in his book and talks about is that Pranab Mukherjee was angling

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:19.900
[Amit Varma]: for the post of Finance Minister, because he had supported Narasimha Rao for the presidentship

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:26.500
[Amit Varma]: of the Congress Party after Mr. Gandhi's assassination. And somehow, because of the cabinet note that

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:32.460
[Amit Varma]: he got from Naresh Chandra, you know, off the bat, Mr. Rao realized that this is a crisis.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.260
[Amit Varma]: And this is not a time to mess around, we need the right people for the job. And he

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:40.980
[Amit Varma]: initially offered the Finance Ministry to IG Patel, who was in at LSE, and he said no,

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.020
[Amit Varma]: and then he offered it to Manmohan. And then this remarkable team comes together. And all

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:50.580
[Amit Varma]: of this happens. So the question here is that, you know, in hindsight, what has happened

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.820
[Amit Varma]: seems inevitable. But to me, it seems like like, my God, we are so lucky that this and

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:59.340
[Amit Varma]: I'm not trying to flatter you. But just in terms of where my own life is, I feel lucky

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:04.140
[Amit Varma]: that this group of people was there at the right time at the right place. Is there a

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:10.940
[Amit Varma]: counterfactual to this, where, you know, you change just one figure in all of this, and

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:14.020
[Amit Varma]: like dominoes, it just doesn't kind of work out?

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:20.620
[Guest]: That's a good question. I mean, look, I agree with you that I think Narasimha Rao understood,

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:28.060
[Guest]: he was not so wedded to the by then frayed, old Congress kind of perception of ideology.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:33.340
[Guest]: Pranam Mukherjee was much more firmly in that camp. Narasimha Rao, no, I think he was aware

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:38.900
[Guest]: of what was happening in the world. I think we are fortunate that he chose a finance minister,

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:44.940
[Guest]: who probably had more credibility internationally than anyone else could, and who had thought

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:50.980
[Guest]: about these things and was also aware that big changes are needed. Given the finance

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:58.840
[Guest]: minister and the close relationship between the prime minister and the finance minister,

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:04.760
[Guest]: the team that was then put together, you can credit it to Manmohan himself, they're always

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:10.660
[Guest]: good people in the system. I mean, if a message went around that, look, we want the kind of

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:16.420
[Guest]: guys who will help us do A rather than B. But you've got to be clear that it is A rather

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:22.100
[Guest]: than B. Just a broad statement of we want some good people doesn't help. That part is

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:30.940
[Guest]: not difficult. But yes, how do you get a political outcome where the two or three key people

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:39.620
[Guest]: at the political top pointed firmly in a particular direction? I agree that the crisis concentrates

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:48.460
[Guest]: the mind very substantially. And I think both Narsimha Rao and Manmohan Singh had to show

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:54.180
[Guest]: that whatever they were doing, was bringing the crisis under control, which they did.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:08:00.220
[Guest]: But I don't think it was just controlling the crisis that constituted the reform. The

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:06.100
[Guest]: lucky thing is that they, they saw this as an opportunity, both to bring the crisis under

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:11.060
[Guest]: control and to bring about economic reforms, which would change the longer term growth

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:15.980
[Guest]: process. I mean, the crisis would have been brought under control, even if the reforms

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:21.220
[Guest]: hadn't happened. So I think crisis itself, but it was a, it was an opportunity to bring

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:26.380
[Guest]: in something. We need to, we need situations like that. But you know, in the end, what

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:33.140
[Guest]: it really means is that governments have to be very clear that their performance is going

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:41.340
[Guest]: to be judged on the basis of performance in key areas. And as long as that is known, they

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:45.980
[Guest]: will know whether they're performing well or not performing well. I mean, you can fudge

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:49.820
[Guest]: things here and there, but not for too long.

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.380
[Amit Varma]: So three things I want to double click on. And one of them is this, my good friend Ajay

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:59.180
[Amit Varma]: Shah, who's been on the show many times, and you obviously know him, has lamented to me

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:03.740
[Amit Varma]: that back in those days, the late 80s and 90s, all the way through, you know, you talk

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.180
[Amit Varma]: about the continuity through government. So all the way through the end of Vajpayee's

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:13.580
[Amit Varma]: regime, then all the way through UPA, you had this cadre of people who believed in reforms

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:17.540
[Amit Varma]: and good economics and good policy, who were sincere, who were kind of working hard. And

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:23.020
[Amit Varma]: his sense is that in a sense, that is, I don't know what's the right word for it, perhaps,

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:27.260
[Amit Varma]: that's gotten dissipated away, that he worries that, you know, you mentioned that there are

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.900
[Amit Varma]: always a few good people in the system. And his worry is that there may not be that many

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:36.860
[Amit Varma]: good people in the system anymore, people just think differently, and so on and so forth,

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:42.100
[Amit Varma]: that there is that tradition that comes down from people like yourself and Vijay Kelkar,

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:47.300
[Amit Varma]: who co-wrote that book with Ajay. And that tradition is kind of dying out. And that's

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.300
[Amit Varma]: sort of...

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:53.660
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, it's always nice to think that one's period was the best. And you know, you

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:59.460
[Guest]: shouldn't even mind thinking that. But I would make one or two other points. One is, it was

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:07.460
[Guest]: relatively easy for us, given the state of play at that time. What was conventional wisdom?

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:13.660
[Guest]: At that time, it was very clear. That's not so today. Because let's face it, if you read

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:19.820
[Guest]: almost anything, people are bemoaning the fact that the old consensus appears to have

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:26.620
[Guest]: frayed, de-globalization, the economists call it slobalization. We're not in a world at

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:33.100
[Guest]: the moment where it's very clear what is the right way to go. This makes it more challenging.

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:38.860
[Guest]: This means that in a way, you need to look at what's happening and then decide what is

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:46.220
[Guest]: it that you want to do. I mean, take an extreme case. Many people are beginning to think that

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:55.100
[Guest]: maybe since the rest of the world is fracturing, India should not be pursuing an open strategy.

01:10:55.100 --> 01:11:00.020
[Guest]: And maybe if the United States is kind of shrinking, maybe we should also shrink. You

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:05.080
[Guest]: can argue against that, by the way. I mean, we are pretty small potatoes when it comes

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:12.180
[Guest]: to the global economy. You could argue that in a world which is fracturing, and in which

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:19.860
[Guest]: the big powers seem to be looking inwards, we may well have an opportunity to cash in,

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:24.700
[Guest]: because although they are looking inwards, none of them is going completely isolated.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:31.780
[Guest]: In a world where China is somehow being shunned, and people are suspicious of China, it creates

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:37.700
[Guest]: a space for us. Because people are ultimately going, it's not that people are going to sort

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:43.060
[Guest]: of reject China, as a lot of people say, it's going to be China plus one. In other words,

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:48.860
[Guest]: they want to balance off the risks. Don't just put all your eggs in one basket, have

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:53.580
[Guest]: another one. India could be another one. So you've got to be clear, what is the strategy

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:59.980
[Guest]: you're following? If the lesson you learn is that the rest of the world is shrinking,

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:04.740
[Guest]: therefore, we should shrink, then you go in one direction. If the lesson you learn is

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:10.380
[Guest]: the rest of the world is shrinking, and is doing it in a manner which creates opportunities

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:15.980
[Guest]: for us, we should not be doing that. But we should be seeing how we can integrate with

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:21.500
[Guest]: whichever part of the world it's easier to integrate with. I would certainly say that

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:29.020
[Guest]: that should be our approach. But this is a strategic choice. In 1991, that choice was

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:36.100
[Guest]: very clear. Because the Soviet Union collapsed, all the inward looking stuff wasn't working.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.180
[Guest]: And there was only one way to go. I personally think we should still remain open. But I think

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:48.140
[Guest]: we have to build an adequate understanding because there are people who say this is just

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:52.780
[Guest]: the old stuff. You're parroting and it's no longer valid.

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:57.780
[Amit Varma]: So my the second of those three questions kind of comes from what you just said that

01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:04.100
[Amit Varma]: in terms of that now it's still a live debate, it's no longer so obvious which direction

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.900
[Amit Varma]: should we go in, though I completely agree with you, I am all for openness and free trade

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:14.060
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. But the question here is this that earlier you spoke about how politicians

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:19.180
[Amit Varma]: should be clear that they will be judged on their performance in certain areas. But I

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:23.940
[Amit Varma]: would argue that if you look at the model, if you look at the current times, that that

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:29.180
[Amit Varma]: link between governance and accountability has broken down in the sense that politicians

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:33.820
[Amit Varma]: seem to have realized and perhaps this was true all along to some extent or the other,

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:39.220
[Amit Varma]: that you know, that governance and electability are two completely different things that the

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:45.140
[Amit Varma]: whole game today seems to be a battle of narratives, that governance doesn't really matter so much

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.620
[Amit Varma]: people are apathetic anyway, it's a question of what narratives can you build and in what

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:54.940
[Amit Varma]: direction you can take them. And when you ally this with the notion that a politician's

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:59.980
[Amit Varma]: imperative is not necessarily to do a deep seated reform that will help the country 15

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:05.420
[Amit Varma]: years later, but to do because his election cycle is five years or in the case of parties

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:10.380
[Amit Varma]: as always some election or the other around the corner. So their incentives are really

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:15.380
[Amit Varma]: to do things which are short term and visible, and maybe band aids at best and not fundamental

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:21.060
[Amit Varma]: reform. The classic example being that now it's become the rigor for parties to offer

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:26.540
[Amit Varma]: farm loan waivers in elections. And in times of deep distress, farm loan waivers may be

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:32.180
[Amit Varma]: a necessary anesthetic, but they are nowhere close to the sort of structural reforms we

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:35.620
[Amit Varma]: actually need and which you've written about so much in your book as well as one of those

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:41.860
[Amit Varma]: areas where we which was much harder to tackle than the other areas. So given political incentives

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:46.100
[Amit Varma]: and from these political incentives would then come the incentives of the bureaucrats

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:50.860
[Amit Varma]: and the policy people within an administration. Because today, what seems to be happening

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:56.660
[Amit Varma]: is that you have a situation where our current Prime Minister has closed himself off to any

01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:01.420
[Amit Varma]: criticism. And therefore people, the people he's gathered around him are people who will

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:07.540
[Amit Varma]: only tell him what he wants to hear. And what he wants to hear will be extremely limited,

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:12.580
[Amit Varma]: because his worldview itself is so limited. I don't want to put you into a situation to

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:17.060
[Amit Varma]: have to comment on politics, because I don't want to, you know, go into that awkward space.

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:21.900
[Amit Varma]: But just in terms of structurally how it works out, if you look at the incentives of everyone,

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:26.220
[Amit Varma]: suddenly there seem to be no incentives to actually do the kind of deep rooted reforms

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:30.940
[Amit Varma]: that are still left. And to, you know, to orient India in these directions that you

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:36.580
[Amit Varma]: mentioned towards openness towards continuing with globalization, and so on and so forth.

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.060
[Amit Varma]: So what's your sense of this?

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:42.780
[Guest]: Well, of course, I don't know. I don't know what the situation is like inside government

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:48.860
[Guest]: now. But you know, I, I mean, I would not say I wouldn't, I agree with you, by the way,

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:54.900
[Guest]: that all over the world, the political battle is now being fought on competing narratives.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:16:00.460
[Guest]: That's fine. But the competing narratives are not anchored on economic performance,

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:04.860
[Guest]: not just in India, but everywhere. And I think we just have to live with that. But I firmly

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.580
[Guest]: believe that in a country like India, you cannot divorce yourself from the economic

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:15.180
[Guest]: narrative. I mean, whatever narrative you spin, if the economics doesn't live up to

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:20.540
[Guest]: it, I don't think that'll work. Nor is the government actually saying that. I mean, for

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:27.700
[Guest]: example, they're talking about, you know, we are going to have doubling, tripling the

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:34.700
[Guest]: GDP, reaching 5 trillion, 10 trillion. Now, sooner or later, somebody is going to ask,

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:40.060
[Guest]: is it happening? And I think if you set your mind to asking that question, somebody must

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:43.940
[Guest]: be saying, look, this is an important part of our narrative, so we better do something

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:52.800
[Guest]: about it. In many areas, for example, there is a very strong assertion that we're going

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.860
[Guest]: to do different things. I mean, for example, on privatization, the official position is

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:03.780
[Guest]: that we are going to privatize a few banks. Well, I mean, they've got delayed. Are they

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:09.020
[Guest]: going to be just completely forgotten? Will something happen? We have to wait and see.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:16.820
[Guest]: So I see around the big narratives, many economic, if you like, touch points, which somehow or

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:22.460
[Guest]: the other, I think the political system will have to refer to saying, look, we said we'll

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:27.260
[Guest]: do this and we've done it. And I think if you do that, then sooner or later, they'll

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:30.220
[Guest]: have to work out how to get it done.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:37.020
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode a few months ago with Shivam Shankar Singh, who worked in the BJP for a

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:41.620
[Amit Varma]: while and then left and wrote a book about campaign politics and all that. And he told

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:45.860
[Amit Varma]: me and he also, you know, worked with Prashant Kishore in the election of Amarinder Singh.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:50.180
[Amit Varma]: So he's worked across parties. But he told me about when he decided to leave the BJP.

01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:54.740
[Amit Varma]: And he said it was the day sometimes well before the 2019 election. So I'm guessing

01:17:54.740 --> 01:18:01.460
[Amit Varma]: it must be 2018 or 2017, where he realized that the plank of the party was going to be

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:06.740
[Amit Varma]: about divisiveness, about social issues, rather than economics. And when he asked why he was

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:12.460
[Amit Varma]: told that, listen, we made a bunch of promises in 2014. We did that on economics. If we now

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:16.220
[Amit Varma]: continue with economics, they will ask us what happened to all those promises. So we

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:20.420
[Amit Varma]: are going to turn away from that. And we are going to instead turn away and talk about

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.140
[Amit Varma]: Mandir, for example, and talk about those kinds of social issues, not literally Mandir,

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:30.940
[Amit Varma]: but you know, I'm using it as a metaphor in turn away towards that, and use that instead.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:36.580
[Amit Varma]: And my sense is that it's, it's not that hard to do that, like after demonetization happened,

01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.900
[Amit Varma]: which I think was the largest assault on property rights in human history, when you see the

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:45.900
[Amit Varma]: number of people who got affected, and I thought they will get hammered in UP, but they won

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:50.820
[Amit Varma]: comprehensively. And part of it, of course, could be from the schadenfreude that people

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:55.020
[Amit Varma]: felt that, you know, others better off the ladder, their perception was that they have

01:18:55.020 --> 01:19:01.300
[Amit Varma]: also suffered, though that was not so much the case. But I'm a little sort of skeptical

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:06.700
[Amit Varma]: about how much economics is really a part of people's consciousness in this aspect.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:11.660
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you you pointed out in your book about how, when you were in the US working for the

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:17.620
[Amit Varma]: IMF around 2003 2004, when that election came about, from a distance, it seemed to you that

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:22.460
[Amit Varma]: the India shining campaign would work. And and then it didn't. And and and the watch

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:26.260
[Amit Varma]: by government, like you pointed out, there was a solid continuity on economics, they

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:31.060
[Amit Varma]: did good things. You know, it was a reformist government, they made progress, we were moving

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:36.900
[Amit Varma]: forward, and yet they lost. So it didn't help them in the election. So what's, you know,

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:43.140
[Guest]: well, I mean, you know, obviously, as an economist, I like to think that somehow or the other

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:49.500
[Guest]: politics will ultimately come around to recognizing that whatever narrative you want to spin,

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:54.540
[Guest]: you can spin that narrative better, if it's on the strength of good economic performance,

01:19:54.540 --> 01:20:00.420
[Guest]: rather than bad economic performance. And you know, for a country of our scale and size,

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:07.220
[Guest]: I remain of the view that the narrative will matter. And therefore moving ahead, people

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:13.180
[Guest]: will look at that look, the biggest thing right now, I guess, inflation is a huge problem

01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:18.820
[Guest]: currently, I'm sure that people are not thinking that inflation doesn't matter, we'll just

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:25.060
[Guest]: spin a narrative. I think longer term employment is a big problem. We're not getting nearly

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:32.140
[Guest]: the kind of employment growth that we would like to have. Now, I don't know, most people

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:38.420
[Guest]: would say that if we can achieve the kind of growth rate, which the government is currently

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:43.300
[Guest]: talking about for the current year, and maybe the year after, it will reflect itself in

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:48.940
[Guest]: the employment situation. And if that happens, they'll be able to spin that as a narrative.

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:54.460
[Guest]: Now, this makes it important to get that kind of growth. I mean, if we don't get that kind

01:20:54.460 --> 01:21:00.140
[Guest]: of growth, there's no way that the employment situation can be spun out at all. It's possible

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:08.020
[Guest]: that economic deterioration doesn't occupy the center stage of political debate. Because

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:13.700
[Guest]: if economics is not going well, you can always debate something else. But as the underpinning

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:19.860
[Guest]: of what determines the way politics moves, being an economist, I like to think that economics

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.780
[Guest]: matters. And I would therefore think that any government, whatever narrative they want

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:30.900
[Guest]: to spin, would be aware that it's a lot easier to spin that narrative if you've got a solid

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:36.780
[Guest]: economic story to tell. And they are telling that story. So it's not as if economic stories

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:42.060
[Guest]: are being forgotten. It's just that we have to wait and see what they look like a year

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:45.340
[Guest]: from now, or maybe two years from now.

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:52.100
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough. I guess, you know, where you sit, you can see the longer span of history.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:56.740
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes it's easy to kind of get into the current moment and feel disheartened or depressed

01:21:56.740 --> 01:22:01.220
[Amit Varma]: at the way things are. But I guess if you just take a few steps back, and you see the

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:05.660
[Amit Varma]: longer arc, then perhaps there's reason for hope. Let's take a quick commercial break.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:10.060
[Amit Varma]: And at the other end of the break, we'll continue chatting. And I want to go back to your fascinating

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:17.580
[Amit Varma]: life story and to the teenage Montek Singhaluwali, if I may.

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:22.500
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:28.220
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009, and

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:32.860
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:38.500
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day, and was forced

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.980
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:48.140
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:55.540
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com,

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:25.420
[Amit Varma]: India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you. Welcome back to the scene in the

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:31.180
[Amit Varma]: unseen. I'm chatting with Montek Singh Aluwalia. And we're going back now to the 1960s. And

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:37.260
[Amit Varma]: to your time in Stephens, which was very interesting because you know, one has a public image of

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:44.140
[Amit Varma]: you as someone who's a serious, stern economist, and so on and so forth. And at Stephens, you

01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:48.740
[Amit Varma]: are just doing so much like on the one hand, you've pointed out about how you know, right

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:52.540
[Amit Varma]: from the time you, you know, you were in DPS, you were doing really well in studies and

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:58.340
[Amit Varma]: how that kind of came from your dad, the importance and you must have, you know, imbibed by osmosis.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:02.940
[Amit Varma]: But you're also very active in extracurricular activities, you're debating in Delhi quite

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:07.420
[Amit Varma]: actively, you later, you know, continued in Oxford and became part of the debating club

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:12.540
[Amit Varma]: there. And you described the two magazines in Stephens, and one is a Stephanian, which

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:17.260
[Amit Varma]: you describe as, quote, ponderous and somewhat pretentious, stop quote, but the one that

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:20.940
[Amit Varma]: you enjoyed, you edited both, but the one that you enjoyed working with was one called

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:25.820
[Amit Varma]: cooler talk and the cooler with a K. And remember, this is the 1960s. So it's such a cool name,

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:30.780
[Amit Varma]: especially back then, where you write cool quote, cooler talk had a snappy style and

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:35.500
[Amit Varma]: carried short pieces on current student life and events with irreverent comments on prominent

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.900
[Amit Varma]: students. We were careful to steer clear of criticizing the college authorities, but disparaging

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:45.700
[Amit Varma]: remarks about the food were tolerated, stop quote, and so on and so forth. So paint me

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:50.100
[Amit Varma]: a picture of, you know, who the young one take is at that time that on the one hand,

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:55.460
[Amit Varma]: it seems that he's a party person. And he's like doing all of these things. He's debating,

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:59.860
[Amit Varma]: he's running magazine, he's taking the mickey out of people. And at the same time, doing

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:04.700
[Amit Varma]: exceptionally well in studies, to the point that you eventually just get the Rhodes Scholarship.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:09.620
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, your academic life, if one looks at it is just absolutely stellar. So tell

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:13.580
[Amit Varma]: me a little bit about that. What kind of person are you? What's what's having fun for you

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:19.580
[Amit Varma]: in those days? Like today, a modern kid, you'll have your own idea of fun. But what do you

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:24.060
[Amit Varma]: actually do? What is the texture of a typical day when you're in college in St. Stephens?

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:25.060
[Amit Varma]: What's happening all day?

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:31.300
[Guest]: Well, you know, one important thing is that the things I was interested in, both debating

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.740
[Guest]: and cooler talk didn't take up that much time. I mean, you know, if you were interested in

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:40.580
[Guest]: theater, it would take up a lot of your time. If you were interested in sports, it would

01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:45.300
[Guest]: take up a lot of your time. But if you're doing the school magazine and debating, I

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:51.580
[Guest]: mean, if you know how to speak, etc, it doesn't take much time to do that stuff. So I don't

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:58.620
[Guest]: think these were conflicting things. But I did actually genuinely enjoy both cooler talk

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:05.920
[Guest]: and debating because, you know, I was a residential scholar. So really, once the college teaching

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.820
[Guest]: periods are over, you've got the whole day to spend. And a small group of people that

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:18.620
[Guest]: you're constantly with, it helps to be involved with them in extracurricular activity. You

01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:23.820
[Guest]: know, those who did theater would just spend hours rehearsing. In our case, we just met

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:28.420
[Guest]: at the college cooler, chatted a bit and said, Why don't you write on this? And I'll write

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:34.260
[Guest]: on that. And you went off and did something. So it was actually quite, it was cool to use

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.240
[Guest]: the correct word.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:42.340
[Amit Varma]: You make it sound so easy. And what was and you've also kind of spoken about how there

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:46.580
[Amit Varma]: was there was discourse happening there. Like you point out at one point how you called

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:50.660
[Amit Varma]: Meenu Masani and Meenu Masani came and gave a talk and because so much of his talk was

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:55.940
[Amit Varma]: so against the conventional leftist wisdom of the time, that people started protesting

01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:59.300
[Amit Varma]: and he said, Don't worry, I'm going to come back, I'm going to debate with you. And then

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:03.700
[Amit Varma]: when he does come back, the person debating him is Mr. Arun Shourie, who is then, you

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:08.500
[Amit Varma]: know, a man of the left as it were. And that's such a fascinating picture, a young Arun Shourie

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:13.900
[Amit Varma]: from the left debating Meenu Masani and you're getting to hear that kind of mind speak. Tell

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:20.260
[Amit Varma]: me a little bit about then how your view of the world begins to form in terms of worldviews,

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:26.620
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that initially, I guess it is so restricted because you don't have the internet,

01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:30.780
[Amit Varma]: all the knowledge of the world is not available to you, what you have is in your syllabus

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:35.540
[Amit Varma]: and the available conventional wisdom about you, around you, you know, people like Hayek

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:39.740
[Amit Varma]: and Friedman are active, but you are not reading their works at that point in time in the,

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:45.780
[Amit Varma]: you know, 50s and 60s. So how does your worldview begin to form at that stage? And how does

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:47.820
[Amit Varma]: it then evolve when you move on to Oxford?

01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:53.860
[Guest]: Well, I think these speakers that we used to get, they would come after dinner. And

01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:59.780
[Guest]: again, this was only the residential scholars who benefited from it. But it was a nice window

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:05.460
[Guest]: to the outside world, where people would say things that are a little unconventional. And

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:13.060
[Guest]: in a way that reflects the fact that our courses were really quite boring. I mean, I think

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:19.340
[Guest]: I mentioned at some point that, you know, we were aware or rather our teachers were

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:25.940
[Guest]: aware that the issue that planning is always good, it was not uncontroversial. I mean,

01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:31.260
[Guest]: there were people who had different views, but we were never taught that at all. It would

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:35.820
[Guest]: have been so much more exciting if they had said, well, you know, even if they could have

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:40.500
[Guest]: said, look, the consensus view is that this is the way to go. But you know, it has this

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:46.740
[Guest]: problem. And you guys think about it and make up your own mind. No, I mean, planning was

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:54.780
[Guest]: good. Raising investment was good. Public sector was good. It was just a undifferentiated

01:28:54.780 --> 01:29:00.820
[Guest]: mass of information thrown at you. And these after dinner speakers, therefore, were a breath

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:06.780
[Guest]: of fresh air. And the students had organized that. It wasn't organized by the college.

01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:11.700
[Guest]: And they would invite well known people to some extent, I guess, since Stevens had a

01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:16.580
[Guest]: kind of a reputation as an elite college. So these guys would also come. And I thought

01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:23.540
[Guest]: it was terrific. And I'm totally convinced that people at that young age should be subjected

01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:31.140
[Guest]: to different views. I mean, they should be told that, look, this is a conventional view,

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:36.260
[Guest]: but there is another view. You can, if you like, indicate to them that some of these

01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:42.260
[Guest]: other views are a little weird, but let them explore it. And I would say from that point

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:49.820
[Guest]: of view, one of the marked differences between going to Oxford and being in St. Stevens was

01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:58.040
[Guest]: that in St. Stevens, the formal teaching did not encourage you to explore these alternatives.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:04.500
[Guest]: It was almost as if, you know, the old joke used to be, the guys who took the IAS exam

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:10.100
[Guest]: in history, that there were seven causes for the decline of the Mughal Empire. And you

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:15.460
[Guest]: had to say them in the right sequence, where there was no effort to say, well, you know,

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:20.380
[Guest]: there are different views you can take on this, and God knows which one is right. And

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:24.940
[Guest]: I wish we had had more of that in our formal education.

01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:30.540
[Amit Varma]: So how was Oxford renewed, of course, did the PPE, which is, you know, people say that

01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:35.340
[Amit Varma]: all the politicians of England are basically people from that small set of elites who do

01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:41.660
[Amit Varma]: the PPE at Oxford and Cambridge and so on. And how was that? Because obviously, the environment

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:45.740
[Amit Varma]: there is completely different. You're not mugging up seven causes of the fall of the

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:50.500
[Amit Varma]: Roman Empire, you're actually encouraged to think about stuff. And I will just, you know,

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:54.900
[Amit Varma]: you've, you've named a few people who gave lectures to you at the time, like Hook Trevor

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:59.860
[Amit Varma]: Roper, and one of my heroes, Isaiah Berlin, you know, just would have been so mind boggling

01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:05.100
[Amit Varma]: for me to actually be physically present at a lecture by him. So what was that like? Because

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:10.100
[Amit Varma]: it seems to me that it must have been really mind expanding. And how are you, how do you

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:16.180
[Amit Varma]: then begin to get shaped into, you know, looking at the world in the way that you know, I think

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:22.540
[Guest]: that was extremely mind expanding. I mean, one simple thing was that, you know, you didn't

01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:27.260
[Guest]: have to go to any particular lecture. I mean, there were a whole bunch of lectures, and

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:33.660
[Guest]: there was a course, and you had tutorials, you could technically do your exam, based

01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:40.020
[Guest]: on your tutorial work, and go to a completely different set of lectures. It wasn't the case

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:45.460
[Guest]: that you're doing PPE, how come you're listening to a historian. And I think that was a terrific

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:51.420
[Guest]: degree of flexibility. It's not that one used it all the time. But you know, the very fact

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:56.820
[Guest]: that you, you could choose whose lecture you wanted to, even in economics. I mean, for

01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:02.220
[Guest]: example, John Hicks was one of the people who lectured, possibly the worst lecturer

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:07.620
[Guest]: in the world. You know, I mean, he would stutter, stumble, but you just wanted to hear the great

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:14.980
[Guest]: man. And you went there. Of course, you read his book separately. And I think I enjoyed

01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:21.100
[Guest]: the academic side of Oxford quite a bit. In fact, my only regret in a way, is that I didn't

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:28.460
[Guest]: do enough didn't take philosophy very seriously. I mean, I sort of slightly resented the fact

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:34.860
[Guest]: that I had to do P, P and E. I didn't mind the politics because I was interesting. But

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:41.700
[Guest]: I think when I think back on it, if I had paid more attention to philosophy, I might

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:50.580
[Guest]: have had a better analytical understanding of how one thinks than I do today. But I was

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:55.940
[Guest]: very much into, you know, let's get the useful stuff like economics and philosophy is neither

01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:57.660
[Amit Varma]: here nor there.

01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:01.660
[Amit Varma]: And who are the people who had the most influence on you in terms of the kind of thinkers ever

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:05.900
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps in terms of shaping the way that you think?

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:06.900
[Amit Varma]: You mean in Oxford?

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:11.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, or even during that period? I mean, I imagine whenever, you know, you feel you're

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.540
[Guest]: being formed in a sense?

01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:18.860
[Guest]: Well, mostly it was in the areas of development economics. I think one of the influential

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:24.340
[Guest]: people in Oxford at the time was Ian Little, as he done a lot of this project analysis

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:30.140
[Guest]: and how do you actually decide that a particular project is good. And I thought that he raised

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:37.300
[Guest]: some extremely interesting things, which we should have been taught about much more than

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:44.020
[Guest]: we were earlier. And, you know, it led you to question the value of a lot of what you're

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:49.380
[Guest]: doing. For example, one of the simplest things he said was that when you value a project,

01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:57.180
[Guest]: you should value everything at world prices. So if you're a steelmaking company, and you're

01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:04.580
[Guest]: taking iron ore and producing steel, the value you're adding is the international value of

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:11.220
[Guest]: the iron ore subtracted from the international value of the steel. And actually, when you

01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:16.660
[Guest]: did it that way, you found that a lot of the Indian steelmaking companies were extremely

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:22.300
[Guest]: inefficient. They were just good iron ore manufacturing companies. The value they added

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:28.940
[Guest]: at international prices was actually very low. And had they paid themselves, paid for

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:34.380
[Guest]: the iron ore, what the iron ore would have commanded in world markets, they'd all be

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:41.260
[Guest]: making losses. So it's an interesting way of thinking about, you know, what is a productive

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:48.780
[Guest]: enterprise as opposed to an unproductive enterprise. And Ian was one. There was a lot of work going

01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:54.660
[Guest]: on at the time in Latin America. You know, why is Latin America? Latin America was, at

01:34:54.660 --> 01:35:01.420
[Guest]: that time, ahead of Asia in terms of development. And many of the ideas that later on were seen

01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:07.740
[Guest]: as traditional development ideas came out of Latin America. Raoul Prebysch and people

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:13.740
[Guest]: like that. That, you know, basically the terms of trade are rigged against you. And you shouldn't

01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:21.740
[Guest]: be, therefore, trying to export primary commodities. You should always be adding value. And that

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:27.740
[Guest]: led naturally to protecting manufacturing, which is in a way what the United States had

01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:34.060
[Guest]: done earlier. So historically, I mean, countries have tried that and done well. And the Latinos

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:39.420
[Guest]: were saying, this is what we should be doing also. It's a very influential set of ideas

01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:47.220
[Guest]: in economics. And, you know, I think the whole notion of development consisting of people

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:55.020
[Guest]: moving from low productivity occupations to high productivity, sort of the Arthur Lewis

01:35:55.020 --> 01:36:00.560
[Guest]: type moving from agriculture to industry. So how do you create an environment which

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:05.900
[Guest]: facilitates that move? That was, I think, one of the interesting things. And, you know,

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:13.300
[Guest]: around that time, there was a lot of very negative thinking about Indian agriculture.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:18.060
[Guest]: Lots of people saying that, you know, India will never be able to feed herself. It's a

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:23.780
[Guest]: club of Rome type of people, which proved to be comprehensively wrong. So it's nice

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:29.500
[Guest]: when you go back. It's not everything that's fashionable at the time that in retrospect

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:35.860
[Guest]: proves to be right. So I think those are some of the big, big things that I can recall of

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:36.860
[Guest]: hand.

01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:40.260
[Amit Varma]: Sanyam Bhutani And do you recall any lightbulb moments where

01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:44.420
[Amit Varma]: something happens or you read something or you listen to a lecture, and the way that

01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:50.620
[Amit Varma]: you look at a particular thing changes completely. Like a lightbulb moment for many people that

01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:56.020
[Amit Varma]: I come across is often that first moment where they realize the positive sumness of things,

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:00.300
[Amit Varma]: and you immediately realize why markets are great and why trade is great and all of that.

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:05.060
[Amit Varma]: Or for me personally, a lightbulb moment is understanding spontaneous order, you know,

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:09.820
[Amit Varma]: how languages and societies and economies and so all can function that you don't need

01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:14.400
[Amit Varma]: a top down benevolent dictator, so to say, but the price system can work and coordinate

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:19.180
[Amit Varma]: all of that within the economy. So do you remember any lightbulb moments like that,

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:22.020
[Amit Varma]: where suddenly, you just see the world in a better way?

01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:25.340
[Guest]: Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan That's a tough one. My guess is that for

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:31.940
[Guest]: the period I was in Oxford, I think some of the ideas that Ian Little was working on,

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:40.700
[Guest]: that which are closely related to the importance of keeping an economy open, and not just valuing

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:47.140
[Guest]: things according to artificially high values, resulting from excessive protection. I thought

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:52.700
[Guest]: that was a bit of a lightbulb moment, because it was a way of thinking that had not been

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:59.820
[Guest]: I'd not been exposed to at all. You know, at that time, the conventional view used to

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:05.380
[Guest]: be that look, foreign exchange is very important. So you should have a shadow price on foreign

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:11.060
[Guest]: exchange. This is a different way of saying the same thing. The issue is not that foreign

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:17.020
[Guest]: exchange, but world prices are very important. And you should you should see what value you're

01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:24.220
[Guest]: adding measured at world prices. And I think that stayed with me. And I saw its importance

01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:31.060
[Guest]: in many, many other areas also linked to that was, and this was probably a little after

01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:38.700
[Guest]: I had left Oxford, a kind of a realization that Southeast Asia was actually doing incredibly

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:46.500
[Guest]: well. You know, that wasn't the case in the early 60s. But for a while, it was mainly

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:53.740
[Guest]: the Gang of Four, etc. But then during the 70s, it was very clear that our performance

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:59.460
[Guest]: was deteriorating. I'd left Oxford by then, our performance was deteriorating, whereas

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:05.100
[Guest]: the Southeast Asia, East Asian, Southeast Asian countries were actually improving. And

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:12.500
[Guest]: that's that was something that had, to me, a very important signal of something wrong

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:19.820
[Guest]: in our policies. And later on, therefore, I was very inclined to believe that the excessive

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:28.020
[Guest]: protection and so on that we were locked into was actually the source of the problem. And

01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:34.140
[Guest]: the interesting thing is that, you know, Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai in their book documented

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:38.700
[Guest]: this very extensively. And it's interesting that I mean, the book was written after they

01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:44.900
[Guest]: left India. But you know, somehow it did not have the impact in India that it should have

01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:52.220
[Guest]: had. I mean, it's only in 1991 that some of those ideas got reflected in policy.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:56.260
[Amit Varma]: I discovered an interesting phrase a couple of years back, which, you know, explains a

01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:00.100
[Amit Varma]: lot of things which are wrong with how we often think about the world and the phrases

01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:04.900
[Amit Varma]: isomorphic mimicry. I did an episode on this with Alex Tabarrok and Shruthi Rajgopalan

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:10.020
[Amit Varma]: where which was in the particular context of policymakers will take a policy that is

01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:13.740
[Amit Varma]: working somewhere else in the world transplanted to India and it obviously won't work because

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:18.740
[Amit Varma]: local conditions are completely different. And conceptually, if I take a step back and

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:24.500
[Amit Varma]: apply to other things, I think it can be true of so many things. So during the time that

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:28.900
[Amit Varma]: you was first studying at Oxford, then, you know, working at the World Bank and so on

01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:35.020
[Amit Varma]: during that entire period of time, were there times where you encountered something in theory?

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:39.740
[Amit Varma]: And you said that, wait a minute, the Indian reality is a little complex, it may not quite

01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:46.140
[Amit Varma]: fit there, you know, in terms of, I think, people who study the world and then actually

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:51.060
[Amit Varma]: get down to it to interact with it and do things in it, often find that there is that

01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:55.820
[Amit Varma]: gap they have to bridge between the theory and the practice and the theory, the verified

01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:00.260
[Amit Varma]: level of ideas, you know, is one thing. But when you get down and dirty, there's just

01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:05.060
[Amit Varma]: so much else that you have to do, like one of the really interesting aspects of your

01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:10.540
[Amit Varma]: book, which I was taking notes on are the many points you made about how the imperatives

01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:15.220
[Amit Varma]: of policy in India, which are so, you know, unique and local, and you have to take so

01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:20.540
[Amit Varma]: much into account, which you will not find mentioned in the textbooks, as well. So what

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:25.620
[Amit Varma]: was that like, like, were there areas where something that you've learned, when does it

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:29.100
[Amit Varma]: begin to clash with the real world? Is it when you're working at the World Bank after

01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:33.340
[Amit Varma]: Oxford? Or, you know, do you read something from a book and think about, okay, let me

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:38.260
[Amit Varma]: place that in the Indian context and try to think for myself. So, you know, tell me a

01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:39.660
[Guest]: little bit about that sort of,

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:45.540
[Guest]: I think it's actually very important. You know, I don't like to think of distinguishing

01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:52.860
[Guest]: between theory and as rarefied and reality, because rarefied theory only sort of spells

01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:57.580
[Guest]: out what are the constraints under which the system works. If you're going to apply that

01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:01.820
[Guest]: somewhere, you ought to think about whether those conditions hold and if they don't hold,

01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:06.220
[Guest]: it's not going to work. But you know, my feeling is that you really only perceive that when

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:13.100
[Guest]: you're actually working in your own country on policymaking, even in the World Bank, after

01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:19.520
[Guest]: all, you're, you're observing from outside, you're visiting very briefly, and your interaction

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:24.580
[Guest]: with governments is not necessarily one in which they're telling you exactly what they

01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:31.900
[Guest]: think. So I think the point's very important. Everybody should be, should think, when they're

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:37.940
[Guest]: trying to apply something, that in theory, this works, because if you do A, then somebody

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:43.740
[Guest]: else will do B, and that'll lead to reaction C. And is that going to happen in this particular

01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:51.100
[Guest]: situation? I think that I began to see those kinds of things only when I was in government.

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:55.380
[Guest]: I don't think the World Bank, I mean, in the World Bank, you read about these things, but

01:42:55.380 --> 01:43:00.740
[Guest]: you don't actually see it. I mean, I'll give you a simple example. You know, in those days,

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:07.320
[Guest]: you had this completely ridiculous system, where if you wanted to produce something,

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:14.160
[Guest]: and you needed some import, you had to get the import cleared from what was called the

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:21.860
[Guest]: indigenous angle, and also the essentiality angle. So essentiality angle meant, do you

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:28.420
[Guest]: really need it? And the indigenous angle meant, why can't you just get it domestically? I

01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:35.140
[Guest]: remember in a licensing committee meeting, there was some guy who wanted to produce electric

01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:40.580
[Guest]: irons. I can't remember whether I mentioned it in the book. And you know, what he said

01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:45.100
[Guest]: was that, look, I want to make an electric iron, and I need to import steel of a certain

01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:52.780
[Guest]: thickness. And Indian steel is not that thin. It just has to be one grade thicker. And that's

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:58.340
[Guest]: not suitable for an electric iron. And around the committee, the guys from the steel ministry

01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:04.400
[Guest]: said this is all nonsense. You know, I mean, perfectly okay, iron will be a little heavy.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:12.100
[Guest]: It struck me that, you know, this is why we never got producers who could actually produce

01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:17.660
[Guest]: up to the quality they themselves wanted. Because here was a guy who actually said,

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:22.900
[Guest]: look, this is what I want to do. And I want to produce an electric iron that looks competitive.

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:28.220
[Guest]: And I need thin steel sheets of this thickness. And the government fellows said, no, what

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:32.540
[Guest]: does it matter if it's thicker? End result, he's produced an iron, but he'll never be

01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:37.140
[Guest]: able to sell it. Because if that's the kind of iron he's producing, somebody wants to

01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:41.660
[Guest]: look around who's a good manufacturer, they would just say, look, this is all clunky stuff.

01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:46.980
[Guest]: I mean, he was producing the ambassador of irons in a way. And since we were doing that

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:52.780
[Guest]: to cars, it's not surprising that we were doing to irons too. You know, I mentioned

01:44:52.780 --> 01:45:00.260
[Guest]: this in the paper that when Maruti came along, and Maruti sort of had agreed that they would

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:08.260
[Guest]: indigenize at a certain pace. So at one point, they were importing the engines, and then

01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:13.980
[Guest]: they had to sort of machine the engine block domestically, for which they needed machine

01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:20.980
[Guest]: tools. So sure enough, they said, look, this is the kind of fineness we want. And they'll

01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:28.000
[Guest]: have to be imported from Japan. The local DGTD, as it used to be called, Directorate

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.220
[Guest]: General of Technical Development, they said, no, we don't need to import this because

01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:40.940
[Guest]: HMT produces machine tools. And HMT was asked, and of course, we can produce it. And they

01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:45.380
[Guest]: were asked, have you produced anything of this sophistication? I said, no, but we are

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:52.660
[Guest]: doing it for the Bajaj scooters. And the Maruti chaps pointed out that the engine of a scooter

01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:58.500
[Guest]: is very different from the engine of a car. And to make the point, Bhargav, who was then

01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:05.300
[Guest]: the MD there, he actually got the two engines brought into the minister's office to show

01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:10.500
[Guest]: him that, look, this is the engine these guys produce. This is the engine we need. They

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:14.900
[Guest]: can machine this one, but they can't machine this one at all. Now, I would have thought

01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:21.620
[Guest]: that this shouldn't have been necessary. And you realize then that, you know, while it's

01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:28.380
[Guest]: very easy to say, we will only allow the import of what is really essential, in the end, it's

01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:35.700
[Guest]: a highly arbitrary decision, and quality suffers. And Maruti were just very keen. Krishnamurti

01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:45.060
[Guest]: was then the head of Maruti, was very particular, that there should be no decline in quality,

01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:50.100
[Guest]: because we started producing the engine block domestically. And he said that, look, I'm

01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:55.860
[Guest]: trying to be responsible for the quality of the Maruti. Don't kind of get me stuck with

01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:02.300
[Guest]: a machine tool, which doesn't make sense to me. Whereas in the system, the tendency would

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:07.300
[Guest]: have been to do that. And I think this is an example of, you know, why you need to be

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:13.900
[Guest]: open, why producers must be given the choice. Because, you know, if producers are not given

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:19.020
[Guest]: the choice, they're not responsible for the end result. The moment you force the guy to

01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:24.980
[Guest]: buy a different machine tool from what he wanted, he can blame non-performance to the

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:31.380
[Guest]: fact that you didn't let me get what I wanted. So it creates a culture that just is not consistent

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:37.940
[Guest]: with producing good quality. And, you know, several meetings that I attended of the licensing

01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:45.820
[Guest]: committee convinced me that never under any circumstances should we have import licensing.

01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:50.420
[Guest]: I mean, if you want to do some protection, do it through duties. And the reason that

01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:56.060
[Guest]: makes sense is that, you know, when you do it through duties, sooner or later, people

01:47:56.060 --> 01:48:02.140
[Guest]: will start asking the question, how come you want such a high duty protection? You know,

01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:08.020
[Guest]: and if the user, on the other hand, feels that it's worth it to import, even at a higher

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:14.660
[Guest]: duty, you won't be easily able to persuade the ministry to jack up duties to unreasonable

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:21.180
[Guest]: levels. Whereas through this licensing system, I mean, it's completely non transparent.

01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:24.180
[Amit Varma]: You've got another great example of this in your book. Both these stories are in your

01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:28.500
[Amit Varma]: book, of course, the steel story and the Maruti story. And you also relate an anecdote which

01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:34.740
[Amit Varma]: Narayan Murthy told you in 1983. And you're right in that your quote, Infosys wanted to

01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:40.080
[Amit Varma]: import a data general MB 8000 computer with three removable disk drives with a capacity

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:45.120
[Amit Varma]: of 200 MB each, they had to make several trips to New Delhi to get the import license. By

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.780
[Amit Varma]: the time they got the license, a new disk drive with a capacity of 300 MB had become

01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:55.180
[Amit Varma]: available 30% cheaper. Naturally, they wanted to import the latest model. However, the original

01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:59.540
[Amit Varma]: license specified the model number, and several additional visits to Delhi had to be made

01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:05.460
[Amit Varma]: to modify the license, stop quote. And, you know, the kind of absurdity which was just

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:12.420
[Amit Varma]: so incredibly sort of commonplace at the time. So before we come to your time in government,

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:16.340
[Amit Varma]: I think it's still a decade and a half to kind of get through after Oxford, you go to

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:22.340
[Amit Varma]: the World Bank. And at this point, when you're at the World Bank, you know, what is how do

01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:26.620
[Amit Varma]: you see the rest of your life kind of panning out? Like, are you thinking that, okay, you

01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:30.180
[Amit Varma]: know, I'm in the World Bank, and things are going well. And, you know, I'll be an economist

01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:37.020
[Amit Varma]: here. And this is sort of my circle, I found my groove, or at the back of your mind, somewhere,

01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:41.020
[Amit Varma]: is there a thought about going back at some point, because in your book, of course, you

01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:46.460
[Amit Varma]: write that the two sort of the two seminal moments in your life for meeting a share and

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:51.060
[Amit Varma]: then coming back to India. And the two are, of course, related, because you decided that

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:54.900
[Amit Varma]: you'd rather have your kids grow up here and all of that. But before that's happening,

01:49:54.900 --> 01:50:00.620
[Amit Varma]: when you're a young economist at the World Bank, you know, how Yeah, well, when I was

01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:06.380
[Guest]: a young economist, before I met Isha, my idea was, I'll be there for three or four years,

01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:12.280
[Guest]: pick up some experience, move back. Then I met Isha, we were kind of courting together

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:17.020
[Guest]: for a year or so, decided to get married. That, of course, altered the timing of coming

01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:22.780
[Guest]: back. But she was also working and she needed to finish her PhD. So that stretched it out

01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:27.340
[Guest]: by a few years, I must say that we enjoyed those few, it's not as if I was yearning to

01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:32.780
[Guest]: get back, happily traveling around the world, very comfortable life, good salary, and so

01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:37.860
[Guest]: on. But I was quite aware that as soon as she got her PhD, which she actually did in

01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:44.020
[Guest]: 76, I think, that's when we would start thinking of moving back. And that's what we did, started

01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:51.620
[Guest]: exploring, I got a job offer from the Ministry of Finance, I think something in 1977, or

01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:58.620
[Guest]: early 78. Isha was our oldest son had just been born in 77. So we wanted a little more

01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:04.140
[Guest]: time. And they agreed that I could come one year later. And so I went and joined the finance

01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:10.800
[Guest]: ministry in 79. As soon as kids arrived, I mean, Isha was quite clear that, you know,

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:15.180
[Guest]: she wanted to go back. So I mean, that that, you know, when you have two people both have

01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:21.980
[Guest]: a job, etc. You can sometimes have a situation where the two don't have the same view on

01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:28.460
[Guest]: when to move as it happened in this particular case, the two were in the same direction.

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:34.660
[Guest]: And I had no problem heading back, having spent more time at the bank than I originally

01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:36.900
[Amit Varma]: thought I would.

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:41.760
[Amit Varma]: So my next question actually comes from something that I read in Isha's book, which is also

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:46.720
[Amit Varma]: a beautiful book and a quick read. And one of the things that she says is that when she

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:53.580
[Amit Varma]: joined presidency, there were 24 boys and four girls in the class. And if a boy would

01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:57.900
[Amit Varma]: happen to reach the class first, the girls would wait outside till the professor came.

01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:01.080
[Amit Varma]: And if a girl happened to enter the class first, the boys would wait outside till the

01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:05.540
[Amit Varma]: professor came. And later, she points out that when you the first time you dated you

01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:10.900
[Amit Varma]: took her to lunch or dinner, or whatever. The thing she points out that impressed her

01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:17.300
[Amit Varma]: was that you treated her as an intellectual equal, and thereby implying that most people

01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:23.620
[Amit Varma]: did not that most people had a sort of a different attitude. And when so my question to you is

01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:31.540
[Amit Varma]: really about how you have seen notions of gender evolve over those decades into context.

01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:36.500
[Amit Varma]: One is a context that back then there simply would not have been so many female economists,

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:41.220
[Amit Varma]: it would have been a male dominated workplace everywhere. And I guess a natural attitude

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:44.900
[Amit Varma]: even today, the natural attitude, honestly, is to talk down to women and to interrupt

01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:50.320
[Amit Varma]: them all the time and all of that. And back then, I guess this must have been even worse.

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:57.540
[Amit Varma]: So one, it's, you know, is this something that you consciously thought about? Because

01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:02.260
[Amit Varma]: it would have been reflexive for most people to actually behave in those ways without thinking

01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:07.180
[Amit Varma]: that it's odd in any way. You know, like one metric that I forget which guest of mine so

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:11.300
[Amit Varma]: I apologize to her but has spoken about is I think Shayana Bhattacharya mentioned it

01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:15.620
[Amit Varma]: and I've also read pieces on this is Shayana mentioned and she works with the World Bank.

01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:19.940
[Amit Varma]: And she said that whenever I would go to whenever I go to meetings, if there's a man with me,

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:23.900
[Amit Varma]: they're always talking to the man, they're never talking to me. And somewhere else, somebody

01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:27.780
[Amit Varma]: pointed out a metric that just take a man with you. If they're talking to the man, they're

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:32.140
[Amit Varma]: not the kind of person you deal with where you're just uncomfortable talking to a woman.

01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:38.860
[Amit Varma]: So one at this aspect of it, how much has the field changed in all this time, because

01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:43.340
[Amit Varma]: women obviously bring different perspectives and that diversity helps in just sharpening

01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:49.780
[Amit Varma]: people's thinking. And the other perspective is that we often tend to, you know, a point

01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:54.620
[Amit Varma]: that sort of Prernal Pandey and Amitabh Bhandare have made at different points in time, while

01:53:54.620 --> 01:54:00.660
[Amit Varma]: on the show is that for every problem that there is in India, there is an aspect of it,

01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:05.420
[Amit Varma]: which is an even deeper problem. And that's the role of gender. So if you look at agriculture,

01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:09.700
[Amit Varma]: what women farmers go through is there's a whole separate layer of suffering that there's

01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:16.140
[Amit Varma]: involved there, in education, a whole different layer of scarcity that girls go through as

01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:22.180
[Amit Varma]: opposed to boys, and so on and so forth. And as an economist, it would seem that at one

01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:27.020
[Amit Varma]: moment in time, it's you're obsessed with problems that are fundamentally men's problems.

01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:31.220
[Amit Varma]: When you're counting GDP, you're looking at what men are producing and not perhaps unpaid

01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:35.780
[Amit Varma]: labor in the household and so on. So these are really two separate questions. So I apologize

01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:41.500
[Amit Varma]: for inflicting them on you at the same time. But one how, you know, what was your personal

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:47.460
[Amit Varma]: view towards the way gender was evolving? And how much has it changed? And to that component

01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:50.340
[Amit Varma]: of gender in thinking about the world? What do you think about that?

01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:55.980
[Guest]: Well, you know, I was, of course, very aware of the gender aspect, simply because having

01:54:55.980 --> 01:55:01.860
[Guest]: met Isha, she frequently made me aware that this is a problem, I could recognize it's

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:06.460
[Guest]: a problem. I wouldn't say that I wouldn't say that I worried about it deeply. But I

01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:11.140
[Guest]: sort of recognize it. Yes, you're right. And hopefully, it'll change over time. You know,

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:16.500
[Guest]: the awareness of what a problem it is from a development point of view, this was a bit

01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:24.180
[Guest]: slower in coming. And I wasn't fully aware of the extent to which these biases exist.

01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:29.500
[Guest]: I mean, you know, if you're a woman farmer, it's not easy to get a loan, especially, for

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:35.780
[Guest]: example, if the land is not in your name, and you could multiply these examples. So

01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:42.700
[Guest]: I would I would agree with the proposition that the gender aspect is another layer of

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:48.580
[Guest]: problems. And in order to understand the nature of problems, you got to appreciate the gender

01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:56.220
[Guest]: aspect much more than we do. And I think we were not, I mean, of course, we were sensitized

01:55:56.220 --> 01:56:02.460
[Guest]: that that we ourselves would not discriminate. We do not think that women are inferior. I

01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:09.700
[Guest]: don't remember, for example, ever talking past a woman in occasions when I had to interact

01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:14.580
[Guest]: with with her professionally. But the honest truth is that there weren't too many such

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:19.980
[Guest]: occasions, because the number of women was very, very limited. But I think after coming

01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:25.700
[Guest]: to India, more than that, actually, even maybe as recently as in the Planning Commission,

01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:31.940
[Guest]: I was made much more aware that the really deep problems that we have to address. I mean,

01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:37.700
[Guest]: for example, I early on came to the conclusion that if you're going to give cash support

01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:42.820
[Guest]: to households, give it to the women in the household and not the men. And it's interesting

01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:47.500
[Guest]: because a lot of people used to say that if you give it to the men, they'll just drink

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:51.140
[Guest]: it away. And if you give it to the women, they'll just beat up the women, take away

01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:56.580
[Guest]: the money. That's not true. I mean, if you give it to the women, actually, the men are

01:56:56.580 --> 01:57:01.500
[Guest]: sufficiently civilized that they won't do that. But it's true that if you give it to

01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:07.780
[Guest]: them, they may gamble it away or throw it away or whatever. So I think the point that

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:15.060
[Guest]: these women have made about gender is more important than we allowed for. And certainly,

01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:21.940
[Guest]: I mean, you know, later on, things in this world of, in a woke world, the extent to which

01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:28.140
[Guest]: women experience sexual harassment, this was just not evident there. I mean, maybe they

01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:33.700
[Guest]: weren't enough. I mean, not enough women. But later on, you know, as I got to talk to

01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:38.140
[Guest]: women, they would point out that this is true.

01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:43.100
[Amit Varma]: So tell me now a bit about, you know, coming to India, for example, you've pointed out

01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:48.700
[Amit Varma]: that you know, you wanted to start a family, career wise, it was just the right time, right

01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:53.700
[Amit Varma]: place, you came to Delhi, both of you have written in your books about that legendary

01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:59.620
[Amit Varma]: meeting with Udham Singh ji at Khyber restaurant, where he introduced you to Manmohan Singh,

01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:04.060
[Amit Varma]: for the first time, who was then teaching at the Delhi School of Economics. And Manmohan

01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:08.540
[Amit Varma]: took a liking to you guys and said, Yeah, you should come. So yeah, tell me, tell me

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:12.940
[Amit Varma]: a bit about that, and how that process played out in your head and all of that.

01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:19.820
[Guest]: Well, I think I won't be able to add anything. But since you mentioned it, it was a it was

01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:26.580
[Guest]: a very interesting occasion. When Udham wanted to take us out, I didn't realize that he was

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:32.220
[Guest]: going to call Manmohan Singh also. So that was fun. We got to meet, at that time, a distinguished

01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:38.540
[Guest]: academic, but I had no idea that this guy was going to become ultimately a very important

01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:45.860
[Guest]: determinant of where I went to work. And you know, it was just like a normal kind of dinner.

01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:51.260
[Guest]: The thing I regret is I've never been to the Khyber restaurant since then. I don't know

01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:56.780
[Guest]: if it still exists, by the way. It wasn't it wasn't at that time, much of a restaurant,

01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:03.180
[Guest]: but it was the nearest thing to the university that Udham could think of. And we it was my

01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:09.820
[Guest]: first exposure, not to a government person, but to a senior academic in the Delhi School

01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.960
[Amit Varma]: of Economics.

01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:18.860
[Amit Varma]: And once you sort of came back and you joined government, was was it sort of like what was

01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:23.780
[Amit Varma]: that period of adjustment? Like, because you come from a very different environment where

01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:29.500
[Amit Varma]: you're dealing with ideas, and I presume you're reading papers, having intellectual conversations.

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:35.940
[Amit Varma]: Here you're kind of on the ground in the middle of this machine. And everything could simultaneously

01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:40.100
[Amit Varma]: seem daunting and frustrating and all of that. So tell me a little bit about you know, your

01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:42.660
[Amit Varma]: early times in government and what that was like.

01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:48.540
[Guest]: Well, it was, you're right, it's very different from something like the World Bank, because

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:53.900
[Guest]: in the World Bank, you're making assessments of other countries. So you're preparing reports

01:59:53.900 --> 02:00:00.980
[Guest]: on those countries. In the Ministry of Finance, you're actually processing multiple proposals,

02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:06.940
[Guest]: which go through different ministries, and you get an opportunity to comment. You don't

02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:13.540
[Guest]: you don't you don't get an opportunity to write a whole essay. I mean, a proposal comes

02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:18.660
[Guest]: up in a file, and you have to make a comment on that particular proposal. It takes a long

02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:24.820
[Guest]: time before you realize that, look, you've got to limit yourself to what is relevant.

02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:29.660
[Guest]: And how can you push it in the right direction or not? You know, half the problem is that

02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:35.980
[Guest]: you think that most of the proposals that have been put forward belong to a world which

02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:40.820
[Guest]: they shouldn't have existed to begin with. But you can't say that I'm not going to have

02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:45.620
[Guest]: a view on this particular action. So that takes a little bit of doing. I think the other

02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:52.060
[Guest]: thing is that it was quite a collegial world. I mean, I had my doubts, how easy it would

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:58.900
[Guest]: be to interact with, say, other IAS officers. But you know, we would, at the joint secretary

02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:05.100
[Guest]: level, economic advisors and joint secretaries, same level, we would occasionally, we'd meet

02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:10.860
[Guest]: for lunch in each other's rooms, bringing along our dabbas, where there were no nice cafeterias

02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:16.860
[Guest]: to go to. But you spent about an hour chit-chatting about what's happening, about politics, where

02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:23.260
[Guest]: things are going and so on. And that was a very important part of sort of becoming part

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:30.100
[Guest]: of the team. And I felt that if you invested a bit of time in it, and you didn't kind of

02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:34.940
[Guest]: throw your weight around saying, I'm the economist, and you must listen to me. There were quite

02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:40.180
[Guest]: willing to listen to you as one of the team. But it is time consuming, because you have

02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:45.180
[Guest]: to invest in becoming part of the team. Now, one of the interesting things in the government,

02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:49.860
[Guest]: of course, is that when you come in as an economist, you have some existing fellows

02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:56.140
[Guest]: there. A year later, one third of them have moved on. New fellows come. To the new fellows,

02:01:56.140 --> 02:02:01.620
[Guest]: you're part of the existing apparatus, so you're an insider. I mean, it's an interesting

02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:09.580
[Guest]: way in which the system works. I didn't find it difficult at all to get on with people.

02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:17.180
[Guest]: And I think I made a lot of friends and colleagues, and many of them moved in time with me. I

02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:24.140
[Guest]: was younger than them. So one of the consequences of this was that by the time I became secretary,

02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:28.580
[Guest]: most of the others who became secretary retired within two or three years, but I had several

02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:37.380
[Guest]: years to go. So that gave me a big advantage of just being around longer than the others.

02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:40.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, while writing about that period of the ministry, you speak about the three

02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:46.540
[Amit Varma]: things you did, which is you helped MPs prepare parliamentary answers, you, you know, helped

02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:51.020
[Amit Varma]: on notes for inter-ministerial meetings, and you worked on the economic survey. But you

02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:55.340
[Amit Varma]: described the inter-ministerial meetings as the most important part. And there's this

02:02:55.340 --> 02:03:00.940
[Amit Varma]: lovely passage where you say, quote, Mao Tse Tung famously said that gorillas must move

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:05.620
[Amit Varma]: among the people like fish in water, difficult to detect, but working from within. It was

02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:10.180
[Amit Varma]: surprisingly relevant advice for an economist in government in those days. It did not always

02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:15.060
[Amit Varma]: work if strong vested interests were involved, but it was an essential first step. On reflection,

02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:19.620
[Amit Varma]: I think my participation in inter-ministerial committees had more impact on policy than

02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:23.900
[Amit Varma]: anything I might have put in the economic survey, stop quote. And I was struck by this

02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:28.460
[Amit Varma]: because like one, of course, I have an interest in gorilla warfare, and I've read up a lot

02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:34.220
[Amit Varma]: about that. But in this context of moving like a fish among water, sounded really fascinating

02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:40.740
[Amit Varma]: to me. And then it strikes me that once you realize this, does a significant part of it

02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:46.980
[Amit Varma]: also does a significant part of your job, not just have to do with thinking about policy,

02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:51.740
[Amit Varma]: but thinking in a strategic way about getting the kind of outcomes that you want within

02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:57.380
[Guest]: the department? Yeah, it does. I mean, I think this is where the big problem, you know, I

02:03:57.380 --> 02:04:03.900
[Guest]: discovered very early on that the economic survey was an interesting document to write

02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:11.340
[Guest]: in the sense that people looking at what's going on would regard it as a definitive statement

02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:16.700
[Guest]: of the government's view. But it wasn't the way to make policy because it was well understood

02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:22.340
[Guest]: that you could have all kinds of homilies in the economic survey, but nobody ever thought

02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:27.580
[Guest]: that they necessarily had to be reflected in policy. So if you want to have an impact

02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:32.900
[Guest]: on policy, you want to persuade people in these inter-ministerial meetings to think

02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:37.980
[Guest]: a little differently. And I found people were really quite willing to entertain different

02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:43.460
[Guest]: thoughts. Very often they would say, well, that's not going to work because and then

02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:48.180
[Guest]: if you could argue, no, no, it's not that simple. But as long as you don't have a kind

02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:55.740
[Guest]: of I'm the expert, listen to me type of attitude, you're just part of a team. And the thing

02:04:55.740 --> 02:05:01.420
[Guest]: that I found missing and which led ultimately to my writing the M document is that, you

02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:10.100
[Guest]: know, there's very little opportunity in government to take a holistic view of what is wrong because

02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:18.060
[Guest]: every ministry works within the confines of its terms of reference. The Ministry of Commerce,

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:26.420
[Guest]: for example, is responsible for providing import licenses to exporters and also to give

02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:33.980
[Guest]: in those days subsidies. So their idea of promoting exports invariably was, let's give

02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:40.420
[Guest]: more import licenses in an easier way and let's give more export subsidies. The most

02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:44.980
[Guest]: important thing for exporters is the exchange rate. That's not the function of the Commerce

02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:50.460
[Guest]: Ministry. So Commerce Ministry not only didn't worry about it, but very rarely said anything

02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:56.340
[Guest]: about it. And occasionally they said they would just say, you must have a realistic

02:05:56.340 --> 02:06:02.460
[Guest]: exchange rate. But that didn't mean anything. That's where I think I found that we need

02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:09.180
[Guest]: periodically somebody taking a holistic look and saying, look, if this is what you want,

02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:14.620
[Guest]: these are five things you have to change. And these things are interrelated. I mean,

02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:20.620
[Guest]: changing one is not going to do anything. I make the point in the book, for example,

02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:28.380
[Guest]: all industrialists felt that industrial licenses should be got rid of because they want to

02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:34.500
[Guest]: expand. They should be allowed to expand. Very sensible. But the point is, if you didn't

02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:40.500
[Guest]: get rid of import licensing, everybody who wanted to expand would ask for a import of

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:45.540
[Guest]: capital good permission, which would be given by the Commerce Ministry. So instead of queuing

02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:50.520
[Guest]: up in the front of the industry ministry, they'd all queue up in the Commerce Ministry.

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:55.580
[Guest]: If on the other hand, you got rid of import licensing and freed the exchange rate, then

02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:59.820
[Guest]: the exchange rate would depreciate if there was too much demand for import. You wouldn't

02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:05.860
[Guest]: have a bunch of officials saying there's too much demand. What should we cut? Allow this.

02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:10.540
[Guest]: Don't allow that. The system would actually work together. It would have been useless

02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:15.460
[Guest]: just getting rid of one of these things and not doing the other. And that, I think, is

02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:22.980
[Guest]: a I drew special attention to this point in the M document. And I was lucky that a year

02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:28.500
[Guest]: later you had the crisis and we were able to get a lot of things this done. And I'm

02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:37.720
[Guest]: sure this problem must be recurring in different contexts all the time, that each ministry,

02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:43.820
[Guest]: if you ask a ministry to do something, it almost never says get some other ministry

02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:49.380
[Guest]: to stop making making it difficult. They look at what instruments they've got and how can

02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:54.380
[Guest]: they use those to promote something. You've got a lovely quote in your book, which I'll

02:07:54.380 --> 02:07:58.740
[Amit Varma]: read out again, where you wrote, quote, we had all learned to students have a particular

02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:04.460
[Amit Varma]: policy that made sense in a first best situation where all other policies were properly deployed,

02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:09.300
[Amit Varma]: may not work in a second best situation where other policies were suboptimal. As developing

02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:14.220
[Amit Varma]: countries suffered from innumerable constraints, the policymaking had to be of the second best

02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:19.460
[Amit Varma]: variety. And I was particularly keen to observe how this worked in practice, stop, quote,

02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:26.300
[Amit Varma]: and what you sort of mentioned about departments working in silos. So you are in a particular

02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:30.060
[Amit Varma]: department, somebody comes to you, you're not stepping back and seeing the bigger picture,

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:34.420
[Amit Varma]: you're not incentivized to step back and see the bigger picture, you just do what you can.

02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:39.700
[Amit Varma]: And therefore you are tackling just one little cog. And that doesn't really change anything.

02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:43.420
[Amit Varma]: And I would imagine that one of the ways that you are able to see the bigger picture is

02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:47.940
[Amit Varma]: because you're an outsider. You're not in that sense, a career bureaucrat and insider

02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:53.380
[Amit Varma]: is officers anyway tend to be generalists. So their, you know, appreciation of the nuances

02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:57.180
[Amit Varma]: of anything would necessarily be limited, not their fault, but if they're generalist,

02:08:57.180 --> 02:09:04.660
[Amit Varma]: that's how it is. So one was being an outsider, something that helped you sort of get this

02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:08.420
[Amit Varma]: bigger picture. And in that case, would you recommend that more outsiders join government

02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:13.820
[Amit Varma]: in specialized positions? And two, was it nevertheless a little lonely? Because you

02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:19.300
[Amit Varma]: would then have been looking at the world in a way that most people around you would

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:24.180
[Amit Varma]: not have shared. And you would have also then to be careful and strategic about when to

02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:29.900
[Amit Varma]: express a particular point of view that may clash with the way things are done.

02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:35.900
[Guest]: That's a tough question to answer. I mean, you know, I think the short answer is that

02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:42.740
[Guest]: you can't run complex ministries just by generalists. That's certainly true. When you say outsiders,

02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:49.420
[Guest]: I mean, you mean people with specialist expertise in something.

02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:53.340
[Amit Varma]: People with specialist expertise and also someone who's from outside the system. You

02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:56.220
[Amit Varma]: haven't worked in the government all your career. You've been in the World Bank, you've

02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:58.020
[Amit Varma]: done your other things, and then you've come.

02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:03.980
[Guest]: Well, in any system, it's a good idea to bring in some outsiders. I would have said that

02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:10.500
[Guest]: the thing that was most missing is that, you know, given that many things now have to be

02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:17.580
[Guest]: done basically by the private sector, government needs to have a much better understanding

02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:23.620
[Guest]: of what are the constraints of the private sector and what is it that will really make

02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:29.980
[Guest]: them do what you want them to do. It's not always easy to find out because talking to

02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:35.220
[Guest]: a private sector guy, I mean, he's constrained by whatever is good for his firm. He's not

02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:40.740
[Guest]: necessarily going to give you what is best from the point of view of the market as a

02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:41.780
[Guest]: whole.

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:48.700
[Guest]: So I think policy has to be opened up, and you've got to have interactions between different

02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:54.980
[Guest]: stakeholders in which I think generalists can also play a role. But we need far more

02:10:54.980 --> 02:11:01.580
[Guest]: consultation, to-ing and fro-ing, and that sort of stuff in the process of making policy.

02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:03.580
[Guest]: And was it lonely?

02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:09.260
[Guest]: I didn't think so. I mean, I felt that I enjoyed it, to be honest. I mean, lonely would mean

02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:10.260
[Guest]: not having friends.

02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:16.660
[Amit Varma]: Not in not in a social sense, but in a sense of not many people who perhaps agree with

02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:17.660
[Guest]: your ideas.

02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:25.020
[Guest]: No, I mean, maybe I was lucky, but I found that many people actually agreed with those

02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:33.060
[Guest]: ideas, but they were caught in a particular silo. Being an economist, I was in some sense,

02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:39.380
[Guest]: I could assume that I can kind of think more broadly. But technically, you know, there

02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:44.500
[Guest]: was the Planning Commission. You now have the Niti Aayog. So there are institutions

02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:50.820
[Guest]: that are cross-ministerial. And there's no reason why they shouldn't be used in order

02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:58.500
[Guest]: to get that kind of an overview, which goes beyond the requirements of a silo.

02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:02.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, one distinction that you made, which is perhaps relevant to this period in time,

02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:07.380
[Amit Varma]: though you made it in the book with reference to the post 91 period and to Narsimha Rao

02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:12.620
[Amit Varma]: and Manmohan Singh, is a distinction between reform by stealth and gradualism, which you

02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:16.380
[Amit Varma]: point out, they are sometimes often confused for each other, but they are different and

02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:21.140
[Amit Varma]: you write, quote, gradualism implies a clear indication of where we are heading, but with

02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:25.460
[Amit Varma]: an acceptance that the pace of change will be tailored to make it more acceptable. Reform

02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:29.700
[Amit Varma]: by stealth is essentially opportunistic. You point in a broad direction without committing

02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:33.660
[Amit Varma]: to any particular pace of change, and then take a step forward whenever it is politically

02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:38.060
[Amit Varma]: opportune to do so. The trouble with such an approach is that it can never create a

02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:44.380
[Amit Varma]: broader constituency for reforms looking ahead. Dr. Singh was a genuine gradualist, he conceptualized

02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:49.500
[Amit Varma]: a complex and multi dimensional structure of reform, and consistently articulated the

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:53.940
[Amit Varma]: need for it, while acknowledging that change must be made slowly to be digestible, stop

02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:59.340
[Amit Varma]: quote. But in the 80s, before everything has happened, you're in the 80s, you're in these

02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:04.660
[Amit Varma]: ministries, government is what it is, you know, massive in its scope, and you know,

02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:08.900
[Amit Varma]: not nearly as strong as it should be in the things that it does. And it's this bureaucratic

02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:14.300
[Amit Varma]: machine and you're trying to be a fish moving among water, you know, how do you play the

02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:19.660
[Amit Varma]: long game? Like, did you have a sense of yourself playing the long game? And saying that, you

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:23.140
[Amit Varma]: know, these are the changes we want, we've got to look for opportunities, we've got to

02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:28.340
[Amit Varma]: create those opportunities, if possible, we've constantly got to figure out the best way

02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:33.020
[Amit Varma]: to get these messages out either to the politicians we interact with, or within our department,

02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:37.500
[Amit Varma]: or to the people at large, wherever we can, you know, a lot of this stuff one thinks about

02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:42.500
[Amit Varma]: in hindsight, and you know, one thinks about it in a post facto way. But at the time, you

02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:45.100
[Amit Varma]: know, how are you guys thinking about it?

02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:50.820
[Guest]: Well, you know, I think, I don't think I was taking a long view of how we're going to do

02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:56.140
[Guest]: it. Because during the period when I was a joint secretary, or even an additional secretary,

02:13:56.140 --> 02:14:01.100
[Guest]: I wasn't in a position where I'd be able to think of orchestrating the whole thing. I

02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:10.460
[Guest]: was just fortunate that in 1990, sorry, in 89, when the Congress government under Rajiv

02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:18.060
[Guest]: Gandhi was going in for an election, I had a very good boss, that was BG Deshmukh. Deshmukh

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:24.420
[Guest]: was the cabinet secretary, later became secretary to the Prime Minister, and he came from Bombay,

02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:30.260
[Guest]: as Chief Secretary Maharashtra. And you know, it's interesting that unlike the other senior

02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:37.380
[Guest]: officials, he was not actually anti-private sector. And he had a genuine sense that, look,

02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:42.980
[Guest]: the private sector has a lot of capabilities, and we should be using them more. And you

02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:49.380
[Guest]: know, he and I tried to get a few things done, and he was always supportive. I remember,

02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:55.980
[Guest]: for example, you know, we had in the case of cement, we'd had a gradual liberalization

02:14:55.980 --> 02:15:02.220
[Guest]: increasing the market share of cement year by year. And towards the end of the Rajiv

02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:11.620
[Guest]: Gandhi government, one area which was controlled was aluminum. I mean, there were four producers,

02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:18.100
[Guest]: and NALCO had just come in with a big production capability. And so there was talk about should

02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:23.660
[Guest]: we do partial decontrol, et cetera, and so on. So I had a discussion with Deshmukh, and

02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:28.540
[Guest]: I said, look, that's what we did with cement. It took four or five years. I think in this

02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:34.300
[Guest]: one, there's enough supply, we can just decontrol. I mean, the private sector guys who may not

02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:39.900
[Guest]: like the fall in price, I mean, they've had a pretty good time so far. So let's kind of

02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:47.900
[Guest]: do it at one go. And Deshmukh supported that, got Rajiv Gandhi to agree that we could go

02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:55.540
[Guest]: and discuss with Fotedar whether this is feasible or not. And when Fotedar saw both Deshmukh

02:15:55.540 --> 02:16:02.060
[Guest]: and me coming in, he sort of assumed that the PM must have approved it, because we persuaded

02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:06.900
[Guest]: him that look, this is the thing we should do. Now, had I done it, it wouldn't have counted.

02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:12.980
[Guest]: But if I'm doing it, and Deshmukh is doing it, that for him, for ND Tiwari would have

02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:20.340
[Guest]: counted, sorry, for Fotedar would have counted a lot. And Fotedar had no sort of ideological

02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:25.260
[Guest]: preoccupation. He felt these two guys are saying it, Rajivji must be in favor, said,

02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:30.380
[Guest]: of course, let's do it. And we did it. And there was no problem at all. So this was a

02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:36.260
[Guest]: very good case where the country was ready for decontrol, mainly because a new producer

02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:42.700
[Guest]: had come in, producing a whole lot of things, NALCO. And the existing guys, some of them

02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:47.900
[Guest]: may have had some marketing difficulty, but there was no shortage. Nobody said prices

02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:54.540
[Guest]: are going sky high and all this kind of stuff. I mean, you need to judge when the time is

02:16:54.540 --> 02:17:00.580
[Guest]: right. This happened to be a case where it was a silo decision. And all we needed was

02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:07.020
[Guest]: a silo, the silo taking the right decision. But when it's a broader one, it becomes more

02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:12.980
[Guest]: complex. And that, that's really what one needs to, government should be constantly

02:17:12.980 --> 02:17:19.900
[Guest]: aware of the complexity of what it is doing, and therefore subjecting everything to an

02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:28.140
[Guest]: internal but critical look. You know, how to create a capability of internal critical

02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:34.860
[Guest]: assessment is very important, because governments typically don't like criticizing other ministries.

02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:40.500
[Guest]: So you need to build that, build that capability very consciously.

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:45.620
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned Mr. Deshbhukh, and one of my favorite quotes in the book is, you know,

02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:50.540
[Amit Varma]: after the VP Singh government came and you were kept on, both of you were kept on in

02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:55.260
[Amit Varma]: the ministries where you were, he said to you, quote, Montek, Delhi aisa shahar hai

02:17:55.260 --> 02:18:01.300
[Amit Varma]: jahan kab badalte hai lekin chamche nahi, which is untranslatable, because of the dual

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:06.180
[Amit Varma]: meaning of chamche as it were. And two more quotes which speak to your point about the

02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:13.060
[Amit Varma]: complexity and interrelated nature of everything. And one is IG Patel telling Rajiv Gandhi around

02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:17.740
[Amit Varma]: the time Rajiv takes power, IG Patel tells him, quote, Mr. PM, there is a lot of interest

02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:22.100
[Amit Varma]: in what you are doing on the economic front. If I may offer some advice, please make a

02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:27.020
[Amit Varma]: bonfire of all industrial controls. You won't regret it, stop quote. And the other quote

02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:31.380
[Amit Varma]: which speaks exactly to this point that you made is LK Jha speaking to Rajiv Gandhi and

02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:35.580
[Amit Varma]: saying, quote, Prime Minister, the Indian economy is like a vehicle with many brakes

02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:40.420
[Amit Varma]: pressed fully on, releasing one or two brakes will not make it move. You have to release

02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:47.220
[Amit Varma]: many more to get results, stop quote. So it's not as if there wasn't realization of this,

02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:51.540
[Amit Varma]: you know, obviously, a bunch of you knew, I mean, this is, of course, a quote from Jha

02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:56.380
[Amit Varma]: to Rajiv Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi knew as well, right. But there was some reforms momentum

02:18:56.380 --> 02:19:02.140
[Amit Varma]: under him, which kind of died down and for a, you know, a bunch of reasons. But what

02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:07.460
[Amit Varma]: was that period like? Was there a sense of excitement that yes, there might be movement,

02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:10.820
[Amit Varma]: we can get some of these things done, and so on? What was?

02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:15.300
[Guest]: Yeah, I can. I mean, I think there was a lot of excitement because, first of all, you had

02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:21.820
[Guest]: a very young Prime Minister. I mean, he was about the same age as I was. So when you're

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:26.100
[Guest]: there, and you suddenly see someone as Prime Minister of your age, you know, that always

02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:31.220
[Guest]: becomes a little special. And I think he had talked about, we must bring India to the 21st

02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:36.700
[Guest]: century. A lot of younger people thought, aha, big changes are coming. You know, after

02:19:36.700 --> 02:19:45.700
[Guest]: his government ended, Veer Sanghvi and Avik Sarkar interviewed him in a very frank interview.

02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:49.380
[Guest]: And they asked him that, look, aren't you a bit disappointed that you really didn't

02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:55.140
[Guest]: get done all the things you thought would be necessary? And he was very frank, and said

02:19:55.140 --> 02:20:00.820
[Guest]: why? And he was quite frank. He said, you know, I think lack of experience. I mean,

02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:05.420
[Guest]: and later on, in other contexts, he had said that if he got another chance, he would do

02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:11.220
[Guest]: it differently. You know, the fact is that he started with a couple of people who were

02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:18.020
[Guest]: very pro the idea of doing things differently. V.P. Singh was one of them. And in the first

02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:24.740
[Guest]: two years, their partnership was really very productive. But in the rest of his cabinet,

02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:29.940
[Guest]: I don't think it was a single person who shared his ideas. And, you know, if you look at what

02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:35.540
[Guest]: happened in China, I mean, Deng Xiaoping, I mean, first of all, he had huge experience.

02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:44.220
[Guest]: Rajiv Gandhi had almost none. But even Deng Xiaoping took a long time to weed out, build

02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:51.060
[Guest]: a team of people supportive of his ideas, so that things could move forward. And, you

02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:58.300
[Guest]: know, it was quite remarkable because he after all, he completely reversed the entire direction

02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:04.740
[Guest]: given by Mao Zedong, without once criticizing Mao Zedong. So in a way, that was part of

02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:12.020
[Guest]: the problem in India that since Rajiv Gandhi was succeeding another Congress government,

02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:17.100
[Guest]: it wasn't a case where you would blame the previous government for making a mess. But

02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:24.740
[Guest]: if you still have been able to define an agenda of change, and I think to do that, you need

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:32.060
[Guest]: insiders, companions in the political sphere. Now, in my book, I say that, you know, politics

02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:39.020
[Guest]: got the better of him. Once the Bofors thing exploded, the whole political situation changed.

02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:45.060
[Guest]: And he didn't really have much time to think about all these things, nor any conviction

02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:52.100
[Guest]: in his cabinet. So these ideas sort of had to wait for a different time and a different

02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:54.300
[Guest]: situation.

02:21:54.300 --> 02:22:00.780
[Amit Varma]: So during this period of time, there is sort of momentum building up, at least in terms

02:22:00.780 --> 02:22:06.300
[Amit Varma]: of ideas towards what will eventually happen, you know, Rakesh Mohan has his note of 86,

02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:10.180
[Amit Varma]: internal discussions are happening, and you talk about the M document, which I have heard,

02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:16.580
[Amit Varma]: you know, so many people regard as absolutely seminal, which you came up with in 1990, and

02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:20.740
[Amit Varma]: was, of course, widely criticized at the time by the left. And it's amusing to read those

02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:27.780
[Amit Varma]: today. Tell me a little bit about the M document, how it came about, and you know, and a brief

02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:29.460
[Amit Varma]: sense of what his contents were.

02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:37.380
[Guest]: Well, you know, it began when the election was going on. And Deshmukh had said to me,

02:22:37.380 --> 02:22:45.620
[Guest]: why is it that we're not able to get our ideas translated into functioning policies. And

02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:50.580
[Guest]: I thought about it. And I said, the reason is that we don't take a comprehensive look

02:22:50.580 --> 02:22:56.740
[Guest]: at what is needed. We just tell ministries to do something which happens to be in their

02:22:56.740 --> 02:23:02.380
[Guest]: area. But what is needed to get that done involves many other ministries. And nobody's

02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:06.300
[Guest]: taking a comprehensive look, saying, look, this is what's done. So he said, why don't

02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:11.740
[Guest]: you write a note. And if Rajiv Gandhi comes back, and he's reelected, we'll give it to

02:23:11.740 --> 02:23:17.180
[Guest]: him. So I started working on such a note. Of course, Rajiv Gandhi didn't come back,

02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:23.740
[Guest]: VP Singh came back. And as you record, as you report, you mentioned earlier, contrary

02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:31.980
[Guest]: to our expectations, both Deshmukh and I were continued under VP Singh. You know, VP Singh

02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:39.740
[Guest]: went to Malaysia. And I was part of this was some Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.

02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:44.500
[Guest]: And I was part of the team. And he said to me that, you know, I'm really struck at how

02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:51.100
[Guest]: much progress Kuala Lumpur has made. Because I had come here in 1973. I mean, this is he's

02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:58.780
[Guest]: going there in 1990. In 1973, as Deputy Commerce Minister, and has really made huge progress.

02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:03.220
[Guest]: And I said, you know, that's absolutely true. Because I used to visit here in the early

02:24:03.220 --> 02:24:09.380
[Guest]: 70s, from the World Bank. And it's now unrecognizable. So he said, Why do you think that's true?

02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:13.220
[Guest]: I said, because they've done reforms, and we don't want to do reform. He said, then

02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:17.260
[Guest]: you write me a paper on what we should do. So I'd been working on this other thing, I

02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:23.380
[Guest]: quickly polished it up, gave it to him. You know, I have a feeling he understood that

02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:29.980
[Guest]: this was necessary. But he was, of course, running a very shaky government. But he had

02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:35.900
[Guest]: the he had sufficient conviction, to say, send it to the cabinet secretary. So it can

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:41.820
[Guest]: be discussed in the committee of secretaries. He sent it to the cabinet secretary, Vinod

02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:46.220
[Guest]: Pandey was then the cabinet, whom I knew. And Vinod liked the paper. And he said, Okay,

02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:51.660
[Guest]: you'll have a discussion. And it's interesting, you might think that Vinod was not at all.

02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:59.020
[Guest]: But I mean, if you posed him with a kind of a holistic picture, he sort of says quite

02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:04.100
[Guest]: a good paper. We had this discussion. And of course, in the discussion, I mean, Amarnath

02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:09.940
[Guest]: supported it, Amarnath Varma, he was an industry minister. Finance Ministry was not supportive,

02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:15.180
[Guest]: but Madhu Dandavate was not in favor of all this liberalization and so on. Planning Commission

02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:19.740
[Guest]: was not supportive, because Planning Commission felt why is the PMO doing this, because we

02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:25.220
[Guest]: are preparing the midterm approach to the next plan. So you're treading on our toes,

02:25:25.220 --> 02:25:31.180
[Guest]: etc. And there was all this big discussion, leftists very negative. But then when the

02:25:31.180 --> 02:25:37.820
[Guest]: when the thing was discussed, several thoughtful economists wrote saying good things. So it

02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:42.060
[Guest]: was not the case that everybody was negative. I feel that there was more support for these

02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:50.140
[Guest]: ideas than surfaced, because I don't think we pose these things in a in a composite manner,

02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:56.740
[Guest]: the way the M document did. Well, I mean, the VP Singh government didn't last, but it

02:25:56.740 --> 02:26:02.540
[Guest]: exited in the middle of a first rate crisis. And by the time Narsimha Rao's government

02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:08.260
[Guest]: came back, I mean, you only had about one month of imports in reserves. So it was a

02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:14.660
[Guest]: very clear situation where something had to be done an opportunity to do something. And

02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:20.900
[Guest]: I'm glad that they I mean, that was really, it was Manmohan Singh who would have picked

02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:26.060
[Guest]: up all this persuaded the finance minister that we must do this. I had said in the paper

02:26:26.060 --> 02:26:34.560
[Guest]: that you know, we should reduce the customs duties quite a bit. And let that be reflected

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:40.460
[Guest]: in the exchange rate in a gradualist kind of way, through an EXIM script or something,

02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:45.500
[Guest]: which is more or less what was done. I mean, first a devaluation, then the EXIM script,

02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:53.020
[Guest]: then move to a dual exchange rate. Things moved very, very quickly in that 1991 period.

02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:58.260
[Guest]: And the number of things that were done so quickly, I don't think we've ever had that

02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:04.540
[Guest]: much change. We never had it before. We probably need something of that kind moving ahead.

02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:09.620
[Guest]: Because the world is changing, and posing new challenges to us.

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:13.580
[Amit Varma]: You know, speaking about the imperatives of the political imperatives of VP Singh, you

02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:17.940
[Amit Varma]: have this lovely quote by Dr. Manmohan Singh, which is quote, politicians have to be in

02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:22.180
[Amit Varma]: power long enough to act like statesman, stop quote, which goes back to what we were discussing

02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:26.740
[Amit Varma]: earlier, how political incentives just go in such different directions. And you've given

02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:32.340
[Amit Varma]: examples of, you know, VP Singh's preoccupation with short term objectives and all of that,

02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:36.620
[Amit Varma]: you know, I'd encourage listeners to read the book. It's just such a thrilling thing

02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:42.020
[Amit Varma]: now after all these years to actually read the inside story of what went on. My question

02:27:42.020 --> 02:27:48.260
[Amit Varma]: here is this, that I feel that, like one thing that I have said, and perhaps this is too

02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:53.260
[Amit Varma]: negative is that politics corrodes character. And let me explain my reasoning behind that.

02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:59.380
[Amit Varma]: The reasoning is that once you enter politics, your raison d'etre necessarily is coming to

02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:04.100
[Amit Varma]: power no matter what it takes the will to power as it were. So you might enter politics

02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:09.520
[Amit Varma]: with a certain set of principles that I want social justice, or I want this or I want that.

02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:14.140
[Amit Varma]: But the moment you enter that game, you are playing an entirely different game, you are

02:28:14.140 --> 02:28:18.660
[Amit Varma]: raising money for elections, there are quid pro quos involved in that you have to appeal

02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:23.980
[Amit Varma]: to certain constituencies, you have to pay a price for that. And eventually over a period

02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:28.340
[Amit Varma]: of time, if you stay long enough, your core beliefs don't matter, because you have none

02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:33.580
[Amit Varma]: everything is about the will to power. And when we speak about, you know, you speak about

02:28:33.580 --> 02:28:37.540
[Amit Varma]: how you worked at the finance ministry when VP Singh was finance minister under Rajiv

02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:42.060
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi, and he was so open to trying new things and just all of that. But when it actually

02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:46.220
[Amit Varma]: came to actions when he was Prime Minister, these were constraints, you know, nobody can

02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:51.020
[Amit Varma]: do anything if they're in his shoes, they're going to perhaps do the same things. But on

02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:57.980
[Amit Varma]: the other hand, once in a while, you do come across politicians who are decisive like Mr.

02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:03.820
[Amit Varma]: Narsimha Rao did, for example, the kind of support that certainly in that initial period,

02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:08.820
[Amit Varma]: which he gave Manmohan Singh and all of you to kind of do what happened. So what is your

02:29:08.820 --> 02:29:13.900
[Amit Varma]: sense of this? You've interacted with many, many, many politicians, and I won't ask you

02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:18.780
[Amit Varma]: to take any names or give examples. But in general, what do you feel about this? Is there

02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:22.900
[Amit Varma]: a certain sympathy you feel for them given their constraints? Is there something to the

02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:29.940
[Amit Varma]: notion that the will to power being the key imperative, that you always have to work around

02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:36.380
[Amit Varma]: that that to make a policy accepted by a politician, you first have to make it sellable and show

02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:38.380
[Amit Varma]: them why it is good for the electorate?

02:29:38.380 --> 02:29:44.940
[Guest]: No, I'm afraid that's probably true. And not just in India, but anywhere. I mean, a lot

02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:50.340
[Guest]: I think depends on the quality of the politics. I mean, if the quality of the politics is

02:29:50.340 --> 02:29:56.660
[Guest]: such that in the end, while you can manipulate politics, you can do a little bit of teasing

02:29:56.660 --> 02:30:04.540
[Guest]: out a certain outcome. As long as the political system rewards good performance, politician

02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:09.900
[Guest]: will have a strong incentive to show good performance. And a lot of that has to do also

02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:17.180
[Guest]: with political education of the public. I mean, the public has to know that some kind

02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:24.340
[Guest]: of political handouts are really not good for even the public at large. But it's very

02:30:24.340 --> 02:30:31.460
[Guest]: difficult to resolve that problem. In practice. I'm not giving a very good answer because

02:30:31.460 --> 02:30:37.180
[Guest]: what I'm really saying is, it is a problem and I don't know how to solve it. But I think

02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:45.260
[Guest]: the only answer I can give is that you should hope that politics is such that a large part

02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:57.460
[Guest]: of electoral support will be triggered by good performance in areas that are important.

02:30:57.460 --> 02:31:02.980
[Guest]: As long as you can have that, yes, there'll be little diversion here and there, but broad

02:31:02.980 --> 02:31:06.340
[Guest]: thrust will be in the right direction.

02:31:06.340 --> 02:31:10.780
[Amit Varma]: So taking off on that, you know, when we think of the political marketplace, it's a marketplace

02:31:10.780 --> 02:31:15.260
[Amit Varma]: of demand and supply. Politicians are the supply end of it and the people at large are

02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:21.380
[Amit Varma]: the demand end of it, right? And I've always sort of held that there's no point if you're

02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:26.700
[Amit Varma]: a reformer or if you're an activist for X policy or Y policy, to just speak to the supply

02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:30.860
[Amit Varma]: end because supply will always respond to demand. So you have to speak to the demand

02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:35.540
[Amit Varma]: end. If your ideas become popular, then the politician will automatically gravitate to

02:31:35.540 --> 02:31:41.420
[Amit Varma]: carrying them out. And this is what makes me feel a little despondent, because number

02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:47.420
[Amit Varma]: one, many of the core ideas, which I'm assuming you'd share with me and which are core truths

02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:51.500
[Amit Varma]: of economics, like the positive sumness of things, that for someone to win, someone else

02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:56.500
[Amit Varma]: doesn't have to lose, every trade makes both people better off, or something like the notion

02:31:56.500 --> 02:32:01.260
[Amit Varma]: of spontaneous order, which we also mentioned earlier, are counterintuitive. You know, we've

02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:05.500
[Amit Varma]: evolved in prehistoric times, we lived in small tribes, our brains have evolved to think

02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:10.180
[Amit Varma]: of the world in zero-sum ways because of the scarcity of those times and so on. We've evolved

02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:13.900
[Amit Varma]: to think with an engineering top-down mindset that you got to build it, you got to control

02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:20.900
[Amit Varma]: it, that spontaneous order is just completely counterintuitive to us. So that's one aspect

02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:25.460
[Amit Varma]: that many of these essential truths about the world are counterintuitive. And the other

02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:32.700
[Amit Varma]: aspect is that in popular, in the conventional view that is popular out there, is full of

02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:38.100
[Amit Varma]: all kinds of fallacies, which is why if at a time of scarcity, some particular thing

02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:42.300
[Amit Varma]: gets too expensive, there will be a popular demand ki price control lagao. Now, we know

02:32:42.300 --> 02:32:46.780
[Amit Varma]: price controls lead to scarcities, but that's going to be the popular demand. And similarly,

02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:52.300
[Amit Varma]: and popular demands will always be based on intentions and not outcomes, you know, which

02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:57.220
[Amit Varma]: is the classic thing that goes wrong. So I don't know if there's a question here, I seem

02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:02.340
[Amit Varma]: to be underscoring what you were saying earlier. But my sense is that how difficult a challenge

02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:09.060
[Amit Varma]: do you think this is? And therefore, do you think that, you know, people like yourself

02:33:09.060 --> 02:33:15.500
[Amit Varma]: then also have a responsibility to be public intellectuals and put their ideas out there

02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:20.220
[Amit Varma]: in the discourse so that they are being read all the time, like what I would have loved

02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:24.580
[Amit Varma]: both you and Dr. Singh for all the great service that you perform to our country. But if you

02:33:24.580 --> 02:33:30.380
[Amit Varma]: were also prolific columnist, I think in some small way, the needle would move in one direction.

02:33:30.380 --> 02:33:34.580
[Amit Varma]: And this is really with hindsight, I'm saying and no doubt you had other things to do and

02:33:34.580 --> 02:33:39.940
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth. But speaking of the current generation of people, you know, if you were

02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:45.520
[Amit Varma]: young today, you know, is this how difficult do you think is this task of changing the

02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:52.300
[Guest]: demand end of because then reforms don't have to be by stealth? Well, I mean, you can't

02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:58.860
[Guest]: just operate on the demand side, absolutely lines of the electorate. I mean, this is what

02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:06.180
[Guest]: in a in a in a contested political situation. This is what parties do. I mean, it's opposition

02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:10.780
[Guest]: parties that have to educate the public that look, these are the situation, this is the

02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:14.660
[Guest]: situation, this is what needs to be done. And if something not being done, then this

02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:19.940
[Guest]: is going to be the consequence. So but clearly, you're right that the thinking crowd, the

02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:24.780
[Guest]: opinion makers, so to speak, they have a big role to play. But mind you, this is one of

02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:30.020
[Guest]: the things that we were discussing earlier. You know, in the in the world of social media,

02:34:30.020 --> 02:34:37.460
[Guest]: this old idea of opinion makers has disappeared. I mean, there was a time when people thought

02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:42.780
[Guest]: that if X or Y or Z were to write a paper writer op ed, everybody would say, well, you

02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:48.480
[Guest]: know, that must be right. But today, opinions are being made on the basis of WhatsApp messages

02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:53.540
[Guest]: sent out by all kinds of people. So frankly, it's not a world that I understand too well.

02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:59.220
[Guest]: And this is not just India. People are saying this around the world. So somehow, how do

02:34:59.220 --> 02:35:07.420
[Guest]: you communicate with the electorate? How do opinion makers make opinions that itself needs

02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:16.020
[Guest]: to be put on the table in a much more frank manner? So we can work out how these things

02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:22.140
[Guest]: are going to move. But in the end, it has to be mediated through political parties.

02:35:22.140 --> 02:35:28.020
[Guest]: Because in a democracy, if it is political parties that are seeking support, it's for

02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:32.900
[Guest]: the political parties to put these things across.

02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:39.020
[Amit Varma]: I agree. And at the same time, I think that a lot of politics happens outside political

02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:45.540
[Amit Varma]: parties and, you know, outside elections. You know, I mean, if you write a column today

02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:50.000
[Amit Varma]: about tomorrow about a particular political situation, that is also an act of politics

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.740
[Amit Varma]: that you're getting your views out there for people to consider and think about and so

02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:59.060
[Amit Varma]: on. So I think there is something there. But I agree with you that it's it's kind of a

02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:04.860
[Amit Varma]: tough task. I want to now ask another question that all that is related to the question I

02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:10.900
[Amit Varma]: asked earlier about the core beliefs of politicians, except here is about the core beliefs of people

02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:16.740
[Amit Varma]: and the core beliefs even of say, economists or policymakers, like one of the disturbing

02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:23.500
[Amit Varma]: trends that I've seen over the last few years, is that I have realised that many people who

02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:28.900
[Amit Varma]: from all sides of the political divide, who espoused principles, were actually just wedded

02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:34.940
[Amit Varma]: to a tribe, and that the thinking is tribal, and the principles are contingent. For example,

02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:41.960
[Amit Varma]: in the US, we have seen how the entire Republican Party was just defaced and demeaned by Trump,

02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:47.140
[Amit Varma]: and shifted over suddenly to supporting Trump, where a lot of what Trump preached was actually

02:36:47.140 --> 02:36:52.140
[Amit Varma]: against core Republican values, for example, his opposition to free trade, and so on and

02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:57.240
[Amit Varma]: so forth, you know, and many of the positions that he took to imagine conservatives or libertarian

02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:01.620
[Amit Varma]: supporting that is outrageous. But as it turned out, many in the party didn't care about the

02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:06.500
[Amit Varma]: principles of voice, they just cared about that they are part of this tribe. Similarly,

02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:13.700
[Amit Varma]: in India, I had a deep disquiet around the time of demonetisation, where many of the

02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:19.340
[Amit Varma]: economists who I think would immediately and instinctively see how utterly daft it is,

02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:22.980
[Amit Varma]: didn't say anything because they were part of the establishment in some way, whether

02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:27.380
[Amit Varma]: it's Arvind Panagaria in the Planning Commission, or so on and so forth, you know, Bebek Debroy

02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:32.460
[Amit Varma]: was also there, and people within the ministries and so on and so forth, even though they obviously

02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:37.820
[Amit Varma]: know that this is daft. And there are two ways of looking at that one way of looking

02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:42.020
[Amit Varma]: at that is that they are gradualists, they are realists, they are within the system,

02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:45.820
[Amit Varma]: they are thinking that there's no point my speaking out now, if I can make small changes

02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:50.100
[Amit Varma]: on the margins, which make this country better off, I'll play that game. And I understand

02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:55.900
[Amit Varma]: that. But at the same time, I feel like a lot of these people who I admired, because

02:37:55.900 --> 02:38:00.780
[Amit Varma]: the stated principles seem to match mine, have abandoned those principles, because they've

02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:08.020
[Amit Varma]: chosen the tribe, and that's a tribe and those principles were just posturing, you know,

02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:13.980
[Amit Varma]: so in my mind, it's like the world is now divided into these two categories of people,

02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:18.020
[Amit Varma]: people who actually believe in what they say, and people who say what they say, because

02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:22.940
[Amit Varma]: at that moment, it's convenient and it's contingent. And that's the tribe they're part of, and

02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:27.540
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth. And it depresses me a lot, because I think the former category,

02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:30.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, and people like you and Dr. Singh would obviously be in that former category

02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:35.420
[Amit Varma]: where you have your core set of principles, and you always fight for that. But so many

02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:40.780
[Amit Varma]: other people who are also in prominent positions who are also public intellectuals in some

02:38:40.780 --> 02:38:44.620
[Amit Varma]: ways, don't. So what are sort of your thoughts on this?

02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:51.700
[Guest]: Well, look, I would hope that at least public intellectuals should always be speaking, whatever

02:38:51.700 --> 02:38:59.220
[Guest]: their principles are, trying to explain them. I recognize that when people are in government,

02:38:59.220 --> 02:39:04.540
[Guest]: they're not expected to say things critical of the government. So you know, I mean, I

02:39:04.540 --> 02:39:10.940
[Guest]: think on you mentioned demonetization, I didn't expect that anybody in government would have

02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:16.820
[Guest]: criticized it once it was decided that it was going to be done. But I think when you

02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:23.420
[Guest]: talked about the Republican Party, you made a more basic point there. Because you know,

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:28.780
[Guest]: the Republicans are not in that sense, part of government, they're not part of the administration.

02:39:28.780 --> 02:39:36.260
[Guest]: So what you're seeing there is a political party is moving in a particular direction,

02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:40.980
[Guest]: because it feels that's where its base is going. In the old days, maybe there was a

02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:47.740
[Guest]: set of principles that they supported, and there was some assumption that the base would

02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:53.980
[Guest]: kind of follow them. Here, they're following the base. And I think in a democratic environment,

02:39:53.980 --> 02:40:01.300
[Guest]: you cannot avoid that. If that happens, you have to ask yourself, why does it happen?

02:40:01.300 --> 02:40:07.180
[Guest]: I think this is part of, you know, the, it goes back to what we were discussing earlier,

02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:14.220
[Guest]: that unlike the situation 20 years ago, where there was much greater clarity about how the

02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:21.540
[Guest]: world is moving, this is a period when there isn't that clarity. So many, many kind of

02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:30.420
[Guest]: things that were taken for granted, very recently, are now up for grabs. How you handle that

02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:34.260
[Guest]: is another matter altogether. Not an easy one to answer.

02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:37.420
[Amit Varma]: Is there any big issue on which you've changed your mind?

02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:46.300
[Guest]: No, I wouldn't like to say, I mean, perceptions obviously change. Perhaps I would say that

02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:52.980
[Guest]: I was never of the view that the right policy to follow was a kind of mindless opening up

02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:59.220
[Guest]: of the economy. Remember, we were ridiculously closed. So it was a no brainer that we had

02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:07.020
[Guest]: to open up. But I'm willing to consider the fact that in the present circumstances, if

02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:13.460
[Guest]: we want to develop a competitive industry, you need to do something to support that industry.

02:41:13.460 --> 02:41:21.420
[Guest]: But for example, I would be in favor of a support that is, as it were, not connected

02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:27.860
[Guest]: with protection, but is connected with giving either subsidizing certain things, or helping

02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:34.780
[Guest]: them do certain things, and so on. For example, the PLI system, which as many people have

02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:41.100
[Guest]: criticized is mere protectionism. It's not mere protectionism, because it's giving it

02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:48.380
[Guest]: a predetermined amount of support. What would become dangerous is if you have a PLI, and

02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:53.420
[Guest]: when the fellows don't succeed, they then start lobbying for higher import duties. I

02:41:53.420 --> 02:41:58.380
[Guest]: would say that if you're going to have a PLI scheme, it should be an understood part of

02:41:58.380 --> 02:42:04.780
[Guest]: the whole thing, that the duties on this product will not increase, and will actually phase

02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:11.940
[Guest]: down. Given that, okay, you're giving some support. But if you don't put in that as a

02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:19.140
[Guest]: condition, nothing stops people from collecting the money under the PLI, and then saying for

02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:24.820
[Guest]: a variety of reasons, we can't compete against somebody else. So why don't you ban the import

02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:32.660
[Guest]: or jack up duties? And if we go down that route, it'll be very, very disturbing. I think

02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:39.340
[Guest]: the other issue that I'm kind of struggling with, actually, is what do we do in the whole

02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:46.100
[Guest]: area of trade negotiations? I mean, our traditional approach correctly, is that multilateral trade

02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:52.400
[Guest]: negotiations are the best. But the problem is the world is kind of turned away from them.

02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:58.060
[Guest]: And as a result, you've got groups formed, which are forming plurilateral agreements.

02:42:58.060 --> 02:43:04.860
[Guest]: Historically, we've not been in favor of plurilateral agreements. And it's certainly true that if

02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:09.920
[Guest]: you could do it multilaterally, that's better. But if that's not happening, then should we

02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:14.860
[Guest]: ignore all plurilateral arrangements? I'm not sure. I think we should look for which

02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:21.700
[Guest]: is the most sensible plurilateral regime to join, and join it and try and work from inside.

02:43:21.700 --> 02:43:29.780
[Guest]: That's why I was in favor of RCEP, for example. Maybe RCEP was not very popular, because China

02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:36.740
[Guest]: is a member. I don't know whether this new thing, the Indo-Pacific economic framework

02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:44.260
[Guest]: will actually end up being a serious kind of arrangement, which could presage a plurilateral

02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:50.380
[Guest]: trade bloc. But if it is, we should be in it. So you know, these are issues that as

02:43:50.380 --> 02:43:58.860
[Guest]: the world changes, we need to, we need to kind of define if you like a second best solution,

02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:03.380
[Guest]: given that the best is multilateral, but that's not happening.

02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:07.980
[Amit Varma]: Let's go back to talking about the reforms period a little bit. At one point, you write

02:44:07.980 --> 02:44:13.220
[Amit Varma]: in your book that when Narsimha Rao was asked, why has he taken a 180 degree turn, he said,

02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:17.180
[Amit Varma]: quote, I have not turned at all, I am facing in the same direction. It is a world that

02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:22.580
[Amit Varma]: has turned 180 degrees, stop quote, which is kind of glib, because in a sense, he was

02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:29.380
[Amit Varma]: sort of forced to turn a little bit. Now, you know, that heady part where you discuss

02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:33.860
[Amit Varma]: those few weeks where, you know, one after the other, you have the two step devaluation

02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:38.660
[Amit Varma]: of the rupee, you have, you know, so much happening in terms of trade policy, industrial

02:44:38.660 --> 02:44:44.080
[Amit Varma]: policy, it's heady, it's brilliant. What I found even more impressive was what happens

02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.020
[Amit Varma]: in the next couple of decades after that, where as you point out, there is this enormous

02:44:49.020 --> 02:44:55.260
[Amit Varma]: continuity, both in terms of the political level, where you have people, you know, initially

02:44:55.260 --> 02:45:02.440
[Amit Varma]: Narsimha Rao, Manmohan Singh, Chidambaram, then later, Deve Gowda and IK Gujarat continue

02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:07.400
[Amit Varma]: the same policies with Chidambaram as FM and then Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government where

02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:12.660
[Amit Varma]: you have Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh, Arun Shourie, just doing remarkable things. And

02:45:12.660 --> 02:45:17.580
[Amit Varma]: then of course, UPA one where you guys come back at the bureaucratic level, you know,

02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:21.540
[Amit Varma]: A. N. Verma, Rang Rajan, Bimal Jalal, Nitin Desai, Vijay Kelkar, it's a it's a litany

02:45:21.540 --> 02:45:27.620
[Amit Varma]: of names and a litany of people who should really be better known to the world. And then,

02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:32.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, so one question is that what made this continuity possible, because it is not

02:45:32.820 --> 02:45:37.780
[Amit Varma]: like there was a demand for it. You had in the political marketplace, you had all of

02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:43.580
[Amit Varma]: these people doing stuff, which because they felt it was the right thing to do, even though,

02:45:43.580 --> 02:45:46.540
[Amit Varma]: you know, you would have imagined that the opposition comes to power, they will want

02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:50.620
[Amit Varma]: to define themselves as different from the previous guys. But no, there is this thread

02:45:50.620 --> 02:45:57.500
[Amit Varma]: of continuity that goes on till the end of UPA one. And, you know, so where do you think

02:45:57.500 --> 02:46:05.700
[Guest]: it came from? Was it a happy accident? Well, I mean, I like to think that success successive

02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:11.260
[Guest]: governments, obviously, when when you have an election, it's fair game, each political

02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:18.940
[Guest]: party criticize the other. When one of them wins, they then lay out their own policy,

02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:24.180
[Guest]: they have the freedom to reverse policy. And what what was remarkable is that they didn't

02:46:24.180 --> 02:46:30.100
[Guest]: reverse it. Okay. Particularly when Atal Bihari Vajpayee came in, because you know, some of

02:46:30.100 --> 02:46:35.420
[Guest]: some of the stuff that was being done, which is that look, we are not that wedded to the

02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:41.500
[Guest]: public sector that was part of BJP also. But opening up foreign investment, these were

02:46:41.500 --> 02:46:46.540
[Guest]: not things that were part of the BJP. But he gave a very clear signal that that's the

02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:53.620
[Guest]: way he wanted to go. Now, I like to think that basically, while people posture in the

02:46:53.620 --> 02:47:01.180
[Guest]: political space, they're also aware of what are the underlying technical consensuses.

02:47:01.180 --> 02:47:06.140
[Guest]: And there's more commonality on that than people think from the outside. I mean, that's

02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:10.700
[Guest]: the only way of explaining it. And in the case of the Vajpayee government, they actually

02:47:10.700 --> 02:47:18.220
[Guest]: said things like continuity with change. So it was it was it was a formula that they thought

02:47:18.220 --> 02:47:26.380
[Guest]: was perfectly good. I mean, whether we will keep having that is the real issue. I think

02:47:26.380 --> 02:47:33.820
[Guest]: what you need is, what you need is a much more continuous discussion of what is the

02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:40.020
[Guest]: underlying consensus, which will make sense. And if you have a consensus on that, the politics

02:47:40.020 --> 02:47:45.020
[Guest]: will take care of itself. That's the crux. Now to have that consensus, you need a lot

02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:50.540
[Guest]: of debate. I mean, you cannot have a consensus, unless you have a debate which takes into

02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:57.900
[Guest]: account different points of view. And I think we need we need more debate, in my view.

02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:01.140
[Amit Varma]: In your book, you have this, you know, lovely anecdote about how you were sitting with Mr.

02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:05.700
[Amit Varma]: Vajpayee and he was asked about, you know, is there any continuity and all that and,

02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:09.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, the balance between continuity and change. And he said, look at Montaik. Montaik

02:48:09.820 --> 02:48:15.300
[Amit Varma]: is the continuity, I am the change, which is, I mean, you know, I was very flattered

02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:20.420
[Guest]: by the Prime Minister saying that. I think there was a particular reason, you know, I

02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:25.900
[Guest]: mean, the BJP government had done what they'd always said they would do, which is to test

02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:32.980
[Guest]: the nuclear weapon. And there were massive reaction to that. I think he wanted to emphasize

02:48:32.980 --> 02:48:38.740
[Guest]: that look on the economic side, this is something we've always said we'll do. And even the Congress

02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:45.660
[Guest]: supported it. So it wasn't just a, but I think he rightly judged that what mattered to the

02:48:45.660 --> 02:48:51.140
[Guest]: rest of the world was whether India's economic policy was going to be dismantled. And he

02:48:51.140 --> 02:48:57.260
[Guest]: gave a very clear signal that it was not. I mean, that was a good thing to have done.

02:48:57.260 --> 02:49:01.420
[Amit Varma]: So one of my guests on the show, Pooja Mehra, wrote this book called The Lost Decade. And

02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:08.340
[Amit Varma]: the narrative of that essentially is that look from 91 to 2011, we had this golden period,

02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:14.780
[Amit Varma]: everything was great, roughly till 2011. And to her, you know, moment which changes everything,

02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:18.540
[Amit Varma]: which I know you don't quite agree with, but nevertheless, for her a moment which kind

02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:23.500
[Amit Varma]: of changes everything are the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, because because of that Mr. Chidambaram

02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:28.580
[Amit Varma]: gets shifted from the finance ministry to the Home Ministry, because it's felt that

02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:33.700
[Amit Varma]: that's where you really need someone to, you know, do a strong job and do an efficient

02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:39.020
[Amit Varma]: job, which the previous incumbent wasn't. And Dr. Singh takes over the finance ministry

02:49:39.020 --> 02:49:44.220
[Amit Varma]: himself, but then he has to go through this heart operation. So instead Pranab Mukherjee

02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:49.500
[Amit Varma]: becomes finance minister, reportedly at Sonia's behest, and remains finance minister for a

02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:53.860
[Amit Varma]: period of time. And as Pooja points out, a lot of things start going wrong at that point.

02:49:53.860 --> 02:49:59.420
[Amit Varma]: And that's when our downfall really starts. And then at a later point in time, they managed

02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:04.180
[Amit Varma]: to kick him upstairs and Mr. Chidambaram does come back and, but it's too late, they lose

02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:10.540
[Amit Varma]: the 2014 elections. And then remarkably, Arun Jaitley and his guys, you know, show some

02:50:10.540 --> 02:50:16.700
[Amit Varma]: continuity for a year or so, till basically political imperatives and so on, change matters

02:50:16.700 --> 02:50:21.740
[Amit Varma]: and everything kind of goes to hell with our economy from there. But the downturn in our

02:50:21.740 --> 02:50:26.580
[Amit Varma]: economy is not just a Modi thing. I mean, I think this government has made it considerably

02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:32.620
[Amit Varma]: worse, but sort of happened towards the end of UPA 1, when that kind of shift took over.

02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:37.300
[Amit Varma]: And now I know you won't want to comment on personalities per se, but just in talking

02:50:37.300 --> 02:50:42.660
[Amit Varma]: about the difference in sort of the movement and the direction, because it seems to me

02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:47.580
[Amit Varma]: that that continuity kind of ended then. And it seems to me that today from the outside

02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:52.220
[Amit Varma]: as an outsider, when I look at what's happening here, I don't see where is the constituency

02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:56.300
[Amit Varma]: for reform, per se, or how strong is it, you would of course know better, even though you're

02:50:56.300 --> 02:51:00.740
[Amit Varma]: outside government now, but you know, you would know better. So, I wouldn't know better.

02:51:00.740 --> 02:51:04.540
[Guest]: I mean, being outside, I would know the same as you do. No, let me say that, you know,

02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:10.020
[Guest]: I think if you look at, if you look at what the government says, forget about demonetization,

02:51:10.020 --> 02:51:16.180
[Guest]: which most economists felt was disruptive. But to be fair, the demonetization effect

02:51:16.180 --> 02:51:22.500
[Guest]: would not have lasted more than six or eight months. Okay. Then you had GST, which many

02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:27.460
[Guest]: people and I think there's some point in it, it could have been handled better. The reform

02:51:27.460 --> 02:51:33.660
[Guest]: itself in my view was long overdue. Glad that the government and it was the BJP that opposed

02:51:33.660 --> 02:51:39.060
[Guest]: it when they were not in government. They had good sense to bring it in. Probably handled

02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:47.180
[Guest]: not too well. But it's slowly kind of getting back to some sort of square one. There's talk

02:51:47.180 --> 02:51:53.340
[Guest]: that they're going to bring about the key reforms that are needed in the rate structure.

02:51:53.340 --> 02:51:57.140
[Guest]: I think there's some committee looking at it right now. So, I don't know what they're

02:51:57.140 --> 02:52:02.060
[Guest]: going to do. But you know, if they do that, that will be not bad at all. For the rest,

02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:08.780
[Guest]: I think most of what is being talked about is really a continuation of what was in any

02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:14.780
[Guest]: case thought to be the right thing to do. Digitalization, more infrastructure, all of

02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:21.020
[Guest]: those things. This government has given a very clear signal also that FDI is welcome.

02:52:21.020 --> 02:52:26.700
[Guest]: So the old fear that the government would be anti-FDI is no longer true. We have to

02:52:26.700 --> 02:52:35.180
[Guest]: wait and see at what pace these reforms actually get implemented. I mean, in a way, you know,

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:40.620
[Guest]: the last few years have been very difficult to judge because the economy was clobbered

02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:45.900
[Guest]: by the pandemic, which was not a government event. I mean, you could argue whether the

02:52:45.900 --> 02:52:50.860
[Guest]: pandemic could have been handled a little differently or not. But by and large, everybody

02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:57.780
[Guest]: did badly. After the pandemic, we have recovered. So those who might have said that we're not

02:52:57.780 --> 02:53:02.460
[Guest]: going to recover, clearly wrong. But I never thought that we were not going to recover.

02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:07.140
[Guest]: We have now recovered. We are back to sort of pre-pandemic levels. Now, the real question

02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:12.700
[Guest]: is, are we going to get back to the kind of growth that was there before the pandemic,

02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:18.300
[Guest]: which is sort of around 4%, 5%? Or are we going to do better? The current projections,

02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:24.100
[Guest]: which many people seem to accept, are that we might actually get 7%. Okay. I mean, if

02:53:24.100 --> 02:53:30.300
[Guest]: we get 7% in this year, that would be a good performance, in my view. And if in that period,

02:53:30.300 --> 02:53:34.780
[Guest]: some of what has been talked about on the reforms front actually gets done, that would

02:53:34.780 --> 02:53:43.940
[Guest]: also be good. The thing that I feel most worried about is the lack of clarity on openness as

02:53:43.940 --> 02:53:49.820
[Guest]: far as import duties are concerned. And are we going to sort of, I mean, on the one hand,

02:53:49.820 --> 02:53:55.540
[Guest]: the government talks about integrating with global supply chains. This, to my mind, is

02:53:55.540 --> 02:54:00.900
[Guest]: the right thing to do. But you know, we shouldn't think that integrating with global supply

02:54:00.900 --> 02:54:06.180
[Guest]: chains means that the entire chain is going to be built in India, and then we're just

02:54:06.180 --> 02:54:12.260
[Guest]: going to export. It really means that we ought to create an environment in which as people

02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:18.020
[Guest]: lock into different types of global supply chains, they think of India as being one of

02:54:18.020 --> 02:54:23.860
[Guest]: the portions of this multi-country kind of chain. Now, these multi-country chains are

02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:29.060
[Guest]: not expanding as much, and the Chinese one is actually contracting. But that gives us

02:54:29.060 --> 02:54:34.980
[Guest]: an opportunity. People are going to look for somebody that would take the place that China

02:54:34.980 --> 02:54:41.020
[Guest]: earlier had. I don't mean replace it. I mean, we are very far behind China, but it gives

02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:48.220
[Guest]: us a space to do better. And in my view, if we want to give that signal, we should definitely

02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:56.220
[Guest]: not be going down the route of raising import duties, etc. That is going to be a real test.

02:54:56.220 --> 02:55:03.340
[Guest]: If the government actually were to address the question, how do we become part of global

02:55:03.340 --> 02:55:11.300
[Guest]: value chain, get advice from reliable people, experts in the private sector, and then take

02:55:11.300 --> 02:55:20.020
[Guest]: action on that basis, I think you might well see a recovery of growth momentum. If it doesn't,

02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:25.580
[Guest]: and we go back to, say, 4-5% growth, you know, that will still be better than the rest of

02:55:25.580 --> 02:55:31.140
[Guest]: the world, because the rest of the world is very clobbered as a result of Ukraine. But

02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:37.100
[Guest]: it will not be enough for generating the kind of employment and meeting the kind of aspirations

02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:42.180
[Guest]: that have been raised. And I think the employment thing is really quite critical. We need to

02:55:42.180 --> 02:55:49.100
[Guest]: get back to 7% growth for the next several years, if we want to provide halfway decent

02:55:49.100 --> 02:55:56.660
[Amit Varma]: jobs for the youth in the country. There's a sort of one great illustration of how gradual

02:55:56.660 --> 02:56:01.500
[Amit Varma]: change can be, is what you point out in your book about how it took 31 years to get from

02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:06.940
[Amit Varma]: Modvad to GST, right, over this entire cycle. And I think the implementation of GST was

02:56:06.940 --> 02:56:12.420
[Amit Varma]: so remarkably botched up that, at least for the short to medium term, GST was a huge negative

02:56:12.420 --> 02:56:16.500
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, my sense from all the business people that I speak to and what a pain it

02:56:16.500 --> 02:56:22.060
[Amit Varma]: was and, you know, that's the sense I get. And again, it also shows how a reform that

02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:27.620
[Amit Varma]: is otherwise fundamentally good, like, you know, like the original conception of GST

02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:32.180
[Amit Varma]: can run into problems, once it makes its way through the political economy and takes whatever

02:56:32.180 --> 02:56:37.660
[Amit Varma]: shape it does. Like another example of a great reform that has, you know, been struggling

02:56:37.660 --> 02:56:41.700
[Amit Varma]: because of state capacity issues and so on, is something that friends of mine worked on

02:56:41.700 --> 02:56:48.620
[Amit Varma]: the IBC, right, the bankruptcy code, which is a fantastic reform, everybody agrees it's

02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:53.660
[Amit Varma]: needed, but has not proved to be as transformative as you would think simply because state capacity

02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:54.660
[Guest]: issues are there.

02:56:54.660 --> 02:56:58.900
[Guest]: Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan Well, I think in the case of the IBC, yes,

02:56:58.900 --> 02:57:04.100
[Guest]: there was a pushback, and we should have anticipated this. But you know, the pandemic mucked that

02:57:04.100 --> 02:57:09.780
[Guest]: up quite a bit. Because given what happened to the pandemic, pressure on the RBI is quite

02:57:09.780 --> 02:57:14.860
[Guest]: understandable, that look, given that the economy is clobbered, don't send these guys

02:57:14.860 --> 02:57:20.660
[Guest]: through the IBC route. But now that we are recovering from the pandemic, that should

02:57:20.660 --> 02:57:25.860
[Guest]: not be a concern anymore. And we'll have to wait and see. But yes, I agree with you, the

02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:32.340
[Guest]: IBC is extremely important, hasn't done so well in the last year. Maybe the pandemic

02:57:32.340 --> 02:57:37.700
[Guest]: is a reason why it didn't do so well. But again, the test is in the next year. You know,

02:57:37.700 --> 02:57:43.740
[Guest]: these institutional reforms, I mean, if they get delayed by a year, but then they get back

02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:51.620
[Guest]: on track, it's not a bad thing. GST, for example, yes, maybe it was rushed too much, they didn't

02:57:51.620 --> 02:57:56.380
[Guest]: prepare enough. Maybe the software wasn't ready, whatever it is, there were too many

02:57:56.380 --> 02:58:04.900
[Guest]: glitches. But we are now we are told that the GST Council is coming up with some fundamental

02:58:04.900 --> 02:58:10.300
[Guest]: rate structure reform. If they do a good rate structure reform, that will be a very important

02:58:10.300 --> 02:58:15.700
[Amit Varma]: step. But we have to see what they do. And the other thing that sort of worries me is

02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:21.340
[Amit Varma]: that even reforms which are needed, can get embedded in a narrative battle. Because at

02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:27.220
[Amit Varma]: this moment in time, you know, the opposition will oppose everything the government does.

02:58:27.220 --> 02:58:31.300
[Amit Varma]: And they will always be pitched narrative battles about absolutely everything. You know,

02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:35.740
[Amit Varma]: those times are gone wherein, you know, in 91, there are stories of how Narsimha Rao

02:58:35.740 --> 02:58:40.260
[Amit Varma]: is speaking to members of opposing parties, telling them we are in a crisis, we have to

02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:44.580
[Amit Varma]: do this, and the way he's managing that and the fact that they're open to it, that someone

02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:49.460
[Amit Varma]: like a Vajpayee is open to it from the outside, the opposition is open to it. And that it's

02:58:49.460 --> 02:58:54.540
[Amit Varma]: way more polarized than that today. I mean, a classic example being the farm laws, where

02:58:54.540 --> 02:59:00.220
[Amit Varma]: a lot of the reforms are, most experts would agree, pretty much in the right direction,

02:59:00.220 --> 02:59:05.100
[Amit Varma]: the Congress has proposed them in the past themselves, you know, much needed. And the

02:59:05.100 --> 02:59:09.660
[Amit Varma]: BJP, of course, botched the politics of it completely and made a complete mess of it

02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:14.380
[Amit Varma]: in that regard. And I had a great episode with Ajay Shah on this. So the whole thing

02:59:14.380 --> 02:59:19.060
[Amit Varma]: was just a tragedy out and out. But the point is, whatever reforms you try to do, are going

02:59:19.060 --> 02:59:21.740
[Amit Varma]: to run into opposition regardless of the merits of the case.

02:59:21.740 --> 02:59:26.740
[Guest]: I don't think you know, if the government has a strong enough majority, what the opposition

02:59:26.740 --> 02:59:32.980
[Guest]: needs is to be listened to. But I don't think it necessarily prevents the reforms. I mean,

02:59:32.980 --> 02:59:38.180
[Guest]: you know, you have mechanisms like a Parliamentary Committee, so you send it to the Parliamentary

02:59:38.180 --> 02:59:43.700
[Guest]: Committee, have a discussion, have some Sunway, maybe even make a concession here and there.

02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:50.820
[Guest]: That's why I'm saying that, you know, to create a broader base, a discussion, a broader discussion,

02:59:50.820 --> 02:59:56.420
[Guest]: including with the opposition, is a good thing. The opposition may not be persuaded. I mean,

02:59:56.420 --> 03:00:01.260
[Guest]: in the opposition, their job is to oppose. But the public will at least perceive that

03:00:01.260 --> 03:00:07.340
[Guest]: look, there was a discussion, they had a chance to say what they had to say. So I mean, I

03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:10.260
[Guest]: don't think that necessarily holds up.

03:00:10.260 --> 03:00:14.260
[Amit Varma]: So that might be a fundamental mistake. You're saying that this government made and not consulting

03:00:14.260 --> 03:00:20.340
[Amit Varma]: widely enough and going through the processes. But there's no reason why a future government

03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:22.500
[Guest]: can't go through those processes and make it happen.

03:00:22.500 --> 03:00:26.500
[Guest]: They can do it now. I mean, I don't see that that's a problem.

03:00:26.500 --> 03:00:31.740
[Amit Varma]: Fair point. So, you know, you've been very kind and giving me so much of your time today.

03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:36.380
[Amit Varma]: And I'm really grateful. Like I said, you know, the show is called the scene and the

03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:41.860
[Amit Varma]: unseen and you and your fellow band of travellers change the lives of so many Indians in so

03:00:41.860 --> 03:00:48.340
[Amit Varma]: many unseen ways. So I don't know how one even expresses that gratitude. But, you know,

03:00:48.340 --> 03:00:52.780
[Amit Varma]: in these last few minutes of this episode, rather than talk about reforms and policy

03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:57.380
[Amit Varma]: and the narrative of what went down, for all of which I'll recommend that everyone reads

03:00:57.380 --> 03:01:02.900
[Amit Varma]: backstage because it's such a wonderful book. Tell me a little bit about what you do these

03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:06.740
[Amit Varma]: days, like in the break, you'd mentioned that you wanted to spend time with your grandchildren.

03:01:06.740 --> 03:01:10.500
[Amit Varma]: So you were reading up on the Mahabharata and that led you down Mahabharata based rabbit

03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:16.400
[Amit Varma]: holes and all of that, you know, earlier, you know, in Ishar's wonderful autobiography,

03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:22.580
[Amit Varma]: he spoke about how you guys together, you'd watch movies of Bergman, the Seeker, Fellini,

03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:27.620
[Amit Varma]: Polanski, all of these people. What is your life like, apart from the world of economic

03:01:27.620 --> 03:01:28.620
[Guest]: policy?

03:01:28.620 --> 03:01:36.860
[Guest]: Oh, well, I mean, as you say, I'm living a life of a gentleman at leisure, if you like,

03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:42.820
[Guest]: and a grandfather, I do enjoy interacting with my grandchildren, three boys, two girls,

03:01:42.820 --> 03:01:49.220
[Guest]: it kind of brings you to many of the things that, you know, you, you did as a kid, and

03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:56.300
[Guest]: you do it in a very personal kind of way. I write the odd article, the odd op-ed. So

03:01:56.300 --> 03:02:02.900
[Guest]: I'm doing a little bit of that I'm associated with the Center for Social and Economic Progress,

03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:08.500
[Guest]: where I'm a distinguished fellow. And right now, I'm kind of focusing on problems of managing

03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:16.420
[Guest]: climate change in India. Very interesting set of issues on policy, which bring out the

03:02:16.420 --> 03:02:22.620
[Guest]: whole importance of the holistic whole of the economy approach. So I'm just bringing

03:02:22.620 --> 03:02:30.620
[Guest]: out a working paper for the Center on that, which I hope those of your listeners are interested

03:02:30.620 --> 03:02:36.180
[Guest]: in will get from the website in another three or four days. And I do as I said, I do some

03:02:36.180 --> 03:02:43.100
[Guest]: op-eds on current issues of policy, give the odd lectures, I quite enjoy lecturing to younger

03:02:43.100 --> 03:02:51.500
[Guest]: people. Primarily right now, what I'm trying to do is to organize my thoughts so that I

03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:56.940
[Guest]: can produce a book sometime in the next couple of years, which will be addressed to a person

03:02:56.940 --> 03:03:03.420
[Guest]: of the age of 23, who won't at all be interested in what happened in 91, wouldn't even have

03:03:03.420 --> 03:03:10.060
[Guest]: been born in 91. But who would be interested in what's happening in the world ahead for

03:03:10.060 --> 03:03:17.140
[Guest]: me in India. And so I mean, many people have done similar things. And my my big challenge

03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:22.580
[Guest]: is, can I make it sufficiently both different and interesting? It doesn't have to be different.

03:03:22.580 --> 03:03:27.260
[Guest]: If somebody said the right things, they want to say the same things. But you know, saying

03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:33.820
[Guest]: it saying it to a bunch of people who are familiar with the debate is one thing, saying

03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:39.860
[Guest]: it to a bunch of people who are 23 years old, and are not interested in the past is different.

03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:41.460
[Guest]: And that's what I want to do.

03:03:41.460 --> 03:03:44.540
[Amit Varma]: Godspeed and I can't wait to read that book. It's a massive challenge, like you said to

03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:49.340
[Amit Varma]: just speak from a layman's perspective to a 23 year old and sort of convince them and,

03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:55.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, after these decades of sort of working, what would essentially be a sequence of one

03:03:55.080 --> 03:04:01.060
[Amit Varma]: day job after another? Do you feel that this change in pace is helping you think about

03:04:01.060 --> 03:04:06.220
[Amit Varma]: things you would otherwise not have thought about? And if, if you had a chance, you know,

03:04:06.220 --> 03:04:09.540
[Amit Varma]: if you got a call from the government saying, write another M document, come back and join

03:04:09.540 --> 03:04:15.900
[Amit Varma]: us, you know, would you be open to doing that? Or have you decided that, you know, this is

03:04:15.900 --> 03:04:18.860
[Amit Varma]: cool. I like the space. I like this rhythm. I'm going to stick with this.

03:04:18.860 --> 03:04:25.540
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I'm 78 years old. So I would if the government wanted such a document,

03:04:25.540 --> 03:04:30.340
[Guest]: I would strongly advise them to get ahold of some younger people and tell the younger

03:04:30.340 --> 03:04:36.840
[Guest]: people to consult widely. You know, I think we underestimate the quality that already

03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:41.340
[Guest]: exists even inside the government. But actually, there's a lot more outside the government

03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:47.460
[Guest]: now than there was then. I mean, you have to remember that when I was in government,

03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:51.940
[Guest]: most important things were done in government. There was hardly any expertise outside the

03:04:51.940 --> 03:04:58.140
[Guest]: government. Today, that's not true. I mean, the greatest expertise on fintech is not inside

03:04:58.140 --> 03:05:03.420
[Guest]: the government. It's outside the government. Similarly on everything. So one of the big

03:05:03.420 --> 03:05:09.580
[Guest]: problems is getting, getting policy papers done by knowledgeable people who know the

03:05:09.580 --> 03:05:14.900
[Guest]: market, the domestic market and the international market. I don't think it's a job for civil

03:05:14.900 --> 03:05:21.540
[Guest]: servants, because it's impossible for someone who's just I mean, you may find civil servants

03:05:21.540 --> 03:05:26.940
[Guest]: who pick up this stuff, because they read widely. But you want you want this to you

03:05:26.940 --> 03:05:32.460
[Guest]: want to talk to the people who were working on it and know the inside. So something of

03:05:32.460 --> 03:05:37.480
[Guest]: that sort is really needed for the end document of the future.

03:05:37.480 --> 03:05:42.100
[Amit Varma]: So my penultimate question and my final one will be really brief. So this is like sort

03:05:42.100 --> 03:05:47.420
[Amit Varma]: of the last serious question, as it were, when you think of India, if you take, say,

03:05:47.420 --> 03:05:52.660
[Amit Varma]: a view of 15 years from now, you know, what gives you hope? And what gives you the spare

03:05:52.660 --> 03:05:56.940
[Amit Varma]: about the trajectory we are on? Or, you know, what might happen? What might not happen?

03:05:56.940 --> 03:06:02.820
[Guest]: Well, I'm basically a very optimistic person. I mean, you know, and that's the mental state,

03:06:02.820 --> 03:06:09.540
[Guest]: you're an optimistic person filters out the negative signals builds up the positive. One

03:06:09.540 --> 03:06:14.100
[Guest]: of the things I'm very positive about is that, you know, if you look at what's happening

03:06:14.100 --> 03:06:22.960
[Guest]: in India right now, you know, you shouldn't try to make the judgment based on macro indicators.

03:06:22.960 --> 03:06:28.180
[Guest]: You should look as it were, at new things that are happening. It's a bit like being

03:06:28.180 --> 03:06:36.500
[Guest]: back in the Jurassic Age, which is dominated by the Tyrannosaurus Rex and various other

03:06:36.500 --> 03:06:43.300
[Guest]: giant lizards. But the future is all the little rodents that are running about in the undergrowth

03:06:43.300 --> 03:06:49.500
[Guest]: looking quite small. So actually, I would say that one needs to tell the story of India

03:06:49.500 --> 03:06:56.940
[Guest]: in terms of interesting, unusual, breakaway things that are happening. And if you look

03:06:56.940 --> 03:07:02.020
[Guest]: at it that way, there's a surprisingly large number. I mean, going back even to the question

03:07:02.020 --> 03:07:09.420
[Guest]: we raised earlier about the status of women. I mean, you know, what you see now, Indian

03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:17.140
[Guest]: women's hockey team, cricket team, this young Muslim woman who's won a gold medal in some

03:07:17.140 --> 03:07:24.660
[Guest]: boxing competition or something like that. All these startups, all kinds of people experimenting

03:07:24.660 --> 03:07:31.380
[Guest]: in new ways of farming. I mean, it doesn't yet add up into the macro. I mean, the macro

03:07:31.380 --> 03:07:37.420
[Guest]: is full of the usual stuff. The question is, is this somehow going to create a series of

03:07:37.420 --> 03:07:44.300
[Guest]: changes which will build momentum? I mean, one would be foolish to think that is necessarily

03:07:44.300 --> 03:07:51.820
[Guest]: going to happen. But you know, I do think that if you're looking for positive signals

03:07:51.820 --> 03:07:57.820
[Guest]: from a multiplicity of efforts, the only way it won't happen is if somebody goes off and

03:07:57.820 --> 03:08:02.100
[Guest]: tries to chop off all of them. That's not going to happen. So I think there's a lot

03:08:02.100 --> 03:08:12.380
[Guest]: of action occurring, which I hope just reaches the top in some way, in terms of visible presence

03:08:12.380 --> 03:08:15.260
[Guest]: in the economy, etc, etc.

03:08:15.260 --> 03:08:19.260
[Amit Varma]: Wise words. And you mentioned Jurassic Park, a little bit of trivia for you and for all

03:08:19.260 --> 03:08:24.620
[Amit Varma]: my listeners, the Velociraptor, which, you know, is that giant marauding creature in

03:08:24.620 --> 03:08:30.540
[Amit Varma]: the film, the actual Velociraptor was as tall as a turkey. So it was all you know, WhatsApp

03:08:30.540 --> 03:08:35.380
[Amit Varma]: history created by Steven Spielberg, as it were. So my final question to you, therefore,

03:08:35.380 --> 03:08:41.060
[Amit Varma]: is, and I ask this of all my guests who come on the show, that for my listeners and me,

03:08:41.060 --> 03:08:46.300
[Amit Varma]: recommend books, music, films that you absolutely love that have been a big part of your life,

03:08:46.300 --> 03:08:50.780
[Amit Varma]: and you want to just tell everyone go out and read this or watch this or listen to this.

03:08:50.780 --> 03:08:51.780
[Amit Varma]: It's beautiful.

03:08:51.780 --> 03:08:59.220
[Guest]: Ah, that's a very tough one. I mean, you know, I've loved all the great movies when I was

03:08:59.220 --> 03:09:05.100
[Guest]: young. I've loved all the James Bonds, although over time, those have become somewhat dated

03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:15.100
[Guest]: and not really politically correct also. I don't know. I mean, I can't, I wouldn't pick

03:09:15.100 --> 03:09:23.420
[Guest]: any one out of them. But I do think that films, I need to get back to watching more films,

03:09:23.420 --> 03:09:28.380
[Guest]: particularly more Bollywood films, because, you know, the interesting thing is that Bollywood

03:09:28.380 --> 03:09:36.520
[Guest]: films reflect what's going on in the country. And I should go and spend about two or three

03:09:36.520 --> 03:09:42.180
[Guest]: weeks looking at each of the more recent Bollywood films to know which one I want to recommend

03:09:42.180 --> 03:09:50.020
[Guest]: to you. So I don't have a straightaway something to recommend. Anything on history, actually,

03:09:50.020 --> 03:09:56.060
[Guest]: if you ask me, I would, I think we should just pick up a lot of the more recent, I mean,

03:09:56.060 --> 03:10:01.740
[Guest]: I spent a lot of time, for example, reading books on the Second World War. And it's very

03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:10.020
[Guest]: interesting how the macro narrative of the war is so hugely oversimplified. And yet,

03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:14.620
[Guest]: when you get into detailed history of what actually went on, who goofed, who did something

03:10:14.620 --> 03:10:21.860
[Guest]: wrong, etc. I mean, it's unbelievably rich. So I think we need a better understanding

03:10:21.860 --> 03:10:27.020
[Guest]: of the past. And that's what historians should be doing, giving us that we don't have enough

03:10:27.020 --> 03:10:29.860
[Guest]: of that kind of stuff, really, we should.

03:10:29.860 --> 03:10:35.300
[Amit Varma]: Montek, thank you so much for giving me so much of your time and so many great insights.

03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:40.700
[Guest]: Thank you. I enjoyed it. And thank you for all the nice things you said about backstage.

03:10:40.700 --> 03:10:46.860
[Guest]: I hope it persuades some of your listeners to pick up the book and go through it. Thank

03:10:46.860 --> 03:11:15.780
[Amit Varma]: you.
