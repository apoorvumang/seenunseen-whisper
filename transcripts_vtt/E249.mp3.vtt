00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Intel.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.960
[Amit Varma]: In 1890, Lucy Jervis, the wife of Lord Harris, the Governor of Bombay, challenged her husband to a game of cricket.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.560
[Amit Varma]: It took place in the Hill Resort of Mahabaleshwar.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Jervis, or Lady Harris, led a team of 13 women, while her husband's team had the usual 11 men.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.960
[Amit Varma]: A magazine called Cricket carried this account from a correspondent.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Quote, We are all feeling quite exhausted with laughing.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.040
[Amit Varma]: The ladies were most dreadfully in earnest, but so nervous.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.880
[Amit Varma]: Every run, every ball led to a comical situation.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.280
[Amit Varma]: Their nervousness at running, the way they met in the middle of each wicket and consulted as to whether it was safe to go on,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.120
[Amit Varma]: and finally each would run back to her own wicket, the way they threw themselves on the ball in fielding

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.520
[Amit Varma]: and had to make a search in their petticoats for it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.520
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Even at this distance, the condescension, the patronizing tone makes me so mad.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's not just a 19th century tone.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.440
[Amit Varma]: You hear it around you today, in private drawing rooms and public social media,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.760
[Amit Varma]: where women's cricket is looked upon as a curiosity.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.680
[Amit Varma]: In recent times, though, there have been stirrings of change.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.200
[Amit Varma]: The excerpt I read out is from a superb book called The Fire Burns Blue,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.080
[Amit Varma]: A History of Women's Cricket in India by Karunia Keshav and the late Siddhant Pattnayak.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.320
[Amit Varma]: And my guest today is someone who's been part of the journey of women's cricket,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.840
[Amit Varma]: both as someone who played for India and as someone who has written with great insight and eloquence about the game.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.840
[Amit Varma]: And she's thrown herself headlong into another movement that I care a lot about,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.400
[Amit Varma]: the one that's happening in the creator economy.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.920
[Amit Varma]: Can someone really be part of two revolutions in one lifetime?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.800
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.840
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.120
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.240
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Snehal Pradhan, who has been a fast bowler for the Indian team,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.600
[Amit Varma]: a cricket journalist, a TV commentator, a radio commentator in multiple languages,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.000
[Amit Varma]: a YouTuber and someone who teaches both how to play cricket and how to do multimedia sports journalism.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.600
[Amit Varma]: She may do many things, but she's not a dabbler.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.920
[Amit Varma]: She's one of the best cricket writers in the game today.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.240
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, a true all-rounder.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.400
[Amit Varma]: Her reportage can be vivid and evocative.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.240
[Amit Varma]: Her opinion pieces are always clear and incisive.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.560
[Amit Varma]: Very few people can do both so well.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Her understanding of cricket, her mastery of the craft of writing,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.200
[Amit Varma]: and most of all, her work ethic and willingness to learn new forms like YouTubing is crazy.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm a Snehal Pradhan fanboy and was delighted when she agreed to come on the show.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Before we begin this conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.520
[Amit Varma]: Artificial intelligence seems like such a scary term.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.120
[Amit Varma]: When we look into the future, AI can seem both magical and dystopian.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.680
[Amit Varma]: But it seems that way only till it actually exists.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Everything around us right now, all of the internet and so much outside it, runs on AI.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.520
[Amit Varma]: From maps to social media to the content we consume to the cabs we take to the water we drink.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.800
[Amit Varma]: One of the unseen forces behind this everyday magic is the sponsor of this episode, Intel.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.440
[Amit Varma]: For anyone who wants to harness the power of AI without reinventing the wheel,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.160
[Amit Varma]: Intel has a range of products and solutions.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.600
[Amit Varma]: The 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors pack in more power than any other solution

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.480
[Amit Varma]: and are insane bang for the buck.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.240
[Amit Varma]: Intel works with various partners to offer AI-based solutions

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.880
[Amit Varma]: and Intel's AI even helped improve Washington DC's water distribution.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.280
[Amit Varma]: You may not realize it, but AI is everywhere.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.760
[Amit Varma]: And where there's AI, there's Intel.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:32.080
[Amit Varma]: So firstly, very kind of you to say that.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.680
[Guest]: Nice to hear, you know, what the life looks like from the outside in.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.680
[Guest]: Growing up, born and brought up in Pune, we used to live in a joint family where I was born

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.080
[Guest]: and spent the first 8 years of my life.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.680
[Guest]: So, very lucky to have the kind of upbringing that allowed us both space in terms of physical space.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.680
[Guest]: We had a, our family had a bungalow where it was my grandparents, paternal grandparents,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.880
[Guest]: my grandfather's mother, and my family as in dad, mom, my brother and myself,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.280
[Guest]: my uncle's family, and all of us kind of living in the same joint family setup.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.080
[Guest]: We had a bungalow with a little bit of a garden at the back.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.480
[Guest]: There was a small outhouse which was converted into an office for my grandparents and my dad's work.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.880
[Guest]: And there was this lovely society.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:30.480
[Guest]: It's a bungalow society which was originally constructed for refugees who came over from Pakistan, Sindhi refugees.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.280
[Guest]: So, it had this beautiful garden called an oval garden.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.280
[Guest]: It was an oval garden where we used to have a lot of space to cycle.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.480
[Guest]: That's where I learned to cycle.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.080
[Guest]: That's where I played cricket, found some empty space, found a few boys playing.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.480
[Guest]: And I joined in, used to pop over to my neighbor's place.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.880
[Guest]: And she had a bunch of older cousins, again joint family, and she was the only girl.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.080
[Guest]: Yeah, the only girl and then all the older cousins and they were always playing cricket.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.880
[Guest]: And so she and I would join in.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.280
[Guest]: That's kind of been a theme whenever there's been a cricket match happening.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.880
[Guest]: Usually, almost, not usually, almost always boys.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.280
[Guest]: And I would just join in as the only girl.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:21.880
[Guest]: I remember, you know, not being stopped by who was playing in terms of whether it was a boys.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.880
[Guest]: So, not being stopped by gender or not being stopped by class.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.680
[Guest]: I mean, as a small kid, I had no perception of that, I suppose.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.880
[Guest]: The servants kids were playing, I was playing with them.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.680
[Guest]: And then afterwards, I would, you know, bring them all to bring them all home.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.880
[Guest]: And they would sit and they would watch cable TV along with us.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.080
[Guest]: Although they used to always sit a little off to the side, like in the veranda.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.280
[Guest]: But that's a memory that I have.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.680
[Guest]: And I played all sports as a kid.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.280
[Guest]: Soon, when I was like eight years old, in two-thirds standard, I shifted schools.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.480
[Guest]: There was one school where I was not so happy.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.080
[Guest]: We also moved out and started to live separately, my dad, mom and family.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.480
[Guest]: So, therefore, we moved to another place, another home.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.880
[Guest]: I shifted schools.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.880
[Guest]: There also, pretty much every sport I used to play, table tennis, badminton.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.280
[Guest]: And we didn't have much else.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.680
[Guest]: But there was always cricket happening on a Saturday morning on the field.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.280
[Guest]: On the school field.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.480
[Guest]: It was all the school boys who would kind of just come over and play.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.080
[Guest]: And I would just join those games.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.480
[Guest]: I would go there, be the only girl in those games.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.280
[Guest]: That was like completely normal for me.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.280
[Guest]: So, it was in that sense, until that point at least,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.280
[Guest]: very sheltered, normal kind of a bringing.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.480
[Guest]: Exposure to sports was incidental.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.480
[Guest]: But my affinity to sports was probably something that was always there.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.480
[Guest]: My parents tell stories about, you know,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.880
[Guest]: since being able to walk and run, picking up something and swinging it around.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.880
[Guest]: Probably influenced by what I was seeing on TV.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.280
[Guest]: Because someone born in the late 80s,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.680
[Guest]: growing up to cable television, Sachin Tendulkar, Desert Storm, all that.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.880
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, you've described in another interview how

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.080
[Amit Varma]: your grandmother was both an MSC and someone who was into sports and all of that.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.080
[Amit Varma]: And I guess being from Pune again,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.480
[Amit Varma]: like I spent many years in Pune, you know, through college and all of that.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.880
[Amit Varma]: My wife is from there.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.680
[Amit Varma]: So, I kind of have a sense of that culture where, you know,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.880
[Amit Varma]: learning is venerated and one, learning is venerated.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.480
[Amit Varma]: And two, another interesting thing about Pune, you know,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.080
[Amit Varma]: in contrast to where I was born in the north,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.280
[Amit Varma]: is that women are expected, it's completely normal to go around and do things,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.680
[Amit Varma]: to work for a living.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.080
[Amit Varma]: You will kind of see them everywhere,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.080
[Amit Varma]: which is not as much the case in many other parts of the country.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.480
[Amit Varma]: But given sort of this, these common factors of both, you know,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.680
[Amit Varma]: that respect for education, running in your family,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.080
[Amit Varma]: because you mentioned when your grandmother got her MSC in the 50s,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280
[Amit Varma]: it was like pretty rare.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.680
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, the fact that, you know,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.680
[Amit Varma]: sports was considered completely normal.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.880
[Amit Varma]: What were your early aspirations like, like as a kid growing up,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.680
[Amit Varma]: what did you think you want to be, if you thought of that at all?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I don't think kids should think too much of these things,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.680
[Amit Varma]: just go through life and enjoy.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.880
[Amit Varma]: But, and at around what point did it become apparent to you that,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.280
[Amit Varma]: hey, I am good at this cricket thing, that I can do this seriously?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.880
[Guest]: So to give you a little bit of the family background

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.880
[Guest]: from the education point of view, or, you know,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.880
[Guest]: just in general, what the situation was like,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.680
[Guest]: my grandparents, paternal grandparents in the 1950s,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.480
[Guest]: yeah, 50s had an inter-caste love marriage.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.080
[Guest]: My grandfather got a PhD in marine biology

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.480
[Guest]: and my grandmother got an MSC in marine biology.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.480
[Guest]: Both of them met when they were researchers at the Tarapur aquarium.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.280
[Guest]: They were both from Mumbai.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.680
[Guest]: And on my mother's side, my maternal grandmother,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.080
[Guest]: actually, both my maternal grandparents were teachers.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.280
[Guest]: I never knew my maternal grandfather.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.880
[Guest]: He passed away when my mother was very young.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.280
[Guest]: But even his father, I believe, if I'm getting this right,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.680
[Guest]: was like a Pali scholar and had some connection to Harvard.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.480
[Guest]: I think he'd gone there, taught there, something like that.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.480
[Guest]: That is in the family history, which I keep hearing about.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.080
[Guest]: Father's an engineer.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.480
[Guest]: So, yes, both my brothers are engineers.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.280
[Guest]: Both my brothers are educated in terms of, you know,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.880
[Guest]: one has an MBA, one has an MSC.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.880
[Guest]: MSC or MS? MS.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.880
[Guest]: And that's the culture.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.880
[Guest]: So I'm the odd one out. I'm the sports person in the family.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.880
[Guest]: But very much the emphasis was on, you know,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.480
[Guest]: play as much as you want, sure.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.280
[Guest]: But you can do both and you should do both.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.680
[Guest]: And that was ingrained in me from a young age.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.080
[Guest]: So I scored very well in my 10th and 12th.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.080
[Guest]: My grandfather had this deep desire.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.880
[Guest]: And still, yesterday we were chatting at night.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.080
[Guest]: And he's like, Azu nahi, tu engineering kela pai che.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.480
[Guest]: Still, you should go and do engineering.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.480
[Guest]: But at the time, I chose not to do engineering

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.280
[Guest]: because just out of 12th and I had been playing cricket for a while.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.880
[Guest]: And I'll come back to that.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.480
[Guest]: But I didn't even give the CET.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.680
[Guest]: I think my batch was the first batch where they had that CET.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.080
[Guest]: And I was so sure that I'm not going to do engineering.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.280
[Guest]: I didn't even give it.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.080
[Guest]: Because I knew that I wanted to study something

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.480
[Guest]: which would allow me to pursue cricket.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.080
[Guest]: Because by that time, I knew that I wanted to pursue cricket.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.680
[Guest]: Who knows what it would lead to.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.080
[Guest]: In fact, I was just last week having a dinner with one of my mentors.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.280
[Guest]: And she was recalling this incident where my grandmother,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.480
[Guest]: and this is probably a good time to tell that story,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.080
[Guest]: how I fell into cricket is that, you know,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.080
[Guest]: after having played in these very informal setups,

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.480
[Guest]: being the only girl, etc.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.480
[Guest]: There was one time where I went to a cricket ground

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.680
[Guest]: and the coach over there told me,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.480
[Guest]: okay, tie your hair inside your hat.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.680
[Guest]: I don't want people outside seeing that there is a girl here.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.680
[Guest]: And having done a little bit of that,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.280
[Guest]: so my grandmother luckily knew that women's cricket existed

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.680
[Guest]: because in the same society that I described before

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.080
[Guest]: where we used to live together,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.680
[Guest]: a former India captain used to live.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.280
[Guest]: And she knew of them because of having lived in the same society.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.680
[Guest]: And so this former India captain, Shubhangi Kulkarni,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.880
[Guest]: who is a veteran of, you know, not just in cricket,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.880
[Guest]: but also in the administrative sense,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.680
[Guest]: my grandmother tracked her down,

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.280
[Guest]: asked her, you know, okay, where can she practice.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.480
[Guest]: She, I think, went and met her, then sent me to meet her.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.880
[Guest]: And then I got the guidance as to

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.080
[Guest]: this is where the Maharashtra team practices in Pune.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.480
[Guest]: So I started going to Nehru Stadium,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.080
[Guest]: which is about 5-6 kilometers from where I was staying.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.880
[Guest]: So every morning my dad would get up and drive me there.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.680
[Guest]: And I would take a rickshaw back or something like that.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.080
[Guest]: Later on, I started cycling that distance to and fro,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.280
[Guest]: sometimes twice a day.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.880
[Guest]: But one of the important points here is that

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.480
[Guest]: it's so random that I discovered that women's cricket exists.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.280
[Guest]: And there might be so many more talents

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.280
[Guest]: who didn't get that opportunity at the right time.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.280
[Guest]: I was probably in 9th standard, 8th or 9th standard,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.480
[Guest]: having, you know, dabbled in all sports,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.880
[Guest]: when I discovered this organized women's cricket.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.880
[Guest]: And I'm physically gifted,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.880
[Guest]: from the athletic point of view, you could say.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.480
[Guest]: I'm 6 feet tall, almost.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.880
[Guest]: Had the frame of an athlete, kind of.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.480
[Guest]: So immediately, despite wanting to,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.280
[Guest]: my aspirations, despite wanting to be a wicketkeeper,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.680
[Guest]: God alone knows why,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.480
[Guest]: I was told, okay, you're nice and tall,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.480
[Guest]: take 20 steps and bowl.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.880
[Guest]: And that's how I kind of became a fast bowler.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.080
[Guest]: Even just thinking, going back to that,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.880
[Guest]: going even further back in time,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.480
[Guest]: I remember as a kid wanting to be an Air Force pilot.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.480
[Guest]: Thinking, wow, that's so cool, you know,

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.080
[Guest]: fighter planes and all that.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.680
[Guest]: All those cartoons we were watching,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.080
[Guest]: probably is the reason, you know,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.480
[Guest]: those SWAT cats and stuff that had

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.680
[Guest]: really cool missiles and whatnot,

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.680
[Guest]: probably influenced more than anything else.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.480
[Guest]: Then went through a non-violent phase and said,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.880
[Guest]: no, no, I don't want to join the Air Force

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.680
[Guest]: because it involves killing people and whatnot.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.680
[Guest]: God alone knows what I was watching

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.080
[Guest]: and what influenced me for that.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.880
[Guest]: But cricket was kind of a constant.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.080
[Guest]: Around the 9th standard,

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.280
[Guest]: I started regularly playing for Maharashtra.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.280
[Guest]: Pretty much graduated from playing

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.080
[Guest]: zero organized cricket to

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.080
[Guest]: Maharashtra under-16s and Maharashtra senior

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.080
[Guest]: and Maharashtra under-19s.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.080
[Guest]: Is that a helicopter?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I think there's a helicopter

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480
[Amit Varma]: somewhere above me, but

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.280
[Amit Varma]: it won't show up on your tracks.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.280
[Guest]: It's just so random, in Mumbai, a helicopter.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.280
[Amit Varma]: Why can't we have helicopters? Carry on.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.480
[Guest]: I would not be surprised to hear trains,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.680
[Guest]: but helicopters. Okay, anyways.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.880
[Guest]: So that's how I kind of fell into organized cricket.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.080
[Guest]: And I discovered that, yes,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.680
[Guest]: this is something that I'm good enough at

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.880
[Guest]: that I can play at the state level straight away.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.080
[Guest]: I mean, to be fair, the competition was very thin.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.480
[Guest]: The number of girls playing cricket,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.680
[Guest]: like we just pointed out, is accidental.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.880
[Guest]: How girls find cricket is accidental.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.480
[Guest]: So the number of girls actually playing cricket is really small.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.680
[Guest]: So most new kids on the block who came in

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.080
[Guest]: would, if they were any good,

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.080
[Guest]: would walk straight into a state team.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.280
[Guest]: But we had some really good seniors and

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.880
[Guest]: they helped set up the journey.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.080
[Guest]: Of course, no coach.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.480
[Guest]: We're just talking about an era where

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.680
[Guest]: we did everything ourselves

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.080
[Guest]: and we just learned from our seniors.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.480
[Guest]: Including, you know,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.080
[Guest]: rolling the pitch in the morning,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.280
[Guest]: staking out the nets, setting up the entire nets,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.680
[Guest]: paying the groundsmen a little bit to

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.080
[Guest]: help us here and there.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.480
[Guest]: That was all done by us.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.080
[Guest]: And that was how the state team practiced in those days.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.480
[Guest]: This is early 2000s,

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.680
[Guest]: which is just kind of mind-boggling to think back on now.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.080
[Amit Varma]: I just finished reading

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.880
[Amit Varma]: The Fire Burns Blue, the excellent book by

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.280
[Amit Varma]: Karunya Keshav and Siddhant Patnaik on women's cricket.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.680
[Amit Varma]: And there was this almost hard-to-believe kind of description of how

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.680
[Amit Varma]: in 1997, when the Women's World Cup happened in India,

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.880
[Amit Varma]: they actually had to shift the date of the final

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.080
[Amit Varma]: because there was a men's India versus New Zealand match

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.880
[Amit Varma]: on the same day.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.880
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, Doordarshan won't have telecasted.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.680
[Amit Varma]: Obviously, they would have telecasted the men's match.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.280
[Amit Varma]: And so, the date for the final had to be shifted.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.080
[Amit Varma]: So, I'm just curious because in those years,

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.680
[Amit Varma]: I don't remember getting to see any women's cricket on TV.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.680
[Amit Varma]: It simply wasn't there in my consciousness at all.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.080
[Amit Varma]: So, all these years when as a kid,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.480
[Amit Varma]: you are learning to play and, you know,

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.280
[Amit Varma]: you're playing with the boys out there and all of that.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.480
[Amit Varma]: And you're thinking of a life in cricket perhaps.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.280
[Amit Varma]: What are you actually, you know, looking ahead to?

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.680
[Amit Varma]: Because a male cricketer, you know,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.680
[Amit Varma]: he's surrounded by cricket. It's all there.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.480
[Amit Varma]: What are you actually looking at?

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.480
[Amit Varma]: Is it initially just a thing of,

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I love the sport. I want to do this.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.480
[Amit Varma]: And that's the only thing that drives you.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.280
[Amit Varma]: Or then do you start thinking seriously about

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.480
[Amit Varma]: what is the route? What are my chances of making it?

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.880
[Amit Varma]: When I get there, what happens?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.680
[Amit Varma]: Do you think about that stuff at all?

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.480
[Amit Varma]: Or how did that play out?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.080
[Guest]: So, in terms of what are we kind of building up to,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.280
[Guest]: there was nothing concrete.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.480
[Guest]: We knew that an Indian team existed.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.080
[Guest]: We knew that, you know, okay, you might get to play for India someday.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.680
[Guest]: And that was a dream. That was a definite dream.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.280
[Guest]: A vague dream because we didn't really know how to play for India.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.880
[Guest]: Besides, you know, doing well at the tournaments and what not.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.480
[Guest]: There was no plan.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.880
[Guest]: We had a few seniors around to kind of guide us.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.080
[Guest]: And luckily, we had a few seniors who were playing in the Indian team at that time.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.480
[Guest]: So, they were kind of examples who we could look up to.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.680
[Guest]: Otherwise, the influence of men's cricket was always there.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.680
[Guest]: When, you know, we're turning on any kind of media, men's cricket is around.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.680
[Guest]: There was women's cricket in bits and pieces on TV.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.880
[Guest]: I remember very vividly that 2002 series

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.080
[Guest]: where Jhulan Goswami made her debut. That one was on TV.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.880
[Guest]: And seeing her, watching her bowl for the first time on TV

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.080
[Guest]: really crystallized that dream.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.280
[Guest]: Okay, yeah, you're thinking, you know, I want to play for India.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.480
[Guest]: What does that look like?

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.280
[Guest]: I want to open the bowling with Jhulan Goswami.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.480
[Guest]: That was how the dream was crystallized in my mind.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.480
[Guest]: What is that going to give me in terms of, you know,

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.680
[Guest]: a career, a profession, anything like that?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.880
[Guest]: Absolutely no idea.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.080
[Guest]: Absolutely no idea how to even ask that question.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.280
[Guest]: I'm not even sure whether that question could articulate itself in my mind at the time.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.480
[Guest]: Because still in my student years, so,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.680
[Guest]: probably far away from kind of taking a decision on that front.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.680
[Guest]: The emphasis on kind of building education side by side was always there

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.880
[Guest]: because there was this understanding that women's cricket does not pay you.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.880
[Guest]: Of course, at the state level, we were earning zero.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.080
[Guest]: At the India level, players who played for India were earning a little bit of money.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.280
[Guest]: This is, of course, pre-BCCI days.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.480
[Guest]: So, women's cricket was administered by the Women's Cricket Association of India.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.680
[Guest]: And I'm sure you've read lots of stories in that book of how things used to be.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.880
[Guest]: But, honestly, only people within the women's cricket circuit could see that,

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.080
[Guest]: okay, this is the Indian team and have a vague idea,

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.080
[Guest]: okay, if you want to get there, you have to go through these tournaments, etc.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.280
[Guest]: And some of us were lucky enough to have seniors who were actually in the Indian team

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.480
[Guest]: or role models like Jhuludi who, you know, I want to be like this.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.680
[Guest]: But, like you said, in the public consciousness,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.880
[Guest]: the Indian women's team hardly existed.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.080
[Guest]: Which is, I mean, a very different scenario from the 1970s and early 80s

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.280
[Guest]: when the women's team was, you know, a much larger,

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.280
[Guest]: I won't say a big, but a much larger part of the public consciousness and the public conversation.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.480
[Guest]: So, it was kind of up to us to make our own road.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.680
[Guest]: We saw a vague destination and then we were kind of figuring it out on the way.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.880
[Amit Varma]: Just for my listeners, Fireburns Blue is an excellent book

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.080
[Amit Varma]: which talks about the journey of women's cricket from the 70s onwards

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.280
[Amit Varma]: when it really started and what a lonely journey it was for so many people

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.480
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, the kind of struggles that people had to go through.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.480
[Amit Varma]: So, worth reading and just for perspective, like you said, the BCCI took over women's cricket in 2006

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.680
[Amit Varma]: and things kind of changed after that, which we'll discuss also.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.280
[Amit Varma]: The other thing that I'm curious about and I, you know, remember writing a piece long, long ago

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.680
[Amit Varma]: about how commentary, just television commentary, satellite television

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.880
[Amit Varma]: changed the way a lot of young players understood the game and therefore grew

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.280
[Amit Varma]: because it was listening to commentary on satellite television in the early 90s,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.280
[Amit Varma]: listening to international commentators, especially that you got a sense,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.480
[Amit Varma]: not just of nuances of strategy and tactics, but also the importance of fitness

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.680
[Amit Varma]: and the importance of different kinds of work ethic that kind of come into play,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:59.680
[Amit Varma]: which would have at some level, you know, influenced a generation of players after that.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.480
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, there are many more reasons why people are so much fitter

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.080
[Amit Varma]: and so much more professional and all of that, but certainly the commentary helped.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.680
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, I see that turbocharged today, like in the kind of work that you do.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.080
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure a lot of people learn tons of stuff from your commentary and your YouTube videos,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.880
[Amit Varma]: not just because you're explicitly coaching stuff, but just talking about the nuances of the game

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.080
[Amit Varma]: is an education in itself for someone who's listening.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.280
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, you mentioned elsewhere that in those growing up years,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.280
[Amit Varma]: that listening to that TV commentary kind of made an impact to you.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:34.080
[Amit Varma]: And you've also just said that you didn't have a coach when you kind of went early in.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.480
[Amit Varma]: So what is that process of then learning to play the game like?

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.480
[Amit Varma]: Like at one level, of course, you learn by doing, you do something again and again,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.880
[Amit Varma]: and you kind of figure out what action works best for you and blah, blah, blah.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.080
[Amit Varma]: But at another level, you have this realization from what you see of international cricket

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.080
[Amit Varma]: that there are methods and there is a way of thinking and all of that,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.280
[Amit Varma]: but you don't actually have actual human guidance.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.080
[Amit Varma]: So what was that process of learning about the game like for you?

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.880
[Guest]: In one word, slow, because, you know, as much as it's absolutely true

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.080
[Guest]: that the more you do something, the better you get at it.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.480
[Guest]: The fact is that if you want to move through that learning process fast,

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.080
[Guest]: having a guide, having someone to accelerate that process for you is absolutely essential.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.080
[Guest]: In our early years, it was literally our seniors who taught us, you know,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:28.280
[Guest]: the one, two, three, fours of batting and what to think, how to kind of ask questions,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.480
[Guest]: how to get to know our own action.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.680
[Guest]: Why is this ball going wide? Think about it yourself.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.480
[Guest]: So that was a slow process because obviously these are players who, you know,

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.880
[Guest]: are currently in the Indian team or just having been in the Indian team.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:46.080
[Guest]: They are focused on their own game and it's complete generosity of time, effort

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.880
[Guest]: that they are also passing on that knowledge to the younger generation,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.680
[Guest]: which is something which is ingrained in our culture,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.280
[Guest]: especially the cricket culture, the women's cricket culture.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.080
[Guest]: But it's, you know, limited in terms of it's not their job to do it.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.880
[Guest]: It's a coach's job to do it and we didn't really have that structured coaching.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.880
[Guest]: We could watch on TV. I remember having a conversation with Shubhangi Gulkarni.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.480
[Guest]: I used to spend a lot of time sitting in the Sunny Sports Shop.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.880
[Guest]: She runs a sports shop here in Pune, which is quite well known.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.080
[Guest]: And she's, it's literally a cricketer's adda.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.680
[Guest]: There will, at any point of day, be some former cricketer, current cricketer,

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.080
[Guest]: either shopping or sitting there and chatting and talking about stuff.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.280
[Guest]: So I picked up a lot from there, picked up a lot from her advice,

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.280
[Guest]: which is just watch the game closely, sometimes more than the actual commentary.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.880
[Guest]: I learned from the actions that are happening on the field because with commentary,

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.280
[Guest]: you have to kind of be in the moment,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.280
[Guest]: immediately move from the previous ball to the next ball.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.480
[Guest]: Can't deep dive into what's happened, why it's happened,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.480
[Guest]: how you can make it happen for you.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.080
[Guest]: So it's more about just watching and trying to adapt that.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.280
[Guest]: I remember when we first got a sense of, you know,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:05.080
[Guest]: strong guidance in terms of one of the seniors who played for our team, Amrita Shinde,

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.080
[Guest]: who's been another mentor of mine.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.280
[Guest]: When she came into the team and she wasn't playing for Maharashtra,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.280
[Guest]: she was playing for Air India for a few years.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.480
[Guest]: But when the BCCI took over and when Air India team disbanded

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.680
[Guest]: because they didn't find a place in the domestic tournament,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.280
[Guest]: which mirrored the men's tournament,

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.280
[Guest]: she came back and a few other senior players who were playing for Air India came back.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:32.480
[Guest]: And she brought with her, I mean, she just took upon herself to pass on this knowledge to us.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.880
[Guest]: Again, while side by side, trying to resurrect her international career.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.080
[Guest]: And we probably, you know, contributed a lot for that.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.280
[Guest]: She was not able to focus on that. We were all troublesome teenagers.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.880
[Guest]: But she brought a exposure to the international level firstly.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.680
[Guest]: She already played international cricket.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.680
[Guest]: She had been in a professional environment. Air India is a team which employed

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.080
[Guest]: women's cricketers on a yearly contract basis.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.080
[Guest]: So they were basically not doing anything else.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.280
[Guest]: They were not studying. They were not side by side working any other jobs.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.680
[Guest]: They were playing cricket all the time.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880
[Guest]: They had coaches.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.680
[Guest]: They had interaction with not just coaches, but also the best of other international players

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.080
[Guest]: because the Air India team at the time was Jhulang Goswami, Anjum Chopra,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.280
[Guest]: Anju Jain, Karuna Jain, Jaya Sharma. No, not Jaya Sharma.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.280
[Guest]: But, you know, all these kind of players.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.080
[Guest]: So that entire knowledge factory she brought back

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.480
[Guest]: and revolutionized the kind of way we used to train.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.680
[Guest]: Revolutionized the drills we used to do.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.080
[Guest]: Just made us think in a very different way about how we should be approaching regular nets.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.880
[Guest]: And the result of the performance was outstanding.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.480
[Guest]: I mean, in that first, I think in the first three years after the BCCI took over,

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.480
[Guest]: Maharashtra reached three finals.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.080
[Guest]: And yes, I mean, it was great that we had three really good players coming back from Air India.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.880
[Guest]: But it was the younger lot. It was my generation.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.480
[Guest]: And we were like literally 19-20 year olds who were pushing and helping the state team perform.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.880
[Guest]: Because of this guidance that we were suddenly receiving.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.880
[Guest]: So how much of a difference it can make.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.280
[Guest]: You know, you can watch as much as you want and absorb and try it out yourself.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.080
[Guest]: But having someone being able to accelerate that process is just invaluable in cricket.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.280
[Guest]: And which is why, I mean, coaching is something that I stress on a lot now in my current role.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.080
[Guest]: But back then, if you ask the moment when our cricket really transformed.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.880
[Guest]: From, you know, kids who were just trying to figure it out

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:32.680
[Guest]: to having someone who knew the ropes show us the ropes was, it was a big moment.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in fact, you have a pretty moving video about how one of your regrets was that

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:44.480
[Amit Varma]: there were these 3-4 years where, you know, before she shifted back to playing for Maharashtra from Air India.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.680
[Amit Varma]: Where you kept thinking, should I approach her for tape?

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Should I take her help? Should I try to train with her?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.880
[Amit Varma]: And you were just hesitant and you didn't do it.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.680
[Amit Varma]: And later you regretted it because you thought, my God, if I'd learnt all of this a little earlier.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.880
[Amit Varma]: Can you give me some concrete examples of specific ways in which she sort of helped your cricket

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.280
[Amit Varma]: both in terms of, you know, the actual game itself and also the mindset which you mentioned?

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.880
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely. So, firstly, in terms of our preparation,

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.680
[Guest]: just the physical preparation was what she emphasised on so much

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.880
[Guest]: that we have to be at a level of fitness that allows us to perform.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.080
[Guest]: Otherwise, you know, the skill is just not going to come out.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:24.480
[Guest]: So, our net sessions were preceded by an hour of fielding and fitness drills.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.080
[Guest]: And she would build fielding into our fitness drills.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.280
[Guest]: Something she is very well known for is the ladder drill.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.480
[Guest]: And that kind of became what our team was known for, you know, the team that carries around the ladder.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.880
[Guest]: And we were the only team that was doing it at the time.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:43.280
[Guest]: Now, you know, it's just so common that shows how ahead of her time she was.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:48.880
[Guest]: Just the extent to which she would push us in terms of our strength training.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.880
[Guest]: Of course, no gym. We had absolutely zero gym access.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.880
[Guest]: It was just basic push-ups, squats, bodyweight training.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.680
[Guest]: But the amount of repetitions that she made us do, we had never imagined.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.480
[Guest]: Oh my God! It can be this much?

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.880
[Guest]: And I remember watching her herself.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.480
[Guest]: I mean, she is this well-known on the women's cricket circuit

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.880
[Guest]: when she was playing as this incredibly fit cricketer.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.080
[Guest]: Her fielding is really well-known.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.480
[Guest]: Her short catching in terms of close-in catching, short leg silly point is really well-known.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:24.680
[Guest]: And she was the kind of player who, you know, back in 2005-2006 as a woman cricketer

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.480
[Guest]: was able to do those push-up and clap.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.080
[Guest]: You know, the ones where you press down, you push up, you are in the air, you clap

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.080
[Guest]: and then you come back and push down again.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.280
[Guest]: She was able to do that.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.480
[Guest]: And we were like, oh my God! How are you able to do that?

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.880
[Guest]: And then she was trying to pass on the processes of, you know,

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.080
[Guest]: how much you have to start, how many push-ups you have to do.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.680
[Guest]: And without actually telling us, she was just building it into our warm-ups.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.680
[Guest]: I remember the first tournament we had when we went to...

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.880
[Guest]: First tournament we had under the BCCI auspices when she had joined the team.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.480
[Guest]: We were travelling to Mumbai and the tournament was in Mumbai.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.880
[Guest]: And during that bus journey, everyone was sleeping, listening to music, chatting.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:08.080
[Guest]: She was sitting at the back of the bus, one by one calling each member of the team behind

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.080
[Guest]: and telling them, this is what your job is.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.680
[Guest]: I remember having that conversation with her.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.880
[Guest]: She was like, no variations. Just bowl the ball in one place.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.080
[Guest]: I was like, okay.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:24.080
[Guest]: And now it's so common. This is called role clarity, which, you know, every T20 team talks about.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.280
[Guest]: 2006, we've never had this kind of role clarity before.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.680
[Guest]: It's just a half an hour team meeting where, yes, do your best and bowl here, bowl there.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.880
[Guest]: What to do, what not to do. Nothing like that.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.680
[Guest]: So, in terms of the mindset, everyone was given a very clear, specific role

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.280
[Guest]: as this is what the expectations are.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:49.080
[Guest]: So, that setting of expectations and then measuring against those expectations was fantastic.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:56.680
[Guest]: She would constantly keep reminding me about, you know, how fearsome I could be as a bowler.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:03.280
[Guest]: Because, like I said, very rare for women to be so tall and, you know, generate the kind of bounce that I did.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.480
[Guest]: So, she's like, why are you bowling with a mid-off?

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.680
[Guest]: You don't need a mid-off.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.480
[Guest]: You just put a fielder there in front of the batter's face and you bowl.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.080
[Guest]: That's the kind of... and I was like, how can I bowl without a mid-off?

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:21.080
[Guest]: I mean, in my cricketing years, I was... even, you know, towards the later half of my cricketing years,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.480
[Guest]: I was this person with that hesitancy and that uncertainty was a part of my personality.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.080
[Guest]: And she was constantly reinforcing that this is something that you can overcome

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.280
[Guest]: and kind of think bigger about yourself.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.480
[Guest]: And this is the potential that you have.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.680
[Guest]: And we were slowly, slowly, slowly growing into the possibility that, okay, she might be right.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.280
[Guest]: That's kind of so mind-blowing and sounds so ahead of her time.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.680
[Amit Varma]: But where did she get all this dope from?

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.280
[Amit Varma]: Because I'm assuming that when she came into sort of playing for the state and all that,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.080
[Amit Varma]: there were still no coaches around, obviously, because this was before your time.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:04.080
[Amit Varma]: So, is this stuff that she started picking up when she got to the national team or playing internationally?

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:10.880
[Amit Varma]: Or is it just a remarkably smart and enterprising person who, you know, figures it out from here and there?

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:17.280
[Guest]: She's gonna hate me for talking so much about her and, you know, even saying that you should have her on your podcast.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.080
[Guest]: But she's this very reserved person, very private person.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.080
[Guest]: And I actually don't even know whether I should be saying all this about her.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.480
[Guest]: But she is someone who learned a lot from observing others.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:37.880
[Guest]: Very quickly, she was born in Kolhapur, moved to Pune because she was a talented cricketer at a very young age.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:46.080
[Guest]: And I remember her telling me that she spent, there was a camp at maybe Pune club or some other ground in Pune,

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.880
[Guest]: where Frank Tyson had come down and he was training, I think, a bunch of boys.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:57.680
[Guest]: And she joined in and, you know, aced the fitness test, sometimes even beating the boys.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.680
[Guest]: So, she was always kind of exposing herself to these kind of environments where she will be able to pick up so many things.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.880
[Guest]: I remember her and our other senior cricketers like Kalyani, Umbrani,

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:14.880
[Guest]: they were regularly training with Maharashtra Ranji cricketers, the Rishikesh Kanitkars, who are based in Pune.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.080
[Guest]: And therefore, picking up a lot from them, which is something which doesn't really happen and didn't really happen to my generation.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.880
[Guest]: I had very little contact with the Ranji Trophy cricketers throughout my career.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.880
[Guest]: I still haven't had much contact with the Ranji Trophy cricketers.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:34.880
[Guest]: I have not set foot or played a game on the Maharashtra stadium at Gahunze just outside of Pune.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.080
[Guest]: It was all kind of very separate in the BCCI times.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:43.280
[Guest]: But back then, they took the initiative and put themselves in these kind of situations

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.880
[Guest]: where they know that they will learn and they will improve as cricketers.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:52.680
[Guest]: And so, to that extent, that's probably, that's what I know of where she would pick up these things from.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.680
[Guest]: Of course, she's played international cricket.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:00.080
[Guest]: Not like, you know, someone who's afraid to talk to the opposition, learn from them.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.280
[Guest]: She picked up a lot when she went abroad.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.680
[Guest]: And in fact, people abroad used to watch her train and pick up a lot from her.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:13.880
[Guest]: Like I said, you know, she's always been the one who's in that kind of situation, but always acing that situation.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.880
[Guest]: But, I mean, to find out really where she picked it up is a really good question.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.480
[Guest]: And I should pick her brain about it at various points.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.480
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, hope to see her on your show sometime, actually.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Since you do have a YouTube channel and you're right there in Pune.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.480
[Amit Varma]: You kind of mentioned a bit about how you could sometimes be diffident and lack confidence and all of that.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.480
[Amit Varma]: And she told you, no, you've got to be fearsome. You're a six foot fast bowler, you know, and all of that.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Do you think that that, you know, the kind of approach that you take to the sport also then changes what you are outside the sport?

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.280
[Amit Varma]: Like if you are finding yourself, finding increased confidence within the field and you're being fearsome as it were,

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:55.280
[Amit Varma]: and bowling bouncers and hitting people and all of that, which I presume all fast bowlers enjoy doing.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.080
[Amit Varma]: But did that also rub off then on the kind of person you are?

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Because I just find that in any field, not just sort of the sport, but in absolutely any field,

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.280
[Amit Varma]: the kind of work you do can often impact the kind of person you become.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, like even podcasts, I just find that having these long conversations has kind of changed me a little bit.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.880
[Amit Varma]: Better listener, more empathetic, so on and so forth.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:20.880
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, is there something to that, not just from your own experience, but kind of seeing people around you?

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.680
[Amit Varma]: I think there's a little bit both ways.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:32.880
[Guest]: My own experience has, I mean, yes, playing sport and, you know, always being with the only girl in the boys

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:40.880
[Guest]: and never letting it kind of bother me, did probably contribute to the little bit of an extrovertness that I have.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:49.680
[Guest]: And, you know, the comfort of starting a conversation or being in a situation which might make other people nervous in that sense.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:58.680
[Guest]: So in that sense, playing sport does help in terms of the person you are and the person you become.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:05.680
[Guest]: But I mean, there's this old adage in any sport is that, you know, sports doesn't really build character, it reveals it.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.680
[Guest]: So more than anything, I think it's the other way around.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:14.480
[Guest]: I think the person you are contributes more to the kind of, this is my experience,

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:19.480
[Guest]: the person you are contributes more to the kind of athlete or the kind of sports person you become.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:26.480
[Guest]: Because you can't, I mean, like sports is, the match is somewhere where it kind of reveals your true personality.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.480
[Guest]: And you can't fake it there.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:34.480
[Guest]: When you're tired and there is no energy left in your body to put up a pretense,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:40.280
[Guest]: the only reserves of energy you have are what are going to be used in doing whatever action you need to do.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:46.280
[Guest]: There, I think it shows who you really are and is an opportunity for reflection and opportunity to learn.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.280
[Guest]: And, you know, for many years, I just went through sport without really actively learning

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.280
[Guest]: and without taking those opportunities to really reflect and really think.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.280
[Guest]: Because, like I said, there were a little bit of hesitancies in my personality,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.080
[Guest]: despite on the outside being this super confident, tall, extrovert-ish kind of person

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.080
[Guest]: who is, you know, happy to pick up any kind of conversations.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.080
[Guest]: There are always some insecurities that you have, insecurities that you pick up,

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.080
[Guest]: which then kind of express themselves on the field.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:21.080
[Guest]: Because more than anything, I think the person you are contributes in a big way to the athlete you become.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.080
[Guest]: Which is why, you know, having talent is not enough.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.080
[Guest]: Everyone says you have to have the right mindset for it, the right attitude for it.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.880
[Guest]: I think that is a part or that is speaking to this aspect of the conversation

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.880
[Guest]: where you have, you know, a person like me can be gifted physically,

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.880
[Guest]: but my mindset, was it the best? No.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.880
[Guest]: I mean, was it the best for a professional athlete? No.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.880
[Guest]: Now, looking back, I can be completely honest with myself.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.880
[Guest]: At the time, I hadn't really figured myself out.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.880
[Amit Varma]: In what way was your mindset not up to the task?

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.680
[Guest]: So, growing up, there were a few insecurities which were coming out of my childhood.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:03.680
[Guest]: There were a few body image insecurities which were kind of carrying forth onto the cricket field.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.680
[Guest]: They were all rooted into the sense of, you know, am I good enough?

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.680
[Guest]: And rooted into the questions of self-worth.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.680
[Guest]: So, therefore, when there is a situation where you need to make the brave choice,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.680
[Guest]: my internal dialogue was, am I good enough?

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.480
[Guest]: And my internal dialogue was that of a doubt.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.480
[Guest]: So, like you mentioned the example of, you know, when I was hesitating

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.480
[Guest]: where I could have, should have gone up, had a conversation,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.480
[Guest]: maybe it would have helped my career.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.480
[Guest]: Worst come to worst, it would have just, you know, I would have had to hear a no.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.480
[Guest]: In those moments, I hesitated, doubted myself.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.480
[Guest]: That, as a cricketer, is kind of really, it can be fatal.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.480
[Guest]: Because you are in a situation where the team depends on you.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.480
[Guest]: You are in a situation where you have to perform a difficult task.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.280
[Guest]: It's easy at the start, you know, and the going is good,

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.280
[Guest]: the energy levels are high.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.280
[Guest]: But should I bowl that slower ball now?

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.280
[Guest]: Oh, what if it gets hit?

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.280
[Guest]: Maybe I'll just stick to my regular stock ball.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.280
[Guest]: Should I take a risk and play this shot?

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.280
[Guest]: Oh, but what if I get out?

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.280
[Guest]: Those are the kind of internal dialogues and internal doubts

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.280
[Guest]: that can sometimes come across.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.280
[Guest]: If you have those kind of insecurities and internal dialogues off the field,

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.080
[Guest]: if you have those kind of things as a part of your personality, so to speak.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.080
[Guest]: And sure, the process of going through those kind of things, it does help.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.080
[Guest]: But in my opinion, that, and I say this now also to, you know,

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.080
[Guest]: younger people in the field, whether it's in media or whether it's in sports,

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.080
[Guest]: is that your personal development is probably the biggest obstacle

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.080
[Guest]: to your professional development.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:43.080
[Guest]: And that is kind of my takeaway from the career that I had,

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.880
[Guest]: is that if I had, for example, my mindset towards professionalism,

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.880
[Guest]: just taking the plunge and being much more professional

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.880
[Guest]: about how I saw it was difficult for me

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.880
[Guest]: because maybe I was limiting myself with what I could be.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.880
[Guest]: Like my mentors kept telling me, you can aim for this,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.880
[Guest]: you should aim for this.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.880
[Guest]: In my mind, if there is a voice saying,

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.880
[Guest]: can I, can I really, can I believe that?

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.880
[Guest]: And then only once you believe that,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.680
[Guest]: can you apply the steps required to kind of reach there.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.680
[Guest]: So thinking back now, I mean, at the time I had zero idea.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.680
[Guest]: But thinking back now, I mean, hindsight is a wonderful thing.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.680
[Guest]: That is something I would have encouraged

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:30.680
[Guest]: a 20, 22 year old Snehal Pradhan to change.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.680
[Amit Varma]: I have a tangential question.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.680
[Amit Varma]: I used to play chess a little seriously in my teens.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, I think when I was 19, I just stopped

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.680
[Amit Varma]: because I realized I'm not good enough to be an Anand

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.480
[Amit Varma]: and anything else just kind of makes no sense.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.480
[Amit Varma]: But just looking back at those days,

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.480
[Amit Varma]: I realized that all my issues with why I wasn't able to

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.480
[Amit Varma]: take the next step were not talent issues, but temperament issues.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.480
[Amit Varma]: Again, similar things to what you've mentioned,

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.480
[Amit Varma]: impatience and always in a hurry and similar to those things.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.480
[Amit Varma]: Now, I wonder that if someone had actually,

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.480
[Amit Varma]: if an older me had sat down and told me,

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.480
[Amit Varma]: these are your problems, this is how you need to get past it,

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.480
[Amit Varma]: this is why it will stop you, whether I would have learned at all.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:12.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, whether people just need to make their own mistakes

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.280
[Amit Varma]: and go through their own phases and you can't actually teach them.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.280
[Amit Varma]: Like on the one hand, I would imagine that having a mentor

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.280
[Amit Varma]: or having a coach can really help you

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.280
[Amit Varma]: because you don't make these mistakes you would otherwise have made.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.280
[Amit Varma]: But the other aspect of it is that these mistakes

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.280
[Amit Varma]: perhaps come from deep inside, perhaps a part of your character

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.280
[Amit Varma]: and you just need to grow on your own.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, you're a coach where you're working with young people all the time

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.280
[Amit Varma]: and you're seeing kind of similar sort of tendencies.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.080
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, would it be the case that like technical defects you can coach out of people,

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:43.080
[Amit Varma]: but just kind of the mentality and all of these other issues.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.080
[Amit Varma]: Is there a way for someone like you to accelerate the growing up process?

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.080
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, instilling, say, patience or discipline in someone

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.080
[Amit Varma]: is not just changing them as a sports person,

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.080
[Amit Varma]: but also changing them as a person in a sense.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.080
[Amit Varma]: Can that be accelerated?

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.080
[Amit Varma]: What's your experience working with younger Snehal's as I'm sure you do?

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.880
[Guest]: Yeah, that's an interesting question.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.880
[Guest]: And like I had one student who I was working one-on-one with

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:15.880
[Guest]: and I emphasized this a lot with her as, you know, a young teenage girl.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.880
[Guest]: Naturally, there are definitely a lot of insecurities.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.880
[Guest]: So, I emphasized self-knowledge is one of the skills that we're trying to build here

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.880
[Guest]: and that extends beyond cricket.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.880
[Guest]: I want like, you know, some of the things that I'll say in coaching

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.880
[Guest]: is that I want you to understand your body as to

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.680
[Guest]: when your arm comes so far away from your head,

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.680
[Guest]: then where the ball will go.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.680
[Guest]: And when your body pivots so well, then where the ball will go.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.680
[Guest]: I want you to understand those things about your body.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.680
[Guest]: I want you to understand that, you know,

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.680
[Guest]: when you're holding the bat in which exact position

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.680
[Guest]: are you able to connect the ball well.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.680
[Guest]: So, that kind of self-knowledge, that technical self-knowledge is important, yes.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.680
[Guest]: But I also encourage her to journal.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.680
[Guest]: I also encourage her to kind of write down her thoughts.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.480
[Guest]: I also encourage her to talk to her near and dear ones

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.480
[Guest]: about the things that you might, you know, not usually talk to

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.480
[Guest]: to have those conversations.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.480
[Guest]: And as someone who is providing that guidance, you can help.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.480
[Guest]: But it's absolutely true that everyone has their own journey.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.480
[Guest]: Everyone has their own path.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.480
[Guest]: I am 100% convinced that if you don't have this mentor in your life,

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.480
[Guest]: that path takes a lot longer.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.480
[Guest]: But even with the mentor in your life,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.280
[Guest]: they can't walk it for you.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.280
[Guest]: You have to be the one.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.280
[Guest]: But there are, for example, like when you talk about cricket,

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.280
[Guest]: some exercises that you do,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.280
[Guest]: which make it easier to perform technical actions.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.280
[Guest]: Like, unless you're strong in your shoulders,

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.280
[Guest]: you won't be able to rip the ball

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.280
[Guest]: when you're bowling it at a certain speed.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.280
[Guest]: So, similarly, some exercises that you do

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.280
[Guest]: can help you in your personal growth.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.280
[Guest]: Like, for example, things like meditation,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.280
[Guest]: disconnecting from your phone, social media, journaling.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.080
[Guest]: These are exercises which aren't going to solve the problem for you,

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.080
[Guest]: but hopefully give you either skills or insights

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:09.080
[Guest]: for you to kind of solve and recognize those problems yourself.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.080
[Guest]: So, as a coach, you can provide those structures

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.080
[Guest]: and hope that those structures can develop

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.080
[Guest]: into self-realization and self-knowledge

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.080
[Guest]: for whoever you're working with.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.080
[Guest]: And, I mean, it's a process that we have to do ourselves,

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.880
[Guest]: as coaches, constantly.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.880
[Guest]: But it can help.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.880
[Guest]: But, like you said, it is up to the individual.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.880
[Guest]: Some individuals will just pick it up faster.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.880
[Guest]: Some individuals will take a lot of time with it.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.880
[Amit Varma]: I want to pick up on your mention of social media there.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.880
[Amit Varma]: Like, I imagine at the time you started playing,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.880
[Amit Varma]: like you said, there weren't too many of you.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.880
[Amit Varma]: Today, I guess a pool of people wanting to play would be larger.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.880
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, so are the distractions

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.880
[Amit Varma]: and so is the opportunity cost in terms of what else

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.880
[Amit Varma]: they could be doing with their time.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.680
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, there is Facebook,

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.680
[Amit Varma]: which I think today renamed itself to Meta,

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.680
[Amit Varma]: so I have to stop using that word.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.680
[Amit Varma]: But Facebook, many years ago, did a study

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.680
[Amit Varma]: which they suppressed,

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.680
[Amit Varma]: which found that social media had a negative impact

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.680
[Amit Varma]: on the sort of the mental health of young teenage girls,

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.680
[Amit Varma]: specifically.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And Jonathan Haidt, on the episode of another show

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.680
[Amit Varma]: that I produced at one point, elaborated a little bit on this

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.680
[Amit Varma]: and what studies have kind of found is that, you know,

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.680
[Amit Varma]: people a decade and a half back

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.680
[Amit Varma]: thought that video games would be bad for boys.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.480
[Amit Varma]: But it turned out boys playing video games was perfectly fine

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.480
[Amit Varma]: because problem solving skills and all of that,

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:27.480
[Amit Varma]: it was okay for them.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.480
[Amit Varma]: But for the girls, the social media became a big problem

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:32.480
[Amit Varma]: because typically, if you're a young adolescent

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.480
[Amit Varma]: or pre-adolescent girl, you have girls hanging around,

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.480
[Amit Varma]: being social, getting to know each other.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.480
[Amit Varma]: But social media made everything performative

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.480
[Amit Varma]: with all the pressures of looking your best

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.480
[Amit Varma]: on Instagram and Facebook and so on and so forth.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.480
[Amit Varma]: And that led to a rise in teenage depression

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.480
[Amit Varma]: and suicides in the US.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's something that's been spoken a lot about.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.280
[Amit Varma]: And the artists formerly known as Facebook

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.280
[Amit Varma]: but now known as Meta kind of apparently suppressed

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.280
[Amit Varma]: research that they had to that effect

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.280
[Amit Varma]: that it was correct, thereby confirming

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.280
[Amit Varma]: what a lot of people were saying.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.280
[Amit Varma]: So when you coach young people,

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.280
[Amit Varma]: do you feel that that is also a problem,

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.280
[Amit Varma]: that there are all these distractions

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.280
[Amit Varma]: or does it mean that the people who've come to you

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.280
[Amit Varma]: for coaching in any case by a process of self-selection

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.280
[Amit Varma]: are the people who are the most driven anyway?

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.080
[Guest]: I would firstly say that I don't have enough sample size

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.080
[Guest]: to answer this question because I usually coach

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.080
[Guest]: on a one-on-one basis.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.080
[Guest]: And if I'm in charge of a team of young girls

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.080
[Guest]: or in a big academy, then it will probably

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.080
[Guest]: give me a bigger picture.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.080
[Guest]: Two, like you said, the students who do come to me

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.080
[Guest]: are the ones who are serious.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.080
[Guest]: They're the ones whose parents are ready to invest

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.080
[Guest]: a significant amount of time driving them

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.080
[Guest]: to and from wherever they are.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.080
[Guest]: They're the ones whose parents are ready to invest fees.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.880
[Guest]: So they're already convinced that this is something

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.880
[Guest]: that they want to get serious about.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.880
[Guest]: So when I tell them to stay off their phones at night

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.880
[Guest]: or give them social media-related advice,

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.880
[Guest]: they're usually more likely to follow it.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.880
[Guest]: In general, yes, social media definitely has thrown up,

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.880
[Guest]: does throw up so many new challenges

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.880
[Guest]: which we're kind of figuring out how to do.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.880
[Guest]: I mean, even when I was playing,

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.880
[Guest]: that is five, six years ago until I retired,

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.880
[Guest]: conversations on social media

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.680
[Guest]: within the women's cricket circuit were quite common.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.680
[Guest]: It is an oft-repeated fact in the women's cricket circuit

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.680
[Guest]: that Elise Perry is not on any social media.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.680
[Guest]: And she's there because she's at the level

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.680
[Guest]: that she's at right now because she's recognized

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.680
[Guest]: that to get there requires a certain amount of focus,

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.680
[Guest]: requires a certain amount of sacrifice,

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.680
[Guest]: requires a certain amount of subtraction from your life.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.680
[Guest]: And it's only now that she's achieved what she's achieved

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.480
[Guest]: and started an Instagram or a Twitter or whatever it is.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.480
[Guest]: So that is something that, you know, does get repeated.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.480
[Guest]: There is a general grumbling that the younger generation

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.480
[Guest]: uses social media too much.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.480
[Guest]: But I'm not close enough to this problem

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.480
[Guest]: to kind of properly comment on it.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.480
[Guest]: I mean, in my life, social media is also a huge distraction

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.480
[Guest]: but also a huge asset.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.480
[Guest]: I mean, my entire brand, so to speak,

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.480
[Guest]: has been built on social media.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.280
[Guest]: I'm not the kind of player who played a hundred tests.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.280
[Guest]: And therefore, I had to assert my credibility, almost,

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.280
[Guest]: through my work on social media.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.280
[Guest]: My playing career doesn't speak for itself.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.280
[Guest]: So, yeah, it can work both ways.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.280
[Guest]: But I recognize that, I mean,

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.280
[Guest]: in my life, I spend too much time on Twitter.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.280
[Amit Varma]: In my life, I spend too much time on Twitter as well.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.280
[Amit Varma]: And I can also rationalize by saying that,

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.080
[Amit Varma]: I reach out to people and I'm connected with readers or listeners or whatever.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.080
[Amit Varma]: But at some level, that's kind of a cop-out.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, earlier you mentioned the role of happenstance.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.080
[Amit Varma]: And I remember this line that really struck me

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.080
[Amit Varma]: from the Fireburns Blue by Karunayan Siddhant,

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.080
[Amit Varma]: which I'll read out, says,

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.080
[Amit Varma]: quote, if today's women's cricket is a community,

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.080
[Amit Varma]: it's because of Shanta Rangaswamy.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.080
[Amit Varma]: If it is competitive, it's because of Diana Adulji.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.080
[Amit Varma]: Helping it take that vital step towards professionalism

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.080
[Amit Varma]: was a vision, efficiency and diplomacy of Shobhangi Kulkarni.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.880
[Amit Varma]: And again, it's happenstance that one of these three sort of pioneers

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.880
[Amit Varma]: who played such a big role was a big part of your life

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.880
[Amit Varma]: and you got to benefit from that

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.880
[Amit Varma]: and many other people kind of wouldn't have, which is great luck.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.880
[Amit Varma]: But also another stroke of luck that you've also had a recent video about

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.880
[Amit Varma]: was your parents in the sense that they were so supportive through everything.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.880
[Amit Varma]: And you just mentioned about how a lot of the kids who come to you,

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.880
[Amit Varma]: their parents are a big part of it.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.880
[Amit Varma]: They'll drive them there from far places and all of that.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.880
[Amit Varma]: And that can be a little bit of a double-edged sword, right?

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.680
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand you're passionate about something

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.680
[Amit Varma]: and it's great if your parents support you

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.680
[Amit Varma]: and they're not going the conventional way saying

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.680
[Amit Varma]: you don't do medical or engineering or MBA,

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.680
[Amit Varma]: but they support you, that's great.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.680
[Amit Varma]: But the flip side of that also is as we've seen in the past

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.680
[Amit Varma]: is that parents can sometimes push you too hard.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, they can kind of want to live vicariously through you

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.680
[Amit Varma]: and all of that and that can also be sort of a problem with kids.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.680
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts on this?

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.680
[Guest]: Before answering that question, I must point out that

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.480
[Guest]: I was lucky enough to spend a lot of time around not one,

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.480
[Guest]: but two of those great pioneers.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.480
[Guest]: Because when I was 21, I got employed with Western Railway.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.480
[Guest]: The senior sports officer at Western Railway,

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.480
[Guest]: the woman in charge of everything, not just cricket, but all sports

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.480
[Guest]: was Diana Adiljee and who went on to play a huge role

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.480
[Guest]: in cricket administration later.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:28.480
[Guest]: And my God, what a force that woman is really, not even was.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.280
[Guest]: So lucky enough, like you said, that Happenstance had these two people

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.280
[Guest]: who were kind of driving women's cricket forward in their own different way.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:42.280
[Guest]: To come to the question about parents, it's definitely a thing

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.280
[Guest]: that you have these parents who are a little too over-involved.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.280
[Guest]: I luckily didn't.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.280
[Guest]: Like I said, my entire family is, you know,

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.280
[Guest]: a family where education is fairly important.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.280
[Guest]: My parents actually split up when I was about 13 or 14.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.080
[Guest]: But despite that, we still lived in the same building.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.080
[Guest]: So they were still sharing the kind of responsibilities

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.080
[Guest]: of making sure that my cricket is always taken care of.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.080
[Guest]: That was never compromised on.

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.080
[Guest]: What has been probably again lucky for me is that

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.080
[Guest]: since they didn't really have like sporting aspirations of their own,

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.080
[Guest]: they never imposed their aspirations or their dreams on me

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.080
[Guest]: and kind of let me take my own path.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.080
[Guest]: Like I said, I moved, I joined Western Railway when I was 21

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.880
[Guest]: and at that point I moved out of home.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.880
[Guest]: I moved from Pune to Mumbai.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.880
[Guest]: Again, wonderful support from both my parents in that respect

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.880
[Guest]: and the entire family, not just my father and my mother.

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.880
[Guest]: So I can't really speak for the people whose parents can be too overbearing

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.880
[Guest]: with coaches or with the children who I teach,

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:46.880
[Guest]: children who I work with.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.880
[Guest]: I kind of make it clear to the parents that

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.880
[Guest]: you will drop the kid to training,

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.680
[Guest]: but then you're kind of out of bounds.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.680
[Guest]: After that, all yours.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.680
[Guest]: But I don't want a parent coming and telling that,

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.680
[Guest]: oh, she should do this, she should do that

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.680
[Guest]: because she doesn't do this or doesn't do that.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.680
[Guest]: I don't want that happening in my coaching.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.680
[Guest]: So that's a line that I draw.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.680
[Guest]: I've been lucky that I've worked with parents that kind of understand that.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.680
[Guest]: It's something that I drive through in my online coaching programs also.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.680
[Guest]: I've now built an online coaching program

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.480
[Guest]: which is designed specifically for parent-children combination.

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.480
[Guest]: So this is my target audience almost

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.480
[Guest]: is these parents that you're talking about

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.480
[Guest]: who want to invest a hundred balls a day,

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.480
[Guest]: who want to bowl a thousand balls a day to their kid.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.480
[Guest]: And almost they might be having cricketing aspirations of their own

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.480
[Guest]: and they want to see their kids fulfill those.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.480
[Guest]: I always try and convey that cricket is not everything.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.480
[Guest]: Please do other things, play other sports, read.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.280
[Guest]: In a subtle way, I try to convey that there is more to life than cricket.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.280
[Guest]: In fact, I mean, part of that online training program that I'm trying to build,

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.280
[Guest]: I'm trying to build a series of educational programs

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.280
[Guest]: on what you can do as in how you can get a job in cricket

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.280
[Guest]: if you don't make it as a cricketer.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:11.280
[Guest]: Because the fact is that 95%, 97%, 99% of people

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.280
[Guest]: aren't going to make it as cricketers.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.280
[Guest]: So how can you be as lucky as I was

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.080
[Guest]: and you were able to stay connected to cricket as a part of your profession

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.080
[Guest]: even after actually quitting the game

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.080
[Guest]: is something that I'm hoping to build out in the future.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:31.080
[Guest]: So I try, it's not something I actively talk about

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:35.080
[Guest]: or it's not something I kind of try to shout through.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.080
[Guest]: But in subtle ways, I try to just encourage them

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.080
[Guest]: that this is also something you could do

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.080
[Guest]: and also make them aware that, you know,

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.880
[Guest]: despite our best efforts, that dream may not be fulfilled.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.880
[Guest]: Okay, that's okay.

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.880
[Amit Varma]: When I was going through your website,

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.880
[Amit Varma]: one of the fascinating things was you have these separate buttons side by side

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.880
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, one for children to click

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.880
[Amit Varma]: and one for parents to click if they want to learn, which is fascinating.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.880
[Amit Varma]: And also this aspect of figuring out stuff outside cricket,

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.880
[Amit Varma]: like CLR James said, what do they of cricket know, who only cricket know.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.880
[Amit Varma]: I have another question for you because you mentioned Dana Edulji

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.880
[Amit Varma]: and what a remarkable woman she was.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.680
[Amit Varma]: This takes me back to a thought I had while recording my episode with Kavita Rao

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.680
[Amit Varma]: where she's written this wonderful book on these women doctors of the 19th century.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.680
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that struck me there was that

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.680
[Amit Varma]: just to be a woman doctor in the 19th century,

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.680
[Amit Varma]: you had to be prima facie absolutely remarkable

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.680
[Amit Varma]: because it wasn't just a question of the aptitude or the interest in the subject,

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.680
[Amit Varma]: but you also had to have the massive will to make it through all the obstacles in your way.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.680
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, it strikes me that as far as these cricketing pioneers are concerned,

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.480
[Amit Varma]: including the three people we just mentioned

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.480
[Amit Varma]: and the two people who've, in a sense, mentored you,

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.480
[Amit Varma]: it kind of strikes me that, you know,

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:51.480
[Amit Varma]: that there is that intersection of great talent and great will that is very rare.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.480
[Amit Varma]: And in women's cricket, you have to have that.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.480
[Amit Varma]: And in men's cricket, you possibly don't.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, just by having great talent and being in the right place at the right time,

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.480
[Amit Varma]: you can make it to a fairly high level.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.480
[Amit Varma]: But in women's cricket, with all the obstacles, deciding to stick with it,

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.480
[Amit Varma]: deciding not to do any of the hundred other things that you can do,

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.280
[Amit Varma]: it's kind of crazy.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.280
[Amit Varma]: And is that something that you see still today?

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'm pretty sure it's true of the pioneers.

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.280
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, when you mentioned that, you know,

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.280
[Amit Varma]: Dhana Adulji was a remarkable woman and all of that.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.280
[Amit Varma]: Expand on that a little bit. I'd love to know.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.280
[Guest]: So going to slightly disagree with you there is that even in men's cricket,

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.280
[Guest]: I don't think you can make it nowadays just because of the sheer volumes

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.280
[Guest]: and the competition that we have without both those great talent and great will.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:41.080
[Guest]: But in terms of what is required at a pioneer stage,

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.080
[Guest]: that's literally the job description of a pioneer, I suppose.

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:48.080
[Guest]: You know, whether it's in women's cricket or whether it's in the freedom struggle

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.080
[Guest]: or any kind of field where they're breaking glass ceilings.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.080
[Guest]: I have this saying which I sadly have to agree with,

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.080
[Guest]: is that, you know, people who break glass ceilings often have bloody fists.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:05.080
[Guest]: And it's especially true, I think, of some of the pioneers of the women's cricket generation

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:09.880
[Guest]: because they gave up so much in terms of what they had to go through

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.880
[Guest]: to simply play the sport that they loved.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.880
[Guest]: I mean, I remember you would have read this in the book.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.880
[Guest]: There's an incidence where Shanta Rangaswamy was protesting against

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.880
[Guest]: some mismanagement by the administration and she was dropped.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.880
[Guest]: She was like simply dropped from the team.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:29.880
[Guest]: Similarly, Dhana Adulji has pushed through so much to build up the legacy

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.880
[Guest]: that the Indian Railways really has.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.680
[Guest]: She is the first women's cricketer to be employed by Railways

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:39.680
[Guest]: and she's the start of that legacy where she really put her name forward

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.680
[Guest]: to a politician at the time saying that my father is retiring from Western Railway.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.680
[Guest]: I would like to take his place because there was this system of, you know,

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.680
[Guest]: almost compensatory employment.

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:56.680
[Guest]: And she then just worked and worked and worked to have more and more cricketers employed.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.680
[Guest]: So, like, you know, what we hear feminists say nowadays

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.480
[Guest]: that if you get an opportunity, you should do your best to make sure

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.480
[Guest]: that that opportunity is also available to the next generation of women

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.480
[Guest]: who come after you.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.480
[Guest]: Before feminism really existed in the Indian consciousness,

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:14.480
[Guest]: these women were doing it and at the time great social cost

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.480
[Guest]: because you are putting yourself almost as a villain in many cases

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:26.480
[Guest]: to fight the case of women's cricket against very often male-dominated situations.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:30.280
[Guest]: And it's not going to be easy at all.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.280
[Guest]: In terms of my own experience with Diana Ma'am,

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.280
[Guest]: she was always this extremely senior figure

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.280
[Guest]: and I was just joining Western Railway in the early 20s.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.280
[Guest]: What used to happen is that she was posted in the office at Churchgate,

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.280
[Guest]: of course, that's the headquarters for Western Railway.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.280
[Guest]: I was posted at Bombay Central, but one month of the year

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.280
[Guest]: we would all spend at Churchgate where we were handling the railway recruitment drives.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.280
[Guest]: The entire women's cricket team would kind of be recruited

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.080
[Guest]: to just help out with that work and we would see her

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:04.080
[Guest]: literally having phone calls constantly, having meetings constantly

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:10.080
[Guest]: to make sure that Western Railway remained the top railway in terms of sports.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:14.080
[Guest]: Whether it's berating some coach who has not done his job

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:19.080
[Guest]: or whether it's making calls to make sure that this team is being transported

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.080
[Guest]: here in the best possible arrangements.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.880
[Guest]: Western Railway always pushed for the best talent,

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.880
[Guest]: the best kind of accommodation whenever our inter-railway tournaments used to happen.

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.880
[Guest]: She would always travel with us for inter-railway because we were her team.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.880
[Guest]: If we didn't do well, then it was a matter of pride for her

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.880
[Guest]: and nothing less than winning is acceptable

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.880
[Guest]: is the culture that she built out at Western Railway.

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.880
[Guest]: And there are some downsides to that culture.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:46.880
[Guest]: Yes, absolutely.

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.880
[Guest]: But the expectations, the high expectations that were set

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.680
[Guest]: was something that she did very rigorously.

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.680
[Guest]: And there was an aura of fear usually around her

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.680
[Guest]: because you do not want to get on her bad side

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.680
[Guest]: because you would be sitting in those offices

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:06.680
[Guest]: and of course they are not like sealed glass cabins

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.680
[Guest]: which are soundproof.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.680
[Guest]: I can just still imagine those thin walled Western Railway offices

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.680
[Guest]: where the upper sections of the high ceiling are just open

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:20.480
[Guest]: and everything that is being spoken inside is carrying out.

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.480
[Guest]: And you will hear her sometimes tearing into someone

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.480
[Guest]: who is not performed as per expectations.

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.480
[Guest]: I remember once I picked up an injury which she wasn't very happy about

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.480
[Guest]: and oh my god, that was an uncomfortable conversation.

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:39.480
[Guest]: But also this fierce admiration for someone who you knew would have your back

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.480
[Guest]: and make sure that you had the best in terms of coaching,

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.480
[Guest]: in terms of facilities available for the railways,

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:50.280
[Guest]: in terms of the kinds of leaves that we were able to get.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.280
[Guest]: And to the extent that Western Railway was very often the envy

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.280
[Guest]: of pretty much every other team

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.280
[Guest]: because we had someone fighting for us, someone in our corner.

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:04.280
[Guest]: So I can imagine, it's a great tragedy that we don't have records,

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.280
[Guest]: we don't have any kind of visual evidence of very little photos,

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:11.280
[Guest]: photographic evidence of some of these players in their prime.

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:17.080
[Guest]: And you look at them now when they are in their 50s and their 60s

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.080
[Guest]: and still they are so impressive.

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.080
[Guest]: And definitely as players you would think,

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.080
[Guest]: would have been very interesting to be in the same team as them.

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.080
[Guest]: Never a dull moment.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:31.080
[Amit Varma]: It's really interesting to me that your first class cricket really,

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:36.080
[Amit Varma]: the equivalent of first class cricket for women really started in the 70s

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.080
[Amit Varma]: but eventually railways was like the dominant team

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.080
[Amit Varma]: because it just employed all the best players.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.880
[Amit Varma]: So it just tells you kind of the force of one woman in building an ecosystem

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.880
[Amit Varma]: and what difference just one person can sometimes make.

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.880
[Amit Varma]: I think they won 19 out of 20 tournaments or something like that

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.880
[Amit Varma]: till a particular point in time.

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of get back to your sort of career now.

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.880
[Amit Varma]: You're this young teenager, you go to the nets,

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.880
[Amit Varma]: you want to be a wicketkeeper, they make you a fast bowler,

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.880
[Amit Varma]: you find out you're good at it.

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:07.880
[Amit Varma]: And then Amrita Shinde joins in 2006 and that kind of helps you along.

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.680
[Amit Varma]: And in 2008, you make your debut,

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.680
[Amit Varma]: and eventually you're bowling alongside Jhulan Goswami.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.680
[Amit Varma]: I think in your first ODI, you took three wickets while she took two.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.680
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about what that experience was like

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.680
[Amit Varma]: actually playing for the national team.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.680
[Guest]: So let me build up a little bit to that

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:30.680
[Guest]: in recognizing what led to that finally happening.

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.680
[Guest]: In terms of A, 2006, BCCI coming over,

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.680
[Guest]: we're playing on better grounds, better facilities,

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.480
[Guest]: all those kind of things, no longer living in dormitories,

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.480
[Guest]: no longer traveling unreserved.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.480
[Guest]: Instead, we're traveling AC, buses, planes and living in twin sharing.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.480
[Guest]: Oh my God, twin sharing, so cool.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:47.480
[Guest]: That kind of a shift.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.480
[Guest]: At the same time, we're now exposed to a much higher standard of cricket

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.480
[Guest]: thanks to players who are playing for the likes of Air India

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.480
[Guest]: coming back into the Maharashtra team.

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.480
[Guest]: That helped, you know, just make one step up.

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.480
[Guest]: 2007, like I said, I joined Railways and Western Railways.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.480
[Guest]: Western Railway was the strongest team on the circuit.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.280
[Guest]: Playing in that environment,

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.280
[Guest]: where suddenly I'm not the meanest bowler on the pitch

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.280
[Guest]: and, you know, there are batters who have,

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.280
[Guest]: out of the top six batters, four would have played for India

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.280
[Guest]: and pitting myself against them also then accelerated my development.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.280
[Guest]: And of course, being in Western Railway

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.280
[Guest]: and having a little more structured training, etc.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.280
[Guest]: And then the call came.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.280
[Guest]: It wasn't even a call.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.280
[Guest]: I mean, the whole process of, you know,

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.280
[Guest]: informing people of their selection is just so

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.080
[Guest]: poorly managed in India.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.080
[Guest]: I didn't expect to be picked for the series that I was picked for,

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.080
[Guest]: which was the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka in 2008.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.080
[Guest]: We had had a camp before that.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.080
[Guest]: I had done okay, okay, but, you know,

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.080
[Guest]: it wasn't really a breakthrough performance.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.080
[Guest]: But obviously, the selectors saw some talent.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.080
[Guest]: They decided to take a chance on it.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.080
[Guest]: I was at home, got a message from one of the players

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.080
[Guest]: saying that, oh, congrats. I'm like, ah, for what?

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.080
[Guest]: Then suddenly, you know, the Internet has

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.880
[Guest]: made its appearance in life. Go check websites.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.880
[Guest]: And I actually see my name there, which is really cool.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.880
[Guest]: I had gotten a little bit of a taste of what it would be like

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.880
[Guest]: to receive in kind of an India cap a few years earlier

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.880
[Guest]: when I had played for India under 21,

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.880
[Guest]: where we had gone to Pakistan.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.880
[Guest]: But actually arriving there,

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.880
[Guest]: we're given this box a few days before our departure,

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.880
[Guest]: which at the time Nike was sponsoring the BCCI.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.680
[Guest]: I'm like still in Nike kit.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.680
[Guest]: I've just had a sports session this morning.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.680
[Guest]: So I'm still in kit.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.680
[Guest]: And there's this box of Nike packaging

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.680
[Guest]: which we can take to our rooms and open.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.680
[Guest]: And we're all going through it.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.680
[Guest]: And we find our caps, our India caps.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.680
[Guest]: There was no culture of,

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:51.680
[Guest]: no paddhat of cap presentation and all, you know.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.680
[Guest]: You got your India cap, now wear it

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.680
[Guest]: and come onto the field was the kind of situation.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.480
[Guest]: I remember the first training session we had in Sri Lanka.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.480
[Guest]: I was so sick from some kind of food poisoning.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.480
[Guest]: I was vomiting on the ground.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.480
[Guest]: Wasn't really able to practice at all,

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.480
[Guest]: almost blacking out.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.480
[Guest]: And I was like, oh shit,

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.480
[Guest]: what a bad way to make a first impression.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.480
[Guest]: And then finally,

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.480
[Guest]: stomach settled down, nerves settled down

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.480
[Guest]: and we got in.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.480
[Guest]: That match that you're talking about

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.480
[Guest]: wasn't actually my first match for India.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.480
[Guest]: There was another match before that against Bangladesh.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.280
[Guest]: But at the time, Bangladesh didn't have ODI status.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.280
[Guest]: So therefore, it doesn't count as an official ODI.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.280
[Guest]: It doesn't count as my first match.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.280
[Guest]: But that was my first match against Bangladesh.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.280
[Guest]: The second match was against Pakistan.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.280
[Guest]: To do well in both those matches was nice

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.280
[Guest]: to hear Mithali Raj say, you know,

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.280
[Guest]: standing at mid-off and saying,

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.280
[Guest]: no, you bowl your full 10 overs.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.280
[Guest]: To have a show that kind of confidence in me

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.280
[Guest]: was really cool for a young cricketer

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.280
[Guest]: to, you know, go to the dressing room afterwards

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.080
[Guest]: and ask Jhuludi, Jhuludi, how did I do?

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:57.080
[Guest]: And to hear that, you know, yeah, you did well.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.080
[Guest]: You can do better.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.080
[Guest]: To get that kind of direct encouragement

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.080
[Guest]: and feedback was incredible.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.080
[Guest]: And I remember on that tour, Jhuludi actually,

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.080
[Guest]: I think she completed the landmark of 100 wickets.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.080
[Guest]: So being on that tour, being a part of that

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.080
[Guest]: was another special feeling.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.080
[Guest]: There are very few people on the women's cricket circuit

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.080
[Guest]: who I've connected on a wavelength with.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.880
[Guest]: And fortunately for me, one of the people I looked up to was one of them.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.880
[Guest]: Jhuludi was one of them.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.880
[Guest]: And she had this, at the same time,

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.880
[Guest]: competitiveness, extreme competitiveness,

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.880
[Guest]: but at the same time, this ability to,

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.880
[Guest]: you know, take the focus off herself

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.880
[Guest]: and guide the younger players.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.880
[Guest]: And again, I keep saying this, it keeps popping up,

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.880
[Guest]: but I almost wonder whether it,

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.880
[Guest]: how much energy she must have been pouring

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.680
[Guest]: still from what these kids say,

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.680
[Guest]: pouring into the current crop of younger cricketers.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.680
[Guest]: And just, despite that she's just an amazing cricketer

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.680
[Guest]: and the cricketer that she is, is amazing.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.680
[Guest]: So overall, getting to fulfil that dream

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.680
[Guest]: was an incredible experience.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.680
[Guest]: Where, you know, you have a dream of opening the bowling

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.680
[Guest]: with Jhulen Goswami for India.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.680
[Guest]: Got to do that, and that was pretty cool.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and her longevity is also amazing for a fast bowler.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.680
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, to give almost 20 years

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.480
[Amit Varma]: is kind of crazy.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.480
[Amit Varma]: So that 3 for 21 you took in the game against Pakistan,

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.480
[Amit Varma]: it was at one stretch, those 10 overs?

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.480
[Guest]: Yeah, those 10 overs, as far as I remember.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.480
[Guest]: I'll have to check ball by ball to be sure.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.480
[Guest]: But as far as I remember, those 10 overs were at a stretch.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.480
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's crazy.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that is really kind of tough physically.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:39.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, just in terms of physical conditioning by this time,

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.480
[Amit Varma]: I guess you had proper coaches and all of that.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.480
[Amit Varma]: And give me a sense from a fast bowling perspective,

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.280
[Amit Varma]: how different approaching a match is for a fast bowler

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.280
[Amit Varma]: as opposed to a batsman, for example,

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.280
[Amit Varma]: or even a spinner?

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.280
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, the spinners are the...

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.280
[Guest]: they have the easiest job.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.280
[Guest]: But for me, that had kind of become something

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.280
[Guest]: I'd been known for on the domestic circuit.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.280
[Guest]: You know, in the few seasons leading up to playing for India

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.280
[Guest]: and at that time, I had become a bit of a new ball specialist.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.280
[Guest]: I had become someone who can...

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.280
[Guest]: who regularly will bowl 10 overs upfront with a new ball.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:18.080
[Guest]: So, it wasn't down to any kind of specific training regime.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.080
[Guest]: It was probably just a lot of bowling.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.080
[Guest]: You know, we hear these two schools of thought nowadays within cricket.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.080
[Guest]: One is that, you know, you have your workload management

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.080
[Guest]: is that bowl only X number of balls per week, per day.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.080
[Guest]: And then you do the rest of your miles

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.080
[Guest]: in your cardio or something.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.080
[Guest]: And we didn't have any of those concepts.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.080
[Guest]: It was just sheerly bowling in the nets

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.880
[Guest]: for almost an hour, hour and 15 minutes

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.880
[Guest]: is how we used to kind of build up that kind of bowling fitness.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.880
[Guest]: Despite having a few coaches here and there,

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.880
[Guest]: there was only probably one other coach

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.880
[Guest]: in the state setup who had, you know,

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.880
[Guest]: shown that they have a very high level of knowledge.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.880
[Guest]: But I had not yet met someone who was able to

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.880
[Guest]: impress as a coach even in my first few years

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.880
[Guest]: in Western Delhi.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.680
[Guest]: But just training with a team like Western Delhi

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.680
[Guest]: where we were putting in a little more hours

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.680
[Guest]: in terms of what we were doing.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.680
[Guest]: There was a gym there, so I was doing gym work

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.680
[Guest]: properly for the first time in my life.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.680
[Guest]: I had been doing some gym before that.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.680
[Guest]: We had this tradition of going for weekly runs to Juhu beach.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.680
[Guest]: And we would head there and reach there by sunrise

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.680
[Guest]: and do a 45 minute, sometimes one hour long distance run.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.480
[Guest]: So these very old fashioned training methods,

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.480
[Guest]: no real knowledge about nutrition,

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.480
[Guest]: no real knowledge about recovery,

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.480
[Guest]: no dedicated time, energy, resources to really do this.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.480
[Guest]: Just try and have as much, you know,

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.480
[Guest]: regular home food as you can.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.480
[Guest]: That was kind of how it went back then.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.480
[Guest]: In terms of preparation for matches,

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.480
[Guest]: one challenge of, you know,

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.480
[Guest]: bowling those 10 overs at a stretch.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.480
[Guest]: For me, I'm someone who sweats a lot.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.280
[Guest]: I mean, they used to call me the Rahul Dravid of the women's cricket team.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.280
[Guest]: That much.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.280
[Guest]: No one would hug me after I took a wicket.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.280
[Guest]: Let's just say that.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.280
[Guest]: And one of the big challenges was cramps.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.280
[Guest]: One of the big challenges was,

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.280
[Guest]: especially training a lot in Mumbai,

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.280
[Guest]: very often playing in hot, humid conditions,

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.280
[Guest]: was cramps.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.280
[Guest]: So hydration, even though there was very little knowledge of nutrition

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.280
[Guest]: and those kind of things,

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.280
[Guest]: hydration became something that I paid a lot of attention to.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.280
[Guest]: So day before the match, my hydration would start.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.080
[Guest]: A day before the match, I would have my favorite brand of ORS

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.080
[Guest]: mixed into a bottle, ready.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.080
[Guest]: And I would kind of consume the entire quota

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.080
[Guest]: a day before the game.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.080
[Guest]: During the game, everyone knew

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.080
[Guest]: this is Poppy's bottle.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:49.080
[Guest]: Poppy, I mean, my nickname during my playing years was Poppy.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.080
[Guest]: So this is Poppy's bottle. Everyone knew.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.080
[Guest]: No one else touched that.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.080
[Guest]: And every opportunity,

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.080
[Guest]: whether it's, you know, a small pause in the game,

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.080
[Guest]: someone will come,

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.080
[Guest]: the 12th man will come inside and run

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.880
[Guest]: me drinks.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:02.880
[Guest]: So that was something that

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.880
[Guest]: I always constantly

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.880
[Guest]: was conscious of, worked on.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.880
[Guest]: It was always,

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.880
[Guest]: I mean, I marveled at all-rounders, you know,

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.880
[Guest]: I looked at people who were proper fast-bowling all-rounders.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.880
[Guest]: I'm like, how did you do it?

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:16.880
[Guest]: Because it was exhausting.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:17.880
[Guest]: Let's be honest.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.880
[Guest]: That kind of training, that kind of preparation.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.880
[Guest]: Of course, by that time, I was also working in Western Railways.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.880
[Guest]: So I had to spend half a day in an office

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.880
[Guest]: where all you want to do is curl up and sleep

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.680
[Guest]: rather than, you know, going through dusty old files

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.680
[Guest]: and having to sort them alphabetically

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.680
[Guest]: only to find out two days later

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.680
[Guest]: that it's all been jumbled up.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.680
[Guest]: That kind of experience was exhausting.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.680
[Guest]: So I really had no concept of

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.680
[Guest]: how these all-rounders did it.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.680
[Guest]: How people who were, Gurumeli Dhar for one example,

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.680
[Guest]: I mean, fantastic all-rounder for India,

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.680
[Guest]: regularly bowled 8-10 overs

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.680
[Guest]: and batted at, you know, 4-5-6 in the middle order.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.480
[Guest]: And I marveled at that.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.480
[Guest]: But it was, at that stage, incomprehensible to me.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.480
[Guest]: I was just about able to kind of

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.480
[Guest]: pour all my energies into bowling.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.480
[Guest]: It got me to that stage that it did.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I think, speaking of Gurumeli Dhar,

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.480
[Amit Varma]: she, I think, made a quick fire of 50

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.480
[Amit Varma]: at Modana Rannabowl in that particular match against Pakistan.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.480
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that Railways thing

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.480
[Amit Varma]: because my impression was you get a sports quota job,

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.480
[Amit Varma]: you're basically playing sports.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.480
[Guest]: But you also had to go to office and look through files.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.480
[Amit Varma]: What was your work there?

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.280
[Guest]: Oh, that was such a phase in life.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.280
[Guest]: Because, I mean, Dhanayadal ji was there.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.280
[Guest]: She had kind of created a system where, you know,

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.280
[Guest]: new players coming in had a place to stay in Mumbai.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.280
[Guest]: So, that first struggle of, you know, where to stay in Mumbai

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.280
[Guest]: wasn't as big a struggle in terms of finding that place.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.280
[Guest]: Getting used to that place was a different issue

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.280
[Guest]: because it was a railway quarter in Matunga.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.280
[Guest]: The Matunga Western Line Station right next to it.

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.280
[Guest]: Still, when you pass from Matunga to Mahim

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.280
[Guest]: and you look on your right,

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.080
[Guest]: you will see those probably blue and white painted houses.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.080
[Guest]: You know, once upon a time, I used to live in one of those houses

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.080
[Guest]: where we're banged next to the railway tracks

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.080
[Guest]: which is why, I mean, hearing just the train sounds in Mumbai

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:08.080
[Guest]: is just a part of my psyche, I suppose.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.080
[Guest]: And we're seven people in that flat.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.080
[Guest]: We're seven girls, all girls from the women's cricket team

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.080
[Guest]: staying in that flat.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.080
[Guest]: It's literally two rooms and a kitchen.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.080
[Guest]: And everyone has different schedules.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.880
[Guest]: There is no real furniture.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.880
[Guest]: We're sleeping on bedrolls on the floor.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.880
[Guest]: We're using that place as, you know, just to crash, essentially.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.880
[Guest]: I was lucky enough that I could,

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.880
[Guest]: I was close by enough to go to Bombay on the,

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.880
[Guest]: go to Pune on the weekends, etc.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.880
[Guest]: and enjoy home comforts.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.880
[Guest]: But moving to Mumbai, living in that kind of place

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.880
[Guest]: after, you know, experiencing Pune and Mumbai,

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.880
[Guest]: anyways, the amount of space you have available to you

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.880
[Guest]: is so very different.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.880
[Guest]: Then commuting every day, like, our routine was almost

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.680
[Guest]: sometimes, if we're doing twice a day training,

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.680
[Guest]: leave Matungar around 6.30.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.680
[Guest]: By 7.15, travel to Lower Parel

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.680
[Guest]: where the Western Railway ground is at Mahalakshmi

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.680
[Guest]: which is opposite Phoenix Mills and High Street Phoenix

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.680
[Guest]: which is now High Street Phoenix.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.680
[Guest]: There, 7.15 to 8.15, 9, have a morning session

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.680
[Guest]: whether that's fitness, whether that is a gym,

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.680
[Guest]: whether whatever is happening at that phase in time.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.480
[Guest]: Use the dormitories there to bathe, change,

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.480
[Guest]: head to office, get to office by 10 a.m.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.480
[Guest]: Stay in office, torturous 3 hours

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.480
[Guest]: and leave at 1 p.m.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.480
[Guest]: So, the facility that we received was half day.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.480
[Guest]: Being a Sports Quota athlete,

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.480
[Guest]: you could basically, you had to go to the office half day,

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.480
[Guest]: leave at 1.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.480
[Guest]: The stories that you hear of, you know, people

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.480
[Guest]: being signed on Sports Quota and then just never having to turn up

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.480
[Guest]: are either stories of extremely elite athletes

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.280
[Guest]: who set conditions that, you know,

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.280
[Guest]: okay, sorry, we're not going to turn up in an office ever

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.280
[Guest]: and the Railways wants them so bad that they accept those conditions

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.280
[Guest]: or people whose offices can be managed,

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.280
[Guest]: whose offices are, you know, cooperative enough to

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.280
[Guest]: yeah, okay, fine, don't come, that's okay

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.280
[Guest]: because everyone finally is posted into an office

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.280
[Guest]: and you're under a particular boss,

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.280
[Guest]: totally depends on how that boss is with regards to how you are,

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.280
[Guest]: how much workload that space has.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.280
[Guest]: I mean, within Western Railway, people who are posted at headquarters,

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.080
[Guest]: Churchgate, usually had very less workloads.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.080
[Guest]: People who are posted like me at Bombay Central,

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.080
[Guest]: working in the Bombay division, not headquarters division,

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.080
[Guest]: had very high workloads.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.080
[Guest]: So, we had no such allowances.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.080
[Guest]: There were, of course, a lot of our players who worked at,

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.080
[Guest]: who worked as TCs and they didn't have weekends off.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.080
[Guest]: They had only one day off a week

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.080
[Guest]: that may not even be on a Saturday, Sunday.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.080
[Guest]: They would actually be in trains checking tickets.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.880
[Guest]: So, that sometimes was like a good thing or a bad thing

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.880
[Guest]: because you're kind of on the fly.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.880
[Guest]: It's easy to fly away when you're on the fly.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.880
[Guest]: And then after 1 p.m., have food, usually outside somewhere

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.880
[Guest]: and head back to Mahalakshmi.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.880
[Guest]: The dormitory is there, had beds.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.880
[Guest]: So, we would usually catch an afternoon nap for an hour

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.880
[Guest]: and then 4 to 6 p.m., training again.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.880
[Guest]: 6 p.m., get back and travel back to Matunga.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.880
[Guest]: It took us about half an hour, 45 minutes.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.680
[Guest]: 7, 7.30 p.m., back, have food.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.680
[Guest]: And if you have any energy left for any recreation,

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.680
[Guest]: that's the time you got.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.680
[Guest]: And that was the kind of routine that we had.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.680
[Guest]: That was the kind of routine that I lived for a very long time

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.680
[Guest]: when I was living in that flat.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.680
[Guest]: Eventually, I moved out and lived with friends.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.680
[Guest]: But it is a very different kind of life.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.680
[Guest]: But at the same time, everyone exists, everyone accepted

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.680
[Guest]: that it is a very normal life for women's cricketers.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.480
[Guest]: I mean, just at any point of time in that flat,

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.480
[Guest]: there were at least 2 India cricketers there.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.480
[Guest]: I think when I was there, there were 4 out of the 7

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.480
[Guest]: had played for India.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.480
[Guest]: So, that was what an India cricketer's life is like.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.480
[Amit Varma]: Wow. And at this point, how are you sort of thinking

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.480
[Amit Varma]: about your life ahead?

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.480
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, there is a game,

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.480
[Amit Varma]: but at the same time, the Indian team just isn't playing so much.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.480
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, it's not like you're going to play 100 test matches.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's just not there. Obviously, I'm guessing

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.280
[Amit Varma]: you're not thinking that, oh, I want to be in railways all my life.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.280
[Amit Varma]: This is a great life.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:16.280
[Amit Varma]: So, how are you kind of thinking of life outside of cricket,

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.280
[Amit Varma]: after cricket and so on?

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.280
[Guest]: To be honest, I mean, in those early years,

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.280
[Guest]: I'm not thinking about after cricket because,

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.280
[Guest]: I mean, just the hope is that, you know,

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.280
[Guest]: you can make as much of this life as possible

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.280
[Guest]: and stay in cricket and continue to play

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.280
[Guest]: at a high level for as long as you can.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.280
[Guest]: You quickly realize that that's not always possible.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:38.080
[Guest]: There is, you know, at that time, so much insecurity in the team,

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.080
[Guest]: so much inconsistency and arbitrariness in selection.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.080
[Guest]: Absolutely no concept of, you know, nurturing a player.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.080
[Guest]: I mean, thinking back right now,

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.080
[Guest]: if I was an administrator and I had a female bowler

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.080
[Guest]: who was six feet tall, I would be making sure

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.080
[Guest]: that I nurture that bowler.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.080
[Guest]: And there were two or three of us who were,

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.080
[Guest]: you know, physically gifted like that.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.080
[Guest]: I would be making sure that I nurture that player

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.080
[Guest]: and having her as kind of a backup

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.880
[Guest]: and a succession for Jhulan Goswami.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.880
[Guest]: There was absolutely no thought like that

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.880
[Guest]: because you have to remember,

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.880
[Guest]: after the BCCI took over women's cricket,

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.880
[Guest]: something changed for the better, like I described before,

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.880
[Guest]: but something's changed for the worse.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.880
[Guest]: We were no longer the number one priority

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.880
[Guest]: of the association who was governing us.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.880
[Guest]: So, you know, whether there was a coach,

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.880
[Guest]: whether there was a national team program,

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.880
[Guest]: national team coaches also were on a revolving musical chair.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.880
[Guest]: So that's the context.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.880
[Guest]: That's the environment that we're kind of in

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.680
[Guest]: and it's an environment of survival rather than prosperity.

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.680
[Guest]: You know, you can't think about flourishing.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.680
[Guest]: You're just thinking about keeping your head above the water.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.680
[Guest]: And this is for the few of us who are lucky enough

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.680
[Guest]: to have government jobs, salaries,

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.680
[Guest]: you know, having already come close to

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.680
[Guest]: or having played for India.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.680
[Guest]: Even we are kind of going through that kind of a mindset

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.680
[Guest]: or at least I was, I won't speak for the others,

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.680
[Guest]: but that was a little glimpse of the environment.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.480
[Guest]: I always knew at the back of my mind

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.480
[Guest]: that I'm not going to stay with railways beyond my cricketing years.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.480
[Guest]: I had no idea what I would do.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.480
[Guest]: Absolutely none.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.480
[Guest]: But it was just a, it was an existence of hope

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.480
[Guest]: that you continue to stay, continue to survive,

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.480
[Guest]: hopefully get opportunities to play at the international level.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.480
[Guest]: If not, you have the fact that there is a railway job

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.480
[Guest]: who is kind of, the railway job is supporting you,

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.480
[Guest]: which is good, but there is a little bit of a

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:32.280
[Guest]: of a driftness to that existence.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.280
[Guest]: Even if you're playing for India, like you said,

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.280
[Guest]: there aren't a lot of matches happening,

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.280
[Guest]: three or four tournaments a year.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.280
[Guest]: When the next tournament happens,

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.280
[Guest]: whether the coach will be the same,

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.280
[Guest]: whether the selectors will still think the same about you,

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.280
[Guest]: an atmosphere of insecurity,

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.280
[Guest]: despite the security of these public sector jobs,

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.280
[Guest]: because you knew that there was no option besides the railways.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.280
[Guest]: It's not like I could, like my,

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.280
[Guest]: I had office mates in chess and table tennis

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.080
[Guest]: and badminton, and all of them could jump from railways

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.080
[Guest]: to petroleum if railways didn't treat them right.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.080
[Guest]: Or, you know, move to like a bank,

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.080
[Guest]: whereas women's cricket railways is the only employer.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.080
[Guest]: So there wasn't an abundance of options either.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.080
[Guest]: So it was this, it was this strange time.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.080
[Guest]: And I'm glad that a lot of cricketers today don't have to,

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.080
[Guest]: or if they're good enough,

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.080
[Guest]: they don't have to kind of go through that kind of time,

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.080
[Guest]: despite being grateful to the railways.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.080
[Guest]: I mean, let's be really clear.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.080
[Guest]: If not for that railway job,

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.880
[Guest]: I would probably have quit cricket after my graduation.

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.880
[Guest]: I turned down engineering, but I did a BSc.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.880
[Guest]: And in my third year, I was thinking about, you know,

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:32.880
[Guest]: higher education.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:33.880
[Guest]: Okay.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.880
[Guest]: How many years can you take,

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.880
[Guest]: keep taking money from your parents from,

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.880
[Guest]: to continue playing cricket,

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.880
[Guest]: which might give you absolutely nothing in the future.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:42.880
[Guest]: Railways kept me in the game.

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.880
[Guest]: Otherwise I would have gone off,

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.880
[Guest]: maybe done an MBA and be sitting in some corporate office right now.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:48.880
[Guest]: Railways kept me in the game.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.880
[Guest]: But at the same time, it's,

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.680
[Guest]: it's something which a few colleagues of mine describe as limiting ambitions

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.680
[Guest]: by being in that environment.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.680
[Amit Varma]: Thank God you ended up not doing an MBA

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.680
[Amit Varma]: and there are plenty of MBAs out there.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.680
[Amit Varma]: That's also the survivorship bias.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.680
[Amit Varma]: So there might be other people who made the same decisions as you,

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.680
[Amit Varma]: who might kind of regret making those decisions

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.680
[Amit Varma]: and not going in for an MBA.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.680
[Amit Varma]: So I guess that's there.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.680
[Amit Varma]: So during this period,

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:17.680
[Amit Varma]: and obviously, you know, in women's cricket,

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.680
[Amit Varma]: matches are simply not happening enough.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.480
[Amit Varma]: Like in the Fire Turns Blue, there is a stroke of how between,

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, half a generation was lost

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.480
[Amit Varma]: because between 86 and 91, there were just no games, you know.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.480
[Amit Varma]: So half a generation was just lost

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.480
[Amit Varma]: and couldn't play international cricket and so on.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.480
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, which is kind of one of those tragic losses.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.480
[Amit Varma]: Like we speak of, we know Mankat's lost two years during World War II,

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.480
[Amit Varma]: but those kind of gaps are just so common in women's cricket.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.480
[Amit Varma]: And obviously that affected you also in the sense that

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.480
[Amit Varma]: you didn't really play that many games till you eventually bowed out in 2012.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.280
[Amit Varma]: But you also spoke about, you know, if you were an administrator,

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.280
[Amit Varma]: you would have nurtured a young Snehal better than what actually happened.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.280
[Amit Varma]: So what really went wrong?

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.280
[Amit Varma]: Like where do you feel nurturing would have helped?

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, where did you go wrong?

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.280
[Guest]: With my own career?

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:11.280
[Guest]: So one thing was, I remember having this comparative example thrown about.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.280
[Guest]: I think this was the 2009 World Cup,

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.280
[Guest]: where we were all in Australia.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.080
[Guest]: And there was, I think we had gone there for a series before.

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.080
[Guest]: We were playing Australia in 2008.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.080
[Guest]: And there was a launch event, you know,

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.080
[Guest]: like a press event for the upcoming 2009 World Cup.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.080
[Guest]: And there were some representatives from some of the top countries.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.080
[Guest]: Isha Guha was there for England.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.080
[Guest]: The Australians, of course.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:36.080
[Guest]: I think Susie Bates must have been there from New Zealand.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.080
[Guest]: And I remember at the time hearing or learning

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.080
[Guest]: that England had kept the same team for the last four years.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.880
[Guest]: They had had that kind of vision that, you know,

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.880
[Guest]: if we're going to do well in the World Cup,

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.880
[Guest]: we need to give a lot of match experience to the players who we select.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.880
[Guest]: So they had essentially selected their World Cup team

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.880
[Guest]: practically four years before.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.880
[Guest]: And by the time they came into that World Cup,

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.880
[Guest]: all of their playing XI and their key players had played about 50 ODIs.

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.880
[Guest]: Yeah. So I remember that.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.880
[Guest]: I am thinking I'm so jealous of that.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.880
[Guest]: I'm so jealous of the fact that, you know,

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.680
[Guest]: what I had heard at the time was these players are told that,

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.680
[Guest]: you know, even if you get four ducks in a row,

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.680
[Guest]: you're going to be in the team.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.680
[Guest]: I was like, I'm so jealous of that because I'm constantly

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.680
[Guest]: in this environment where despite doing well, I might get dropped.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.680
[Guest]: I mean, the 2009 World Cup, I didn't play a single game.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.680
[Guest]: The next World Cup that was happening after that,

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.680
[Guest]: I wasn't in the team.

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:33.680
[Guest]: There was like a domestic tournament before that.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.680
[Guest]: I did OK.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.680
[Guest]: But, you know, you would think that you would hold on to your place

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:40.680
[Guest]: unless you get knocked off at the international level.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:44.480
[Guest]: At least so much arbitrariness in selections.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.480
[Guest]: I mean, there was one phase where India caps

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.480
[Guest]: were being just handed out in a slightly ill manner.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:55.480
[Guest]: And it's this kind of environment that makes it difficult.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.480
[Guest]: And I'm not going to sit here and blame the environment,

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.480
[Guest]: just the environment and, you know, not say that I could have done better.

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.480
[Guest]: I've already said that.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.480
[Guest]: Looking back, I wish that I had taken the game more professionally.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.480
[Guest]: I had trained much more.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:12.280
[Guest]: I had played a lot more matches outside of what, you know,

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.280
[Guest]: India or Maharashtra were providing to me,

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.280
[Guest]: which are a lot of things that I did in the latter half

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.280
[Guest]: of my domestic cricket career and saw value in that.

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.280
[Guest]: But, you know, at the time, like we said,

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.280
[Guest]: we were figuring things out.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.280
[Guest]: Didn't have this constant coaching,

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.280
[Guest]: always moving from, OK, now you're at the Western Railway coach,

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.280
[Guest]: now you're at some other coach, now you're at some other coach.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.280
[Guest]: Whereas nowadays, every player you hear at the top level

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.080
[Guest]: comes to the top level because they've had this constancy in coaching.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.080
[Guest]: They've had, you know, one person who's kind of,

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.080
[Guest]: they always can go back to that one person,

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.080
[Guest]: which really wasn't there for me.

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.080
[Guest]: So there was no shortage of hard work,

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.080
[Guest]: but there was these other things which I wish that I had done differently

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.080
[Guest]: in terms of, you know, the time where I lost my place

01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.080
[Guest]: in the Indian team because of the suspect action calling.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.080
[Guest]: That was one of those phases where I was very much in between coaches.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.080
[Guest]: You know, who should I be learning from exactly?

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.880
[Guest]: That is one of the things I wish I had gotten sorted a lot earlier in life.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.880
[Guest]: And the fact is, there weren't as many people

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.880
[Guest]: who were becoming personal coaches of women's cricketers back then.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.880
[Guest]: So that is something that I feel I could have done better

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.880
[Guest]: in terms of approaching the game more professionally.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.880
[Guest]: I kind of got caught up in the railway's life.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.880
[Guest]: You know, I have to keep the people at office also happy.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.880
[Guest]: I have to make sure I'm doing my best.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.880
[Guest]: Whereas now, thinking back, I could have thought, you know,

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.680
[Guest]: I mean, maybe that's just the people pleaser in me thinking that,

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.680
[Guest]: but I could have thought, let office go to hell.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.680
[Guest]: I'm here to play cricket.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.680
[Guest]: I can play cricket for a finite amount of years.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.680
[Guest]: I don't care if people in the office are unhappy,

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.680
[Guest]: but I'm going to spend more time on the ground.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.680
[Guest]: You know, maybe that's something that I could have thought.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.680
[Guest]: But again, the environment is such that you're penalized

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.680
[Guest]: for that kind of thinking.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.680
[Guest]: I mean, if I just drop everything and run

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.680
[Guest]: and not turn up to office for five days,

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.680
[Guest]: I have to go back and face consequences at some point.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.680
[Guest]: Which is, I mean, things that happened.

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:06.480
[Guest]: I, at one point, got charge-sheeted in the office for not turning up

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.480
[Guest]: when they called me to work on a weekend.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:11.480
[Amit Varma]: So, they have charge-sheets.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.480
[Guest]: They have charge-sheets.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.480
[Guest]: This is the literal word, charge-sheets.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:18.480
[Guest]: I can still remember the word sitting on those brown faded paper.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.480
[Amit Varma]: Oh my God.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.480
[Guest]: Jesus.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:26.480
[Guest]: So, that was, it was a semi-professional environment.

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.480
[Guest]: We keep talking about, you know,

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.480
[Guest]: how India has professional contracts for the top 20 players.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:32.280
[Guest]: Okay, fine.

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.280
[Guest]: 2015 onwards, that existed.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.280
[Guest]: In our time, there was no such thing as an India contract.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.280
[Guest]: You go to one tour.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.280
[Guest]: Okay, you earn a lot more money

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.280
[Guest]: than you've ever earned before playing cricket for the BCCI.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:47.280
[Guest]: But suddenly, the next tour, that doesn't exist.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.280
[Guest]: So, that's something that we're aware of.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.280
[Guest]: That this kind of, there's no constancy,

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.280
[Guest]: there's no financial support.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.280
[Guest]: Besides, you know, I keep complaining,

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.080
[Guest]: but I have a railway job.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.080
[Guest]: Still, I'm thinking like this.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.080
[Guest]: I'm kind of stuck in this kind of thinking.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.080
[Guest]: So, I wish my thinking had been very different.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:07.080
[Guest]: The kind of thinking that now I approach my,

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.080
[Guest]: not just media career, but also the career

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.080
[Guest]: where I'm trying to build my own coaching,

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.080
[Guest]: especially my online coaching.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.080
[Guest]: The kind of thinking that I'm applying right now.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.080
[Guest]: The kind of initiative I'm showing

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:19.080
[Guest]: in trying to get the kind of guidance that I need.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.080
[Guest]: I wish I had those kind of attitudes back then.

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.080
[Guest]: But I also recognize that the environment is very different

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.880
[Guest]: and you have to be like, you know,

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.880
[Guest]: some of those pioneers.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.880
[Guest]: This really driven person

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.880
[Guest]: to crack that kind of situation.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.880
[Guest]: And which is why I have serious respect

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.880
[Guest]: for the likes of, you know, Mithali Raj, Julen Goswami

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.880
[Guest]: and people who have been in this situation

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.880
[Guest]: and excelled for so long.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, one when that happened,

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.880
[Amit Varma]: like around 2012, you were called for a suspect action

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.880
[Amit Varma]: and your career gradually petered out

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.880
[Amit Varma]: and you played your last game, I think in 2015.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.680
[Amit Varma]: So what was that phase like?

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Did you feel that you were kind of left alone to fend for yourself?

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Not enough support within the system?

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.680
[Amit Varma]: And at what point did you start figuring out

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.680
[Amit Varma]: that, okay, this is going to end at some point

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.680
[Amit Varma]: and I need to think about what I'm going to do beyond that.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.680
[Amit Varma]: So what was sort of that transitional phase like

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.680
[Amit Varma]: when you kind of started thinking seriously

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:13.680
[Amit Varma]: about what do I do next?

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And also as a general question,

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.680
[Amit Varma]: we'll talk about women's cricket more in detail after the break,

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.680
[Amit Varma]: but just as a general question,

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:23.480
[Amit Varma]: when male cricketers end their careers, there are often different kinds

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.480
[Amit Varma]: of post-career pipelines that are there.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.480
[Amit Varma]: They can enter local administrations

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.480
[Amit Varma]: or those who are fortunate enough can get into media

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.480
[Amit Varma]: and all these different kind of pipelines are there.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.480
[Amit Varma]: There are precedents for what people have done

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:37.480
[Amit Varma]: and chances are that on average,

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.480
[Amit Varma]: they've actually made more money also.

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.480
[Amit Varma]: So is there something like that?

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Is it like I imagine like for all of us, you know,

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.480
[Amit Varma]: like my career really probably ends when I drop down dead.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.480
[Amit Varma]: But for sports people, that's not the case.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.280
[Amit Varma]: For sports people, you are kind of in the peak of your physical life

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.280
[Amit Varma]: when suddenly it's over.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.280
[Amit Varma]: Everything that was the center of your life for so long is just done.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.280
[Amit Varma]: So is that something in a general sense that,

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, how have people around you coped with that?

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.280
[Amit Varma]: And in a specific sense,

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.280
[Amit Varma]: how was it like you when you started kind of transitioning?

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.280
[Guest]: It's actually funny that, you know,

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.280
[Guest]: the period where after I was called for a suspect action

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.280
[Guest]: and the one year after that was really difficult.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:22.080
[Guest]: But the phase after that, maybe the last few years of my domestic career

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.080
[Guest]: were actually the best cricket that I had ever played

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.080
[Guest]: because I had gotten a lot of the things which I wish I had gotten right earlier.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.080
[Guest]: I had gotten them right later.

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.080
[Guest]: But in the phase of where I was called for suspect action,

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.080
[Guest]: I remember the actual day when the announcement was made.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.080
[Guest]: I found out on TV, which was terrible.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.080
[Guest]: I mean, I remember being really angry at the media.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.880
[Guest]: You know, usually you guys don't cover women's cricket at all.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.880
[Guest]: Now you're putting it on the headlines just because

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.880
[Guest]: I've been called for a suspect action.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.880
[Guest]: I found myself really angry at the media

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.880
[Guest]: because, you know, there was this little bit of a stigma

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.880
[Guest]: around suspect actions before,

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.880
[Guest]: whereas now it's looked at more holistically.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.880
[Guest]: You know, people don't think Sunil Narayan is a bad person

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.880
[Guest]: because he had a suspect action,

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.880
[Guest]: whereas there was a little bit of a stigma around, you know, cheating

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.880
[Guest]: and all those kind of things around suspect actions a little further back.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.680
[Guest]: And therefore, it was almost like I was being portrayed on TV as a villain.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.680
[Guest]: And I really remember resenting that.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:22.680
[Guest]: I really remember being distressed, watching the news

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.680
[Guest]: and seeing myself on the 8 o'clock news in the sports section.

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.680
[Guest]: I'm like, come on, when India do well at the World Cup,

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.680
[Guest]: you don't highlight us there.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.680
[Guest]: And now when there's some kind of infamy,

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.680
[Guest]: immediately you guys wake up.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.680
[Guest]: So I remember that.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.480
[Guest]: It was during a national camp at Bangalore.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.480
[Guest]: So in that sense, I had immediate support.

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.480
[Guest]: I remember Sandeep Patil was the director of the NCA.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.480
[Guest]: The next day he called me into his office

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.480
[Guest]: and he told me, you'll be fine in six months.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.480
[Guest]: I said, I'm going to be fine in three.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.480
[Guest]: And that determination was there.

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.480
[Guest]: It was a near miss kind of a situation.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.480
[Guest]: They take you to a lab.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.480
[Guest]: This lab happened to be in Perth, Australia,

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.280
[Guest]: where they put electrodes on your arm and you're asked to bowl.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.280
[Guest]: Not electrodes, but they put those fluorescent dots

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.280
[Guest]: which basically show up on a particular type of camera.

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:21.280
[Guest]: And that camera tells you that roughly

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.280
[Guest]: this ball angle was this much, this ball angle was this much.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.280
[Guest]: If the permissible limit is 15 degrees,

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.280
[Guest]: my average was about 17 degrees.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.280
[Guest]: So I believed that it's just a minor adjustment

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.280
[Guest]: that needs to be made.

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.080
[Guest]: Strength levels need to be improved to make sure

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.080
[Guest]: that the arm isn't taking that much of the load.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.080
[Guest]: Some technical adjustments were made

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.080
[Guest]: in getting my action slightly more round

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.080
[Guest]: so as to not go past vertical,

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.080
[Guest]: which can lead to that.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.080
[Guest]: On top of that, I have a naturally hyperextended elbow.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.080
[Guest]: Not as much as the Muralis or the Shoaibs,

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.080
[Guest]: but this is something that's fairly common

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:01.080
[Guest]: in subcontinental bodies and especially

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.080
[Guest]: slightly taller, longer bodies.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.880
[Guest]: So therefore, the optical impression is just enhanced

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.880
[Guest]: when you're watching an action with the naked eye.

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.880
[Guest]: So the immediate support was good

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.880
[Guest]: because the coaches within that camp,

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.880
[Guest]: we sat down, we kind of chalked out a plan.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.880
[Guest]: The months after that, it did take six months eventually,

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:25.880
[Guest]: despite my determination and young bullishness.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.880
[Guest]: But the months after that were difficult.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.880
[Guest]: I remember and really appreciate

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.680
[Guest]: some of the Indian team players checking in,

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.680
[Guest]: but I had zero idea who to talk to

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.680
[Guest]: about the BCCI about this.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.680
[Guest]: I had zero idea who to talk to

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.680
[Guest]: about my state association about this.

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.680
[Guest]: I kept asking them for answers.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:45.680
[Guest]: Okay, when is there going to be an assessment?

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:46.680
[Guest]: What is going to happen?

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:47.680
[Guest]: What are the next steps?

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:50.680
[Guest]: And there was very little communication.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.680
[Guest]: Eventually, there was a review a few months down the line.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.680
[Guest]: Then once we were all confident,

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:58.680
[Guest]: there was another review at the ICC level.

01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.680
[Guest]: Everything was fine.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:03.480
[Guest]: Action back into legal status and bowling action cleared.

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.480
[Guest]: But in that time, I could not bowl for my state.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.480
[Guest]: So I was playing for my state as a batter.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.480
[Guest]: And this was the tricky period

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:12.480
[Guest]: because then at one point,

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.480
[Guest]: I lost my spot in the state team as well,

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:17.480
[Guest]: which, you know, absolutely zero concept of,

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.480
[Guest]: okay, now you're out of the team.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.480
[Guest]: You'll still be supported.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.480
[Guest]: You can still come to training.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.480
[Guest]: We'll still help you with that

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.480
[Guest]: because you are a valuable member of the state side.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.480
[Guest]: You've been with the state side for the last five, six years.

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:31.280
[Guest]: And like absolutely zero, no such support.

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:35.280
[Guest]: It was a very much friend for yourself kind of a situation.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:40.280
[Guest]: A situation where you are shown who your real friends are.

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.280
[Guest]: But eventually, I mean, just through sheer determination

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.280
[Guest]: and sticking to the kind of processes

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.280
[Guest]: that we had mapped out in that first camp

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.280
[Guest]: as to how we can fix it

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:52.280
[Guest]: and working with the coach

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.280
[Guest]: while I was out of the camp as well.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:58.080
[Guest]: Again, correcting one of the mistakes of the past.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.080
[Guest]: I got back and I mean,

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.080
[Guest]: I'm pretty proud of the second half of that career.

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:06.080
[Guest]: So I wouldn't say my career petered out

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:09.080
[Guest]: because I had some of my best years with Maharashtra after that.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.080
[Guest]: Yes, I didn't play for India again,

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:13.080
[Guest]: but I captained India A.

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:16.080
[Guest]: My last professional game was playing for India A against New Zealand.

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:21.080
[Guest]: So I was very close to breaking back into the Indian team.

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:26.880
[Guest]: So that part of the journey was difficult,

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:27.880
[Guest]: but at the same time rewarding

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:28.880
[Guest]: because like you said,

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.880
[Guest]: you have to learn from these kind of things

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.880
[Guest]: and sometimes only when these kind of things happen,

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:33.880
[Guest]: do you learn.

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:36.880
[Guest]: So there was definitely a change in my approach towards fitness,

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.880
[Guest]: towards professionalism also.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.880
[Guest]: The situation in my Western Railway office

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.880
[Guest]: also improved somewhat

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.880
[Guest]: where I can be away from work a lot more than I could.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.880
[Guest]: So that helped and I could train a lot more

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.680
[Guest]: with the coaches and get the kind of match experience that I needed.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:54.680
[Guest]: And I mean,

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:59.680
[Guest]: some of my best spells were in those 2014-2015 years

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.680
[Guest]: and I retired in 2015.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:02.680
[Guest]: I had, like I said,

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.680
[Guest]: just made it to India A,

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:06.680
[Guest]: felt like I was one step away from,

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.680
[Guest]: one good performance away from making it back to the Indian team.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:10.680
[Guest]: But again,

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.680
[Guest]: didn't get selected into the Indian team after that India A game

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:18.680
[Guest]: and no idea about what women's cricket looks like

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.480
[Guest]: for the next rest of the year.

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:21.480
[Guest]: After that series,

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:22.480
[Guest]: what's going to happen?

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.480
[Guest]: Even that series was announced so last minute

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:29.480
[Guest]: that I remember coming into that camp completely unprepared

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.480
[Guest]: because we thought we were heading into an off-season

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.480
[Guest]: and suddenly New Zealand is visiting.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.480
[Guest]: That kind of situation.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:37.480
[Guest]: No idea when India is going to play next.

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.480
[Guest]: No idea what to kind of build up to

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.480
[Guest]: besides a vague target of,

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.480
[Guest]: you know, the 2017 World Cup.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.480
[Guest]: And this situation where there was a lot of uncertainty.

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.480
[Guest]: So the question is,

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.280
[Guest]: do I want to then, at the age of 28, 29,

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.280
[Guest]: do I want to continue and give it another couple of years

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.280
[Guest]: with an excruciating amount of hard work

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.280
[Guest]: that had gone into those last couple of years

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.280
[Guest]: which were leading to good performances?

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.280
[Guest]: Do I want to do that all over again?

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:03.280
[Guest]: Again, with the uncertainty

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.280
[Guest]: whether I will play for India or not.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.280
[Guest]: Close to 30 selectors usually prefer younger bowlers,

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.280
[Guest]: younger players at that point,

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.280
[Guest]: arbitrariness of selection and those kind of things.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:17.080
[Guest]: Or whether do I want to give myself some time to

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.080
[Guest]: look to build a second career.

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:21.080
[Guest]: And I knew that because I was going to quit railways,

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.080
[Guest]: I had to make a living somehow, some other way.

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:27.080
[Guest]: And therefore whether that is the right time

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.080
[Guest]: to think about giving myself time to do that.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.080
[Guest]: And eventually I decided on the latter.

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, that feels like an absolutely agonizing decision.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.080
[Amit Varma]: Do you sometimes look back and wonder

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.080
[Amit Varma]: had you stayed in the game,

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080
[Amit Varma]: could things have been different?

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you could have been part of the 2017 team, for example.

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.880
[Amit Varma]: Especially if you were bowling at your best

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:49.880
[Amit Varma]: at that point in time.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.880
[Amit Varma]: Is that a thought that stays with you?

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I guess it wouldn't come so much

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.880
[Amit Varma]: because you are extremely successful in what you're doing.

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.880
[Amit Varma]: But that may not have been the case.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.880
[Amit Varma]: So is that a thought that sometimes comes to you,

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:03.880
[Amit Varma]: the counterfactual?

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.880
[Guest]: No, I mean, I think about it.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:09.880
[Guest]: But I don't regret that decision at that time.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.680
[Guest]: There was also an element of, you know,

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.680
[Guest]: having played cricket despite being only 28-29,

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:16.680
[Guest]: having played cricket for 15 years

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.680
[Guest]: and at the same time remembering and knowing

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.680
[Guest]: because of my, I suppose, family background

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.680
[Guest]: and this constant awareness that, you know,

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.680
[Guest]: there is something beyond the railways

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.680
[Guest]: that there are other things that can

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.680
[Guest]: give me a lot of happiness which are out there.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.680
[Guest]: I didn't know what those things were.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.680
[Guest]: Also a determination to stay connected to cricket.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.480
[Guest]: That, you know, even though I will no longer be playing cricket,

01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:43.480
[Guest]: I'll still be doing something or the other in the game

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.480
[Guest]: because, I mean, that is the primary skill I had

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.480
[Guest]: at, you know, the stage where I'm retiring.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.480
[Guest]: Again, zero idea what I will do.

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.480
[Guest]: Also, those last few years,

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.480
[Guest]: even though they were successful in terms of

01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:57.480
[Guest]: what I was getting out,

01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:59.480
[Guest]: they demanded more and more in terms of

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.480
[Guest]: what I had to put in.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.480
[Guest]: As a fast bowler, there are always going to be

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:03.480
[Guest]: a few injuries here and there

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.280
[Guest]: towards those last year or so,

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.280
[Guest]: I had developed this weird pain in my ankles

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.280
[Guest]: where, you know, after every game,

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.280
[Guest]: I had to put both my feet in a bucket of ice.

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.280
[Guest]: So, those are all things which were kind of

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.280
[Guest]: building up and contributing to that decision.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:23.280
[Guest]: And it's a hard life as a fast bowler,

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.280
[Guest]: as a player who is, you know,

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.280
[Guest]: fully committedly professional in an environment

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:30.280
[Guest]: which is giving you no guarantee of results.

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:34.080
[Guest]: And so, therefore, I don't have any regrets, you know.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.080
[Guest]: I don't think, oh, whatever I had been

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.080
[Guest]: at the 2017 World Cup,

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.080
[Guest]: because I was at the 2017 World Cup

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.080
[Amit Varma]: in another capacity.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.080
[Guest]: So, in a way, I don't feel like

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.080
[Guest]: I've disconnected from the game or given up the game.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.080
[Guest]: I just feel like I've switched teams.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.080
[Guest]: And so, I don't have regrets about

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.080
[Guest]: how things happened.

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.080
[Guest]: There's also a recognition that,

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.080
[Guest]: like I said, I was a very different person

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.880
[Guest]: from, you know, the people you'd usually find

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.880
[Guest]: at the women's cricket level,

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.880
[Guest]: where people would think, you know,

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.880
[Guest]: the railway job is never something you quit.

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.880
[Guest]: Whereas, I have no doubt in my mind

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.880
[Guest]: that this is something I'm not going to do

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.880
[Guest]: because I knew I could do other things.

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:14.880
[Guest]: So, a lot of people ask me,

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.880
[Guest]: why didn't you take up coaching after you quit?

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.880
[Guest]: Because I knew that, you know,

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.880
[Guest]: everyone can do coaching,

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.880
[Guest]: but very few people can do what I do

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.880
[Guest]: with the communication skills that I have,

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.880
[Guest]: with the language skills that I have.

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.680
[Guest]: And so, I knew that I had the opportunity

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.680
[Guest]: to contribute in different ways

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.680
[Guest]: because I had already gotten a taste of that

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:35.680
[Guest]: while I was playing.

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.680
[Guest]: So, like thinking about,

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.680
[Guest]: I never think about the counterfactual.

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.680
[Guest]: I don't think about, you know,

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.680
[Guest]: that entire time at the 2017 World Cup,

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:45.680
[Guest]: not once did I think,

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.680
[Guest]: oh my God, this could have been me.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.680
[Guest]: But on the other hand, I was thinking,

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.680
[Guest]: oh my God, wow, I'm here.

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.680
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous. We'll take a quick commercial break

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.480
[Amit Varma]: and when we come back on the other side,

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.480
[Amit Varma]: we'll actually talk about your life after cricket,

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.480
[Amit Varma]: which to me, in a sense,

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:03.480
[Amit Varma]: is also incredibly inspiring

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:04.480
[Amit Varma]: and a lot to learn from this.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.480
[Amit Varma]: So, we'll take a quick commercial break before that.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.480
[Amit Varma]: People often say,

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.480
[Amit Varma]: hey, cricket is not such a big sport.

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.480
[Amit Varma]: Only a few countries take it seriously.

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.480
[Amit Varma]: Well, let me put it like this.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.480
[Amit Varma]: If you were to gather all the cricket fans in the world

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.480
[Amit Varma]: and make a country out of them,

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.480
[Amit Varma]: Cricketistan would be one of the biggest countries in the world.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And the national app of Cricketistan

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.280
[Amit Varma]: would be the co-sponsor of this episode, Crick Heroes.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.280
[Amit Varma]: For any casual cricketer or cricket fan,

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.280
[Amit Varma]: Crick Heroes is the final piece of the puzzle

01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.280
[Amit Varma]: as far as cricket apps are concerned.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.280
[Amit Varma]: Look, the other apps and websites

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.280
[Amit Varma]: will give you information, features, data,

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.280
[Amit Varma]: but you'll be a passive consumer of big events.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.280
[Amit Varma]: Crick Heroes makes you a participant.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.280
[Amit Varma]: Are you a recreational cricketer

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.280
[Amit Varma]: who wishes there was a record of your performances?

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.280
[Amit Varma]: Well, Crick Heroes allows players everywhere

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.280
[Amit Varma]: to record their scorecards in real time.

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:52.280
[Amit Varma]: Every match, even a gully match if you want.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.080
[Amit Varma]: You can track the arc of your own career.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.080
[Amit Varma]: And you can track your friends.

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.080
[Amit Varma]: You can trade cricket-related goods and services

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.080
[Amit Varma]: with them in the Crick Heroes marketplace.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.080
[Amit Varma]: You might even find a coach there.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.080
[Amit Varma]: 10 million people use Crick Heroes.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.080
[Amit Varma]: What's more, so do 38 national boards across the world

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.080
[Amit Varma]: and many state boards in India

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:12.080
[Amit Varma]: so that they can track every game that happens.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.080
[Amit Varma]: No talent left behind.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.080
[Amit Varma]: So head on over to crickheroes.in

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.080
[Amit Varma]: and download Crick Heroes now.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.080
[Amit Varma]: If you love cricket, you'll love Crick Heroes.

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.880
[Amit Varma]: And I had discovered this technique

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:52.880
[Amit Varma]: where by squeezing it a lot

01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.880
[Amit Varma]: and releasing it just as, you know,

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.880
[Amit Varma]: whatever I could impart great forward spin,

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.880
[Amit Varma]: which made it really fast, right?

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.880
[Amit Varma]: So Dravid came over once to play with us

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:02.880
[Amit Varma]: and I bowled him.

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:04.880
[Amit Varma]: My first ball, I was trying, you know,

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of a backward spin kind of thing.

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:07.880
[Amit Varma]: And that was a wide.

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.880
[Amit Varma]: Next two balls, he was clean bowled.

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.880
[Amit Varma]: In exasperation, he called me Shoaib Akhtar

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.880
[Amit Varma]: and said, I can't play against you.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.880
[Amit Varma]: But the irony was that it was all finger spin.

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.680
[Amit Varma]: There was no chucking involved.

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.680
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that aside

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.680
[Amit Varma]: and in case I gave the impression

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.680
[Amit Varma]: that I also play cricket,

01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.680
[Amit Varma]: I'd be absolutely useless in a field.

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.680
[Amit Varma]: So kind of moving on from your cricketing career,

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.680
[Amit Varma]: like one of the things that I'm actually excited

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.680
[Amit Varma]: talking about is this next part

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.680
[Amit Varma]: because I have been thinking a lot in recent months

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.680
[Amit Varma]: about creators in general,

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.680
[Amit Varma]: about things like teaching,

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:41.680
[Amit Varma]: about things like how do you achieve excellence

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.680
[Amit Varma]: in what you do?

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.680
[Amit Varma]: And there are just so many dimensions

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:47.480
[Amit Varma]: to things that you've done in this period

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.480
[Amit Varma]: in terms of writing,

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.480
[Amit Varma]: in terms of starting a YouTube channel

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.480
[Amit Varma]: and making that work,

01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:53.480
[Amit Varma]: in terms of coaching

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:54.480
[Amit Varma]: and not just coaching cricket,

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.480
[Amit Varma]: but also coaching sports journalism

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.480
[Amit Varma]: and in terms of doing commentary

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:01.480
[Amit Varma]: in two different languages.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.480
[Amit Varma]: So let's start with what actually came first,

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.480
[Amit Varma]: which I don't know.

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.480
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, after your cricketing career was done,

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, where did you go next?

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:09.480
[Amit Varma]: What happened next?

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:10.480
[Amit Varma]: How were you thinking

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.480
[Amit Varma]: of what you want to do from now on?

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.280
[Guest]: So writing came first

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.280
[Guest]: and it happened in parallel

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.280
[Guest]: with kind of the second half

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.280
[Guest]: of my cricket career.

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.280
[Guest]: There was this,

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:24.280
[Guest]: like, since school,

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.280
[Guest]: okay, so maybe I should go

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.280
[Guest]: a little further back.

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.280
[Guest]: When I was in,

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.280
[Guest]: like I said,

01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:33.280
[Guest]: I changed schools at one point.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.280
[Guest]: The first school that I was in

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.280
[Guest]: where we were living with the joint family

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:39.280
[Guest]: was a convent.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.280
[Guest]: And, you know,

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:42.280
[Guest]: it is this fairly prestigious convent,

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.080
[Guest]: this really old school,

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.080
[Guest]: which has been around since my parents' time.

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:47.080
[Guest]: My mother went to that school.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.080
[Guest]: My father went to the school next to it,

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.080
[Guest]: which is a boys' convent.

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.080
[Amit Varma]: Which school was this?

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.080
[Guest]: St. Joseph's.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.080
[Guest]: Okay.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.080
[Guest]: St. Joseph's Pashan,

01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.080
[Guest]: and next door is Loyola's,

01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.080
[Guest]: where my father went

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.080
[Guest]: and St. Joseph's was where my mother went.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.080
[Guest]: And they wanted me to get admission.

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.080
[Guest]: And, you know,

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:07.080
[Guest]: the whole convent colonial obsession

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:09.080
[Guest]: with their language,

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.880
[Guest]: you know, you should be able to speak good English

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:11.880
[Guest]: from nursery,

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:13.880
[Guest]: otherwise you won't get admission kind of situation,

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.880
[Guest]: created an environment at home

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.880
[Guest]: where we were speaking a lot of English.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.880
[Guest]: So despite being a Marathi family,

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.880
[Guest]: despite being a family where,

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:23.880
[Guest]: you know,

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.880
[Guest]: my grandparents had most of their education in Marathi,

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.880
[Guest]: we were speaking a lot of English at home,

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:31.880
[Guest]: mainly to get me into the habit of speaking in English

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.880
[Guest]: so I would fit into a convent school.

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.880
[Guest]: Due to that fact,

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.880
[Guest]: I've always had good English speaking skills.

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.680
[Guest]: So therefore,

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.680
[Guest]: I always enjoyed English throughout school.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.680
[Guest]: And when I,

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.680
[Guest]: and I tried my hand at kind of writing

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.680
[Guest]: throughout school, you know,

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.680
[Guest]: small limericks, poems,

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.680
[Guest]: not going to compete with your level of limericks,

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.680
[Guest]: but the point being that

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.680
[Guest]: I was dabbling around with the written form

01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:59.680
[Guest]: before I ever conceived,

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:00.680
[Guest]: could conceive that, you know,

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.680
[Guest]: I might make a living from it.

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.680
[Guest]: So I had this fondness for writing

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.480
[Guest]: even though I had never actually written much.

01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.480
[Guest]: But during my years in Mumbai,

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.480
[Guest]: I actually started writing blog.

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.480
[Guest]: I started writing a blog

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.480
[Guest]: and would write about pretty much anything that came to me.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.480
[Guest]: Some of my oldest entries were,

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:25.480
[Guest]: you know, what we would now identify as listicles,

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:29.480
[Guest]: vague philosophical ramblings on, you know,

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.480
[Guest]: the meaning of sport and winning and losing

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.480
[Guest]: and that kind of stuff.

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.280
[Guest]: Eventually, I started writing about cricket also,

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.280
[Guest]: started writing about cricket more frequently,

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:44.280
[Guest]: started a separate blog just for my writing on cricket.

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.280
[Guest]: So the previous blog could have been anything,

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.280
[Guest]: book reviews, song reviews,

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.280
[Guest]: you know, what this song meant to me, that kind of stuff.

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:53.280
[Guest]: But this blog was more about

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:55.280
[Guest]: what I was thinking about the game.

01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.280
[Guest]: I discovered Twitter around that time,

01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:00.280
[Guest]: probably 2013, 13-ish,

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:02.280
[Guest]: and discovered that, you know,

01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:06.080
[Guest]: there are people abroad who are dedicated women's cricket writers

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.080
[Guest]: and are writing blogs about their women's cricket

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:11.080
[Guest]: so as to give it more and more attention

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.080
[Guest]: and that kind of things.

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:15.080
[Guest]: And I thought, hey, that's something I can do.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.080
[Guest]: I can, you know, write blogs about domestic cricket,

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:20.080
[Guest]: which no one ever talks about and no one ever covers.

01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:22.080
[Guest]: Everyone knows Jhulan Goswami, everyone knows Mithali Raj.

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.080
[Guest]: Okay, fine, good.

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:27.080
[Guest]: By now, you know, BCCI has taken over women's cricket

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.080
[Guest]: and these people are slightly more famous

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.080
[Guest]: than they were maybe 10 years ago.

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.880
[Guest]: But domestic cricket, no one talks about us.

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.880
[Guest]: So I started doing reviews of tournaments

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.880
[Guest]: or, you know, previews of the season.

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.880
[Guest]: I started writing that kind of stuff on my blog

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.880
[Guest]: and putting it up on Twitter.

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.880
[Guest]: Eventually, someone picked it up.

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.880
[Guest]: Vision India reached out saying that

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.880
[Guest]: we would like you to write for us.

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:51.880
[Guest]: And at that time, I was, like, so absolutely naive.

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.880
[Guest]: Zero idea about how to have conversations about money.

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:58.880
[Guest]: I wrote my first probably 10-odd articles for them.

01:43:59.080 --> 01:43:59.880
[Guest]: Didn't even ask for any money.

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.680
[Guest]: And later, you know, the good people at Vision India

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:02.680
[Guest]: reached out to me,

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.680
[Guest]: Hey, have you received your payment for this kind of thing?

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.680
[Guest]: Like, no, no, no, no, I haven't.

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.680
[Guest]: So that was happening in parallel while I was playing cricket.

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:17.680
[Guest]: My blog for Vision India ran in that period.

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:21.680
[Guest]: I was actually writing some kind of anti-BCCI stuff.

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.680
[Guest]: I mean, I don't mean to be anti-BCCI,

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.680
[Guest]: but I was writing about, you know,

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.680
[Guest]: how women's cricket has changed,

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.680
[Guest]: some for the better and some for the worse,

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:28.680
[Guest]: while I was playing.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.480
[Guest]: Which is kind of, yeah, which is kind of,

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:33.480
[Guest]: I didn't even, like I said, I was just so naive

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:35.480
[Guest]: that I never even appreciated

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.480
[Guest]: that there may be consequences for this kind of thing.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.480
[Guest]: Also, because it was such a small thing,

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:43.480
[Guest]: I was like, no chance anyone of import is actually reading this.

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:44.480
[Guest]: So it's okay.

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.480
[Guest]: And then I was finding a sense of satisfaction

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.480
[Guest]: and purpose through that.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:51.480
[Guest]: Because again, like I said, you know,

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:52.480
[Guest]: everyone can do coaching,

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.480
[Guest]: but very few people were actually,

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:55.480
[Guest]: very few cricketers.

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:56.480
[Guest]: I don't think anyone else.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.280
[Guest]: I may be wrong, but I don't think anyone else

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.280
[Guest]: was actually writing about the game

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:02.280
[Guest]: while they were playing the game.

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.280
[Guest]: And in this sense,

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:06.280
[Guest]: I was kind of being inspired in a way

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.280
[Guest]: by what was going on in other countries

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.280
[Guest]: where, you know, blogging about niche game

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.280
[Guest]: is a very big and mainstream thing in its own right.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:17.280
[Guest]: There will be any, pick any like niche game.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:20.280
[Guest]: And I don't know why chess is coming to mind.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.280
[Guest]: I don't want to say chess right now.

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.280
[Guest]: But lawn bowls.

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:29.080
[Guest]: I'm sure there are very active blogs about lawn bowls

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.080
[Guest]: and very active communities about lawn bowls in,

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.080
[Guest]: for example, maybe Australia.

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:37.080
[Guest]: So I was kind of following the leads of these kind of communities

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:40.080
[Guest]: and writing and putting my stuff out on Twitter

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.080
[Guest]: and finding that, oh, this is interesting.

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:44.080
[Guest]: So after I quit,

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.080
[Guest]: like having no plan when I quit,

01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.080
[Guest]: but after I quit, one of the first things that I did was

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:53.080
[Guest]: I reached out to some people within the media saying that,

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.880
[Guest]: hey, this is what I've done before.

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.880
[Guest]: Would you be interested in hosting these kind of articles?

01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:58.880
[Guest]: And they said yes.

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:02.880
[Guest]: And they said, OK, we'll pay you X amount of money for each article

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.880
[Guest]: and you write X amount of articles per month.

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.880
[Guest]: I was like, oh, I can make some money here.

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.880
[Guest]: It was not a lot of money, but it was,

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:12.880
[Guest]: I had never been able to conceive that, you know,

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.880
[Guest]: I might be able to support myself financially

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.880
[Guest]: or even start of supporting myself financially

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:18.880
[Guest]: through writing about cricket.

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:19.880
[Guest]: I think this is cool.

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:21.880
[Guest]: And so I started writing about cricket.

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:23.680
[Guest]: I started discovering that, you know,

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.680
[Guest]: rather than just writing from home,

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.680
[Guest]: you can travel and cover tournaments.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.680
[Guest]: And there is something called accreditation

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:34.680
[Guest]: where you become an actual member of the media

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.680
[Guest]: when you gain that accreditation,

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.680
[Guest]: which is basically a pass for a media person

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:41.680
[Guest]: to cover a particular tournament.

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:45.680
[Guest]: And then this very interesting little journey happened

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.680
[Guest]: before the accreditation.

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:49.680
[Guest]: No, actually, at that point,

01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:55.480
[Guest]: I had received accreditation and covered a 2016 T20 World Cup,

01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.480
[Guest]: covered a couple of women's games in that tournament.

01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:59.480
[Guest]: So that was my first ever assignment

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:02.480
[Guest]: as a written journalist, you know,

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:03.480
[Guest]: where I'm actually at the ground.

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:04.480
[Guest]: I'm in a press box.

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:06.480
[Guest]: Oh, so this is what a press box is like.

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:08.480
[Guest]: You know, the heroes have kind of changed.

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:11.480
[Guest]: Rather than wanting to run into Jhulan Goswami,

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.480
[Guest]: I'm running into Osman Samiuddin.

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.480
[Guest]: Oh, my God, I read his work.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:16.480
[Guest]: He's sitting right here.

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.480
[Guest]: That is so cool.

01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:20.280
[Guest]: Those kind of moments I'm having.

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.280
[Guest]: Then I have this little bit of a journey.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:27.280
[Guest]: The women's Big Bash has begun.

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:30.280
[Guest]: Indians are going to be playing in it for the first time.

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.280
[Guest]: Harbin Preet Kaur and Smriti Mandana.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:35.280
[Guest]: I figure I have a few friends in Australia.

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.280
[Guest]: There are going to be Indians in Australia.

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:41.280
[Guest]: There's going to be no one else really covering it from India.

01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.280
[Guest]: Why don't I travel and see if I can cover this tournament

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:48.080
[Guest]: on my own, like totally freelance.

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:49.080
[Guest]: Reached out to a few people saying,

01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:51.080
[Guest]: hey, will you guys be interested in articles?

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:53.080
[Guest]: It was nowhere near, you know,

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:55.080
[Guest]: the cost of covering my trip.

01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:57.080
[Guest]: It was still going to be significantly out of pocket.

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:00.080
[Guest]: But at the same time, because I was able to live with friends,

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:03.080
[Guest]: I wasn't really incurring as much cost as I might have.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.080
[Guest]: And I went to Australia for a couple of months.

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:07.080
[Guest]: And I went to Brisbane.

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.080
[Guest]: I went to Melbourne.

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.080
[Guest]: I went to Sydney.

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.080
[Guest]: And I just experienced that tournament as a journalist.

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:16.880
[Guest]: I wasn't writing about it every day.

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.880
[Guest]: But I would go to every game.

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:19.880
[Guest]: I would sit in the designated area,

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:21.880
[Guest]: which is called, which is, you know,

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:22.880
[Guest]: what they pass for a press box.

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.880
[Guest]: Because these are small community games.

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.880
[Guest]: The WBBL is not as big a tournament as it was before.

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:30.880
[Guest]: I also happen to be around at the same time

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:32.880
[Guest]: the Australian Open is being played.

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.880
[Guest]: So I visit the Australian Open for the first time.

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.880
[Guest]: So there is this exposure to a wider sporting experience

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.880
[Guest]: and a different culture, a culture in the country,

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:48.680
[Guest]: which is sports mad, which really,

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.680
[Guest]: which really, I wouldn't say it was like a pivotal moment,

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:53.680
[Guest]: but it was a moment of broadening of my horizons.

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:54.680
[Guest]: Because I'd been to Australia before.

01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:56.680
[Guest]: I'd been to Australia three times as a player.

01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.680
[Guest]: But you're a player, you're staying in a hotel,

01:48:58.880 --> 01:48:59.680
[Guest]: you're going from a team bus,

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.680
[Guest]: you're going to a ground, coming back from a team bus,

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.680
[Guest]: you're coming back here far, you know,

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.680
[Guest]: at most you're going to a little bit of sightseeing at the end of it.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.680
[Guest]: Whereas here I was mapping out my own directions,

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.680
[Guest]: budgeting my own trip,

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.480
[Guest]: figuring out what my travel schedule should be,

01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:16.480
[Guest]: booking my own flights.

01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:19.480
[Guest]: The entire experience was just so educational.

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.480
[Guest]: And in terms of opening up,

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:25.480
[Guest]: the WBPL is like one of the best run women's leagues in the world.

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.480
[Guest]: So opening up to the possibilities of, you know,

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.480
[Guest]: what women's cricket holds,

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.480
[Guest]: that was a brilliant experience.

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:36.480
[Guest]: And I still have no idea how I actually conceived of it

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:38.480
[Guest]: and actually went ahead and did it.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.480
[Guest]: If I think about it now, I don't know if I'll do that.

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.280
[Guest]: But yeah, it was just such a new experience.

01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:49.280
[Guest]: At every step I'm discovering literally something new.

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.280
[Guest]: For example, there are separate cycling tracks in Australia

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.280
[Guest]: for only cyclists.

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:56.280
[Guest]: You know, the small, small things which blow your mind.

01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:01.280
[Guest]: Or the fact that the trails here are so well marked.

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.280
[Guest]: Or the cricket here is so well done.

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:05.280
[Guest]: You know, they have a Christmas party.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.280
[Guest]: Christmas, of course, in Australia, it's summer.

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:10.080
[Guest]: So they have a summer Christmas party on the ground

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:13.080
[Guest]: where after the match they open up the ground for the audience

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.080
[Guest]: and they have a band in the middle of the stadium

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.080
[Guest]: and everyone's playing Christmas carols on a cricket ground.

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:21.080
[Guest]: These are the kind of experiences which I would never have gotten

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.080
[Guest]: if I had not gone on that kind of trip.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:27.080
[Guest]: And that was probably the first beginnings of my life

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:30.080
[Guest]: as a writer, as a sports journalist,

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.080
[Guest]: as a member of the written press, so to speak.

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:39.880
[Guest]: But, yeah, almost exploring this sporting landscape

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.880
[Guest]: in a way I had never done before.

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:44.880
[Guest]: As a player, the view is always very bracketed.

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.880
[Guest]: It's always very narrow.

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:48.880
[Guest]: And here I was trying to go as wide as I could.

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's fascinating.

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And you kind of brought back memories of my own

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:56.880
[Amit Varma]: because I remember in 2006 I really wanted to cover India to Pakistan.

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.880
[Amit Varma]: And the typical way of doing that was

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.880
[Amit Varma]: that you get a freelance gig with an English newspaper

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:04.680
[Amit Varma]: because that covers your cost.

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.680
[Amit Varma]: So I got a gig writing pieces for The Guardian

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:09.680
[Amit Varma]: and I did some small audio thing for the BBC while I was there.

01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And my whole thing was I just want to cover the cost of this tour.

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.680
[Amit Varma]: So it wasn't even like make a profit.

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.680
[Amit Varma]: Just cover the cost. You want to go, you want to watch the cricket,

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:18.680
[Amit Varma]: you want to soak in the experience.

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.680
[Amit Varma]: So I kind of totally get that.

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:26.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm curious about craft here because, you know, one of the...

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.680
[Amit Varma]: And I don't want to embarrass you with praise,

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:30.680
[Amit Varma]: but, you know, where you are as a writer

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:32.480
[Amit Varma]: and sort of your work over the last year,

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.480
[Amit Varma]: you don't get there overnight.

01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.480
[Amit Varma]: You don't get there.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:37.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, it takes many, many years.

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:40.480
[Amit Varma]: Like, I look back on my own sort of progression as a cricket writer

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:42.480
[Amit Varma]: or many of the young writers that I've worked with

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:44.480
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, when you're young,

01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:46.480
[Amit Varma]: you're trying so hard to impress.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:49.480
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes you're overdoing the style, so on and so forth.

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:51.480
[Amit Varma]: It takes time for you to find your voice,

01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.480
[Amit Varma]: to find the confidence, to find that...

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.480
[Amit Varma]: where you can just sit back and do what you have to do.

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:59.480
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, how did that craft evolve in your case?

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:02.280
[Amit Varma]: Because I like... I have to apologize and say

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:05.280
[Amit Varma]: I haven't read your earlier pieces from when you started writing.

01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:07.280
[Amit Varma]: I've just read what you've done over the last year or so.

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:08.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's fantastic.

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.280
[Amit Varma]: And there's one quality that I noted in your work

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.280
[Amit Varma]: that cuts across not just your writing,

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.280
[Amit Varma]: but also your YouTube work,

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:16.280
[Amit Varma]: which is that you're not trying to impress.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.280
[Amit Varma]: It's very straightforward.

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:19.280
[Amit Varma]: It is what it is.

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.280
[Amit Varma]: There's no added artifice to that, you know.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:25.280
[Amit Varma]: So is that, again, something that is kind of natural?

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.280
[Amit Varma]: Is there a moment where you say that

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:30.080
[Amit Varma]: you kind of have to work at that moment,

01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.080
[Amit Varma]: if you get what I'm saying?

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:33.080
[Amit Varma]: So I'm very curious,

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.080
[Amit Varma]: like you did my writing course as well, for example.

01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:38.080
[Amit Varma]: You're clearly a person who wants to get as much

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.080
[Amit Varma]: sort of exposure to different aspects of craft

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:42.080
[Amit Varma]: and thinking about writing.

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:45.080
[Amit Varma]: Take me a little bit through that journey of yours.

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:47.080
[Guest]: I think to answer this question,

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:48.080
[Guest]: I need to go back to my childhood.

01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.080
[Amit Varma]: Please do, yeah, let's go back.

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:54.080
[Guest]: And I need to go back to...

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.880
[Guest]: I mean, my dad used to make regular trips to Mumbai at the time.

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.880
[Guest]: And we had this custom that,

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:02.880
[Guest]: you know, whenever he comes back from Mumbai,

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.880
[Guest]: the first question my younger brother and I would ask him,

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:06.880
[Guest]: what you got for us?

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.880
[Guest]: You know, he has to come back and he has to bring us a gift.

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.880
[Guest]: So, which still in our family is called

01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:14.880
[Guest]: the what you got for us gift.

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.880
[Guest]: And very often those would be books.

01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:18.880
[Guest]: Very often you would bring back

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.880
[Guest]: your Nancy Drews and your Hardy Boys.

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:24.680
[Guest]: There was no end of Enid Blyton's

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.680
[Guest]: littered around my childhood.

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:29.680
[Guest]: There was this memory of

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:33.680
[Guest]: spending so many months reading Lord of the Rings

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.680
[Guest]: and our entire family was reading it.

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:37.680
[Guest]: And it would be, you know, this,

01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:39.680
[Guest]: it would just be situated in our bathroom

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:42.680
[Guest]: because unfortunately, we have a lot of people

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.680
[Guest]: who used to read while in the toilet.

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.680
[Guest]: And it is this kind of

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:52.480
[Guest]: maybe just an extension of that environment where English was emphasized at a young age.

01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:55.480
[Guest]: Therefore, reading was also emphasized at a young age.

01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:57.480
[Guest]: And I read exclusively fiction at the time.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.480
[Guest]: I found non-fiction boring.

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:02.480
[Guest]: And it is interesting, recently someone put out a

01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:04.480
[Guest]: quote on Twitter saying that, you know,

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:06.480
[Guest]: non-fiction greater than fiction.

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:08.480
[Guest]: I was like, yeah, maybe.

01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:11.480
[Guest]: I mean, non-fiction might be what

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:13.480
[Guest]: what I read now and what I find really, you know,

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:16.480
[Guest]: helps me level up in whatever I'm doing.

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:20.280
[Guest]: But I spent my entire childhood reading exclusively fiction,

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.280
[Guest]: reading like fantasy,

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.280
[Guest]: a little bit of sci-fi here and there.

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.280
[Guest]: And maybe that's what ingrained a sense of storytelling in me

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.280
[Guest]: because I didn't, like I said,

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:33.280
[Guest]: I did a BSc after my graduation.

01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:35.280
[Guest]: I played cricket for 15 years.

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:38.280
[Guest]: I have no formal education in writing.

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:40.280
[Guest]: My education is just my childhood,

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:43.280
[Guest]: my experiences, the fact that I like to read

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:45.280
[Guest]: and once in a while will, you know,

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:48.080
[Guest]: take the effort of reading an autobiography.

01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:51.080
[Guest]: And those are the kind of books that interested me at the time.

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:54.080
[Guest]: So the evolution of the craft definitely

01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.080
[Guest]: starts from the reading habit,

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.080
[Guest]: which is just a part of my childhood.

01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:01.080
[Guest]: And again, unconsciously has helped me in

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.080
[Guest]: being a writer and being someone who is able to

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:07.080
[Guest]: make a living from writing today.

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.080
[Guest]: And beyond that,

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:12.080
[Guest]: I remember reading a lot.

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.080
[Guest]: Like I said, that phase when I discovered Twitter

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.880
[Guest]: and suddenly discovered, oh, there's so much to read.

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:18.880
[Guest]: And I suddenly discovered that there are so many

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:22.880
[Guest]: writers who write about cricket and think about cricket.

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:26.880
[Guest]: And like I said, they have from the media

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:29.880
[Guest]: a very different background and a very different view.

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:32.880
[Guest]: And me as a player, I'm reading that view.

01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:35.880
[Guest]: And suddenly I think, oh, their view is so much,

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.880
[Guest]: I wouldn't say wider or larger, but just different.

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.880
[Guest]: It's just so different as someone in the media

01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.680
[Guest]: and someone as a writer and really good pieces

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.680
[Guest]: of cricket writing at the time.

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:49.680
[Guest]: And again, most of my reading has been restricted to cricket.

01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:51.680
[Guest]: And this is something I'm consciously trying to do nowadays,

01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:53.680
[Guest]: is read more about other sports and whatnot.

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.680
[Guest]: But at the time, Osman Samiuddin,

01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:57.680
[Guest]: Andrew Fidel Fernando,

01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:01.680
[Guest]: Jared Kimbers writing some really funny, irreverent stuff.

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:05.680
[Guest]: All those are kind of probably influencing that.

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:08.680
[Guest]: Very early on, I remembered this or I discovered this quote,

01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:12.480
[Guest]: which is copy technique, not style.

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:13.480
[Guest]: And I actually started doing that.

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:16.480
[Guest]: I was like, OK, this person has written this nice piece.

01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:18.480
[Guest]: What technique are they using here?

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:21.480
[Guest]: Not consciously, but unconsciously.

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:24.480
[Guest]: I wasn't actually trying to name the technique.

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:26.480
[Guest]: I was just trying to say, OK, can I write a piece

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:29.480
[Guest]: which is something similar to what this person is writing?

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:32.480
[Guest]: And, you know, for the longest part,

01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:35.480
[Guest]: I had no idea what these official journalistic terms were.

01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.480
[Guest]: I had no idea what an opinion piece was.

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:41.280
[Guest]: I had no idea the difference between a feature and a report,

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.280
[Guest]: and a reported piece.

01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:44.280
[Guest]: I had no idea what a newspeg was.

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.280
[Guest]: Again, these are words that I discovered

01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:48.280
[Guest]: when I kind of got into the field

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.280
[Guest]: and I had to kind of overcome my ignorance and ask,

01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:55.280
[Guest]: what is a newspeg?

01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:57.280
[Guest]: And, you know, those are the kind of things,

01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:58.280
[Guest]: those are the ways I learned.

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:01.280
[Guest]: Being a freelancer had its advantages

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:05.280
[Guest]: in terms of being kind of on the outside

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:08.080
[Guest]: and not being insulated into any one environment.

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:11.080
[Guest]: At the same time, I missed out, I think,

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:16.080
[Guest]: on these constant exposure to these really good writers,

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.080
[Guest]: which I think sometimes being in an organization gives you.

01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:22.080
[Guest]: But, and it is funny, I mean,

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:24.080
[Guest]: in the process of building out my sports journalism course,

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.080
[Guest]: I read out, I went back and read a few of my pieces.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:31.080
[Guest]: And some of the pieces were like, yeah, OK, good, honest effort.

01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:33.080
[Guest]: Some of the pieces were actually good.

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.880
[Guest]: I picked up some old pieces as examples of, you know,

01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:37.880
[Guest]: writing that I had done, which worked well

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:39.880
[Guest]: and which kind of still holds up.

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:42.880
[Guest]: So I wouldn't call it talent,

01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:45.880
[Guest]: but I would call it a culmination of the environment

01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:47.880
[Guest]: where A, English was emphasized,

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:49.880
[Guest]: B, reading was emphasized,

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.880
[Guest]: C, education was kind of emphasized.

01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:56.880
[Guest]: And then add into that my unique experiences in sport,

01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:00.880
[Guest]: allowing me to kind of bring a viewpoint that others didn't

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:04.680
[Guest]: and therefore kind of giving me a point of difference in,

01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:06.680
[Guest]: you know, amongst so many other bloggers.

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.680
[Guest]: No one was writing about women's domestic cricket.

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:11.680
[Guest]: No one was writing about, well, not no one,

01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.680
[Guest]: but very few people were writing about women's cricket.

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:15.680
[Guest]: So therefore, when someone wrote about it,

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:17.680
[Guest]: even if it wasn't written really well,

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.680
[Guest]: people read it and people shared it.

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:24.680
[Guest]: And even if it is just like a report piece on just providing information,

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.680
[Guest]: people read, people shared it.

01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:31.480
[Guest]: And therefore I got a little bit of a following on social media.

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:35.480
[Guest]: But honestly, it's only in the process of building out

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.480
[Guest]: this post-journalism course that I have really thought about

01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:40.480
[Guest]: what makes me a good writer,

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.480
[Guest]: what works, what doesn't work,

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.480
[Guest]: what are the things I tend to use,

01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:46.480
[Guest]: what are the writing devices I tend to use more,

01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:51.480
[Guest]: what has contributed to how I have progressed as a writer so far.

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:57.280
[Guest]: Also, one other non-craft thing that is an essential element,

01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:00.280
[Guest]: I think, of why I have succeeded as a writer

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:03.280
[Guest]: is being brave in terms of what I write.

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:07.280
[Guest]: Because, you know, I'm constantly almost towing that line,

01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:10.280
[Guest]: being someone who is in the cricketing system,

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:13.280
[Guest]: but also sometimes having to criticize that same system.

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:17.280
[Guest]: But when in doubt, unlike, like I said,

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:22.080
[Guest]: my evolution as a person over the last few years has

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:25.080
[Guest]: reflected in my professional work as well,

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:29.080
[Guest]: where I have more often than not silenced that inner doubt

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:34.080
[Guest]: and been brave and tried to tell my truth,

01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:36.080
[Guest]: if not the truth as I see it.

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:39.080
[Guest]: Those are actually two words which I try to remind myself of,

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.080
[Guest]: you know, courage and truth

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:46.080
[Guest]: are two things that I want to use in the content that I create.

01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:50.880
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned coaching and like one of the things I realized

01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:52.880
[Amit Varma]: after I taught my writing course for a while,

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:56.880
[Amit Varma]: that it in a subtle way changed the way I looked at my own past writing as well,

01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:59.880
[Amit Varma]: where perhaps unlike you, I mean, I might like some of my earlier work,

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:01.880
[Amit Varma]: but a lot of my earlier work were like cringemax.

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Like, what is this? What am I doing?

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.880
[Amit Varma]: I tell my students not to do this and I'm doing the exact same thing.

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:10.880
[Amit Varma]: And it just kind of sharpened the way I look at my own writing

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:13.880
[Amit Varma]: and sort of has that been a process with you

02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:16.680
[Amit Varma]: through your multiple sort of coaching strengths,

02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.680
[Amit Varma]: like, or rather your coaching lanes,

02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:20.680
[Amit Varma]: like one lane, of course, is sports journalism and writing.

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.680
[Amit Varma]: There's another lane, which is cricket,

02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:26.680
[Amit Varma]: where I was going through a bunch of your fabulous videos on batting.

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:30.680
[Amit Varma]: Right. And it's so intricate and so detailed and all of that.

02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:33.680
[Amit Varma]: And do you sometimes wish that you had been coached

02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:36.680
[Amit Varma]: at the start of your career by someone like you?

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.680
[Guest]: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, half of the expression

02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:44.480
[Guest]: through the content right now is that, you know,

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.480
[Guest]: this information is now available.

02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:49.480
[Guest]: Take it. Do something with it.

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:52.480
[Guest]: Yes. I mean, having had a career where, you know,

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:57.480
[Guest]: didn't really have this one fixed coach moving from influence to other influence.

02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:01.480
[Guest]: It's not been the driving motivation of what I do,

02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:03.480
[Guest]: but it's been a part of that.

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:06.480
[Guest]: It's been, you know, the thrill of being able to share this.

02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.480
[Guest]: And rather than in a cricket academy,

02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:13.280
[Guest]: it being learned, for example, the cricket coaching videos

02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.280
[Guest]: in a cricket academy, 50 people learning it

02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:19.280
[Guest]: or maybe 20 people learning it, the 50,000 people learning it.

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:24.280
[Guest]: That was a revolution in terms of, you know, the power of YouTube.

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:28.280
[Guest]: And I was lucky, fairly lucky enough that I could discover that power

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:33.280
[Guest]: pretty much accidentally and fairly early on in the whole creative journey.

02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:35.280
[Guest]: In terms of the writing part, yes, absolutely.

02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:40.080
[Guest]: Like I said, I've really started thinking about my writing now.

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.080
[Guest]: And therefore, I've tried to reverse engineer my own process,

02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:45.080
[Guest]: which is instinctive.

02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:49.080
[Guest]: Until now, I would just put words on the page

02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:52.080
[Guest]: and then, you know, try and refine them.

02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.080
[Guest]: It's a very crude process, but a very instinctive process.

02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:59.080
[Guest]: A process kind of also driven in large part by emotion

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:03.080
[Guest]: because very often I'm not someone who's employed to write every day.

02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.880
[Guest]: So therefore, I write when I feel like it.

02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.880
[Guest]: And I have that, you know, again, a lucky situation where I have that.

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:12.880
[Guest]: So I was usually writing from a place of emotion.

02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:14.880
[Guest]: I'm angry about this. I'm sad about this.

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.880
[Guest]: I'm happy about this. Wonderful match played.

02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.880
[Guest]: Oh, this could have been better. I wish this was different.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:24.880
[Guest]: Those kind of things usually came across in my writing.

02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:26.880
[Guest]: And maybe that's one point of connect

02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.880
[Guest]: and one point of, you know, why it has connected with so many people.

02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:34.680
[Guest]: But in terms of the actual process now,

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:37.680
[Guest]: after having built out that course,

02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:41.680
[Guest]: after having created a process which other people can take

02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:45.680
[Guest]: and, you know, you can apply it to yourself and see if it works for you.

02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:47.680
[Guest]: Now I follow that process.

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:51.680
[Guest]: Now I sit down and I go through my own processes

02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:53.680
[Guest]: and see if I've met my own checklists

02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:56.680
[Guest]: because this is literally how I've, you know,

02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:59.680
[Guest]: it's absolutely like how a cricketer will

02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:02.480
[Guest]: identify that this is your process,

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:04.480
[Guest]: results and processes, we talk about it.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:07.480
[Guest]: When your hand comes this close to your ear,

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:09.480
[Guest]: the ball goes on off stump line.

02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:12.480
[Guest]: When you tick X, Y, Z boxes in writing,

02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:17.480
[Guest]: the piece is likely to come out better, cleaner, clearer,

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:19.480
[Guest]: like you constantly emphasize.

02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:23.480
[Guest]: And therefore, that is something that I follow now.

02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:26.480
[Guest]: Whereas before it was very instinctive.

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:29.480
[Guest]: And like a year ago, if you had asked me how you do it,

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:31.280
[Guest]: I would not have been able to tell you.

02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:33.280
[Guest]: I would just like, I write when I'm angry.

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:35.280
[Guest]: That's what I would have said.

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:38.280
[Amit Varma]: A good reason to write among other reasons.

02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:42.280
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, one of the things that I kind of talk about in my course

02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:45.280
[Amit Varma]: and I also draw a cricket metaphor from it

02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:49.280
[Amit Varma]: is mindful learning and learning that you're just kind of taking by osmosis.

02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:51.280
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of cricket learning is mindful.

02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:54.280
[Amit Varma]: If you go in the nets for the first time,

02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:57.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, the way your feet are moving, your elbow,

02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:00.080
[Amit Varma]: the balance of your body, all of that, you're mindful about it.

02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:02.080
[Amit Varma]: Later, you internalize it completely

02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:05.080
[Amit Varma]: and you don't need to actually think consciously about it.

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:07.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, in your case, the learning process seems to have been

02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:10.080
[Amit Varma]: and again, a reading habit I keep saying is the best way to become a good writer.

02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:14.080
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of it seems to have come from osmosis just by reading a lot.

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:18.080
[Amit Varma]: You read a lot of great storytelling and then that translates into the way you write

02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:21.080
[Amit Varma]: and you've picked up a lot of good habits without even realizing it.

02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:23.080
[Amit Varma]: And that's not mindful.

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:25.880
[Amit Varma]: And then some of it is mindful, especially when we start teaching.

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:27.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, you start noticing that stuff mindfully

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:30.880
[Amit Varma]: or if you're studying a writer, you like you reverse engineer what they've done

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.880
[Amit Varma]: and you know, all of that.

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.880
[Amit Varma]: So like I keep reminding myself, though,

02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:39.880
[Amit Varma]: I always say when it comes to reading that for me, there's no difference.

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, as long as you're reading, I don't care if it's mindful or otherwise,

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.880
[Amit Varma]: because if what you're reading is something that captivates you,

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:47.880
[Amit Varma]: you'll pick up things from it by osmosis.

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:51.880
[Amit Varma]: But do you feel that it helps to be more mindful

02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:55.680
[Amit Varma]: that we should all be more mindful in terms of craft of the things that we do,

02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:58.680
[Amit Varma]: whether it is something in a cricketing technique sense,

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:02.680
[Amit Varma]: whether it is something in a writing sense, you know, all of these things?

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:05.680
[Guest]: You know, it's funny.

02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:07.680
[Guest]: You will try to be mine.

02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:10.680
[Guest]: My recent experience has been I will try to be mindful about,

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:13.680
[Guest]: you know, reading or consuming any kind of content.

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:16.680
[Guest]: And, you know, I teach a multimedia journalism course.

02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:20.680
[Guest]: So it's, you know, videos, podcasts, writing, that kind of thing.

02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:24.480
[Guest]: So I keep saying that, you know, whatever content you consume,

02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:26.480
[Guest]: you're going to pick up something from it.

02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:28.480
[Guest]: And if you should try and actively do that,

02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:30.480
[Guest]: even if it's, you know, watching your favorite Netflix show.

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:33.480
[Guest]: And a lot of these things just come

02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:36.480
[Guest]: and express themselves in content so randomly.

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.480
[Guest]: Having not made notes,

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:42.480
[Guest]: at some point, something will strike me.

02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:45.480
[Guest]: Like recently I wrote a piece on Ashwin

02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:48.480
[Guest]: and I ended it with this line.

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:51.280
[Guest]: When is it okay to drop the alpha?

02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.280
[Guest]: When the pack is stronger without him.

02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:55.280
[Guest]: Yeah, a wolf reference.

02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:58.280
[Guest]: So again, where did this line come from?

02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:00.280
[Guest]: One of my sports journalism students asked me,

02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:02.280
[Guest]: how did you come up with this line?

02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:04.280
[Guest]: Game of Thrones.

02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:08.280
[Guest]: And I was not mindfully watching Game of Thrones.

02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:10.280
[Guest]: And, you know, that line in Game of Thrones where

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:13.280
[Guest]: the strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack.

02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:16.280
[Guest]: That's just what somehow popped up in my mind.

02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:19.080
[Guest]: Okay, let's use a wolf reference, that kind of a thing.

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:21.080
[Guest]: I was not mindfully watching Game of Thrones,

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.080
[Guest]: but it turned up.

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:26.080
[Guest]: I don't know how, I don't know why, I can't really explain it.

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:29.080
[Guest]: So there have been instances where, you know,

02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:32.080
[Guest]: stuff in my notes has really helped

02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:35.080
[Guest]: improve the content that I have put out.

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.080
[Guest]: And there have been instances where, you know,

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:40.080
[Guest]: stuff just comes so randomly and that sticks with people.

02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:45.080
[Guest]: So I would probably say it's a good habit to develop that mindful consumption.

02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:48.880
[Guest]: But, I mean, who are we if we can really understand?

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.880
[Guest]: We're not going to pretend to understand how our brains work.

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:53.880
[Guest]: And just like at the subconscious level,

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:55.880
[Guest]: there is so much weird stuff happening.

02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:59.880
[Guest]: And when it will be useful and when it will be harmful, God alone knows.

02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:01.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, well said. That makes a lot of sense.

02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of talk about your YouTubing now,

02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.880
[Amit Varma]: because I was watching your video about that intimidating video

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:09.880
[Amit Varma]: I referred to at the beginning about doing commentary twice a day and all that.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:11.880
[Amit Varma]: And at the beginning, there is this sequence,

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:13.880
[Amit Varma]: this montage where you're making filter coffee.

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And I straight away thought of Peter McKinnon,

02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:18.680
[Amit Varma]: the YouTuber whose coffee montages are really famous.

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:22.680
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about what got you into try YouTubing.

02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:26.680
[Amit Varma]: Did you intend to do cricket stuff or did you intend to do vloggy stuff?

02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:29.680
[Amit Varma]: Who are the YouTubers that you kind of liked?

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:33.680
[Amit Varma]: What were the kind of values that you picked up mindfully from people?

02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:35.680
[Amit Varma]: Like that whole coffee montage, I just looked at it

02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:37.680
[Amit Varma]: and I thought she must have watched Peter McKinnon.

02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:40.680
[Amit Varma]: So now you can confirm if that's true or not.

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Take me a bit through your early part of your YouTube journey as well.

02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.480
[Guest]: I have watched Peter McKinnon,

02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:48.480
[Guest]: but I must say that, you know, again,

02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:51.480
[Guest]: this is the weird, unconscious, subconscious stuff that I'm talking about.

02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:54.480
[Guest]: I am 100% sure that I did not think about Peter McKinnon

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:56.480
[Guest]: probably for a year or so,

02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:58.480
[Guest]: even while I was making that coffee montage

02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:00.480
[Guest]: before you brought up his name.

02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:03.480
[Guest]: Like I watched his videos probably a long time ago.

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:05.480
[Guest]: But again, you know, subconsciously,

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:08.480
[Guest]: what all we internalize, God alone knows.

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:11.280
[Guest]: If someone can figure out the subconscious one day,

02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:14.280
[Guest]: it will be a very big achievement.

02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:17.280
[Guest]: But YouTube was a very interesting phase.

02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:20.280
[Guest]: Again, I must emphasize that this was a phase

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:23.280
[Guest]: where I was receiving a lot of support from home.

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:27.280
[Guest]: Again, not having a regular job.

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:30.280
[Guest]: And I say that with air quotes.

02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.280
[Guest]: Having quit my railway job, you know,

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:35.280
[Guest]: much to the consternation of my grandfather,

02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:37.280
[Guest]: who still wants me to do engineering

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:40.080
[Guest]: and have a permanent job and a pension.

02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:42.080
[Guest]: There was a tremendous amount of support from home.

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:44.080
[Guest]: I was back in Pune living with my parents.

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:47.080
[Guest]: And there was this space

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:49.080
[Guest]: to kind of, you know, figure it out yourself.

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:51.080
[Guest]: I went to Australia for a couple of months.

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:53.080
[Guest]: There was...

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:56.080
[Guest]: And therefore, I was in a phase of my life

02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:57.080
[Guest]: where I had a lot of time.

02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:59.080
[Guest]: You know, I was writing from time to time

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:01.080
[Guest]: and that kind of paid the bills.

02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:03.080
[Guest]: But it was not my job.

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.080
[Guest]: I was not doing it every day.

02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:06.080
[Guest]: So I had some time in my life

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:07.880
[Guest]: kind of figuring out what I was...

02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:09.880
[Guest]: what I would like to do.

02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.880
[Guest]: Briefly flirting with the idea of writing a book.

02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:14.880
[Guest]: And then I...

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:17.880
[Guest]: This is one of my favorite stories in life

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:20.880
[Guest]: about, you know, what can lead you where.

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:22.880
[Guest]: Then I started playing Pokemon Go.

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:24.880
[Guest]: Okay.

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:26.880
[Guest]: Again, you know, 90s kid

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:28.880
[Guest]: having grown up watching those cartoons

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:30.880
[Guest]: and Pokemon being one of those cartoons.

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:32.880
[Guest]: This game suddenly took over the world.

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:34.880
[Guest]: And I was like, okay, let's try it out.

02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:37.680
[Guest]: And having no idea how to play it,

02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:39.680
[Guest]: I randomly Googled

02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:40.680
[Guest]: or maybe went on to YouTube

02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:41.680
[Guest]: and tried to learn how to play it.

02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:42.680
[Guest]: And this is the first time

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.680
[Guest]: I had consciously used YouTube to learn something.

02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:46.680
[Guest]: Until that, you know, YouTube was a place

02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:48.680
[Guest]: where I watched trailers once in a while

02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:50.680
[Guest]: or YouTube was a place where

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:52.680
[Guest]: videos I was intentionally watching

02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:53.680
[Guest]: happened to be hosted.

02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:55.680
[Guest]: I didn't go on to YouTube

02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:56.680
[Guest]: to actually watch something.

02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:58.680
[Guest]: So this is the first time I'm on YouTube

02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:01.680
[Guest]: and I'm watching this video

02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:03.680
[Guest]: by a vlogger in the US.

02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:06.480
[Guest]: His name is Nick. His channel's name is Trainer Tips.

02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:09.480
[Guest]: And he's basically making daily vlogs

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:12.480
[Guest]: explaining his processes of playing Pokemon Go.

02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:13.480
[Guest]: He's a Pokemon Go nerd.

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:15.480
[Guest]: And I'm like, oh, these videos are cool.

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.480
[Guest]: And I started playing Pokemon Go.

02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:19.480
[Guest]: I keep watching his videos regularly.

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:23.480
[Guest]: He has this lovely vloggy style.

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:27.480
[Guest]: And I think, hey, maybe I should try that.

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:30.480
[Guest]: And that's literally how the YouTube channel started.

02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:32.480
[Guest]: I made a few calls

02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:35.280
[Guest]: and happened to get some advice

02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:37.280
[Guest]: from the person who today is

02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.280
[Guest]: the head of production for my YouTube channel.

02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:42.280
[Guest]: And he basically told me use this camera,

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:43.280
[Guest]: use that camera.

02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:44.280
[Guest]: This is fine. That is fine.

02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:45.280
[Guest]: Just go and do it.

02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:47.280
[Guest]: And yeah, I was kind of just imitating

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:49.280
[Guest]: what I was seeing on YouTube,

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:50.280
[Guest]: what I was seeing on,

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:52.280
[Guest]: what I was seeing other people do.

02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:54.280
[Guest]: And at the time, I had just gotten a dog.

02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:56.280
[Guest]: He was about a year old.

02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.280
[Guest]: And therefore, I was spending a lot of time outdoors with him.

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:00.280
[Guest]: I thought, OK, let's...

02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.080
[Guest]: And I'm an outdoor person. I like hiking.

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.080
[Guest]: I like going on any kind of

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.080
[Guest]: trip which is taking you closer to nature

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:08.080
[Guest]: and that kind of stuff.

02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:11.080
[Guest]: Even like today, it's a big part of my life.

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:15.080
[Guest]: But I think maybe I can make a show about cricket

02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:16.080
[Guest]: done outdoors.

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:18.080
[Guest]: You know, someone talking about cricket,

02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:19.080
[Guest]: but doing it outdoors.

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.080
[Guest]: Just randomly trying to combine

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:23.080
[Guest]: whatever passions I have

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:25.080
[Guest]: in the most generic way possible.

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.080
[Guest]: So I started making vlogs.

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:29.080
[Guest]: If you go back to the first three videos on my channel,

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:32.880
[Guest]: they are vlogs where I'm exploring some place

02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:34.880
[Guest]: and talking about cricket side by side.

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:36.880
[Guest]: And this is a time where, like I said,

02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.880
[Guest]: I have a lot of time in my life.

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:42.880
[Guest]: Well, I have more time than I had time.

02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:44.880
[Guest]: And therefore, I'm on YouTube learning.

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:46.880
[Guest]: I'm learning how to use a camera.

02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:48.880
[Guest]: I'm on YouTube learning how to shoot.

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.880
[Guest]: I'm on YouTube, most of all,

02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:51.880
[Guest]: most important of all,

02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:52.880
[Guest]: learning how to edit my own videos.

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:55.880
[Guest]: Again, I am a BSc graduate

02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:57.880
[Guest]: who played cricket for 15 years,

02:11:57.880 --> 02:11:58.880
[Guest]: worked in a government office,

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:01.680
[Guest]: have zero idea about how all this technology works.

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:03.680
[Guest]: And suddenly YouTube is teaching me all of this.

02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:05.680
[Guest]: I was like, oh, this is so cool.

02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:08.680
[Guest]: And that process of learning

02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:11.680
[Guest]: and implementing what I've learned,

02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.680
[Guest]: it gives you a little bit of a high.

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:15.680
[Guest]: It gives you a little bit of a sense of satisfaction.

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:18.680
[Guest]: This is that, you know, A, it's so new.

02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:21.680
[Guest]: Maybe everyone nowadays finds this very normal,

02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:23.680
[Guest]: you know, having a YouTube channel and doing all this.

02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:28.480
[Guest]: 2016, I remember going to the YouTube office and the head of YouTube,

02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:30.480
[Guest]: India or head of YouTube sports,

02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:31.480
[Guest]: I think head of YouTube India.

02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:33.480
[Guest]: He's like, I remember in 2016-17,

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:35.480
[Guest]: you were the only channel who was doing this.

02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.480
[Guest]: And it happened to be so.

02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:39.480
[Guest]: I was, you know, happened to be one of the first people

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:41.480
[Guest]: who discovered that this process of learning

02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:43.480
[Guest]: and this process of creating,

02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:45.480
[Guest]: using what you've learned on YouTube is fun.

02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:47.480
[Guest]: And so therefore, I was just doing it for fun.

02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:49.480
[Guest]: And the fourth video I made,

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:52.480
[Guest]: I thought, let's OK, let's mix it up

02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:55.280
[Guest]: and let's make a video on how to choose a bat.

02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:58.280
[Guest]: So that was the first how to video I made.

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:00.280
[Guest]: And I made that video.

02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:02.280
[Guest]: It's still in a vlog style

02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.280
[Guest]: because that's what I liked to do.

02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:06.280
[Guest]: And I still like it more than

02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:08.280
[Guest]: hardcore tutorials.

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:11.280
[Guest]: But I made that video and it kind of exploded.

02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:14.280
[Guest]: And suddenly my channel has 4000 subscribers.

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:16.280
[Guest]: I'm like, oh, there's something here.

02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:18.280
[Guest]: So let me think about it.

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:20.280
[Guest]: Let me try and do it seriously.

02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:23.080
[Guest]: And that's kind of how YouTube started.

02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:25.080
[Amit Varma]: And you have, I think, more than 300,000 now

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:26.080
[Amit Varma]: or something like that.

02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:28.080
[Guest]: Some 2,80,000 right now.

02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.080
[Amit Varma]: 2,80,000. OK.

02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:32.080
[Amit Varma]: So like one of the things I noted,

02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.080
[Amit Varma]: which I alluded to earlier,

02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:37.080
[Amit Varma]: but one of the things I noted about your YouTube

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.080
[Amit Varma]: as it is now from the recent videos that I watched

02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:41.080
[Amit Varma]: is a lack of self-consciousness.

02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Is that it's just, you know,

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.080
[Amit Varma]: you're not overthinking it.

02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:46.080
[Amit Varma]: You're not trying to be too stylized

02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:48.080
[Amit Varma]: despite the filter coffee montage.

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:50.880
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like what you see is what you get.

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one of the sort of the things

02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:55.880
[Amit Varma]: that I say that creators should pay more attention to

02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:56.880
[Amit Varma]: and should cultivate.

02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:57.880
[Amit Varma]: And that's an important quality.

02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:59.880
[Amit Varma]: It's just authenticity in terms of

02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.880
[Amit Varma]: being authentic to who you are.

02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:03.880
[Amit Varma]: All the creators I enjoy listening to in podcasts

02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:05.880
[Amit Varma]: or watching on YouTube

02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:07.880
[Amit Varma]: are just authentic to who they are.

02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:10.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, whatever the subject might be of the podcast

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:12.880
[Amit Varma]: or their particular video or whatever,

02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:13.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm really watching it for them.

02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:15.880
[Amit Varma]: I've kind of gotten a comfort level with them.

02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:18.680
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, that's why I'm there.

02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:19.680
[Amit Varma]: That's why I'm hooked.

02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:20.680
[Amit Varma]: That's why I'm kind of going there.

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.680
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, again, is this something

02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:24.680
[Amit Varma]: that was there from the start

02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:27.680
[Amit Varma]: or is it something that you kind of evolved to?

02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:28.680
[Amit Varma]: Like, did you, was there a time

02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:29.680
[Amit Varma]: where you were overthinking it?

02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Was there a time where, you know,

02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:35.680
[Amit Varma]: you thought more stylistic takes were important

02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:38.680
[Amit Varma]: or you just figured out that this is the easiest way

02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:40.680
[Amit Varma]: to do it and not to overthink it

02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:42.680
[Guest]: and so on and so forth?

02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:45.480
[Guest]: I don't think that's completely what it is.

02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:46.480
[Guest]: Like, for example,

02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:47.480
[Guest]: that video that you mentioned,

02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:48.480
[Guest]: the day in the life,

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:51.480
[Guest]: you know, it starts with me really bleary eyed.

02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:53.480
[Amit Varma]: Exactly, you're not trying too hard

02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:54.480
[Amit Varma]: to make yourself look good,

02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:56.480
[Amit Varma]: which is great, which is...

02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:58.480
[Guest]: Yeah, and in that video,

02:14:58.680 --> 02:14:59.480
[Guest]: I was consciously doing that.

02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:01.480
[Guest]: Like, literally, I decided first thing in the morning,

02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:02.480
[Guest]: I'm going to film.

02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:03.480
[Guest]: But while watching it back,

02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:05.480
[Guest]: I was like, oh God, that looks so bad.

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:08.480
[Amit Varma]: No, I disagree.

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:12.280
[Guest]: And, you know, later on the video,

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:13.280
[Guest]: looking at it and thinking,

02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:14.280
[Guest]: oh, there's like a weird,

02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:16.280
[Guest]: curly hair sticking out here

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:18.280
[Guest]: and this should have been better

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:19.280
[Guest]: and that should have been better.

02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:20.280
[Guest]: And when I'm filming,

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:23.280
[Guest]: I do try and present.

02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:25.280
[Guest]: There is absolutely,

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:27.280
[Guest]: I mean, it's kind of become part of my job,

02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:30.280
[Guest]: presenting, but at the same time,

02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:33.280
[Guest]: not presenting too much.

02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:37.280
[Guest]: If you meet me outside of YouTube,

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:39.080
[Guest]: I'm definitely going to talk differently.

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:40.080
[Guest]: I don't have...

02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:41.080
[Guest]: I have a script,

02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:42.080
[Guest]: for example, on YouTube.

02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:43.080
[Guest]: Usually, I'll have a fair idea

02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:45.080
[Guest]: of what I want to say.

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:46.080
[Guest]: I will do takes.

02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:48.080
[Guest]: I'm not, you know,

02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:50.080
[Guest]: this absolute authenticity person.

02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:51.080
[Guest]: But at the same time,

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:52.080
[Guest]: as a person,

02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:56.080
[Guest]: I'm not a person who worries a lot

02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.080
[Guest]: about how I look.

02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:59.080
[Guest]: I'm not a person who,

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.080
[Guest]: you know,

02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:02.080
[Guest]: I've never been into makeup.

02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.080
[Guest]: In fact, that's one of my worst,

02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:06.080
[Guest]: that's one of the things I like the least

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:08.880
[Guest]: about having to sometimes work in TV

02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:09.880
[Guest]: or in a studio.

02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:12.880
[Guest]: The just uncomfortable amount of makeup

02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:14.880
[Guest]: that they put on us.

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.880
[Guest]: I've never been someone who has,

02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:19.880
[Guest]: you know, consciously gone out of the way

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:21.880
[Guest]: to dress in a certain way.

02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:24.880
[Guest]: Usually, I'll just be most comfortable

02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:25.880
[Guest]: in what I'm most comfortable.

02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:28.880
[Guest]: And I think that comes across.

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:30.880
[Guest]: That comes across as,

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:32.880
[Guest]: you know, even stylistically of

02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:36.680
[Guest]: I'm okay with a first thing in the morning shot

02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:38.680
[Guest]: because that's what it's supposed to be.

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:39.680
[Guest]: It's a first thing in the morning shot.

02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:41.680
[Guest]: But if it's supposed to be a shot

02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.680
[Guest]: where I'm really trying to convey

02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:46.680
[Guest]: a crisp, organized look,

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:48.680
[Guest]: which is still me,

02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:49.680
[Guest]: I will do that.

02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:50.680
[Guest]: I will put in the effort to

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:53.680
[Guest]: make sure that I am so presentable.

02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:55.680
[Guest]: And there is a certain amount of,

02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:57.680
[Guest]: I mean, off camera,

02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:58.680
[Guest]: I'm slightly different,

02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:00.680
[Guest]: but only slightly.

02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:03.480
[Guest]: And that's probably the best way to describe it.

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:04.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I know.

02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:05.480
[Amit Varma]: I get what you're saying that,

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:06.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, like,

02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:08.480
[Amit Varma]: even the intros to my podcast,

02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:09.480
[Amit Varma]: like in this conversation,

02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:10.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm just being me.

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:11.480
[Amit Varma]: But in the intro to my podcast,

02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:12.480
[Amit Varma]: I am kind of presenting,

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:14.480
[Amit Varma]: but it's also kind of me.

02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:15.480
[Amit Varma]: It's not contrived.

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:17.480
[Amit Varma]: That's a similar thing.

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:18.480
[Amit Varma]: So I get what you mean

02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:19.480
[Amit Varma]: when you say you're presenting

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:20.480
[Amit Varma]: and you've got a script and all that.

02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:21.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I get that.

02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:22.480
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time,

02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:23.480
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't feel contrived.

02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:26.480
[Guest]: I'm not trying to make it not feel contrived.

02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:27.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:28.480
[Guest]: While at the same time,

02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:31.280
[Guest]: I'm not trying to make it, you know,

02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:32.280
[Guest]: unless it's a vlog like that,

02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:33.280
[Guest]: I'm not trying to make it

02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:35.280
[Guest]: look completely casual either.

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:38.280
[Guest]: I mean, I will pay more attention to the lighting

02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:40.280
[Guest]: than I will to hairstyle.

02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:41.280
[Guest]: That's me.

02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:43.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's kind of remarkable

02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.280
[Amit Varma]: because I think that kind of

02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:47.280
[Amit Varma]: lack of self-consciousness is just great.

02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:48.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know,

02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:51.280
[Amit Varma]: I'm also thinking of starting something on YouTube

02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:53.280
[Amit Varma]: and that self-consciousness about

02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:55.280
[Amit Varma]: just the physical aspect of it is,

02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:57.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, kind of the biggest

02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:59.080
[Amit Varma]: stumbling block, though I know that

02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:00.080
[Amit Varma]: once I start and I get past it,

02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:01.080
[Amit Varma]: it's kind of fine.

02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:03.080
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, audio is easy that way.

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:05.080
[Amit Varma]: You don't really have to worry.

02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:06.080
[Guest]: No, there I totally agree,

02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:07.080
[Guest]: which is why, I mean,

02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:09.080
[Guest]: you know, out of the commentary work that I do,

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.080
[Guest]: doing radio commentary is my favorite

02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:14.080
[Guest]: because there it's not about

02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:15.080
[Guest]: what you look like.

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:17.080
[Guest]: It's about what you know and how you say it.

02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:21.080
[Guest]: And that is the probably

02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:23.080
[Guest]: most natural form of commentary

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.080
[Guest]: that I've experienced.

02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:27.880
[Guest]: And that is something that I really enjoy doing

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:28.880
[Guest]: purely for the reason that, you know,

02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:30.880
[Guest]: you don't have to present visually.

02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:32.880
[Guest]: You just need to present almost

02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:34.880
[Guest]: intellectually and vocally.

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:36.880
[Amit Varma]: So let's talk about commentary.

02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:37.880
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know,

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:39.880
[Amit Varma]: there are very different views

02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:41.880
[Amit Varma]: of what good commentary is.

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:43.880
[Amit Varma]: Before satellite television kind of took over India,

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:45.880
[Amit Varma]: if you go back to the Ritchie Beno school of thinking,

02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:47.880
[Amit Varma]: the Ritchie Beno school of thinking

02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:49.880
[Amit Varma]: really is that the viewer can see

02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:50.880
[Amit Varma]: what is happening on the screen.

02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:51.880
[Amit Varma]: You don't need to describe it.

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:53.880
[Amit Varma]: If you have something to say with that

02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.680
[Amit Varma]: adds to that, say it.

02:18:55.880 --> 02:18:57.680
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, keep quiet.

02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Whereas, you know,

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:00.680
[Amit Varma]: the brief on Indian satellite television

02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:03.680
[Amit Varma]: for the early group of commentators in the 90s

02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:05.680
[Amit Varma]: was simply that don't let there be a quiet moment.

02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.680
[Amit Varma]: So you kind of had to talk.

02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:09.680
[Amit Varma]: You had to sort of fill all the space

02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:11.680
[Amit Varma]: with the description and that

02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:12.680
[Amit Varma]: there was a danger there

02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:14.680
[Amit Varma]: that then you just get banal

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.680
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, all of those things kind of happen.

02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:20.680
[Amit Varma]: So when you started doing commentary,

02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:22.680
[Amit Varma]: what was the kind of brief you gave to yourself?

02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:25.480
[Amit Varma]: Like, how does one define good commentary?

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.480
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, it's different on TV and radio

02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:29.480
[Amit Varma]: because radio, the person isn't actually seeing the action.

02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:31.480
[Amit Varma]: So you got to get into that as well.

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:34.480
[Amit Varma]: But what was your notion of commentary going in?

02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:35.480
[Amit Varma]: How did it evolve?

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:37.480
[Amit Varma]: How did your style as a commentator evolve?

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:39.480
[Amit Varma]: And what did you find difficult?

02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:41.480
[Amit Varma]: And what did you not find difficult, so to say?

02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:44.480
[Guest]: So my first experience with commentary

02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.480
[Guest]: was probably Australia,

02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:48.480
[Guest]: where I went and, you know,

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.480
[Guest]: word got around that there's someone from India here.

02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:53.280
[Guest]: And since there was subjects of interest

02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:55.280
[Guest]: in terms of two Indian players,

02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:57.280
[Guest]: ABC Radio wanted to get some perspective,

02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:58.280
[Guest]: get the Indian perspective.

02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:01.280
[Guest]: And that was the first time I put on a mic

02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:02.280
[Guest]: and quite nervous.

02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:05.280
[Guest]: Luckily, I had the role there of an expert.

02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:07.280
[Guest]: So, you know, you would usually

02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:09.280
[Guest]: describe commentators in two roles.

02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:11.280
[Guest]: One is a caller and one is an expert,

02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:13.280
[Guest]: where the caller is having to,

02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:15.280
[Guest]: especially on radio, describe what happened

02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:17.280
[Guest]: and the expert will have to

02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:19.280
[Guest]: describe why it happened.

02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:22.080
[Guest]: So the first few opportunities that I got were opportunities

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:24.080
[Guest]: which were usually, you know, in the break commentary

02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:25.080
[Guest]: where I could just talk about

02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:27.080
[Guest]: my experience with women's cricket.

02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:30.080
[Guest]: And that felt fairly natural.

02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:32.080
[Guest]: It felt fairly, you know, OK.

02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:34.080
[Guest]: I know my stuff.

02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:36.080
[Guest]: So therefore, I can put it across.

02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:39.080
[Guest]: Like I said, I mean, communication in English

02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:41.080
[Guest]: had always been a strength.

02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:44.080
[Guest]: So this was just about overcoming

02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:45.080
[Guest]: those initial butterflies of,

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:47.080
[Guest]: oh my God, your life

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:48.080
[Guest]: and getting started.

02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:50.880
[Guest]: And once I got started, I used to usually get into the flow.

02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:52.880
[Guest]: So that was how radio went.

02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:55.880
[Guest]: When I went to TV for the first time,

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:57.880
[Guest]: this was, I got an opportunity to commentate

02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:58.880
[Guest]: on a challenger trophy,

02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:00.880
[Guest]: a women's challenger trophy.

02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:02.880
[Guest]: First time commentating with the BCCI,

02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:04.880
[Guest]: first time commentating

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.880
[Guest]: on something that is going up on TV

02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:08.880
[Guest]: on a major channel like Star Sports.

02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:11.880
[Guest]: There, the brief to myself was

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:12.880
[Guest]: play your role.

02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:15.880
[Guest]: Again, usually I was only slotted as the expert

02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:17.680
[Guest]: because inexperienced as a caller.

02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:20.680
[Guest]: In India, the culture is kind of different in TV commentary.

02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:21.680
[Guest]: The roles mix.

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:24.680
[Guest]: A former cricketer can be both expert and caller

02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:27.680
[Guest]: depending on your position in the roster.

02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:30.680
[Guest]: Usually, my role has been of the expert

02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:34.680
[Guest]: being trying to add some layer of insight.

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:36.680
[Guest]: And that was probably one brief I had to myself

02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:38.680
[Guest]: that, you know, if this is happening,

02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:40.680
[Guest]: what is the background story?

02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:44.680
[Guest]: And that's one area I worked really hard.

02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:46.480
[Guest]: The whole journalistic training of, you know,

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:48.480
[Guest]: interviews, research,

02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:51.480
[Guest]: really helped in that sense that

02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:54.480
[Guest]: I remember that challenger trophy, in fact.

02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:56.480
[Guest]: I got there a day before.

02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:58.480
[Guest]: I tried to watch practice.

02:21:58.680 --> 02:22:00.480
[Guest]: You know, I arranged to stay with a friend.

02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:03.480
[Guest]: I hadn't actually got official accommodation that day.

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.480
[Guest]: But I arranged to stay with a friend,

02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:06.480
[Guest]: watch practice.

02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:09.480
[Guest]: The next night, once I checked into my official accommodation

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:11.480
[Guest]: which is the same hotel the players were staying,

02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:13.480
[Guest]: I went around room to room

02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:16.280
[Guest]: and sat the players down and had a chat with them.

02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:17.280
[Guest]: What's your back story?

02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:18.280
[Guest]: Where do you come from?

02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:20.280
[Guest]: And especially the younger players

02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:22.280
[Guest]: because I had been retired a couple of years.

02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:24.280
[Guest]: There were players who I had not played with and against.

02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:25.280
[Guest]: I didn't know their stories.

02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:27.280
[Guest]: I had to make sure I knew their stories

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:30.280
[Guest]: because, like, I am the voice of these people.

02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:32.280
[Guest]: I am the one who is responsible with telling their stories.

02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:34.280
[Guest]: So I had to make sure I knew those stories.

02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:36.280
[Guest]: So I went room to room chatting.

02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:38.280
[Guest]: Like, Didi, up!

02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:41.280
[Guest]: That kind of a, like, completely unscheduled, unannounced,

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:45.080
[Guest]: Hi, I am just going to take 15 minutes of your time and ask you about your life.

02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:47.080
[Guest]: Kind of conversations.

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:48.080
[Unknown]: And that helped.

02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:51.080
[Guest]: I mean, if you are caught on a moment

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:54.080
[Guest]: where, you know, the caller has thrown to you,

02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:55.080
[Guest]: Snehal, tell us about this person.

02:22:55.280 --> 02:23:00.080
[Guest]: And you don't know that comes across on TV

02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:01.080
[Guest]: or on commentary as bad commentary.

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:03.080
[Guest]: It comes across that you are faking it.

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:06.080
[Guest]: And if you actually have done the research,

02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:07.080
[Guest]: then you can tell the stories.

02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:10.080
[Guest]: And that might have been the brief I gave to myself.

02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:12.880
[Guest]: Is that, you know, A, it's your responsibility to tell these stories.

02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:14.880
[Guest]: B, it's your responsibility to grow the game.

02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:17.880
[Guest]: And that is kind of one of the things

02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:21.880
[Guest]: that has driven a lot of my later career.

02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:25.880
[Guest]: I mean, even one of the reasons I got into writing on women's cricket

02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:28.880
[Guest]: and I did most of my early writing on women's cricket

02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:31.880
[Guest]: was that no one was writing about women's cricket.

02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:32.880
[Guest]: And I knew I could.

02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:34.880
[Guest]: And I knew I could make an impact.

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:37.880
[Guest]: So the same kind of awareness while going into commentary

02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:41.680
[Guest]: where if you do this well, it will help grow the game

02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:42.680
[Guest]: in whatever small way.

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:43.680
[Guest]: They are the story.

02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:46.680
[Guest]: They are the ones who are going to do it primarily.

02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:48.680
[Guest]: I am just a storyteller.

02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:50.680
[Guest]: That was kind of the brief I gave myself.

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:53.680
[Guest]: But I always had an awareness that, you know,

02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:56.680
[Guest]: unless both those aspects are in sync,

02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:59.680
[Guest]: the value of what is happening on the field

02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:01.680
[Guest]: won't go across to the viewer or the listener.

02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:05.680
[Amit Varma]: One kind of strand, one sense that I got through your writings

02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:08.480
[Amit Varma]: and your videos and stuff was that

02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:12.480
[Amit Varma]: much of the stuff that you did after actually retiring as a player

02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:16.480
[Amit Varma]: was driven by your passion for women's cricket in India.

02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Like you talk about how, you know, you loved coaching

02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:20.480
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, you didn't get that coaching.

02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And now all these girls have access to that coaching.

02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:26.480
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, you know, writing about the women's game,

02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:28.480
[Amit Varma]: nobody else is doing it, so you're doing it.

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:30.480
[Amit Varma]: Not just coaching cricket, also coaching sports journalism.

02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:34.480
[Amit Varma]: You're also now not just writing about women's cricket,

02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:36.280
[Amit Varma]: but just writing about cricket, you know,

02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:38.280
[Amit Varma]: writing about cricket really, really well.

02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:41.280
[Amit Varma]: So is that passion still sort of the single driving force

02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:43.280
[Amit Varma]: that gets you into all of this?

02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.280
[Amit Varma]: Or do you see yourself as a creator

02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:48.280
[Amit Varma]: outside of someone who's come as a former player herself?

02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:50.280
[Amit Varma]: Do you also see yourself as a creator?

02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:54.280
[Amit Varma]: Like I noticed that you also got another sideways YouTube channel

02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:55.280
[Amit Varma]: which is not about cricket coaching,

02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:56.280
[Amit Varma]: which is just about vlogging.

02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:59.280
[Amit Varma]: And you did a recent vlog about the trek you took and stuff.

02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:02.280
[Amit Varma]: So, like, was it always the case that you thought that,

02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:05.080
[Amit Varma]: oh, I'm a creator and I'll do these cricket things?

02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:07.080
[Amit Varma]: Or were you driven into these things

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:08.080
[Amit Varma]: because of your passion for cricket?

02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:11.080
[Amit Varma]: And then you kind of began to redefine and expand.

02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:13.080
[Amit Varma]: So what's been your thought process

02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:16.080
[Amit Varma]: and your sort of the way that you look at yourself?

02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:19.080
[Guest]: I definitely think of myself as a creator,

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:21.080
[Guest]: but this creator would not exist

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:24.080
[Guest]: if that passion for women's cricket was not there.

02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:29.080
[Guest]: I mean, that was the material that needed an outlet.

02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:31.080
[Guest]: And that outlet happened to be, you know,

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:33.880
[Guest]: starting with writing and mostly the women's cricket stuff

02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:35.880
[Guest]: has been conveyed through my writing.

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:39.880
[Guest]: YouTube has mostly been stuff where I enjoy this process of,

02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:41.880
[Guest]: like I said, learning and then applying.

02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.880
[Guest]: Similarly, learning and then sharing what you've learned

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:48.880
[Guest]: is also something that gives you a little bit of a kick

02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:50.880
[Guest]: or gives me a little bit of a kick.

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:55.880
[Guest]: And I enjoy that process independent of women's cricket

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.880
[Guest]: or independent of my passion for cricket in general.

02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:02.680
[Guest]: I mean, my passion for cricket is not completely,

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:04.680
[Guest]: how to say, indestructible.

02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:07.680
[Guest]: Like there will be phases and there was a phase

02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:10.680
[Guest]: just after the IPL after having done commentary almost every day

02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:13.680
[Guest]: where I didn't want to watch cricket for one week.

02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:15.680
[Guest]: But there I still might feel like, you know,

02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:18.680
[Guest]: I might be able to make a video or I might be able to do other stuff.

02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:24.680
[Guest]: So the passion for the subject definitely existed first

02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:29.480
[Guest]: and then the outlet for it has probably defined me as a creator.

02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:34.480
[Guest]: But if you ask me what I will want to and be passionate about creating,

02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:37.480
[Guest]: it will always be something related to growing the game,

02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:39.480
[Guest]: growing the women's game.

02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:43.480
[Guest]: Like even now my storefront, you could say,

02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:45.480
[Guest]: doesn't really have a lot of women's cricket.

02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:47.480
[Guest]: You know, I might be writing on women's cricket, yes,

02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.480
[Guest]: but I might be writing on other cricket also.

02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:51.480
[Guest]: I might be doing YouTube videos on cricket in general

02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:55.280
[Guest]: and where 80% of my viewers are boys, but in the background

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:57.280
[Guest]: there are projects running where I'm thinking

02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:59.280
[Guest]: how can I make an impact on this game?

02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:03.280
[Guest]: How can I help the Indian team win a World Cup?

02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:09.280
[Guest]: How can I help the Indian domestic players get a better deal?

02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:13.280
[Guest]: Those kind of things always occupy space in my mind

02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:16.280
[Guest]: and they may not always find a creative outlet,

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:19.280
[Guest]: but there will be something or the other running.

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:24.080
[Guest]: And again, I'm very lucky to be able to make a living

02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:27.080
[Guest]: from this kind of thinking, just thinking about the game

02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:29.080
[Guest]: and trying to find solutions for it,

02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:33.080
[Guest]: which I really appreciate and remind myself to be grateful for.

02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:39.080
[Guest]: But that thinking process and that desire to fix the problems

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:43.080
[Guest]: that I see in women's cricket has not really gone away

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:46.080
[Guest]: and that's probably what is then driving

02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:48.080
[Guest]: and expressing in different ways.

02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:50.880
[Amit Varma]: So, let's talk about women's cricket.

02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And I almost feel hesitant, you know,

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:54.880
[Amit Varma]: talking about women's cricket particularly

02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:56.880
[Amit Varma]: because I don't want to slot you as someone

02:27:57.080 --> 02:27:58.880
[Amit Varma]: who writes about women's cricket because like I said,

02:27:59.080 --> 02:27:59.880
[Amit Varma]: I just love your writing.

02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:01.880
[Amit Varma]: You're one of my favorite cricket writers.

02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:03.880
[Amit Varma]: But women's cricket is simply one of those subjects

02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:06.880
[Amit Varma]: which not enough people have that kind of depth of knowledge about

02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:08.880
[Amit Varma]: or sort of talk about.

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, most Indians are kind of saturated

02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:13.880
[Amit Varma]: with the regular men's cricket that happens out there,

02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.880
[Amit Varma]: but know nothing about women's cricket per se.

02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:19.680
[Amit Varma]: And you've written this wonderful report called An Equal Hue

02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.680
[Amit Varma]: along with Karunya Keshav and the late Siddhant Patnaik.

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:25.680
[Amit Varma]: And let's kind of talk a little bit about that

02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:27.680
[Amit Varma]: because I love reading that paper in the sense that

02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:31.680
[Amit Varma]: it laid out in great detail across all these different categories,

02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:33.680
[Amit Varma]: not just what is wrong with women's cricket,

02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:35.680
[Amit Varma]: but what can be done to improve it.

02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And just as a vision document and as a, you know,

02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:40.680
[Amit Varma]: taking stock of where things are,

02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:42.680
[Amit Varma]: I just found it eye-opening in many ways.

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:46.480
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about what it involved.

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:48.480
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, why did you write that?

02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:50.480
[Amit Varma]: What was the impetus behind it?

02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Like, I know you were one of the, I think,

02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:54.480
[Amit Varma]: three journalists present during the 2017 World Cup final.

02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:56.480
[Amit Varma]: I think Karunya was also one of them.

02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:59.480
[Amit Varma]: So what was the impetus which made you decide

02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:01.480
[Amit Varma]: that this is something that needs to be done?

02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:04.480
[Amit Varma]: Did you feel that there was a serious audience for it?

02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:06.480
[Amit Varma]: Not audience in terms of eyeballs,

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:08.480
[Amit Varma]: but in terms of people who would act in the board,

02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:10.480
[Amit Varma]: who would actually do something about it?

02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:15.280
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about what led you to the report and so on.

02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:18.280
[Guest]: So let me pick up on the fact that

02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:22.280
[Guest]: the third journalist in that 2017 World Cup was Siddhant.

02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:24.280
[Amit Varma]: Ah, so the three of you.

02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:27.280
[Guest]: Yeah. So, and that was kind of where it started

02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:30.280
[Guest]: because the two of them were working for Vision India at the time.

02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:33.280
[Guest]: I was freelancing and the three of us

02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:35.280
[Guest]: were the only ones who were traveling

02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:38.280
[Guest]: to cover the World Cup in entirety.

02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:41.080
[Guest]: Then after India reached the finals, a lot more media coverage swept in,

02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:42.080
[Guest]: which was great.

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:45.080
[Guest]: But I must really mention here

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:48.080
[Guest]: the influence that Siddhant also had in this entire project.

02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:51.080
[Guest]: That was the first time I actually spent time with him.

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:53.080
[Guest]: I'd met him once in the Vision India office,

02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:56.080
[Guest]: but we were housemates on that tour.

02:29:56.280 --> 02:29:58.080
[Guest]: So we had the same schedule.

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:00.080
[Guest]: So we basically had planned our accommodation

02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:02.080
[Guest]: and our travel, etc. together.

02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:04.080
[Guest]: And we chatted so much about women's cricket.

02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:06.080
[Guest]: And of course, he was, I mean, not there just because

02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:07.880
[Guest]: he was working with Vision India.

02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:09.880
[Guest]: Even before that, in all his time,

02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:13.880
[Guest]: he and Karun had put up a huge body of work

02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:14.880
[Guest]: on women's cricket.

02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:16.880
[Guest]: They were one of the few people who were writing about

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:19.880
[Guest]: domestic women's cricket, international women's cricket

02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:20.880
[Guest]: before 2017.

02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:22.880
[Guest]: Remember, 2017 is the moment where

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:24.880
[Guest]: women's cricket became cool again.

02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:26.880
[Guest]: And I'm always going to have tremendous respect

02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:28.880
[Guest]: for the people who were putting in a lot of work

02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:29.880
[Guest]: behind the scenes before that.

02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:30.880
[Guest]: And Siddhant was one of those people.

02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:33.880
[Guest]: And he has a sister who, you know,

02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:36.680
[Guest]: he saw a lot of similarities between her and me.

02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:39.680
[Guest]: This sporty kid, always not afraid to play

02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:41.680
[Guest]: with the boys, standing out.

02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:43.680
[Guest]: And there was always this desire to kind of make

02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:46.680
[Guest]: the world a better place for people like her.

02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:50.680
[Guest]: And therefore, this kinship with the underdogs,

02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:53.680
[Guest]: whether it's domestic men's cricketers

02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:55.680
[Guest]: or women's international cricketers.

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:59.680
[Guest]: And so the loss of the 2017 World Cup final,

02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:01.680
[Guest]: even for that final, the three of us were

02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:04.480
[Guest]: sharing a house together in London.

02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:07.480
[Guest]: And we kind of grieved it in that final

02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:08.480
[Guest]: in our own ways.

02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:11.480
[Guest]: I remember finishing my filing

02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:14.480
[Guest]: at some ridiculous hour at night

02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:17.480
[Guest]: and after that match, just collapsing

02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:18.480
[Guest]: in the kitchen and crying.

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:20.480
[Guest]: I mean, that is the time where the emotion

02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:21.480
[Guest]: finally came out that, you know,

02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:25.480
[Guest]: we were so close and we lost by nine runs.

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.480
[Guest]: And after that, we kept talking,

02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:29.480
[Guest]: especially Siddhant and me, about

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:32.280
[Guest]: what we can do to help the game,

02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:35.280
[Guest]: what we can do to try and make it better.

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:37.280
[Guest]: So, I mean, for a start, we decided,

02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:39.280
[Guest]: OK, let's compile our suggestions

02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:40.280
[Guest]: for whatever it's worth.

02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:43.280
[Guest]: And we made a very rough document

02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:44.280
[Guest]: which had some excellent suggestions.

02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:47.280
[Guest]: I mean, even Siddhant had really put in,

02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:49.280
[Guest]: you know, he had event management background.

02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:51.280
[Guest]: So use that kind of a background

02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:53.280
[Guest]: to draw this up.

02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:55.280
[Guest]: He happened to speak to Nandan Kamath,

02:31:55.480 --> 02:31:57.280
[Guest]: who you've had on your pod before,

02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:00.080
[Guest]: who has founded something called

02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:02.080
[Guest]: the Sports Law and Policy Center,

02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:04.080
[Guest]: which is a body which is dedicated

02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:06.080
[Guest]: to kind of publishing these kind of works

02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:09.080
[Guest]: which create almost a body of work

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:11.080
[Guest]: on that particular sport.

02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:13.080
[Guest]: So Nandan really encouraged us

02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:15.080
[Guest]: to widen and deepen the scope of the report

02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:17.080
[Guest]: and make it, you know,

02:32:17.280 --> 02:32:19.080
[Guest]: a basic groundwork document

02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:21.080
[Guest]: where anyone who wants to have

02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:23.080
[Guest]: any kind of influence in women's cricket

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:26.080
[Guest]: can read this, get an idea of where they are,

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:28.880
[Guest]: where the action areas are required.

02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:31.880
[Guest]: And so we set about that.

02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:34.880
[Guest]: During the course of making that report,

02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:36.880
[Guest]: Siddhant's sickness got worse

02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:39.880
[Guest]: and eventually he didn't survive.

02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:42.880
[Guest]: After that, I asked Arunia to come on board

02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.880
[Guest]: and the two of us kind of finished that work.

02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:46.880
[Guest]: And during the course of the lockdown,

02:32:47.080 --> 02:32:48.880
[Guest]: actually, when we both got a lot more time,

02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:50.880
[Guest]: so a project that was kind of

02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:52.880
[Guest]: in the making for three years,

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:53.880
[Guest]: put it together,

02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:56.680
[Guest]: we based it not just on our own experience,

02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:59.680
[Guest]: but a survey conducted of 350 state cricketers

02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:02.680
[Guest]: who were really generous with our time.

02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:04.680
[Guest]: Again, like the sense of community

02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:06.680
[Guest]: within the women's cricket circuit

02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:10.680
[Guest]: where they all volunteered to fill up the survey

02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:12.680
[Guest]: because, again, there was a lot of goodwill

02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:14.680
[Guest]: built up by Arunia and Siddhant also

02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:16.680
[Guest]: in the process of writing their book.

02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:18.680
[Guest]: So when they knew that they were involved in this,

02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:21.680
[Guest]: a lot of cricketers participated very actively.

02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:24.480
[Guest]: And this kind of then led us to

02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:25.480
[Guest]: the Equal Hue Report,

02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:27.480
[Guest]: which was published in 2020.

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:31.480
[Guest]: It is the groundwork for action

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:32.480
[Guest]: that needs to be taken next.

02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:34.480
[Guest]: It's a document that analyzes

02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:35.480
[Guest]: where the gap areas are.

02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:37.480
[Guest]: It's the document that really says

02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:39.480
[Guest]: that, you know, OK, if anyone,

02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:40.480
[Guest]: whether it's the BCCI,

02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:41.480
[Guest]: whether it's a broadcaster,

02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:44.480
[Guest]: whether it's some NGO who wants to do good work,

02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:46.480
[Guest]: or whether it's a corporate who has CSR funds,

02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:49.480
[Guest]: they would like to use it to help women's cricket grow.

02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:51.280
[Guest]: These are the areas where you can start.

02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:53.280
[Guest]: This is the way where you can make an impact

02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:55.280
[Guest]: through the recommendations that we've made.

02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:56.280
[Guest]: Along the way, you know,

02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:57.280
[Guest]: we've also had this sense of,

02:33:57.480 --> 02:33:59.280
[Guest]: OK, now we've done this analysis,

02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:00.280
[Guest]: now what?

02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:02.280
[Guest]: And therefore, it's moved into action.

02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:05.280
[Guest]: And we've formed, Karunia, myself,

02:34:05.480 --> 02:34:07.280
[Guest]: people at the Sports Law Policy Center

02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:08.280
[Guest]: have formed the Equal Hue Project

02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:11.280
[Guest]: where we are trying to fill some of these gaps ourselves.

02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:15.280
[Guest]: And a couple of the gaps that we identified were

02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:18.280
[Guest]: not enough information about women's cricket, you know.

02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:20.080
[Guest]: If a women's cricketer is sitting in

02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:24.080
[Guest]: Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Orissa or Dharamshala,

02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:26.080
[Guest]: do they know the pathways in their state?

02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:28.080
[Guest]: So, Karunia really headed a project

02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:31.080
[Guest]: which compiled information for each state

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:34.080
[Guest]: of, you know, what the existing pathways in that state are,

02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:37.080
[Guest]: how a woman who's interested in cricket

02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:38.080
[Guest]: or a girl who's interested in cricket

02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:40.080
[Guest]: can find cricket near her,

02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:43.080
[Guest]: what the state association processes are,

02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:44.080
[Guest]: what their phone numbers are,

02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:45.080
[Guest]: wherever available,

02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:46.080
[Guest]: whatever information is available

02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:48.880
[Guest]: has been put together in a website,

02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:49.880
[Guest]: on the Equal Hue website,

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:52.880
[Guest]: where, you know, we're aiming to fill up that information gap.

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:56.880
[Guest]: They also worked really hard on publishing an audiobook

02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:58.880
[Guest]: where there's a women's cricketer

02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:00.880
[Guest]: as a central figure in it

02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:02.880
[Guest]: for 5 to 8-year-olds or 5 to 10-year-olds.

02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:05.880
[Guest]: So, the next generation should grow up

02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:07.880
[Guest]: with women's cricketers in their consciousness.

02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:08.880
[Guest]: So, that's some of the projects

02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:10.880
[Guest]: that the Equal Hue Project is working on.

02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:12.880
[Guest]: Like I said, there are projects in the background

02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:13.880
[Guest]: that we are working on.

02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:17.680
[Guest]: We have plans and we are reaching out

02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:19.680
[Guest]: to various brands to partner with them

02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:22.680
[Guest]: on these plans to just support the ecosystem

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:23.680
[Guest]: more and more,

02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:24.680
[Guest]: be it through scholarships,

02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:25.680
[Guest]: be it through tournaments.

02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:28.680
[Guest]: And that's, I think, the big opportunity

02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:31.680
[Guest]: and something that I hope really allows us

02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:33.680
[Guest]: to make an actual impact on the ground

02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:35.680
[Guest]: because there's only so much you can do

02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:38.680
[Guest]: is what I've discovered writing about a sport.

02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:41.680
[Guest]: But, you know, can we actually make an impact

02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:44.480
[Guest]: on the ground through our projects?

02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:47.480
[Guest]: That's the new focus almost.

02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:49.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, the hope has been voiced by many

02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:51.480
[Amit Varma]: that the 2017 World Cup final

02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:53.480
[Amit Varma]: with all the viewership that it got and so on,

02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:55.480
[Amit Varma]: the World Cup, in fact, not just the final,

02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:56.480
[Amit Varma]: with all the viewership that it got

02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:58.480
[Amit Varma]: could be something like the 1983 moment

02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:00.480
[Amit Varma]: for men's cricket was.

02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:01.480
[Amit Varma]: But my question is, you know,

02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:05.480
[Amit Varma]: I think in the life of any sport or any activity,

02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:08.480
[Amit Varma]: there is this transition from where early on

02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:10.480
[Amit Varma]: all the people who care about it deeply

02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:12.280
[Amit Varma]: and are making initiatives are people

02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:13.280
[Amit Varma]: who are just passionate about it

02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:15.280
[Amit Varma]: and are motivated by that passion

02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:16.280
[Amit Varma]: and that's what's driving them.

02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:18.280
[Amit Varma]: And then the next phase that comes

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:21.280
[Amit Varma]: is when it crosses a certain tipping point

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:23.280
[Amit Varma]: and people are instead motivated by commerce.

02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:25.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, so people begin to do things

02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:26.280
[Amit Varma]: for women's cricket

02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:28.280
[Amit Varma]: because they feel there is a market for it

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.280
[Amit Varma]: and then things really improve,

02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:32.280
[Amit Varma]: then infrastructure improves,

02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:33.280
[Amit Varma]: then all of these things, you know,

02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:35.280
[Amit Varma]: like you've got a section

02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:37.280
[Amit Varma]: where you speak about barriers to participation

02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:38.280
[Amit Varma]: which include cultural barriers,

02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:41.080
[Amit Varma]: physical barriers, financial barriers,

02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:43.080
[Amit Varma]: then those start to disappear.

02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:44.080
[Amit Varma]: You've got a section where you talk about

02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:46.080
[Amit Varma]: domestic cricket and the grassroots

02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:49.080
[Amit Varma]: and how the ecosystem there can be much better

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:52.080
[Amit Varma]: and those kind of start to vanish.

02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:53.080
[Amit Varma]: So how close is that point?

02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:54.080
[Amit Varma]: Have we reached that point?

02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:55.080
[Amit Varma]: Have we crossed that point?

02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:57.080
[Amit Varma]: Is it still somewhere in the future?

02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:59.080
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of how the game

02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:02.080
[Amit Varma]: is sort of evolving in that sense

02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:04.080
[Amit Varma]: because it is true that women's cricket

02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:06.080
[Amit Varma]: is much more in the consciousness

02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:07.880
[Amit Varma]: of a lot of viewers,

02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:10.880
[Amit Varma]: but is there enough women's cricket happening?

02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.880
[Amit Varma]: Are they watching it actively?

02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:15.880
[Amit Varma]: What's the ecosystem like beneath the elite game?

02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:18.880
[Amit Varma]: Give me a little bit of a sense of that.

02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:21.880
[Guest]: So let me answer the

02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:24.880
[Guest]: driven by commerce kind of angle first.

02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:28.880
[Guest]: The last IPL T20 women's challenge that happened

02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:31.880
[Guest]: where it involved three teams

02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.680
[Guest]: was held in Dubai alongside the men's IPL of 2020.

02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:39.680
[Guest]: It was the first tournament to attract sponsors.

02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:41.680
[Guest]: It was the first tournament where Jio came on board

02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:43.680
[Guest]: as an independent title sponsor.

02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:45.680
[Guest]: It was very prudent and smart of the BCCI

02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:48.680
[Guest]: to not just piggyback it along with the men's tournament

02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:50.680
[Guest]: and the men's sponsors and identify it

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:52.680
[Guest]: as a separate property and see what value

02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:55.680
[Guest]: there is for this property.

02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:57.680
[Guest]: Jio came on board as a title sponsor

02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:59.680
[Guest]: and then all the IPL supporting sponsors

02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:02.480
[Guest]: came on board for this women's T20 challenge as well.

02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:05.480
[Guest]: Wonderful opportunity for you to get branding.

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:07.480
[Guest]: Wonderful opportunity for you to get exposure

02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:10.480
[Guest]: and what the BCCI treasurer I believe said after the tournament

02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:12.480
[Guest]: is this is now financially sustainable

02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:15.480
[Guest]: which I take to understand that it paid for itself.

02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:17.480
[Guest]: We've broken even.

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:22.480
[Guest]: So if that is the bare minimum of where we are,

02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:24.480
[Guest]: it's a wonderful starting point to be

02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:28.480
[Guest]: because you can just everything north of this is profit.

02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:31.280
[Guest]: So I think commerce wise that is where

02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:36.280
[Guest]: the Indian team is value wise when right now

02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:38.280
[Guest]: it's hard to define a separate value

02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:40.280
[Guest]: for the Indian women's cricket team because

02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:42.280
[Guest]: how do you define value of a sports property?

02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:44.280
[Guest]: Broadcast rights.

02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:47.280
[Guest]: What kind of money is being paid by broadcasters

02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:49.280
[Guest]: to showcase this property which reflects

02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:52.280
[Guest]: how many advertisers are willing to put money

02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:54.280
[Guest]: behind this kind of a product.

02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:56.280
[Guest]: It's hard to gauge right now because

02:38:56.280 --> 02:38:59.080
[Guest]: women's domestic women's international matches

02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:02.080
[Guest]: are bundled in to the men's broadcast rights

02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:05.080
[Guest]: along with you know, the under 19 World Cup

02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:08.080
[Guest]: or those under 19 teams same with the shirt sponsorship.

02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:11.080
[Guest]: The shirt sponsorship is sold as a bundle

02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:14.080
[Guest]: for the men's women's and under 19.

02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:16.080
[Guest]: Whereas I think now in the next cycle

02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:18.080
[Guest]: which is 2023 onwards.

02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:20.080
[Guest]: There is a case.

02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:23.080
[Guest]: There is a strong case to separate this

02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:24.080
[Guest]: as a separate property.

02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:26.880
[Guest]: Let's say women's cricket is sold at a separate property.

02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:27.880
[Guest]: It will earn you.

02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:29.880
[Guest]: I mean by separating women's cricket

02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:31.880
[Guest]: the overall cost of the men's rights

02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:32.880
[Guest]: is not going to come down.

02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:34.880
[Guest]: Yeah, but the but the women's rights

02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:37.880
[Guest]: might earn you, you know, some amount of money.

02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:39.880
[Guest]: It's not going to be in the range of what the men

02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.880
[Guest]: men's rights are going to earn you,

02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:43.880
[Guest]: but it will earn you some amount of money

02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:46.880
[Guest]: that will put a number on the value of women's cricket

02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:48.880
[Guest]: and that is something I look forward to happening.

02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:51.880
[Guest]: There's also the fact that if you look at

02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:52.880
[Guest]: a women's cricket broadcast now,

02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:54.680
[Guest]: for example, on these OTT apps,

02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:58.680
[Guest]: you can you can gauge that by how many of these

02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:02.680
[Guest]: how many ads are off the OTT platform itself.

02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:05.680
[Guest]: For example, if it's a on Hotstar in the breaks,

02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:07.680
[Guest]: how many Hotstar ads are you seeing?

02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:10.680
[Guest]: Because that is time where they haven't been able

02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:11.680
[Guest]: to sell it to an advertiser.

02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:13.680
[Guest]: So they put a Hotstar ad there.

02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:15.680
[Guest]: So if you see a lot of Hotstar ads,

02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:17.680
[Guest]: it means that this property is not really valuable.

02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:21.680
[Guest]: What I've seen is of the recent tour to Australia.

02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:24.480
[Guest]: There were a lot of ads for the women's tour to Australia.

02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:26.480
[Guest]: There were ads by brands,

02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:28.480
[Guest]: very few ads by the broadcaster who was Sony.

02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:32.480
[Guest]: There was also title sponsors for the series.

02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:35.480
[Guest]: There was also investment by the broadcaster

02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:37.480
[Guest]: in building up this is for away series.

02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:41.480
[Guest]: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, three separate languages

02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:44.480
[Guest]: for broadcast for the women's series

02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:47.480
[Guest]: beyond just the world feed English commentary

02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:50.480
[Guest]: that they carry, which tells me that's where you

02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:52.280
[Guest]: that's where they stand in terms of commerce

02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:55.280
[Guest]: in terms of the underlying structure.

02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.280
[Guest]: So much that could be better.

02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:00.280
[Guest]: I mean, we talk about the strength of domestic cricket

02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:03.280
[Guest]: for the men and the finishing school

02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:06.280
[Guest]: that is the IPL and the India A programs

02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:09.280
[Guest]: a long time ago for the men's in men's cricket.

02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:12.280
[Guest]: We used to compare Australia as a better domestic system.

02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:15.280
[Guest]: Why? Because they have only eight teams,

02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:17.280
[Guest]: whereas we have some 30-35 teams

02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:19.280
[Guest]: and we are diluting our talent.

02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:23.080
[Guest]: Therefore, the competition is less fierce.

02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:25.080
[Guest]: Therefore, the players are not battle hardened

02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:27.080
[Guest]: when they come to international cricket.

02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:28.080
[Guest]: What has changed?

02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:30.080
[Guest]: I mean, we still have 30-35 teams,

02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:32.080
[Guest]: but now we have an India A program.

02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:33.080
[Guest]: Now we have an IPL.

02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:35.080
[Guest]: Those are the steps up.

02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:37.080
[Guest]: So, I mean, for me, it's just common sense to say

02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:39.080
[Guest]: that, you know, apply the same model here.

02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:42.080
[Guest]: We have 30-35 teams playing domestic cricket.

02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:44.080
[Guest]: Please have an India A program.

02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:45.080
[Guest]: Please have an under-19 program.

02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:47.080
[Guest]: Please have a women's IPL and just see how,

02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.880
[Guest]: you know, other countries are scared of India getting it right

02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:53.880
[Guest]: because of just the sheer number of players that we have,

02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:55.880
[Guest]: even despite, you know, not really trying.

02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:58.880
[Guest]: A few moves which have bewildered me

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:00.880
[Guest]: in the last few years have been

02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:03.880
[Guest]: the removal of the interzonal tournament.

02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:05.880
[Guest]: So, from these 30-35 teams,

02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:06.880
[Guest]: you're picking talent directly,

02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:08.880
[Guest]: putting it in the challenger trophy

02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:10.880
[Guest]: and sending it to international level.

02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:13.880
[Guest]: Of course, they're going to find that jump slightly difficult.

02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:15.880
[Guest]: The interzonal level was what gave them

02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:17.680
[Guest]: a little bit of a stepping stone.

02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:20.680
[Guest]: I would love to see that tournament come back

02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:22.680
[Guest]: besides the fact that it just gives more match days

02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:23.680
[Guest]: to the players.

02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:25.680
[Guest]: Again, they play too few matches.

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:27.680
[Guest]: Spend nine months of the year training

02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:29.680
[Guest]: and play about four or five matches ODI,

02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:31.680
[Guest]: four or five matches T20.

02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:32.680
[Guest]: If you don't qualify for the next stage,

02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:34.680
[Guest]: that's it. Domestic season over

02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:36.680
[Guest]: in senior cricket.

02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:40.680
[Guest]: And what was your other question about the underlying structure or...

02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:43.680
[Amit Varma]: I'll come back to that just to follow on sort of,

02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:46.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, what you said obviously makes sense

02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:47.480
[Amit Varma]: that if you unbundle the rights,

02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:50.480
[Amit Varma]: you get a proper picture of where

02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:51.480
[Amit Varma]: women's cricket really stands.

02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:54.480
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the risk of underestimating it

02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:55.480
[Amit Varma]: is no longer there.

02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:57.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, is it then a problem that BCCI

02:42:57.680 --> 02:42:59.480
[Amit Varma]: is running both aspects of the game?

02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:00.480
[Amit Varma]: Because obviously, I'm, you know,

02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:02.480
[Amit Varma]: both men's cricket and women's cricket

02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:04.480
[Amit Varma]: because I get it that in 2006,

02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:05.480
[Amit Varma]: with all the resources,

02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:07.480
[Amit Varma]: they improved a lot of things.

02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:09.480
[Amit Varma]: They can't take a lot of the abundant money

02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:11.480
[Amit Varma]: from the men's game and, you know,

02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:13.480
[Amit Varma]: use it to give the women's game a leg up.

02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:16.280
[Amit Varma]: But if I just think of incentives within the BCCI,

02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:18.280
[Amit Varma]: their huge cash cow is the men's game.

02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:21.280
[Amit Varma]: All their thinking, all their organizational work,

02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:24.280
[Amit Varma]: it's natural for it to kind of go there.

02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:26.280
[Amit Varma]: So was it perhaps better earlier

02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:28.280
[Amit Varma]: in just in terms of incentives

02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:30.280
[Amit Varma]: that if you have a body where, you know,

02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:32.280
[Amit Varma]: your job is women's cricket, it's nothing else.

02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:33.280
[Amit Varma]: That's all you do.

02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:34.280
[Amit Varma]: That's your incentives.

02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:35.280
[Amit Varma]: That's how you will be judged.

02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:36.280
[Amit Varma]: It's a separate product.

02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:38.280
[Amit Varma]: It's a separate property, you know.

02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:41.280
[Amit Varma]: So do you see that as a structural flaw?

02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:45.080
[Amit Varma]: Does the BCCI really take women's cricket that seriously?

02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:47.080
[Amit Varma]: What's your sense?

02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:49.080
[Guest]: This is an interesting line of thinking

02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:52.080
[Guest]: and it's something that the cricket historian

02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:55.080
[Guest]: in the UK, Raf Nicholson, has researched quite a bit.

02:43:55.280 --> 02:44:00.080
[Guest]: She's actually, I think, doing something close to a thesis

02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:04.080
[Guest]: on how women's sport has fared

02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:07.080
[Guest]: after it kind of got absorbed by the ruling

02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:08.880
[Guest]: existing men's body.

02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:10.880
[Guest]: And like I've said, there are a lot of things

02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:12.880
[Guest]: that, you know, change for the better

02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:15.880
[Guest]: and there are some things that change for the worse.

02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:18.880
[Guest]: In terms of incentives, if you really go that cold,

02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:21.880
[Guest]: I'm trying to put my passion for women's cricket aside.

02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:25.880
[Guest]: Think about it in terms of a commercial property.

02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:27.880
[Guest]: Think about it in terms of, you know,

02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:29.880
[Guest]: can this earn me revenue?

02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:33.880
[Guest]: Is it worth putting in X amount of money

02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:37.680
[Guest]: and will I get greater than X back?

02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:39.680
[Guest]: Initially, no.

02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:41.680
[Guest]: Initially, it's going to be something that requires

02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:43.680
[Guest]: a lot of investment of time and money to grow.

02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:46.680
[Guest]: But the potential of women's cricket as a property,

02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:49.680
[Guest]: I think, is something that people are missing

02:44:49.880 --> 02:44:53.680
[Guest]: and you have to kind of think about it

02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:56.680
[Guest]: in terms of doubling your base

02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:01.680
[Guest]: rather than, you know, draining your resources.

02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:04.480
[Guest]: So if one thinks about it like that,

02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:07.480
[Guest]: we've seen how women's sport has just grown

02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:09.480
[Guest]: into its own cash-generating,

02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:12.480
[Guest]: revenue-generating property in other sports.

02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:15.480
[Guest]: We've seen the success of the women's Big Bash League.

02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:18.480
[Guest]: We've seen the popularity of the US

02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:20.480
[Guest]: national women's football team.

02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:23.480
[Guest]: We've seen PV Sindhu as, you know,

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.480
[Guest]: a female sport icon, although team sport,

02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:27.480
[Guest]: I'll probably, should probably take more examples

02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:29.480
[Guest]: from team sport.

02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:32.280
[Guest]: But there is enough to suggest,

02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:34.280
[Guest]: like we saw with the IPL,

02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:36.280
[Guest]: where sponsors came on for just,

02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:38.280
[Guest]: which essentially exhibition matches.

02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:41.280
[Guest]: There is enough to suggest that there is value

02:45:41.480 --> 02:45:43.280
[Guest]: in putting in this investment for 4 or 5 years.

02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:46.280
[Guest]: There are incentives to put in that investment

02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:47.280
[Guest]: for 4 or 5 years.

02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:49.280
[Guest]: Think about it from an IPL team.

02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:51.280
[Guest]: Okay, suppose an IPL team wants to,

02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:53.280
[Guest]: or, you know, what are the incentives

02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:55.280
[Guest]: for an IPL team to start a women's cricket team?

02:45:55.280 --> 02:46:00.080
[Guest]: One is that IPL is only a 2-month-a-year property.

02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:02.080
[Guest]: If you can double that for a small investment,

02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:04.080
[Guest]: getting involved with a women's IPL

02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:05.080
[Guest]: will require a smaller investment

02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:06.080
[Guest]: than it was for a men's investment.

02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:09.080
[Guest]: You're doubling your branding suddenly

02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:11.080
[Guest]: because if you have a women's IPL,

02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:12.080
[Guest]: even if it's a 1-month tournament

02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:14.080
[Guest]: separate from the men's IPL window,

02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:16.080
[Guest]: suddenly from 2 months of visibility,

02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:17.080
[Guest]: you've got 3 months of visibility.

02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:19.080
[Guest]: I think those are the incentives that exist

02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:22.080
[Guest]: if you choose to see them,

02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:24.080
[Guest]: if you choose to look at them that way.

02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:26.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I completely agree with you

02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:28.880
[Amit Varma]: that women's cricket in the long run

02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:31.880
[Amit Varma]: is an enticing commercial prospect as well.

02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:33.880
[Amit Varma]: The worry just is that,

02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:35.880
[Amit Varma]: from the BCCI's point of view,

02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:37.880
[Amit Varma]: the whole focus will be men's cricket, IPL.

02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:39.880
[Amit Varma]: There's just so much money there

02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:41.880
[Amit Varma]: that they may not bother about this per se.

02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:44.880
[Amit Varma]: Whereas, you know, that's kind of the worry.

02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:46.880
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of final questions.

02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:48.880
[Amit Varma]: I know I've kept you talking for a long time.

02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:51.880
[Amit Varma]: A couple of sort of final questions.

02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:54.680
[Amit Varma]: One of the subjects on which you've written and spoken passionately

02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:57.680
[Amit Varma]: is the need for a women's IPL.

02:46:57.880 --> 02:46:59.680
[Amit Varma]: Elaborate on this a bit because,

02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:01.680
[Amit Varma]: for me, when the men's IPL happened,

02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:03.680
[Amit Varma]: and I remember there were critics of it before it started,

02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:05.680
[Amit Varma]: and I wrote a long piece in Crick Info,

02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:08.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of talking about the wonders it would do,

02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:10.680
[Amit Varma]: and even I underestimated them.

02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:13.680
[Amit Varma]: But the wonders were not just in a commercial sense.

02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:15.680
[Amit Varma]: I just felt that culturally it would have a big impact

02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:18.680
[Amit Varma]: in terms of giving many more players a livelihood,

02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:20.680
[Amit Varma]: making the field much more competitive

02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:22.480
[Amit Varma]: where you don't have the monopsony of the BCCI

02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:24.480
[Amit Varma]: as the only buyer for your services.

02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:26.480
[Amit Varma]: Within this artificial environment,

02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:29.480
[Amit Varma]: you have eight people competing to get talented cricketers,

02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:31.480
[Amit Varma]: to build talented cricketers.

02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:34.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, instead of 10 people making a living from the game,

02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:38.480
[Amit Varma]: you have 100 people making that kind of living from the game.

02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:41.480
[Amit Varma]: So it just culturally, it kind of changed everything.

02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:45.480
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about what, you know, your case for a women's IPL.

02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:47.480
[Amit Varma]: Do you see a similar sort of thing happening

02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:49.480
[Amit Varma]: if it's just allowed to exist?

02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Because like I said, it would take a fraction

02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:53.280
[Amit Varma]: of the investment of the male IPL

02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:56.280
[Amit Varma]: and I'm pretty sure people would tune in.

02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:01.280
[Guest]: So just to finish off one point on the previous question,

02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:05.280
[Guest]: is that, you know, if the BCCI can almost have

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:07.280
[Guest]: a focus completely on men's cricket,

02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:10.280
[Guest]: it's not outlandish to for them, you know,

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:13.280
[Guest]: build up a dedicated women's cricket section

02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:16.280
[Guest]: and give them a budget and say,

02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:18.280
[Guest]: okay, we're not going to pay attention to you at all,

02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:20.080
[Guest]: you can do whatever you want,

02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:22.080
[Guest]: which would almost kind of be an ideal case scenario

02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:24.080
[Guest]: for many fans of women's cricket where, you know,

02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:27.080
[Guest]: you have a decision maker with some actual power

02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:29.080
[Guest]: using a budget given by the BCCI,

02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:31.080
[Guest]: which is kind of the best of both worlds.

02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:33.080
[Guest]: To come to the IPL question,

02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:37.080
[Guest]: many ways in which I think about a successful sports team

02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:41.080
[Guest]: is their value in terms of the broadcast market.

02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:44.080
[Guest]: What makes a successful sports team valuable?

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:46.080
[Guest]: What made the Indian women's cricket team

02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:49.880
[Guest]: suddenly a subject of interest and therefore a subject of commerce

02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:52.880
[Guest]: is that performance in a World Cup.

02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:55.880
[Guest]: Again, they kind of acted up with a performance

02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:58.880
[Guest]: where they reached the final of the 2020 World Cup

02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:03.880
[Guest]: and it must be acknowledged that

02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:09.880
[Guest]: when Australia established that record of 86,174 people

02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:12.880
[Guest]: in the MCG for a women's cricket final,

02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:17.680
[Guest]: a big part of that, well, a part of that for sure

02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:19.680
[Guest]: is the fact that India were their opposition.

02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:21.680
[Guest]: If New Zealand were their opposition,

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:24.680
[Guest]: would they have pulled in so many people? I'm not sure.

02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.680
[Guest]: So, which tells you that this Indian team,

02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:30.680
[Guest]: if it does well at a World Cup,

02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:34.680
[Guest]: becomes a big property, becomes a big financial property for you.

02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:37.680
[Guest]: Now, what will help the Indian team win a World Cup?

02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:40.680
[Guest]: We've seen the effect with the men's IPL

02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:43.480
[Guest]: on how it's impacted the performance,

02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:45.480
[Guest]: the international performances of the Indian team.

02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:48.480
[Guest]: That is one of the cases, that is one of the strongest cases

02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:52.480
[Guest]: for creating a women's IPL because it will help you win a World Cup.

02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:54.480
[Guest]: So, you're creating these other,

02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:57.480
[Guest]: maybe, you know, you're creating these other eight players in the system

02:49:57.680 --> 02:50:00.480
[Guest]: but it's going to help the big player get even stronger.

02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:04.480
[Guest]: One of the biggest cases where the incentives are just aligned

02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:08.480
[Guest]: to really make this absolutely happen,

02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:12.280
[Guest]: make it grow as fast as possible and make it the number one women's league in the world.

02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:16.280
[Guest]: The other impacts of the IPL, like we've seen,

02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:19.280
[Guest]: are really the human stories that come out of the men's IPL.

02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:22.280
[Guest]: Where you have someone like a Varun Chakravarthy,

02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:24.280
[Guest]: almost given up cricket, working as an architect,

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:27.280
[Guest]: now IPL star, Indian team player.

02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:30.280
[Guest]: Within the Indian team itself, you have so many of those stories.

02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:34.280
[Guest]: You have Shikha Pandey, Air Force officer and Indian cricketer.

02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:36.280
[Guest]: You have someone like a Radha Yadav,

02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:43.080
[Guest]: whose father was a vegetable seller on literally like a footpath in Mumbai.

02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:47.080
[Guest]: And now, you know, through the money that she's earned for the Indian team,

02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:49.080
[Guest]: they're able to afford a flat in Mumbai.

02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:56.080
[Guest]: Those kind of stories and the potential for those stories to effect actual social change.

02:50:56.280 --> 02:51:00.080
[Guest]: Because you are talking about women in India.

02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:03.080
[Guest]: You are talking about a group which has its own challenges,

02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:07.880
[Guest]: own social restrictions or own social obstacles.

02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:09.880
[Guest]: And we've seen that.

02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:11.880
[Guest]: I mean, this is a concept that my brothers and I talk about.

02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:17.880
[Guest]: It's very often in a lifetime hard to jump up one's socioeconomic class.

02:51:18.080 --> 02:51:19.880
[Guest]: The class that you are almost born into.

02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:21.880
[Guest]: Cricket is a vehicle that allows that.

02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:23.880
[Guest]: Cricket is a vehicle that allows you,

02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:25.880
[Guest]: because of the popularity in the country

02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:28.880
[Guest]: and because of the money associated with the IPL, it allows that.

02:51:29.080 --> 02:51:30.880
[Guest]: And I want to hear more stories like that.

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:33.680
[Guest]: I mean, that's my case for a women's IPL.

02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:38.680
[Guest]: I want to hear more stories where Shafali Verma was able to pay for her father

02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:40.680
[Guest]: to fly out of the country for the first time.

02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:43.680
[Guest]: He is seeing suddenly the world in a whole new light.

02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:47.680
[Guest]: That entire generation is just exposed to something completely different

02:51:47.880 --> 02:51:49.680
[Guest]: because of what she's done.

02:51:49.880 --> 02:51:54.680
[Guest]: That's the social change that I want to be effected through a women's IPL.

02:51:54.880 --> 02:51:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Final question.

02:51:56.880 --> 02:51:59.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, one way of kind of transforming women's cricket

02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:02.480
[Amit Varma]: is through top-down action of the kind we've been mentioning,

02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:04.480
[Amit Varma]: that the BCCI get its act together.

02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:06.480
[Amit Varma]: And even if they have a separate department,

02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:10.480
[Amit Varma]: I think it's kind of a little bit of luck that who will they have in charge there.

02:52:10.680 --> 02:52:13.480
[Amit Varma]: Will it be a politician or will it be someone from within the game

02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:16.480
[Amit Varma]: who really cares about it, which is kind of uncontrollable.

02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:18.480
[Amit Varma]: But I totally get it.

02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:20.480
[Amit Varma]: But one of the ways of driving that change is from the top-down.

02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:21.480
[Amit Varma]: The BCCI does things.

02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:24.480
[Amit Varma]: They put India A, all of that into place, all of that happens.

02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:27.480
[Amit Varma]: But the other is also from the bottom-up,

02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:30.280
[Amit Varma]: where there is a passion for the game that is coming from the grassroots.

02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:35.280
[Amit Varma]: More people are playing it and supply eventually meets that demand.

02:52:35.480 --> 02:52:37.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, clearly that wasn't the case,

02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:39.280
[Amit Varma]: say, even when you took up cricket,

02:52:39.480 --> 02:52:43.280
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that you point out about how so much of it is kind of happenstance,

02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:46.280
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, Shubhangi Kulkarni, Dana Edulji,

02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:49.280
[Amit Varma]: all the pieces kind of falling into place that took you wherever.

02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:52.280
[Amit Varma]: But cultural barriers, physical barriers,

02:52:52.480 --> 02:52:55.280
[Amit Varma]: like you talk in that report about how you didn't have changing rooms.

02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:58.080
[Amit Varma]: So after a, you know, gruelling session,

02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:00.080
[Amit Varma]: all the boys would just change their T-shirt and go home

02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:02.080
[Amit Varma]: and you'd be all sweaty and, you know,

02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:04.080
[Amit Varma]: you'd put on a jumper over what you were wearing

02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:08.080
[Amit Varma]: because you didn't want people in the local train to have to tolerate your sweat.

02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:12.080
[Amit Varma]: But now with the kind of the changing profile,

02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:15.080
[Amit Varma]: with the fact that people don't need to physically meet a Shubhangi Kulkarni

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:19.080
[Amit Varma]: when they can watch a Snehal Pradhan video on YouTube and get inspired by that.

02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:22.080
[Amit Varma]: Or they can even watch, like there's a charming talk show

02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:25.880
[Amit Varma]: that Smriti Mandana and I think Jemima Rodrigues too, you know,

02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:27.880
[Amit Varma]: and they can watch that and make them role models.

02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:30.880
[Amit Varma]: So do you feel that in terms of bottoms up,

02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:32.880
[Amit Varma]: something happening there,

02:53:33.080 --> 02:53:34.880
[Amit Varma]: that at least there things are changing,

02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:37.880
[Amit Varma]: that happenstance of that sort will no longer be so rare,

02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:39.880
[Amit Varma]: will no longer be so necessary?

02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:42.880
[Amit Varma]: And just people's approaches, you know,

02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:44.880
[Amit Varma]: whereas earlier parents who loved cricket

02:53:45.080 --> 02:53:46.880
[Amit Varma]: and wanted to live vicariously through their kids

02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:48.880
[Amit Varma]: might have sent their son to a coaching camp.

02:53:49.080 --> 02:53:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Today they'll send their daughter to a coaching camp.

02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:53.680
[Amit Varma]: So what's your sense of the change actually happening

02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:56.680
[Amit Varma]: in our society in that context?

02:53:56.880 --> 02:53:58.680
[Guest]: That's a really good question.

02:53:58.880 --> 02:54:01.680
[Guest]: It's probably one that I haven't really thought about before.

02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:03.680
[Guest]: But just thinking about it right now,

02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:07.680
[Guest]: I think about it about how it exists in men's cricket

02:54:07.880 --> 02:54:10.680
[Guest]: because that is what the situation is in men's cricket

02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:15.680
[Guest]: where the demand is just so much that supply arises.

02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:17.680
[Guest]: Then, you know, there are tennis ball tournaments

02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:21.480
[Guest]: organized at every little open space you can find

02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:23.480
[Guest]: because there are people playing tennis ball cricket there

02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:25.480
[Guest]: who say, let's make a tournament.

02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:28.480
[Guest]: So can we get to that point?

02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:32.480
[Guest]: Yes, I mean, in theory, yes,

02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:35.480
[Guest]: it will take a long time for bottom up change to happen.

02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:40.480
[Guest]: It will probably take an event like how it did for India.

02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:41.480
[Guest]: If you think about, you know,

02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:44.480
[Guest]: how men's cricket's current situation has developed,

02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:46.480
[Guest]: it's been slow cooked for 30 years.

02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:49.280
[Guest]: It's been slow cooked since 1983

02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:52.280
[Guest]: throughout the entire generation of Sachin Tendulkar worship.

02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:54.280
[Guest]: Now into the generation of, you know,

02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:57.280
[Guest]: a team that can go abroad and win.

02:54:57.480 --> 02:55:01.280
[Guest]: That's the kind of time I'm talking about that it will take.

02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:04.280
[Guest]: You never know, you know, there might be an incredible event.

02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:07.280
[Guest]: We, you know, we underestimate these kind of things.

02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:09.280
[Guest]: There might be an incredible event in women's cricket

02:55:09.480 --> 02:55:12.280
[Guest]: which just drives that almost overnight,

02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:15.280
[Guest]: you know, relatively speaking overnight.

02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:19.080
[Guest]: And then you might have, like you said,

02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:22.080
[Guest]: supply suddenly turning up because there is so much demand.

02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:26.080
[Guest]: I feel there is definitely a shift in terms of

02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:31.080
[Guest]: how the likes of Smriti Mandhana are such popular figures nowadays

02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:34.080
[Guest]: and the influence that they're having on the next generation

02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:37.080
[Guest]: is probably something we'll only understand once the generation grows up.

02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:39.080
[Guest]: So it's definitely possible.

02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:44.880
[Guest]: There are so many more ways for people to get into coaching, etc.

02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:47.880
[Guest]: and start on their first few steps of the journey.

02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:52.880
[Guest]: But the next few steps are still held by these institutions

02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:56.880
[Guest]: and therefore you might have more,

02:55:57.080 --> 02:55:58.880
[Guest]: the base of the pyramid does get wider,

02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:00.880
[Guest]: but then to move up the pyramid,

02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:02.880
[Guest]: you do have to move to a few fixed ladders.

02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:06.880
[Guest]: And that's where I'm a little worried,

02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:07.880
[Guest]: a little cynical about this

02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:11.680
[Guest]: because we've already seen this since the 2017 World Cup,

02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:13.680
[Guest]: cricket academies everywhere.

02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:15.680
[Guest]: I mean, just after the 2017 World Cup,

02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:17.680
[Guest]: so many girls turned up at cricket academies,

02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:20.680
[Guest]: but they don't yet have that many tournaments

02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:23.680
[Guest]: to really fill their appetite.

02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:27.680
[Guest]: And that's, I mean, thinking back to your conversation with Nandan and Joy,

02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:30.680
[Guest]: I think Nandan was also talking about

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:32.680
[Guest]: just creating these tournaments

02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:36.680
[Guest]: and how that really changes the ecosystem

02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:39.480
[Guest]: just by virtue of having more opportunities to play.

02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:42.480
[Guest]: I think that is where the demand already exists

02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:45.480
[Guest]: and the supply needs to step up.

02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:47.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I guess it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing

02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:48.480
[Amit Varma]: where the demand exists,

02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:50.480
[Amit Varma]: but it can't express itself in any particular way

02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:51.480
[Amit Varma]: because there's no supply.

02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:52.480
[Amit Varma]: If you had tournaments,

02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:55.480
[Amit Varma]: you would know how many people are really interested.

02:56:55.680 --> 02:56:57.480
[Amit Varma]: So I guess at some point,

02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:00.480
[Amit Varma]: it's up to creative entrepreneurs

02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:02.480
[Amit Varma]: and passionate crusaders like yourself

02:57:02.680 --> 02:57:04.480
[Amit Varma]: to kind of change that.

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:08.280
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, thanks a lot for giving me so much time on the show.

02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:09.280
[Amit Varma]: I'm really looking forward

02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:11.280
[Amit Varma]: not just to what happens in women's cricket,

02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:13.280
[Amit Varma]: but also your journey as a creator,

02:57:13.480 --> 02:57:15.280
[Amit Varma]: which is, I think, just so inspiring

02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:18.280
[Amit Varma]: in terms of the kind of output you put out.

02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:20.280
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to go and watch that video again

02:57:20.480 --> 02:57:22.280
[Amit Varma]: to kind of hit myself with it

02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:24.280
[Amit Varma]: and say, look how much she does in a day, you fool.

02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:25.280
[Amit Varma]: What are you doing?

02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:27.280
[Amit Varma]: So thanks so much, Snehal.

02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:28.280
