00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480
[Amit Varma]: One of the common certitudes of our species is that we know the world that we live in.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.600
[Amit Varma]: I would argue that not only do we not know it, we don't even see it.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.880
[Amit Varma]: All of us exist in a bubble of our own, surrounded by infinite invisible worlds.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: If we are in a car in a traffic jam, the beggar at the signal or the hawkers on the pavement

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.120
[Amit Varma]: may be invisible to us, the waiters at the restaurants we dine at, the domestic help

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.320
[Amit Varma]: around us, the building watchmen, all invisible.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.640
[Amit Varma]: If we are men, we do not see the extra layer of awareness all women carry, such as when

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.760
[Amit Varma]: a stranger walks in their direction on the footpath or when they enter a lift filled

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.040
[Amit Varma]: with other people.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.960
[Amit Varma]: The exact construction of our bubble changes from moment to moment, but there are always

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.760
[Amit Varma]: things we do not see, and often things we choose not to see.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.780
[Amit Varma]: Defining ourselves by identities of happenstance, we divide the world into categories based

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.880
[Amit Varma]: on class, religion, caste, gender, nationality, and so on.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: We wear these identities like straight jackets, restricting ourselves and the better angels

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
[Amit Varma]: of our nature.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.160
[Amit Varma]: But one thing that can temporarily make us forget these barriers we have built is art.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.880
[Amit Varma]: We can all be transported by a beautiful image or get lost in a piece of music, and then

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.360
[Amit Varma]: the divisions between us don't matter.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.440
[Amit Varma]: But even that art may be shaped by those divisions.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.200
[Amit Varma]: And in any case, when the music stops, we are back to being our narrow parochial selves.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.560
[Amit Varma]: It is a rare artist who, even after the song is over, can continue to peel back the layers

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560
[Amit Varma]: of the unseen.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:45.800
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.800
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.560
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a remarkable TM Krishna, who is not just a legend of the Carnatic music

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.440
[Amit Varma]: world, but also a fearless public intellectual who has spoken out repeatedly over the years

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.040
[Amit Varma]: against the very structures of power that he himself benefited from, the orthodoxies

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.120
[Amit Varma]: of Brahmanism and patriarchy.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.960
[Amit Varma]: TM has written numerous books, most recently Sebastian and Sons, and is arguably one of

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.480
[Amit Varma]: India's most powerful voices today, in the context of his art, an uplifting voice, and

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.880
[Amit Varma]: in the context of his politics, a discordant voice.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And honestly, in these times, we need both.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.240
[Amit Varma]: Before I begin my conversation with him, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.120
[Amit Varma]: If you're listening to The Scene and the Unseen, it means you like listening to audio and you're

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.640
[Amit Varma]: thirsty for knowledge.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.920
[Amit Varma]: That being the case, I'd urge you to check out Storytel, the sponsors of this episode.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.440
[Amit Varma]: Storytel is an audiobook platform that has a massive range of audiobooks from around

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.440
[Amit Varma]: the world.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.640
[Amit Varma]: Their international collection is stellar, but so is a local collection.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.360
[Amit Varma]: They have a fantastic range of Marathi and Hindi audiobooks.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.080
[Amit Varma]: What's more, I do a weekly podcast there called The Book Club with Amit Verma, in which I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.960
[Amit Varma]: talk about one book every week, giving context, giving you a taste of it, and so on.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.160
[Amit Varma]: Download that app and listen to my show.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.440
[Amit Varma]: And as long as Storytel sponsors this show within this commercial itself, I will recommend

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.680
[Amit Varma]: an audiobook that I liked on that platform every week.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040
[Amit Varma]: My recommendation for this week is The Complete Sherlock Holmes.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.840
[Amit Varma]: This is comfort food for me, whether I read it or listen to it, which you now can on Storytel.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.320
[Amit Varma]: The Complete Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.200
[Amit Varma]: Download the Storytel app or visit Storytel.com.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.800
[Amit Varma]: Remember that Storytel with a single L. Storytel.com.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.240
[Amit Varma]: TM, welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Lovely to be here, Amit.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, you know, before we start talking about your book or about your music or about

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.640
[Amit Varma]: your politics, let's kind of go back to how you started as a musician, like you were a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.040
[Amit Varma]: bit of a child prodigy, weren't you?

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.040
[Amit Varma]: I like the word prodigy.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.000
[Guest]: So, you know, my home was a home of Carnatic music, definitely, of Bharatanatyam, all these

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.400
[Guest]: arts.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.760
[Guest]: But we are a business family.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.920
[Guest]: My dad was a business person.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.000
[Guest]: So we're not a family of musicians like we usually hear about in India.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.360
[Guest]: But at the age of four or five, apparently I showed some talent, I used to hum the tunes

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.880
[Guest]: my mother used to sing.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.160
[Guest]: My mother herself was a trained vocalist, not on the professional stage, but she was

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.520
[Guest]: formally trained.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.080
[Guest]: She did a graduation in music, actually, a post graduation in English.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.280
[Guest]: So so what happened was, I mean, I started singing when I was about five or six, formally.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.760
[Guest]: I never wanted to be a musician.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.680
[Guest]: You know, I grew up playing cricket on the streets, hated the music class thrice a week.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.600
[Guest]: Me, I'm a left hand batsman, I'm very proud of the fact that I'm a left hand batsman.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.800
[Guest]: So presumed that I'm naturally elegant, basically.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.800
[Guest]: So so I loved it.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800
[Guest]: I used to love to sing.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.280
[Guest]: There's one thing I never felt any inhibition.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.040
[Guest]: I know that you go to anybody's home and they say sing a song, I would just belt it out.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.960
[Guest]: So that was one thing I was I was quite fearless about singing.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.240
[Guest]: But I never thought I'd be a musician.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.720
[Guest]: You know, I got to school, 10th grader, I was economics, I want to be an economist.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.240
[Guest]: And that was my big dream.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.240
[Amit Varma]: My God, you could have been on the show talking about something else entirely.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.240
[Guest]: How horrible the show would have been.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.360
[Guest]: So I must tell you what Amartya Sen told me when I told him, he said, thank God.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.000
[Guest]: He feared the competition would go down.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.880
[Guest]: I couldn't have tolerated another economist in the world, probably.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.760
[Guest]: But you know, I want to be an economist.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.600
[Guest]: And I had this whole plan in my head, you know, Delhi School, LSE, as if they're going

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.240
[Guest]: to call me and invite me.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.840
[Guest]: But anyway.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.440
[Guest]: But I started performing when I was about 12, my first concert was when I was 12.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.560
[Guest]: And you know, people thought I was talented.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.040
[Guest]: And yes, he has a bright big voice, young guy sings without any fear.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.040
[Guest]: All that was there.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.160
[Guest]: And I was within the world of Carnatic music.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.680
[Guest]: And I was within the power structures, my, you know, my uncle was the president of the

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.120
[Guest]: Music Academy in Chennai, which is like one of the premier institutions.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.040
[Guest]: And you descended from T.D. Krishnamachari, you actually started the academy.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.380
[Guest]: Yes, T.D. Krishnamachari is one of the founders, and he is my grand uncle.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.000
[Guest]: So yeah, so I come from within the power structures of high art, whatever that is.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.760
[Guest]: And therefore, even so, then I started taking it more seriously.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.160
[Guest]: And I think it was about 92, 91, when I had a series of concerts, and I remember a lot

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.080
[Guest]: of senior musicians and colleagues, young people coming and telling me, you should take

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.040
[Guest]: this seriously, what are you doing?

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.720
[Guest]: That's when it struck me that, okay, maybe this is something I should be doing.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.720
[Amit Varma]: And you're like 15, 16.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.400
[Guest]: Yeah, I'm just getting into college.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.000
[Guest]: And when I went into college, my undergrads in economics, of course, and by the second

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.200
[Guest]: year, I was singing concerts a bit here and there.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.400
[Guest]: And people said, okay, there's this kid who can, you know, sing, I had to make a choice

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.080
[Guest]: whether it's music or whether it is economics.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.480
[Guest]: And, you know, I come from all the privileges in the world, I looked, I went to my dad and

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.000
[Guest]: said, I want, he said, do what you want, and I'll support you.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.960
[Guest]: That's when I took the plunge to become a singer.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.760
[Guest]: And then things just kind of rolled, opportunities came by.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.680
[Guest]: There was this association formed in 1985 called Youth Association for Classical Music.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.200
[Guest]: It's very interesting that young people who are interested in Carnatic music formed this

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.600
[Guest]: organization because in the 80s, there was this whole thing that Carnatic music is dying.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.760
[Guest]: It's all old people stuff.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.760
[Guest]: There are no young people singing, no young people listening.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.760
[Guest]: What do we do?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.040
[Guest]: The truth of the way young people who are willing to sing, they never got opportunities.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.120
[Guest]: You know, in India, the grayer you get, the more intelligent you're presumed or more talented

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120
[Guest]: you're presumed.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.320
[Guest]: And so these guys did something quite remarkable for its time.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.480
[Guest]: They said, you know what, we will organize concerts only for young people below the age

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480
[Guest]: of 30.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.480
[Guest]: Wow.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.920
[Guest]: And those were days when there were no sponsorships.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.200
[Guest]: So for the first time, they went to corporates and got like 500 rupees, 1000.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.280
[Guest]: So I became a member there later.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.720
[Guest]: And then all that.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.200
[Guest]: So we had a community where you could talk about a raga and a thala, which is not a cool

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.120
[Guest]: thing to do in school, right?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.280
[Guest]: But I think all that was part of growing up for me and my interest in jamming with people,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.280
[Guest]: you know.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.720
[Amit Varma]: So there's a lot of fun, I must say.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.440
[Amit Varma]: And there seem to be have been two other journeys you've been on.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.440
[Amit Varma]: One, of course, as a scholar, where you've all studied the history of the music and kind

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.840
[Amit Varma]: of looked at all of that, a scholar-cum-historian, so to say.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.800
[Amit Varma]: And two, of course, there's politics.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.800
[Amit Varma]: How did these two sort of evolve?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.400
[Amit Varma]: Like, initially, like, you know, you said you were going to be an economist and then,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, you decided that, fine, these concerts are being received well.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.240
[Amit Varma]: So was it partly that the concerts are being received well, or did you just love the music

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.160
[Amit Varma]: enough to say, this is what I want to do and nothing else?

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160
[Amit Varma]: Come on, it's both.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a bit of both.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.360
[Amit Varma]: Of course, you love the stage.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.560
[Amit Varma]: You love the applause.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.920
[Amit Varma]: And when is the tendency towards, A, the scholarship, figuring out what the history of this is and

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.040
[Amit Varma]: figuring out what is behind all of this come from?

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And B, is that what then led to the politics?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.840
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, most of this is like, post facto kind of understanding how the movement took

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.840
[Guest]: place.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.200
[Guest]: Because honestly, I think many of these moments just take place, and you're in the flow of

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.200
[Guest]: it.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.760
[Guest]: And it's, I don't believe it's ever a moment.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.200
[Guest]: I think the moment we talk about is a moment when you realize it.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.360
[Guest]: It's already happening in its background.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.480
[Guest]: So I think it's, it starts with my home and my school.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.640
[Guest]: In terms of how I grew up in, at home and school, there was nothing that was taboo.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.280
[Guest]: You could talk about anything, you could ask any question.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.080
[Guest]: And so there was this definitely Catholicity at home and open speaking.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:32.320
[Guest]: My school was a school that came from J. Krishnamurti's philosophy, where it was about asking questions.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.240
[Guest]: So you know, even the notion of how does one ask a question?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240
[Guest]: What is the question?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.000
[Guest]: You know, those are things discussed in school, you know.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.800
[Guest]: So I think that plays, these two places play a very important role in what happened to

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.640
[Guest]: me later, because they kept me open, they kept me in check.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.400
[Guest]: And see, once I started performing, and opportunities came by, I mean, it's a drug.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest]: It's like being high always.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.040
[Guest]: I mean, when somebody comes, you know, whether you're young or, you know, someone says that

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.360
[Guest]: you're like incredible, I mean, you have incredible talent.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.840
[Guest]: And they keep telling you that you just love it, you love the audience.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.680
[Guest]: In fact, if the applause is not enough, it bothers you.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.560
[Guest]: And then as a musician, you will do something to get that thunderous applause.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.640
[Guest]: And I always tell my students, you know, when do you really practice, for example, you know,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.640
[Guest]: we say sadhana and all that, riyaz, whatever.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.080
[Guest]: The truth is most of the times when we are practicing at home, we hear the applause.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080
[Guest]: Really?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.320
[Guest]: Yeah, of course.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.920
[Guest]: So it's fascinating how it works, like you're singing at home, and you finished a phrase,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.480
[Guest]: and you can actually hear it in your head, because you're dreaming of it the next day

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.440
[Guest]: on stage.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.840
[Guest]: So can you cut yourself off that and actually really practice?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.200
[Guest]: These are all very interesting challenges that I think artists go through.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.560
[Guest]: And so I went through this, I was extremely ambitious guy who just want to be at the top.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.840
[Guest]: My wife will vouch for my ambitiousness and my cutthroatness.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.560
[Guest]: So I want to say this, because it's not like, you know, I've always been like this and asking

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560
[Guest]: these questions.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.460
[Guest]: No, I've had this whole right where I just didn't care a shit, that's the truth.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:15.200
[Guest]: But I think what happened after a while is I kind of figured out how to be successful

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.200
[Guest]: as an artist.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.080
[Guest]: And that's can be a good feeling and a bad feeling.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.000
[Guest]: The good feeling is because you can then belt out successful concerts, you know what you

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.440
[Guest]: need to add to your repertoire, add to your skill set to keep moving ahead.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.480
[Guest]: But then I think something happened missing, is this all this is about?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.120
[Guest]: You know, is this all music is about?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.960
[Guest]: I mean, is it just the fact that I can please X number of people, I know how to please them

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.280
[Guest]: again and again and again, I'm going to do this all my life.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.040
[Guest]: So I loved it.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.200
[Guest]: But that question did come up in my head.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.900
[Guest]: And I think that's when I started diving into history.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.760
[Guest]: So you know, even questions like, you know, what was music like 100 years ago?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.400
[Guest]: What was it like 150 years ago?

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.000
[Guest]: Was it different?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.680
[Guest]: And once I started doing that, and I did some research and we did some archival work, I

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.680
[Guest]: was in for a shock.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680
[Guest]: And around what time?

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.160
[Guest]: It was about 2002, 2003.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.160
[Guest]: Around that period of time.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.440
[Amit Varma]: So you're about 26, 27 at this time.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.280
[Guest]: And then we started doing this research and this archival work and this reading up, I

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.880
[Guest]: started reading treatises.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.280
[Guest]: I started bothering scholars with questions on Sanskrit on what does this word mean in

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.360
[Guest]: this in Natya Shastra, it's in Brihadeshi, what does this mean in Matanga, I said this,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.440
[Guest]: you know, all these crazy things.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.200
[Guest]: And I spent a lot of time trying to understand it with my limited abilities.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200
[Guest]: I did.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.760
[Guest]: I think that's when a lot of things hit me, you know, about history, about everything

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.640
[Guest]: being old, that we are somewhere continuing something that was preciously given to us

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.160
[Guest]: 2000 years ago.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.280
[Guest]: All these things became question marks for me, first musically, had nothing to do with

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.560
[Guest]: society or politics, just aesthetically.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.360
[Guest]: So what is this I'm carrying forward, you know, Amit, you know, I believe I'm a carrier

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360
[Guest]: of Indian culture.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.000
[Guest]: You know, especially if you're in the classical world, you believe somehow you represent this

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.960
[Guest]: incredible idea of India.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.680
[Guest]: And this has been sold by us to the world over for the last 70 odd years.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.960
[Guest]: So what am I really selling?

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.680
[Guest]: You are selling something, let's be very brutally honest, this is not some pristine thing that

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.560
[Guest]: you're putting, you're selling it.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.720
[Guest]: So what am I selling?

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.840
[Guest]: Do I mean, and I believe it.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.160
[Guest]: So what am I holding on to?

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.640
[Guest]: What are these notions of this antiquity, the sense of purity, sense of something that's

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:31.520
[Guest]: unchanged, that, you know, people just handed over like this precious ceramic piece of art

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.040
[Guest]: that you can't even crack or modify.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.200
[Guest]: So all these questions started appearing and then some of the things that I thought that

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.320
[Guest]: music was like, I thought today if somebody sang like that, it would sound horrible.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.440
[Guest]: So I'm like, so what is beautiful?

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:53.040
[Guest]: You know, we look at certain colors, certain designs, and we say, that's Indian beauty.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.280
[Guest]: But what is that?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.560
[Guest]: What construction is that?

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.360
[Guest]: So I think all this started, the moment this started, within a few years, and I can tell

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.560
[Guest]: you that I never wrote a book for a long time.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.840
[Guest]: You know, I was just doing this because I have an OCD, I get obsessive on something,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840
[Guest]: I'll just keep doing it.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840
[Guest]: So I just kept doing it.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.840
[Guest]: And I was not doing a PhD or anything, I was just doing it because I was just fascinated

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.200
[Guest]: by what was happening to me and to my understanding and learning.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.680
[Amit Varma]: And did it sort of help that this is also the time when the internet is taking off,

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.160
[Amit Varma]: so you have a lot of sources online or you didn't have so many then?

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.480
[Guest]: I, well, early 2000, not so much.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.360
[Guest]: But I think through the years, it did help.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.360
[Guest]: But a lot of my sources then were actually the texts and actually scholars, I used to

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.240
[Guest]: go call them at 10 o'clock in the night, spend one hour talking to them.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.440
[Guest]: They were very kind people, putting up with this young guy who was asking this question

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.440
[Guest]: who knew nothing.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.760
[Guest]: You know, but the first impact of all this happened in the way I was singing.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.000
[Guest]: And I, very naturally, I started fiddling around with the idea of the performance.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.720
[Guest]: Every art practice has a performative, a form.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.860
[Guest]: And we should realize that the form is a reflection of the art, right?

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.280
[Guest]: But after a point of time, that performative becomes the solidified notion of the art,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280
[Guest]: right?

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.040
[Guest]: So slowly, I started playing with the performative, you know, because I felt, you know, if it's

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.800
[Guest]: all just about the way I design something and offer it package and give it to you, then

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800
[Guest]: it's just so simple.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.920
[Guest]: It can't be.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.880
[Guest]: So that was a moment when I started, my music started changing.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.400
[Guest]: I didn't notice it.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.600
[Guest]: I didn't notice it was changing.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.720
[Guest]: The audience didn't notice it.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.240
[Guest]: They didn't see anything radical.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.520
[Guest]: I had not like made a big shift for a long time.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.080
[Guest]: But after a point, I knew I was listening differently, you know, I was, I was looking

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.860
[Guest]: at a concert differently.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.040
[Guest]: So that's where it began.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.280
[Guest]: But the moment all this happens, I think you're also asking questions of society, of people

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.540
[Guest]: who's singing this, you know, who was singing it.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.120
[Guest]: When they sang it, how did it sound?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.940
[Guest]: So when you ask these questions, then you're automatically asking political questions.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.440
[Guest]: And first of all, you're asking these questions of yourself.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:09.000
[Guest]: So I must tell you that it is not like these ideas of caste or anything were in my any

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.480
[Guest]: part of the horizon for a long time.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.040
[Guest]: It is a word I never used in my life.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:20.840
[Guest]: You know, it is even in the most democratic, open home of mine, caste was never discussed.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.400
[Guest]: That's the fact.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:30.360
[Guest]: It came only because of this kind of confusions and all these struggles that were happening.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.600
[Guest]: And that's when identity became gender, all these questions started appearing in my view.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.360
[Amit Varma]: And people often have the view that in contrast with other kinds of music, and I'm sort of

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.120
[Amit Varma]: I don't know Carnatic music very well.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.440
[Amit Varma]: So the listeners and you will have to forgive me if I say something hopelessly naive.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.960
[Amit Varma]: But it's often looked at as something that is very rigid, and that has become ossified

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.240
[Amit Varma]: through the years.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.800
[Amit Varma]: Is that rigidity also a consequence of what's happening in in the background socially?

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.440
[Guest]: Okay, first of all, like burst the bubble of Hindustani musicians, they are also ossified

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.440
[Guest]: and rigid.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.320
[Guest]: It's just a notion of rigidity and ossification is different.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.160
[Guest]: Okay, so I have to put it out there.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.720
[Guest]: So the point is, I think it's true.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.720
[Guest]: Yes.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.960
[Guest]: So without going into the idea of rigidity and what it means, I think there is definitely

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:25.440
[Guest]: this, it becomes crusty, no doubt, whether it is Hindustani music, or that's also because

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.560
[Guest]: of what we think it represents, I think that's a very important aspect we should think about.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.120
[Guest]: Why is it ossified?

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.120
[Guest]: Why is it crusty?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.840
[Guest]: Because we believe that in that form, it symbolizes something.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.200
[Guest]: And we're more interested in the symbol than the art.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.000
[Guest]: That's the point of the performative.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.280
[Guest]: So the performative becomes the symbol of identifying something about India, something

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.000
[Guest]: about our sound, Nada, you know, all these notions, and you know, whether you believe

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.200
[Guest]: in it or not, is a different issue altogether.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.680
[Guest]: So we want that symbol to remain.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.180
[Guest]: And we believe that any movement there kind of demolishes the symbol, and we've created

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.400
[Guest]: this symbol.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.800
[Guest]: And there's no doubt that all that has played a role in keeping something unquestioned.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.920
[Guest]: And I want to say something, people may say that no, no, no, but certain things have changed

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.140
[Guest]: in the last 60 years, neither Kerala, neither Carnatic music is the same, true.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.520
[Guest]: So the question is, what do you allow to be questioned?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.920
[Guest]: What don't you allow to be questioned?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.300
[Guest]: That's society does brilliantly, right?

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.560
[Guest]: We know what can change, I can probably change a raga, I can introduce a new raga, I can

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.480
[Guest]: do something, all these are surface level operations, right?

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.680
[Guest]: Because after a point, a musician should be able to do this.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.680
[Guest]: But then what about the fundamentals of what the music itself represents?

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.240
[Guest]: What are the non-negotiables in your, in your idea of the music?

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:46.040
[Guest]: You ask those questions, those are political questions, and those questions will never

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:51.360
[Guest]: be asked, especially of the so-called classical, I call them the so-called classicals, because

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:59.960
[Guest]: you believe that you are the moral, ethical, aesthetic identity of what is Indian culture.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.200
[Guest]: Everything else plays around.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.480
[Amit Varma]: So you know, so when you start figuring this stuff out, like one, I think it's almost then,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.760
[Amit Varma]: if I read it correctly, an act of rebellion and changing the music itself, because that

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.560
[Amit Varma]: itself is a political statement, by changing the way you perform, you're questioning the

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of existing structures.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:24.120
[Amit Varma]: But what it also strikes me is that what must be very difficult about figuring out the politics

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.920
[Amit Varma]: behind all of it, how these entrenched caste structures have played a part, the damage

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.520
[Amit Varma]: that they've done to society in general, the privileging of the classical over the non-classical,

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.880
[Amit Varma]: all of this, you're also questioning yourself and your own place, because you are a product

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.880
[Amit Varma]: of all this privilege.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.320
[Amit Varma]: You are at the centre of it, you are this.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.760
[Amit Varma]: How hard was that process, like, it must be so tempting to say, you know, everything has

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.760
[Amit Varma]: its own place.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.720
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just, you know, art is by itself.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.080
[Amit Varma]: And all of this doesn't matter.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.320
[Guest]: And, you know, well, it was very difficult, especially in the beginning, because there

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.440
[Guest]: was a time period when I was worried I will lose the music.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:06.760
[Guest]: Because my question was, if everything is so political, if everything is so entrenched

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:14.000
[Guest]: in ugliness of sorts, then is there anything to this at all?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:22.200
[Guest]: You know, should I be saying aha, or is saying aha itself an act of violence, for example,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.000
[Guest]: in the sense that am I saying aha, because I am doing that out of habituation of reiteration

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.280
[Guest]: of identities, or is the aha beyond that?

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.640
[Guest]: You know, you can't really say, honestly, you can't really say.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:39.440
[Guest]: So there was a point I was saying, suppose after this whole exercise, I don't feel the

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.440
[Guest]: music anymore.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440
[Guest]: What do I do?

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.720
[Guest]: And that was very real.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:49.120
[Guest]: That feeling, that fear was real, because I knew if I push honestly, I could get to

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.200
[Guest]: a point where everything in this music sounds ugly to me.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.560
[Guest]: Because I believe I've said everything is social, everything is political, everything

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.600
[Guest]: is discriminative.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.400
[Guest]: So the whole thing is then collapses, right, in my own emotional and psychological world.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.760
[Guest]: That fear I did have.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.280
[Guest]: Were there moments when it happened?

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:12.800
[Guest]: No, I think what's what saved me if you want to use that expression, I won't use that expression,

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:21.200
[Guest]: is that there were moments in the music still, where I believed that that sound somehow at

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:29.360
[Guest]: least temporarily made me see the ugliness with greater clarity.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.760
[Guest]: So I said, okay, maybe it could be Amit that I'm creating this whole thing.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.200
[Guest]: Okay, what I'm telling you right now, it could be, I'm not a psychologist, I'm not a person

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.680
[Guest]: who can judge that.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.080
[Guest]: But there were moments when I said, the clarity with which I could see the ugliness because

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.400
[Guest]: I was singing, or I was listening to the music, I was not having a discourse, I'm just singing,

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:55.600
[Guest]: I'm singing a raga, and then pop for about five minutes, there is greater clarity.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.520
[Guest]: I said, okay, if the sound can give me that, maybe there is some truth to it.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.120
[Guest]: Maybe there is something that is truth to art, that it can really move across it.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120
[Guest]: But we can't hold on to it.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.960
[Guest]: There is something that drags us back into who we are.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:14.920
[Guest]: So that's what gave me hope that, okay, I can still sing, I can still feel, and I can

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.660
[Guest]: still say I'm ugly.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.120
[Guest]: So what I thought was a contradiction, then moved away from becoming a contradiction became

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.640
[Guest]: more real, that these things always exist together, the profound and the profane are

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.640
[Guest]: not opposites.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.920
[Guest]: They are constantly with each other.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.120
[Guest]: And they're truly real, when in a way, you feel both.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.120
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.840
[Amit Varma]: So, I mean, this question about art is also something that I think is alive in other contexts,

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.820
[Amit Varma]: like is art something separate from itself from A, the social structures and the politics

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.000
[Amit Varma]: that have led to it and from B, from the artist, because more and more we find that we look

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.640
[Amit Varma]: back upon time and we say that, all right, these artists were accused of me too, should

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.160
[Amit Varma]: we read their books, or these artists were, you know, assaulters, or, you know, Neruda

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.600
[Amit Varma]: raped someone when he was whatever, should we read their work?

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.320
[Amit Varma]: And that becomes sort of a big question on the one hand, it seems to me that at this

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.560
[Amit Varma]: moment in time, if you sing a couple of notes, and it moves me in a particular way, my being

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.840
[Amit Varma]: moved by just the sound is something that is surely independent of where it is coming

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.840
[Amit Varma]: from.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.120
[Amit Varma]: So that art, that music per se stands apart.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.200
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, it's kind of, I mean, do you agree that it stands apart or do you

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200
[Amit Varma]: think that?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.760
[Guest]: I'll try and answer in two parts.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:39.160
[Guest]: So this notion of art for art's sake, you know, it's a very well used cliche.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:45.460
[Guest]: My problem with that, that construction is somehow inside that construction is a disassociation

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.000
[Guest]: with reality.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.440
[Guest]: That somehow with this bubble floating at 7000 meters up there, and we're all looking

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.740
[Guest]: at it in wonderment.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:00.520
[Guest]: But I'm saying suppose you redefine art in that statement and say art is reality with

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.280
[Guest]: all its layers.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.960
[Guest]: And whenever something has multiple layers, it's automatically profound.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.680
[Guest]: I'm not judging it, okay?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.000
[Guest]: When it is flat and literal, there is nothing else to it.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
[Guest]: Okay?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.880
[Guest]: When we make it a bubble, we're making it flat and literal, we're taking away the layers

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.880
[Guest]: of it.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.280
[Guest]: But when we say art is, we are in the studio having this conversation, art is not just

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.120
[Guest]: what I'm saying and what you're saying.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.380
[Guest]: It's about what you're evoking.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.420
[Guest]: It's about what the recorder is looking at.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.180
[Guest]: It's about what I see out of the window.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.640
[Guest]: It's about all the complexities that's going in my head and your head as we're having this

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.040
[Guest]: conversation beyond this room, then it becomes something so vibrant, right?

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.200
[Guest]: So I would like to trust that kind of art, okay?

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.000
[Guest]: It doesn't mean that art has to be, that has to be like overtly political.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.200
[Guest]: No, I'm not saying that.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.920
[Guest]: To your second question, that's, in fact, something I've struggled with.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.920
[Guest]: The artist and the art, you know, what does one do?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.320
[Guest]: And I don't have a correct answer to it.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:06.720
[Guest]: I tried grappling with it in a piece I wrote about Wagner, Tiagaraja, and about Polanski.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.880
[Guest]: Very three different reasons.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.440
[Guest]: And I want to bring Daniel Barenboim here.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.280
[Guest]: He's a very well-known Jewish conductor.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.320
[Guest]: And he did something which really impacted me, you know.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:24.320
[Guest]: So you know what Wagner's music represents, an anti-Semitic kind of history.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.280
[Guest]: And he's performing in Jerusalem.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:34.000
[Guest]: And Barenboim says he's going to perform Wagner with an audience of Jews.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.600
[Guest]: That was such a profound idea to me.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.120
[Guest]: Now, do we dissociate Wagner from the music?

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.840
[Guest]: Do we say Wagner is independent to what the historical impressions he leaves, and it's

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.280
[Guest]: just music?

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.040
[Guest]: But Barenboim does something interesting.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.800
[Guest]: He kind of conflates both.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:59.560
[Guest]: He brings the individual in, or what the individual represents in, and he says, I still want us

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.080
[Guest]: to hear it.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.480
[Guest]: Now what does this do to the experience?

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.520
[Guest]: I think that's where we have an interesting muddle.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.200
[Guest]: So do I not stop watching Roman Polanski?

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:19.520
[Guest]: No, but I'm saying if we can, in a way, keep that tension real between the horrible things

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:26.760
[Guest]: of the artist and the most moving things of the art produced or art object, then that

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.200
[Guest]: tension gives us a different experience.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.800
[Amit Varma]: So we can condemn what the artists read, but celebrate the art.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.680
[Guest]: At the same time, at the same time, I think, but we can't forget it.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.240
[Guest]: I'm saying at the same time, I have a problem if you say, you know, I don't care what kind

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240
[Guest]: of person the artist is.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.400
[Guest]: I'm not willing to do that.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.280
[Guest]: I'm saying you have to allow that tension to be there in your experience.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.280
[Guest]: It may change the way you experience the art.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.960
[Guest]: But if you say, I don't care about who the person, the artist is, I mean, that to me

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.400
[Guest]: is again another way of just brushing something under the carpet.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.880
[Guest]: So it's a complicated situation for which there's no absolute answer.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I find it evocative what you say about art being so complex with so many

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.640
[Amit Varma]: layers and that's what makes it beautiful.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.080
[Amit Varma]: But in modern times, what often happens is that politics looks for simple narratives

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.040
[Amit Varma]: and therefore embracing this complexity and accepting that dissonance, like you pointed

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.960
[Amit Varma]: out that on the one hand, there is the ugliness to deal with.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.280
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, there is all this beauty can get hard.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.880
[Amit Varma]: And a related question to that is when you when you were writing Sebastian and Sons,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:29.260
[Amit Varma]: for example, or whenever you've kind of looked back on history, how hard is it to not judge

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.720
[Amit Varma]: historical characters by contemporary morality?

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.200
[Amit Varma]: For example, some of the people in Sebastian and Sons like Vaidyanathan Iyer or later,

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, Palgatmani Iyer, where you write about Palgatmani Iyer, you can see how a lot

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.760
[Amit Varma]: of that entrenched Brahmanism is there in his behavior and the things he does.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.040
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, he has an extremely tender relationship with Parlandu who is his,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, chief maker.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost touching the sort of bond that they have.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.480
[Amit Varma]: So you know, and versions of this question can go back forever to Jefferson and his slave

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.840
[Unknown]: Sally Hemings and all the way.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:08.680
[Amit Varma]: So you know, when you look back at history, do you try to dissociate contemporary morality

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680
[Amit Varma]: with that?

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.720
[Amit Varma]: Or you say that, no, you know, there's also something useful in looking at the things

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720
[Guest]: they did with this lens.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.360
[Guest]: I mean, I think it's important to look at all this as a flow, okay, whatever direction

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360
[Guest]: it takes.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:27.760
[Guest]: I don't think it's correct to impose upon modern morality or modern ethical living,

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.180
[Guest]: because this is also a movement.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.760
[Guest]: We are not in some absolute position even today, right?

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:37.720
[Guest]: But at the same time, I think putting a lens on what happened is very, very important,

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.640
[Guest]: because the tendency for us is to say it was all then like this.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:49.980
[Guest]: And now we're all somehow perfect in some sense, you know, and I find that deeply disturbing.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:55.600
[Guest]: So when you put the lens on something behind, you're also saying, okay, but what does it

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.040
[Guest]: say about us now?

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:03.200
[Guest]: And what I like to do is also when I put the lens on history, to add some layer of nuance

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.040
[Guest]: into that, because Maneer is not a flat person.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:11.360
[Guest]: I mean, he's not like, you know, so as you said, there is this whole tenderness, there

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.000
[Guest]: is love, but there is hierarchy.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.920
[Guest]: There is this inability to accept the reality, inability to go beyond his own limitations.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:28.600
[Guest]: So that is interesting for me, because that is as real today as it was then.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600
[Amit Varma]: Because I am like that.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.600
[Amit Varma]: I'm no different.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.400
[Amit Varma]: I think we all like that in the sense that there are some things we can see and it's

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.760
[Amit Varma]: almost poignant that they're invisible to him.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.160
[Guest]: And there are so many things that must be invisible to you.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.160
[Guest]: Exactly the point.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.960
[Guest]: And which is why that lens is important.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.480
[Guest]: Can putting the lens on Maneer with the things that he was blind to somehow reflect upon

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.440
[Guest]: what are we blind to?

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.800
[Guest]: That is what I find interesting within that.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.520
[Guest]: It is not about the character itself.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.680
[Guest]: It's about the fact, okay, just to see if I'm, you know, if somebody read Sebastian

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.280
[Guest]: Sons and just see what you described as, you know, this tenderness, and they also see this,

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.760
[Guest]: can they think about themselves, you know, in some way, can I think about, I mean, I

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.760
[Amit Varma]: do that.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.760
[Guest]: Can they think about what they have normalized in their own lives?

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.760
[Guest]: Yes.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.800
[Guest]: That is the hope.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.360
[Guest]: That is truly the hope that that is why it makes sense looking at the past for me, at

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.000
[Guest]: least as a writer.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.320
[Guest]: Because then I think you can use those, because I don't think society in terms of how it operates

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.880
[Guest]: in frameworks has ever changed.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.040
[Guest]: The frameworks are always the same.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.720
[Guest]: It's the interior, the semantics and the structures that may vary.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.160
[Guest]: The basic framework is the same.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.560
[Guest]: So can we just shift the framework and say, so even in the book, when you see it move

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.520
[Guest]: through time, you will see that the framework is constantly there.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.480
[Guest]: It's just a negotiational table is changing, right?

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.400
[Guest]: So that is, for me, very important.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.120
[Amit Varma]: And for me, where your book also works is that it's not it is both a political and a

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.120
[Amit Varma]: non political book.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.560
[Amit Varma]: It's a political book, because of course, it is looking at all of these things that

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.160
[Amit Varma]: are happening, all of these power structures of Brahmanism is playing out how misogyny

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.400
[Amit Varma]: and patriarchy and all of those are playing out.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.520
[Amit Varma]: But what it also refreshingly does is that all of these people are humans to me, you

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.840
[Amit Varma]: know, I begin to feel that like someone like Mani Aiyar, where I both have enormous empathy

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.840
[Amit Varma]: for him.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, you feel like, okay, he's trapped in that, you know, he might be doing some

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.120
[Amit Varma]: things which we would not approve of today or do ourselves, but he's kind of trapped.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.720
[Amit Varma]: Before we sort of get to talking about the book, which is a very rich and interesting

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.000
[Amit Varma]: book.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.360
[Amit Varma]: For those of us who are not so familiar with it, which really includes me also, to an extent,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.880
[Amit Varma]: give us a summary of what you discovered about this world of Carnatic music about all the

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:41.800
[Amit Varma]: sort of the unexpected ugliness that lay behind the book, not through this book, particularly,

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800
[Guest]: but in general,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:50.280
[Guest]: You know, yeah, so, I mean, I grew up in the interiors of Carnatic music, okay.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.840
[Guest]: And I grew up in the interiors having the privilege of being an elite in the interior.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.120
[Guest]: So, you know, I had it all, you know, yeah, I mean, it's like, I was not a middle class

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.440
[Guest]: interior representative, I was an elite interior representative, you know, so I even looked

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.800
[Guest]: down upon the middle class structures within it, right?

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:15.080
[Guest]: You are the Karan Johar of Carnatic music, I'm gonna let that pass, but I will go on.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.800
[Guest]: But so, I lived it.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:24.120
[Guest]: I was definitely part of the power corridors.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.520
[Guest]: I probably still am, how much do I dissociate from it?

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.100
[Guest]: And that's, that's what I live with all my life.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.000
[Guest]: And so I did not see any of these things for a very long time.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.120
[Guest]: But then when all these, you know, internal churnings happened towards me, I mean, within

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.080
[Guest]: me, I think I was asking these questions of myself.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.000
[Guest]: You know, I was asking these questions of, you know, okay, what am I really representing?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
[Guest]: What am I really singing?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.160
[Guest]: And what is that, that pleasure that I'm getting from it, the moment that the ugliness I discovered

00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.000
[Guest]: and is not unique of Carnatic music, Carnatic music is my entry point, because that's, that's

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.520
[Guest]: all I knew.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:11.200
[Guest]: Just the fact of how patriarchy, how casteism are so normalized, I think that's the biggest

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.680
[Guest]: learning for me, that it's so normalized, there's a homogeneousness to it.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.760
[Guest]: And homogeneousness is in fact taken as a conditionality.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.780
[Guest]: You know, the kind of people who should come, where should this art be produced?

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.280
[Guest]: What is the ideal place that you should consume it?

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.080
[Guest]: How should the people there behave?

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.040
[Guest]: How should the women who come to the concert dress?

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.400
[Guest]: And how, what did my music class tell me about my identity?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:43.700
[Guest]: I had to, why was that the music class was not just about music, but it's about so many

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.200
[Guest]: things else and what was being conveyed to me, you know, all these like started hitting

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.200
[Guest]: me.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:55.920
[Guest]: And I realized that the entire world is a world of a certain homogeneous, upper caste

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.440
[Guest]: patriarchal structure.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.840
[Amit Varma]: And within this, we are celebrating Indian culture.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.920
[Guest]: And not just by default, there are rigidly enforced entry barriers, you know, it's very

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.360
[Guest]: important to understand how these entry barriers operate, you know, and they've operated in

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.200
[Guest]: different ways through time, again, when you go back to the past, but the barrier is still

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.200
[Guest]: there.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.880
[Guest]: It's these invisible screens, you know, it's, it's, everybody knows that.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.600
[Guest]: I mean, it's, there's this move, I always use this, I have used in reshaping art, there's

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.920
[Guest]: this Tamil movie called Kaka Muttai.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.040
[Guest]: And I would urge everybody to watch it.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.800
[Guest]: I think it's on Amazon Prime or something.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.240
[Guest]: And there is this scene, and the scene is this, the story is very simple.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.480
[Guest]: It's about these two kids, who a pizzeria is open in their locality, and they are kids

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.000
[Guest]: from a neighboring slum.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Guest]: And they want to get into pizzeria, and the watchman looks at them and throws them out.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.080
[Guest]: So they then decide they need better clothes.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.520
[Guest]: And if they wear better clothes, they'll be allowed in.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.640
[Guest]: So they decide to go to a mall.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:00.880
[Guest]: So they go to this, two kids go and they turn the, you know, just turn the end of the road

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.880
[Guest]: and they see the mall and one, they're brothers, one of them looks at the other and said, oh,

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.280
[Guest]: I said, they're going to let us in.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.460
[Guest]: You know, nobody has said they can't enter the mall.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.720
[Guest]: The kids have seen the mall, and they've decided that they're not going to be allowed in.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.420
[Guest]: So this is what we should understand with great care.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.840
[Guest]: So these designs are always there.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.640
[Guest]: We design society to decide who can come in, who cannot come in, what sound can come in,

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.360
[Guest]: what sound is outer, when do we throw somebody out, when do we allow somebody in?

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.560
[Guest]: So for example, how do I need to change in order to be acceptable?

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.100
[Guest]: We see this world over.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.600
[Guest]: It's not just in India, it's ethnicity, it's color, it's race.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.480
[Guest]: We see the need.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.760
[Guest]: So it's like everybody is playing a part.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.160
[Guest]: The person who has power, cultural power, is making sure these notions are there, making

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:55.400
[Guest]: sure they keep changing according to time, but fundamentals are there.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.320
[Guest]: People who want to look at social and cultural mobility are saying, okay, how can I become

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.880
[Guest]: more like that?

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:07.320
[Guest]: And that's such an ugly structure in it, that you need to give up something of yourself,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.100
[Guest]: you want acceptability at this place, first of all, you place it at a higher level.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.100
[Guest]: So what about people?

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.240
[Guest]: What about different cultures?

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.980
[Guest]: What about different habits?

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.720
[Guest]: So what are we saying?

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:22.320
[Guest]: You know, it is, it's very, honestly, even as I say, this is so deeply disturbing for

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.320
[Amit Varma]: me.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.960
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of it is invisible and unstated, as you just said, in the sense that, you know,

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.560
[Amit Varma]: if a lower caste person enters the house of, you know, someone from a higher caste, he

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.440
[Guest]: will instinctively sit on the floor or he'll be embarrassed about entering.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.360
[Guest]: And this is so instinctive that to, you know, to someone who's grown up like that, it's

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360
[Guest]: just understood.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360
[Guest]: You don't think about it.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.040
[Guest]: And also, I can, if that person did not sit on the floor and just sat on the sofa, what

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.440
[Guest]: would my instinctive react, even the progressive TM Krishna think, for a split second in my

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.440
[Guest]: mind will go this thought, oh, now what does that mean?

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:01.360
[Guest]: It means that somehow I expected a certain behavior from this individual.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.480
[Guest]: And the person has transgressed.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.440
[Guest]: I may correct myself for to tick off the liberal box.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.000
[Guest]: But the fact is that feeling is there, right?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.960
[Guest]: So these, I mean, I always find it very interesting that when you talk about caste, people find

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.960
[Guest]: problematic.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:21.160
[Guest]: But, you know, if you just in the frame and talk about gender, I know women and trans

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.160
[Guest]: people know this every day, you know, and it's always fascinating for me when upper

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.680
[Guest]: caste women feminists don't get it in caste, but they get it in feminism.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.780
[Guest]: I'm like, do you realize it's the same framework?

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.600
[Guest]: It's that look that you talk about.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.960
[Guest]: It's the inequality in looking at two people that you talk about that you feel it.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.880
[Guest]: I would never feed it because I'm a man and I'm, I have everything going for me, but it's

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.720
[Guest]: the same framework that happens in caste and race and in ethnicity.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.800
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, there's a nice bit from Sebastian and Sons, which I marked out, which expresses

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.080
[Amit Varma]: exactly this.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.800
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote from your book, and this is someone speaking, quote, the relationship

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.600
[Amit Varma]: between the widwan and honorific often used for seasoned artists and the worker is like

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.400
[Amit Varma]: that of a husband and wife.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.880
[Amit Varma]: Only if there are arguments and disagreements between the husband and the wife, will the

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.120
[Amit Varma]: family move ahead.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.120
[Amit Varma]: If I am upset, I will not say much.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.720
[Amit Varma]: They will notice that from my facial expression and introspect about how they spoke to me.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.000
[Amit Varma]: It has been going on like this, and it should hopefully continue, stop quote.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.080
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, this spoke to me so much because it's, it's casteism and the patriarchy, and

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.240
[Amit Varma]: they're both together.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.800
[Amit Varma]: And all of us have experienced, you know, if not one, at least the other in some form

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.800
[Amit Varma]: of the other.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.280
[Amit Varma]: And I was also reminded of this, but there was this very interesting tweet by a writer

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.840
[Amit Varma]: on Twitter called Asim Ali, who's a journalist, I think he writes for various people where

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.280
[Amit Varma]: he pointed out that if you are at a restaurant and you're mistaken for the waiter, you know,

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.160
[Amit Varma]: you immediately feel, you know, a sense of hurt, pride and humiliation.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.800
[Guest]: And the very fact that we do say something about all of this, that's what that's exactly

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800
[Guest]: what I'm saying.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800
[Guest]: And we all feel it.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.840
[Guest]: I mean, I was actually the bookstore, this happened just about last week.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.640
[Guest]: And somebody came behind me.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.480
[Guest]: And he tapped me and he said, where is the fiction section?

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.640
[Guest]: For a second.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.640
[Guest]: I was like offended.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.960
[Guest]: How dare you ask me that question?

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.960
[Guest]: Right?

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.360
[Guest]: Because then I turned around, he said, sorry, sir.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:16.480
[Guest]: But the fact is that somebody could presume that I'm just a person in the shop floor.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.760
[Guest]: Yeah, we are offended.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.920
[Amit Varma]: We definitely are offended.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's a sharp observation.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.820
[Amit Varma]: And you were talking about pizza.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.160
[Amit Varma]: So I have to tell you this before this, when we were at lunch, I told you about how much

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.560
[Amit Varma]: I love TikTok and you should check it out.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.200
[Amit Varma]: So there is this nice TikTok video doing the rounds where, you know, this girl calls a

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:37.560
[Amit Varma]: pizza hut, and she says, pizza hut, and voice at the other end says, yes.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.640
[Amit Varma]: And she says, apke paas pizza hai?

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.580
[Amit Varma]: And the voice at the other end says, yes.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:46.240
[Amit Varma]: And then the girl gives this wistful look and says, maze hai yaar, maze hai, apke paas

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.080
[Guest]: pizza hai, you know, which is both very funny, but it's got resonance with that.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.280
[Guest]: It completely has a resonance with that, yeah, definitely does.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:01.960
[Amit Varma]: And there's a sort of a lot of that happening on TikTok, but we'll sort of define it later.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, so just to kind of sum it up, there are two things happening.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.640
[Amit Varma]: One, as you described, is in the world of Carnatic music, one, as you described, that

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.080
[Amit Varma]: there have traditionally been all of these entry barriers.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.960
[Amit Varma]: But also what is happening is that there is a denigration of other forms of art, and this

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.440
[Amit Varma]: elevation of the classical into a fine art, like even I have grown up with this impression

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.240
[Amit Varma]: that Hindustani classical and Carnatic are like the high forms of art.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:32.080
[Amit Varma]: And of course, in my case, they've intimidated me and said nahi main rock music sununga,

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.880
[Amit Varma]: but that's the whole impression.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:39.640
[Amit Varma]: And as you also point out in your book of essays as well, before this, about art, we've

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:45.720
[Amit Varma]: seen what, for example, in America, supposedly lower forms of art like jazz, gospel, hip

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.880
[Amit Varma]: hop coming up, and you know, now jazz is pretty much considered, you know, you're supposed

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.600
[Amit Varma]: to be classy, you're supposed to be a classy person, if you listen to jazz, and you're

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.760
[Amit Varma]: very sophisticated, if you argue about who's better Miles Ravis or Coltrane, and all of

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.760
[Amit Varma]: that happens.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.720
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, that is still a deep problem here, an entrenched problem.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.400
[Amit Varma]: So what's been your sort of experience of trying to do something about that?

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:12.160
[Guest]: So initially, I was only thinking of Carnatic music, okay.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:17.120
[Guest]: So now retrospectively, I can see why that was problematic in the sense it was about

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:23.760
[Guest]: this music, about the fact that I felt that this it lacked any kind of societal, political,

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:30.640
[Guest]: ethicalness, and also the music needed to kind of breathe, so to speak.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.640
[Guest]: But it was still about the music.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.880
[Guest]: I mean, I had not really given a year to different cultures, this is the truth.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.360
[Guest]: And I think that happened slowly.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.520
[Guest]: And slowly, I started looking at different cultures.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.560
[Guest]: And that's when I started questioning that word classical.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.280
[Guest]: You know, some people may say classical is not an Indian word, it's but I think Shastri

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.280
[Guest]: is as deeply problematic as classical.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.240
[Guest]: Absolutely, what is Shastri, who writes the Shastra, we can ask 100 questions about it.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:58.000
[Guest]: But I also believe that classical music in some way was superior.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.360
[Guest]: And to be able to appreciate, we've all been told this, that to appreciate classical music,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.280
[Guest]: you need to kind of a certain level of sophistication, you must have a year you must have kind of

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280
[Guest]: trained.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.040
[Guest]: So, you know, and I believed it, I honestly believed it.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.720
[Guest]: So what we have is this is representative of what Indian culture has been to the world.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.880
[Guest]: We always have the main shows being the classical world, and the side shows being some drum

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.640
[Guest]: dance from Manipur or Nagaland Meghalaya, then some other thing, you know, that those

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:30.800
[Guest]: are the diversity, they are the little crumbs we throw for diversity.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.240
[Guest]: But the main real representative has been these forms.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:40.000
[Guest]: We have represented India culturally like this in India and across the world.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.240
[Guest]: We treat those artists differently, we treat the classical artists differently, all this

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240
[Guest]: has been happening.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.960
[Guest]: But I think what happened was, when I started engaging with other art forms, you know, other

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:55.680
[Guest]: forms, which were not within the classical tag, is when things started becoming clear.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:02.960
[Guest]: But the first person who put the seed in my head is a musicologist named Harold Powers.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:09.880
[Guest]: Powers studied Carnatic music, and actually did his PhD on Hindustani music.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:15.240
[Guest]: And he was towards the end of his life, and he visited my home, and I was much younger

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.320
[Guest]: and very casually asked Harold, so Harold, what's the difference between classical and

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.840
[Guest]: folk?

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.840
[Guest]: And he didn't bat an eyelid, he said, very simple.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:29.480
[Guest]: As an art form goes up the ladder of society, it moves from becoming folk to classical.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.760
[Guest]: And when he first told me that, I thought that was rubbish.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.600
[Guest]: Okay, but I'm happy that that quote never went out of my head.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600
[Guest]: It stayed with me.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.680
[Guest]: And it kept bothering me.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.040
[Guest]: You know, how can you say this?

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:46.560
[Guest]: Are you saying there's nothing intrinsic about the art that makes it more special?

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.520
[Guest]: I mean, I sing it, it has to be more special.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:55.380
[Guest]: But when I started then investigating it, you see that he's absolutely right.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.120
[Guest]: He just nailed it.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.640
[Guest]: It's a question of who is participating in the creation of that art?

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.640
[Guest]: Who's creating it?

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.680
[Guest]: Who's listening to it?

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.040
[Guest]: And that defines whether you call it classical or you take the world classical across the

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:13.240
[Guest]: globe, everywhere in the world, it is the cultural elite who are defining the classical.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.000
[Guest]: So there has to be something about it.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.440
[Guest]: So this was the first thing.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.560
[Guest]: The other thing is when I started engaging with art forms which were not considered classical,

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.800
[Guest]: and I will never forget one experience, I went to a little village near Chennai.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.960
[Guest]: And this is art form called Katte Koothu.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:36.720
[Guest]: And incredible artist Mr. Rajagopal, and he runs a school for this art form, and I performed.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.680
[Guest]: At that point, I was engaging with art forms, but I think the snoot in me had not gone yet.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.680
[Guest]: You know, you still feel something.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.800
[Guest]: I mean, this has to be special.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.800
[Guest]: Come on.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.960
[Guest]: And I remember I performed that day.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.120
[Guest]: So I was performing in an area which was alien.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.720
[Guest]: I was culturally alien to the people there.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.720
[Guest]: Okay.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.960
[Guest]: It was extremely intimidating.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.520
[Guest]: Classical musicians never usually do that.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.480
[Guest]: There were about 1000 villagers from across the villages.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.960
[Guest]: And then was a Koothu performance.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:06.280
[Guest]: Now the Koothu unfolded.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.800
[Guest]: I had no clue what was going on.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.960
[Guest]: Every person sitting there knew every nuance, every little joke.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.520
[Guest]: And I'm thinking to myself, who is the sophisticated here?

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:24.080
[Guest]: Me or the 1000 villagers who I will consider uneducated, crude, you know, these words called

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:30.240
[Guest]: ethnic, all these words that we use, you know, raw, real, in aesthetic senses, when we use

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.600
[Guest]: that word, it's not a compliment.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600
[Guest]: Let's be very clear.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.840
[Guest]: It's not a compliment.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.760
[Guest]: And that's when it hit me that this whole notion of sophistication, complexity, subtlety

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.840
[Guest]: is very specific to every art form.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:49.000
[Guest]: If I'm able to dive into another culture, then I will feel it in that way.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.560
[Guest]: And that's when this whole thing, like crumbled, that these words are only social constructions,

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.320
[Guest]: they're political constructions, which is why even if, you know, jazz is considered

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.280
[Guest]: this profound thing, it's never called classical.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.280
[Guest]: Why?

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.680
[Guest]: Because it ticks every box that you want to take.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.760
[Guest]: It's complicated.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.760
[Guest]: It's difficult to understand.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.720
[Guest]: Even if you read 100 books, you can do an online course on jazz, you still won't understand.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.640
[Guest]: I won't still understand it.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.200
[Guest]: But it still is not called classical.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.880
[Guest]: Classical is still white man's music.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.640
[Guest]: There is something to it.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.960
[Guest]: So that's when I realized that this is not an aesthetic point.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.840
[Guest]: This is not a musical point.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:31.400
[Guest]: This is purely about people and about society and about politics of it.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.400
[Guest]: When you change the politics, something else may become, in fact, you've got a very nice

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.120
[Amit Varma]: line in your book, which I'll just read out, which, you know, is in the context of North

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Chennai, where all the Dalit slave and all of that.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And your sentence goes, quote, culture is not a word commonly associated with North

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.520
[Amit Varma]: Chennai, simply because this culture is not that of the upper caste, stop quote, which

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of says everything is then.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.640
[Amit Varma]: And is it a fair analogy to say that what you're talking about, you know, you're trained

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.360
[Amit Varma]: in Carnatic music, so you see all the sophistication and all that, but is it a fair analogy to

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.840
[Amit Varma]: say that it's like you're being really good at a language and a language which you know

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.720
[Amit Varma]: nothing of sounds like noise to you till you actually take the effort to immerse yourself?

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.440
[Amit Varma]: And at some point in the book, you've spoken about noise becoming music, you know, and

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.360
[Guest]: the analogy is very true.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.360
[Guest]: That's what it is.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.360
[Guest]: Right.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.400
[Guest]: And what we should also realize how difficult it is for us to actually move to another culture

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:30.600
[Guest]: or shall we dive into another culture, it's we're always carrying something with us, okay.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.200
[Guest]: And because we always carry something, it's so much harder to do.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.680
[Guest]: And so really, to be immerse yourself in multiple cultures is not an easy thing.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.560
[Guest]: And probably we're all never going to be able to do it.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.440
[Guest]: But even if you do it once with something, then we realize about this whole idea of how

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.840
[Guest]: can noise become music.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:49.520
[Guest]: So, you know, I'll give you a very, very Indian example.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.480
[Guest]: Many Hindustani musicians think that Carnatic musicians sing Besur.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:59.640
[Guest]: We are not singing Besur because the movement that they hear is Besur is actually a technical

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.680
[Guest]: required movement in Carnatic music.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.240
[Guest]: Now, is it off tune or not?

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.960
[Guest]: Is there an absolute answer to the question?

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.440
[Guest]: When is somebody singing in pitch?

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.840
[Guest]: Even a simple idea like that is so complicated.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:20.480
[Guest]: To your ear it may seem off pitch, to my ear, musically, that's in pitch.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.160
[Guest]: So I mean, this is a classic and then listen to Makhan music.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.960
[Guest]: I mean, their movements sound Besur to me.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.040
[Guest]: All of us sound Besur to the Western classical musician.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.600
[Guest]: So who is singing off tune?

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.600
[Guest]: We don't know.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.000
[Guest]: That's what I'm saying.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.760
[Guest]: It's so specific.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:40.480
[Guest]: So and this is very important, not just musically to understand, to culturally understand, you

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.480
[Guest]: know.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.360
[Guest]: So it happened to me when I heard so many kinds of music first, I thought it was just

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360
[Guest]: noisy.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360
[Guest]: This is loud.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.560
[Guest]: But now I feel the music inside sometimes.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.640
[Amit Varma]: So is it a journey then you then make from this intellectual understanding that no, this

00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.080
[Amit Varma]: kind of music is also legit in its own way to an emotional understanding where you can

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.000
[Amit Varma]: just sit back and enjoy that music and it doesn't sound Besur anymore?

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.600
[Guest]: I think that's the most important part.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.800
[Guest]: The intellectual understanding doesn't even scratch the surface.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.240
[Guest]: The fact is that none of us are going to change because we comprehend something or we believe

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.800
[Guest]: that intellectually that's right.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.800
[Guest]: We have to feel the music.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.800
[Guest]: You have to feel it.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.200
[Guest]: I mean, you have to feel the people.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.200
[Guest]: That's the message.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.200
[Guest]: You feel the people.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.200
[Guest]: You feel the dancer.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.200
[Guest]: You feel the culture.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.200
[Guest]: You have to feel the streets.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.200
[Guest]: You have to feel that you should taste the food.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.200
[Guest]: You have to.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.200
[Guest]: I mean, it's all that.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.200
[Guest]: Right.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.200
[Guest]: And then somewhere, at least momentarily, you feel you're part of it.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.680
[Guest]: And then that drumbeat is right at the bottom of your stomach.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And that's happened to you.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.680
[Guest]: Your smile.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.680
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, and that moment is incredibly emotional.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.480
[Amit Varma]: And does it then change the way you look at your own music?

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.320
[Amit Varma]: Are you taking some of that into your music?

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.320
[Guest]: So yeah, it does.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.880
[Guest]: I mean, it does change the way you hear.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.640
[Guest]: I mean, you often say that the music is not in the singing or playing.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.920
[Guest]: It's in the listening.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.800
[Guest]: The painting is not in the brush.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800
[Amit Varma]: It's in the scene.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.700
[Amit Varma]: There's a similar thing I like to say that, you know, great art is not about talent.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.700
[Amit Varma]: It's about judgment.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:05.700
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.700
[Guest]: Separate thing.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.700
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.400
[Guest]: But I'm saying that, you know, when you start feeling it, then you hear differently.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.280
[Guest]: You know, the lines kind of disappear, you know.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.280
[Guest]: This is right.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.480
[Guest]: This is not right.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.920
[Guest]: So kind of understand context for this technique, you know, and what are the things you can

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.920
[Guest]: judge?

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.080
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, how do you separate things?

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.000
[Guest]: These things become far more fluid.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.160
[Guest]: And I can tell you the way I hear Carnatic music, which is musically my home, is entirely

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.160
[Guest]: different.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.320
[Guest]: It's entirely different.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.600
[Guest]: I hear it differently.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.520
[Guest]: I know I hear it differently.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.600
[Guest]: I don't look for when I sing.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:44.800
[Guest]: I don't look for the things that I was looking for in my own music anymore.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.240
[Guest]: I know I'm not looking for it.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.840
[Guest]: I don't care a damn about so many things that I cared so much about in the music that I

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.840
[Amit Varma]: sang.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:56.600
[Amit Varma]: So as a performer, where is then the intersection between your new way of hearing this music

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.720
[Amit Varma]: and you know, how your understanding of your own music has evolved and how the audience

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.240
[Amit Varma]: is because it's still the same audience and you still want to push the buttons and get

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.240
[Guest]: the applause.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.240
[Guest]: So.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:14.600
[Guest]: So the thing is that I do like to hope that I push less buttons now, but nevertheless,

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.520
[Guest]: actually that has been an interesting journey itself.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.520
[Guest]: There are two parts.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.120
[Guest]: The one is that when things started changing the way I performed, the people who thought

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.720
[Guest]: that I was committing blasphemy, that I was killing the art form, that I was disrespecting

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.720
[Guest]: tradition.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:33.320
[Guest]: A lot of people just disliked what I was doing.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:40.720
[Guest]: And though I was singing all within the structures within the environment and this and what I

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.640
[Guest]: want to say is also tough for me.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.160
[Guest]: So again, you know, you may believe in something, but when you actually do it, it may not still

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.320
[Guest]: be you.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.600
[Guest]: It takes some time because before it becomes you.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.760
[Guest]: So as the audience was struggling, I was also struggling, right?

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.260
[Guest]: Because you're kind of demolding yourself in some way.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:59.920
[Guest]: And that process can be very difficult because you're grappling.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.200
[Guest]: You have nothing to follow.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.380
[Guest]: You don't know what you're doing.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:06.120
[Guest]: You just know you just have to get out of this and your problems are visible only to

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.120
[Guest]: you.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.120
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:12.640
[Guest]: And because of the discomfort, the audience goes through incredible discomfort, enormous

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.480
[Guest]: difficulty to understand what is this guy doing?

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:18.960
[Guest]: I'm going through discomfort saying, you know, does this answer what I'm asking for or am

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:19.960
[Guest]: I asking for?

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:20.960
[Guest]: What am I asking for?

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.960
[Guest]: I don't even know that.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.920
[Guest]: So there is this great amount of churn that's happening to everybody who's participating

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920
[Guest]: in this.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920
[Guest]: Right.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.920
[Guest]: That's one part.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:34.460
[Guest]: And then there is, there is the whole other idea of how does this respond to the politics

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.120
[Guest]: that you're talking about, to the social.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.240
[Guest]: So you know, things like, where do I sit?

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.760
[Guest]: Things change the way I sat on stage.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.680
[Guest]: I completely changed the way we sat on stage.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:49.040
[Guest]: And then the interesting thing happened is I started also questioning space, place.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.840
[Guest]: So I, you know, sang in open spaces where the audience was not the traditional audience.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:53:00.200
[Guest]: I've sung at a beach when there were six kids listening to me with their hands in their

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.360
[Guest]: ears saying, this is awful.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.160
[Guest]: To them, mine was noise.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.140
[Guest]: How does an artist react to that?

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:11.400
[Guest]: You know, singing in a bus, singing to people that have no clue, you know, they're different

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.400
[Guest]: culture entirely.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.560
[Guest]: In my city, just one kilometer away from the suburb where everybody will applaud everything

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.640
[Guest]: I'm singing.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.040
[Guest]: One kilometer later, these people think this is noisy stuff, man, ask them to stop.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.680
[Guest]: So what does that do to me?

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.440
[Guest]: You know, that also changed me.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.040
[Guest]: That also changed the way I was, I was thinking I was singing.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.000
[Guest]: So it's multiple things involved here.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.480
[Guest]: One is that internal musical rediscovery, hopefully.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.280
[Guest]: Then there is the idea of place and the idea of people.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.280
[Guest]: All these three are at play.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:45.080
[Guest]: And which is why I think all these three need to be at play for art to remain true.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.640
[Guest]: You know, you can say that I'm making art, which is not elitist, but if you're just going

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.000
[Guest]: to make it and make it, make sure that it's only in a gallery where a few people can enter.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.360
[Guest]: It's still that.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.440
[Guest]: So can you deconstruct a gallery?

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.800
[Guest]: Not only deconstruct your art, but deconstruct the gallery.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.200
[Guest]: These, you know, also the kind of people, the moment you do this, it's all fluid, which

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.920
[Guest]: means it's mayhem, which means you really don't know what's going to come out of all

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.920
[Guest]: this.

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:13.160
[Guest]: You know, when I sang on a, on a moving public transport bus, it was the most incredible

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.040
[Guest]: experience by the end of it.

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.040
[Guest]: It's a moving bus.

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.040
[Amit Varma]: How did that happen?

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.560
[Guest]: So this is part of many projects that we are involved in, right?

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:25.600
[Guest]: So as we moved from, as I move from not just talking about Carnatic music, the fact that

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:30.240
[Guest]: we are looking at different cultures and each are occupying different spaces and also at

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:36.440
[Guest]: a different hierarchical position, how do we create little contestation?

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.960
[Guest]: You need to create contestation between different cultures.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.440
[Guest]: You need to allow them to kind of come in, you know, kind of bang each other and some

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.640
[Guest]: amount of equality, at least for some time.

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:50.040
[Guest]: So one of the things we said is, why don't we just take the Carnatics and the classicals

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.120
[Guest]: onto a bus, this public transport bus.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:55:00.000
[Guest]: So we call it, now it's called MTC, I think it used to be called PTC when we were young.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.960
[Guest]: And we, I was not going to sing.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.440
[Guest]: So we did this relay of music.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:09.880
[Guest]: So we had not just Carnatic music, but we had some Tamil rock, we had Carnatic, we had

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.800
[Guest]: some Naam Sankirtan, all happening like a relay.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.800
[Guest]: So these musicians, all young musicians had to board the bus at different bus stops.

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.960
[Guest]: And they hand over the baton to the other person, it was fun.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.600
[Guest]: So I said, the first time we did it, I said, I want to check out how it is.

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.600
[Guest]: Was it recorded, video shooting?

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.600
[Guest]: There's a video on YouTube of it, of me singing.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.840
[Amit Varma]: That'll be linked from the show.

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.760
[Guest]: So what I did was I just got onto the bus in one of the bus stops, I was just going

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.200
[Guest]: to check it out.

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.680
[Guest]: But these young guys said, you have to sing.

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.120
[Guest]: I mean, how can you not sing?

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120
[Guest]: It was unbelievable.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:45.160
[Guest]: I mean, just the experience, you see, it was unbelievable because I was completely exposed.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.280
[Guest]: I was entirely vulnerable.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:52.280
[Guest]: I couldn't push any button, you couldn't push any button, that's the point.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.720
[Guest]: Once you know your audience, you push a button.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.640
[Guest]: Once you know your environment, you can push a button.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.360
[Guest]: You know the place, the people, the content, everything.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.480
[Guest]: If everything is removed, you can't push any button.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.840
[Guest]: You don't know whether the person is going to hate what you're doing.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:06.120
[Guest]: You don't know if you're going to get acceptability.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.120
[Guest]: You want to be accepted.

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.120
[Guest]: You're an artist.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.120
[Guest]: You want acceptance.

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.120
[Guest]: You want the applause.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.120
[Guest]: But you have no clue how to get it, man.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.760
[Guest]: And it was, it was exhilarating.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.880
[Guest]: I have, it was also panic, you're scared.

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:21.200
[Guest]: You know, by the time I did this, I've been in the field for what, two decades.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.120
[Guest]: I've never been scared of being on stage, but that day I was terrified.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.320
[Guest]: I was terrified when I sang on the beach for the first time, because I didn't know who's

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.320
[Guest]: going to, what's going to happen.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.320
[Guest]: Am I going to be discarded?

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.320
[Guest]: You know, is somebody going to say, stop?

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.520
[Guest]: Is somebody going to scream, for example, say, hey, please stop.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.520
[Guest]: Get out.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.320
[Guest]: I mean, so on the bus, this happened.

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.320
[Guest]: I'll never forget.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.560
[Guest]: It was the last leg when these young guys said, you have to sing.

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.360
[Guest]: So I belted out a song.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:51.320
[Guest]: And I remember as we came to the terminus, bus terminus, everybody on the roads were

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.480
[Guest]: wondering where music was coming from, right?

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:58.040
[Guest]: And there was this man who was drunk and he started dancing.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:02.760
[Guest]: He was on the road and he's like walking with the bus dancing.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.760
[Guest]: Is this in the video?

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.080
[Guest]: I don't think that's in the video.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.080
[Amit Varma]: Unfortunately.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.080
[Amit Varma]: We'll have to imagine it.

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:13.080
[Guest]: And I was like, this is the most beautiful connection I've made.

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:18.360
[Guest]: You know, we belong to very different worlds, very different ideas.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.320
[Guest]: He just heard the music and danced.

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.520
[Guest]: And because he's drunk now, he'll forget the connection the next morning.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.520
[Guest]: I wish I was drunk.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they would have leveled it off.

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:32.640
[Amit Varma]: How did your traditional audience, what you've called the 25,000 Brahmins who congregate every

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:39.240
[Amit Varma]: December in Chennai, how did your traditional audience react to you in light of the politics

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.800
[Amit Varma]: that you were now expressing?

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.720
[Amit Varma]: React to your music in light of the politics?

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.640
[Guest]: You had two or three different reactions.

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:52.960
[Guest]: Of course, my politics is and was very disconcerting.

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.480
[Guest]: And I can understand why it is.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.560
[Guest]: I mean, there's no point, I can't pontificate because it's true.

00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.320
[Guest]: I mean, I guess 20 years ago, I would have probably also looked at somebody who was doing

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.800
[Guest]: this and what the hell is he doing?

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:05.120
[Guest]: You know, so I can understand it at some level.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:10.040
[Guest]: So there were people who either said, I've had people sending me an email saying I've

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.560
[Guest]: thrown all your CDs.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.320
[Guest]: I don't have any CD of yours anymore.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.680
[Guest]: You've disrespected Hindu gods, you've disrespected Indian culture, therefore, I don't listen

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.680
[Amit Varma]: to you anymore.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.680
[Amit Varma]: I've had that.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.160
[Guest]: They can't do that anymore because you can't throw MP3s.

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.160
[Guest]: Yeah, I know.

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm on YouTube, they're stuck with me.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:32.200
[Guest]: So they've had people who have actually even now many people say, how is this guy who produces

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.120
[Guest]: such divine music speak such filth?

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.000
[Guest]: I've had many people say that.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000
[Guest]: In so many words.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
[Guest]: Those words actually.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.480
[Guest]: I'm not even paraphrasing.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:48.720
[Guest]: So how can he be so filthy and say all these horrible things, but when he sings, it's divine.

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.000
[Guest]: You have that.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.720
[Guest]: And you have also the other end of people who have never heard me, who listen to me

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:59.280
[Guest]: because of my politics, usually younger, younger people, and many people who don't belong within

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:04.080
[Guest]: the Carnatic world, who have now said, you know, I want to listen to this music because

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.720
[Guest]: I find it interesting that you can actually challenge it from being inside, which they

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.200
[Guest]: never thought was possible.

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.120
[Guest]: So you have different shades of all this happening.

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.480
[Guest]: So the power structures are uncomfortable with me.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.960
[Guest]: But the fact of the matter is, I'm doing all this because I'm powerful.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.960
[Guest]: So let's not run away from the fact that if I did this 20 years ago, I would have been

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.280
[Guest]: thrown and nobody would, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:32.840
[Guest]: So the fact also is the fact that I can, I can handle all this is because I know I have

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.840
[Guest]: the...

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.360
[Guest]: But you have also been deplatformed and stuff.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.360
[Guest]: Oh, yeah, of course.

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.000
[Guest]: There's been many concerts cancelled.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000
[Guest]: It's happened in India.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
[Guest]: It's happened in the US.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.600
[Guest]: It's happened in the US, wow.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:46.320
[Guest]: So this was about a couple of years, 2018, when actually some colleagues of mine were

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.720
[Guest]: targeted for singing Christian themes in Carnatic music.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.240
[Guest]: And they were really bullied.

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:57.840
[Guest]: And especially the women, I mean, the trolling was just, you know, I can't even quote the

00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.500
[Guest]: kind of things that were said, and I really pissed me off.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.040
[Guest]: And there was some guy who said he'll break my legs also.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.200
[Guest]: I mean, that also happened, but that is not so important.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.720
[Guest]: So I put out saying, a video saying, I'm going to release a song on Allah and Jesus every

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.760
[Guest]: month in Carnatic music.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:18.360
[Guest]: And it was done as a protest, saying that nobody has a right to tell me what I can sing

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.360
[Guest]: about.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.680
[Guest]: And this music doesn't belong to any community, any religion.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.560
[Guest]: And when I did that, I was just going to the US on a tour.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.800
[Guest]: And the concert was at Washington DC at the Shiva Vishnu temple where I've sung Amti number

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.480
[Guest]: of times.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.360
[Guest]: And they cancelled the concert.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.400
[Guest]: And they said that they have been threatened by right wing groups.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.040
[Guest]: And there was this huge blog this woman wrote about how they celebrated that the concert

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.040
[Guest]: was cancelled.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.360
[Guest]: And I was shown my place and that Indian culture was protected.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.080
[Guest]: And I understand recently that she's going to stand for election to something that the

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.080
[Guest]: same woman.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.080
[Guest]: That's very interesting.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.760
[Guest]: So I think it's Trump land.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.840
[Guest]: But yeah, so that's happened too.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.520
[Guest]: But I must say the positive of that, that happened.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:07.760
[Guest]: But then a group got together on the very same day, same time, a concert in DC did happen

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.240
[Guest]: as a as an answer.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.640
[Guest]: So that too happened.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.920
[Guest]: Yes, it was cancelled.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.160
[Guest]: But there are also people who came together and said this cannot happen.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.160
[Guest]: And we will do the concert.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.160
[Amit Varma]: So there are both sides to it.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that it's not just casteism.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.200
[Amit Varma]: There is of course, you know, the sexism is there in the sense women cannot play the mridangam

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.440
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440
[Amit Varma]: But there's also racism.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.280
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, Sudha Raghunathan, whose daughter married an African American

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.280
[Amit Varma]: gentleman and her concerts got cancelled because her son-in-law was African American.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280
[Guest]: Was it cancelled?

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.280
[Guest]: Yeah, that's what I've heard.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.280
[Guest]: I knew she was trolled.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.280
[Guest]: I know she was trolled.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.760
[Guest]: She was trolled and her shows were cancelled in January apparently.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:49.040
[Guest]: Okay, that's but you know, if you think of it, how far is casteism from racism?

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's, you know, it's the same insularity, we are the group, everyone else is the other.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.560
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:01.240
[Guest]: In fact, we Indians are probably the most racist lot, especially, you know, and what

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:06.080
[Guest]: do you also forget is there's a homogeneousness more or less in bandwidth of so called Indians

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.840
[Guest]: abroad, who are the majority of Indians who have migrated, they're most of them coming

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:16.080
[Guest]: from forward caste or shall we say socially mobile, OBCs, if you look at the government

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.240
[Guest]: categorization.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.840
[Guest]: And therefore, there's a certain homogeneousness of ideas and, and there is a certain commonness

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.800
[Guest]: with the way they want to build a narrative.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.440
[Guest]: And the narrative casteism is entrenched.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.280
[Guest]: And in casteism is color.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.480
[Guest]: And therefore, the notion of the darker skin notion of the African American is also seen

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.760
[Guest]: as a lower caste.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.280
[Guest]: The African American is seen as a lower caste.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.280
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.280
[Guest]: Right.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.160
[Guest]: So this just works perfectly in casteist narrative.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.760
[Guest]: And that is why you have this ridiculous thing happening.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.720
[Guest]: And there's a personal thing about somebody getting married, and has got nothing to do

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.440
[Guest]: with anybody, and, but then the person is actually harassed and trolled for a personal

01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440
[Amit Varma]: decision.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440
[Guest]: And her son-in-law was called the n-word.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:10.440
[Guest]: I mean, the surprising thing, Amit, is after all this, even people who are viewing it,

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.160
[Guest]: you know, forget the people who are throwing this nonsense out, maybe, you know, maybe

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.680
[Guest]: we can have a conversation with people, I don't know.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.040
[Guest]: But even people are viewing it, just don't see the horribleness of it, or say, you know,

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.560
[Guest]: they shouldn't say this, but I just don't get that.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.680
[Guest]: I mean, I just don't get it.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.000
[Guest]: I said, you know, there can't be any but over there.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.720
[Guest]: I mean, but a lot of us speak that way.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.840
[Guest]: You know, they should have not made this public, they should have done the marriage quietly.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840
[Guest]: What do you mean?

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.840
[Guest]: You want to just say that these things don't happen?

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.840
[Guest]: What are we saying?

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.680
[Guest]: You know, so you'll be happy if the she had married a Jewish white person?

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.560
[Guest]: I mean, what are we saying?

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.560
[Guest]: I mean, these moments are horrible for the person experiencing it.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.180
[Amit Varma]: These moments are also revealing.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.940
[Amit Varma]: And I think the point I'd like to clarify is, and this is a common confusion that when

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:03.400
[Amit Varma]: you talk about all of you know, these upper caste NRIs taking their caste baggage with

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.920
[Amit Varma]: them, you don't mean to say that they are necessarily casteist or they are thinking

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.800
[Amit Varma]: in terms of caste consciously, it's just that they're carrying those entrenched ways of

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.000
[Amit Varma]: thinking and responding to the world.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.900
[Amit Varma]: And it's completely internalized.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.720
[Amit Varma]: They may be the best human beings otherwise, and all of that.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.720
[Guest]: Very true.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.720
[Guest]: You know, that's not a big problem, right?

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.200
[Guest]: When you speak in these terms, people think that you're painting somebody as evil people.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.200
[Amit Varma]: They react defensively.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.740
[Guest]: Yeah, it's not.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:31.120
[Guest]: But that's why I keep saying I am still casteist.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.640
[Guest]: You know, all these invisible ways.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.640
[Guest]: I do it every day.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.640
[Guest]: I do it.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:40.760
[Guest]: I mean, especially, you know, sexist, casteist, I mean, you know, in your relationship with

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.180
[Guest]: your wife, there are things that you presume that your wife should be doing without even

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.200
[Guest]: thinking about it twice, whereas it comes from patriarchy that you don't recognize.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.440
[Guest]: And then you, when you talk about it, you realize, yep, where is this coming?

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.280
[Guest]: So these things are so ingrained and normalized that we just don't see it.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.560
[Guest]: So actually, a lot of times I will say that these are not intentional in that sense.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.800
[Guest]: You're not purposely saying, I look at Amit, you're like this, and therefore I'm targeting.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800
[Guest]: No.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.280
[Guest]: See, we're all pattern recognizers as a species.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.720
[Guest]: And these are all patterns we've been taught to recognize, you know, starting from gender.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.720
[Amit Varma]: These are instinctive aversions.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:22.520
[Guest]: So we do all this automatically, we do this automatically, and these engines start working.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.920
[Guest]: And, but it's important that we are aware that we are functioning in that manner.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.840
[Guest]: I mean, that's the problem.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.480
[Guest]: And I think what gets accentuated in a place like with the NRAs is the fact that at least

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.680
[Guest]: in India, you have to walk the street and go to the dhukan.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:42.720
[Guest]: You know, you meet, even if you don't want to, people of diversity, you know, but what

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:48.160
[Guest]: happens in the States is you are a homogeneous lot, only meeting those people, carrying these

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:53.880
[Guest]: things from India and constantly reaffirming that over 20, 30 years, that makes it much

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.880
[Guest]: harder.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.800
[Guest]: Actually, I'm saying that it's much harder for the NRAs to break free of this because

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:03.080
[Guest]: they don't, that they lose that connection of the possibility of being hit by something

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:07.840
[Guest]: that they never expected or experiencing people in a way that they never expected, because

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.760
[Guest]: you are this little bubble in these lit cities.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.680
[Amit Varma]: And once you get into a comfort zone, you don't question it, which is why your journey

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.760
[Amit Varma]: is so surprising that you've reached the top of the Carnatic music ladder.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:22.200
[Amit Varma]: And then you are, you know, you have the level of self reflection, I can imagine someone

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.320
[Amit Varma]: from the outside or someone who's not so successful doing that, you know, just speaking to this

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:30.080
[Amit Varma]: point, there's a beautiful poem by Akhil Katyal, who's just read a book out, and I'm just going

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.080
[Amit Varma]: to read that out.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.460
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sure you're familiar with it.

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:36.160
[Amit Varma]: But for those of my listeners who aren't, and the poem is called Poetic License, is

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.960
[Amit Varma]: by Akhil Katyal.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:42.000
[Amit Varma]: One day when he was about 10 or 12, he asked his mother, what is my caste?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.420
[Amit Varma]: Some boys in the school were asking, I didn't know what to say.

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:50.200
[Amit Varma]: The mother got up in the middle of a supper, beta, if you don't know it by now, it must

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.200
[Amit Varma]: be upper.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:58.560
[Guest]: That's, that's a very important poem, because it's true of most of us.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:06.080
[Guest]: You know, it's like, somebody told me is that if you are a Dalit, every day, every moment

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.040
[Guest]: of your life, you're reminded that you're a Dalit.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:15.440
[Guest]: So when we all say, especially that, what caste, we never spoke about caste at home.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.400
[Guest]: This is said very often, just means exactly what he said.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.240
[Amit Varma]: It's that extra layer of awareness, even women carry it, you know, when women walk on the

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.440
[Amit Varma]: street, they have this extra layer of awareness, which is not important to us.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.240
[Amit Varma]: We can take our being male for granted.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.240
[Amit Varma]: No woman can do that.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.600
[Amit Varma]: You enter a lift, you're looking at everyone who's there before you get in.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's consistent, and it's normalized, and men don't see it.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.600
[Guest]: And men think it's normal to look at a woman in a certain manner.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.800
[Guest]: And you have to catch yourself sometimes doing things that you would not normally think,

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.360
[Guest]: you know, you know, it's not about whether you're liberal, progressive, etc, etc, etc.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.120
[Guest]: This is not about being conservative.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.120
[Guest]: This is just about these entrench habits.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.840
[Guest]: So I catch myself looking in a certain manner at a woman so many times, then I see it myself.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.920
[Amit Varma]: This is things that we do.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, wife is listening to this.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680
[Amit Varma]: What are you saying?

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.400
[Amit Varma]: Okay, before we go into a break, and after the break, we have to get to your wonderful

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.400
[Amit Varma]: book.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.520
[Amit Varma]: We're not doing it justice if we don't.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:19.280
[Amit Varma]: But sort of a final question, just you know, going back to that old theme we were exploring

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:24.160
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, the evolution of Carnatic music and the setting it apart from other kinds

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.840
[Amit Varma]: of lower art, which are not classical and all that, did also the academies play a part

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.840
[Amit Varma]: in this?

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.400
[Amit Varma]: For example, in your book, there is this passage about the Music Academy, which you know, your

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.440
[Amit Varma]: grand uncle, T.T. Krishnamacharya played a part in founding, quote, the Music Academy,

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.520
[Amit Varma]: established in 1928, had quickly become the sanctum sanctorum of Carnatic music, sabhas

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.760
[Amit Varma]: such as Parthasarathy Swami Sabha, Perambur Sangeet Sabha, Jagannath Bhakt Sabha were

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.680
[Amit Varma]: changing the nature of Carnatic music consumption, ticket paying public and membership driven

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.120
[Amit Varma]: models became the accepted norm.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.800
[Amit Varma]: This was enabled by Brahmin families migrating from Tanjavur, Tirunelveli and surrounding

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.200
[Amit Varma]: areas, the Chettiyars from Karaikudi district and other high culture seeking business communities

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.240
[Amit Varma]: such as the Mudaliars, stop quote.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.920
[Amit Varma]: And what seems to me to be happening here, and where say Carnatic music gets this kind

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.720
[Amit Varma]: of advantage as it were over the other forms which are looked down upon, is that you have

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.160
[Amit Varma]: an academy, you have theory building around it, you have a pedagogy building around it,

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.720
[Amit Varma]: you have a community building around it, while other forms of music may survive sort of as

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.080
[Amit Varma]: oral traditions do, without this accumulated knowledge passing through to future generations.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.520
[Guest]: Very important point you make.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.900
[Guest]: So I think we have to go back to the political context of the times.

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:41.480
[Guest]: So this is a times of Hindu nationalism.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.840
[Guest]: So there's not just a Carnatic phenomena, you see Bhatkande trying to do the same thing,

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.760
[Guest]: you see Paluskar trying to do the something, this whole notion of presenting Indian culture

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:55.640
[Guest]: as this very old, very pristine, you know, idea.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.080
[Guest]: And so you have these people, all upper caste people, in the case of Khyal, they feel that

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.680
[Guest]: the Muslims have basically spoiled this art form, they sing whatever they want.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.240
[Guest]: And so we need to get the original music.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.360
[Guest]: So Bhatkande decides to go through the musicological way, Paluskar said bhakti is the way.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.060
[Guest]: Bhakti is the essence of this music.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.060
[Guest]: So he uses another channel.

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.000
[Guest]: So you have that happening, and that's when you have all the Gandharva Mahavidyas forming,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
[Guest]: you have all these things.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.440
[Guest]: A similar narrative is happening in the South.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.040
[Guest]: But in the South, what is happening is that Devadasis are the targets.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.980
[Guest]: Now, they are now by then considered niche.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.920
[Guest]: So then they can't be part of something we are considered old and pure.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.880
[Guest]: So then you again building a very, very nationalistic, very upper caste notion, theosophical society

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:49.400
[Guest]: plays a very important role in these constructions of what Hindu philosophy, Hindu history, the

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.400
[Guest]: Rishis in the Himalayas, all these notions, right?

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.600
[Guest]: So you have these art forms forming in that.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:01.760
[Guest]: Thyagaraja is now becoming this saint, he becomes this real, beyond reality human being.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.320
[Guest]: So all this construction is happening at the same time, everybody recognizes another battle

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.400
[Guest]: you have to fight with the British is not just emotionally getting this music, but also

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.840
[Guest]: say that it's technical, also say that it is intellectual.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.520
[Guest]: So then you have this Music Academy forming, and it's fascinating if you go through Music

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:25.360
[Guest]: Academy discussions, and it's all documented, you have lawyers, okay, they're not professional

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360
[Guest]: musicians.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:31.040
[Guest]: So all these lawyers and well educated upper caste Brahmin men, who are having these debates

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040
[Guest]: on Carnatic music with musicians.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040
[Guest]: Wow.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.560
[Guest]: Okay, so they are saying so that's when the rules are then being formed, like you're then

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.680
[Guest]: giving knowledge validity in document.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.400
[Guest]: Sounds like the Constituent Assembly debates, are these online?

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400
[Guest]: Oh, it's online.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.280
[Guest]: It's all online, you can go it's very interesting.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.560
[Guest]: So that's part of creating intellectual capital.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.360
[Guest]: That's actually creating knowledge.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.360
[Guest]: And it has been modern.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360
[Guest]: And you're codifying it.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.360
[Amit Varma]: Basically, it's a codification.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.440
[Unknown]: Yeah, and it's a modern notion.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.520
[Guest]: This has happened, the same thing is happening with Hindustani music.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.600
[Guest]: And then the interesting part is post independence, we just continued the same narrative.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:08.040
[Guest]: Just look at the institutions that were created for culture across the country.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:14.240
[Guest]: That was for Bharatanatyam, private Carnatic music or Hindustani music for Kathakali.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.880
[Guest]: So again, you're only looking at those art forms that are practiced by a certain group

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.720
[Guest]: of people or enjoy by certain group of people that is decided that you believe needs to

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.320
[Guest]: be codified that deserves even codification of intellectual activity.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.840
[Guest]: So you're actually designing cultural knowledge, you're actually defining what is knowledge

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.280
[Guest]: in culture and art.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:38.120
[Guest]: So all this played a very important role in placing these art forms where they are, in

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:43.480
[Guest]: placing them in the fact that this is what we want to present as ourselves, without doubt.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:49.480
[Guest]: And the fact that this did not happen for so many art forms, meant that for 70 years,

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:55.720
[Guest]: they are still considered just they considered, of course, exotic, very important, or you

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.040
[Guest]: say one thing, they are the source for this.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.960
[Guest]: You know, I always find it deeply disturbing when classical musicians say, you know what

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.480
[Guest]: folk say, what do you mean by that?

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.160
[Guest]: It's like it was something that was an, you know, unpolished diamond that we took from

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.120
[Guest]: there and made it polished.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.080
[Guest]: So those were like resource material.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.120
[Guest]: And they have their beauty, they have their limitedness.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.560
[Guest]: But then the classical is what is an evolution of them.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.760
[Guest]: So all this allowed for this kind of cultural discourse to be entrenched in our psyche

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.640
[Guest]: and in our emotional beings, because we feel that way.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and, you know, just thinking in terms of cultural equity, it just seems that the

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:38.760
[Amit Varma]: inequality in cultural equity was enormously exacerbated by these institutions, which just

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.600
[Amit Varma]: keep, you know, doing what they're doing, which is not to say that these forms of music

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:48.040
[Amit Varma]: should not have academies or, you know, theoretic development or whatever, but the other forms

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.040
[Guest]: are...

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040
[Guest]: Definitely.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.560
[Guest]: And you can point to so many forms across this country, you know, so I won't say I'm

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.640
[Guest]: not talking about what I would like to call, I don't like the word folk, social music,

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.600
[Guest]: for example, harvest songs or a lullaby.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:06.480
[Guest]: Those are social music that is passed on from mother to daughter or, you know, all the villagers.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.920
[Guest]: That's different from organized art.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:14.600
[Guest]: And you've organized art across this country, and none of them had the benefit of being

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:20.000
[Guest]: codified or being given theorization or being written about in, you know, with the nuances

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.240
[Guest]: and the technicalities that they all have, simply because of where they belonged in society.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.160
[Amit Varma]: So does that now, assuming that this started out as, I don't want to use the word equal,

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.560
[Amit Varma]: because we're not weighing different art forms, but assuming that at one time, they were all

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.560
[Amit Varma]: art forms at a similar level of evolution, have those kind of fallen back?

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.000
[Guest]: I mean, I'm uncomfortable about using this language itself.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
[Guest]: I'm not sure.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.320
[Guest]: Because of this codification process.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.320
[Guest]: I'm not sure.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.320
[Guest]: I wouldn't think so.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.760
[Guest]: I would think that it's not an upper view, does not mean that it has not had its own

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.760
[Guest]: evolution.

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.760
[Guest]: It had its own changes.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.680
[Guest]: You go to any of these art forms, and the practitioners will tell you how things have

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:55.680
[Guest]: changed.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Narratives have changed.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.680
[Amit Varma]: Storytelling has changed.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.080
[Guest]: And maybe the absence of codification is a feature, not a bug.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.400
[Guest]: And then that kind of takes it to a different kind of a journey.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.400
[Guest]: It's definitely happened.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:09.440
[Guest]: I think the fact that they seem to be invisible is what the problem is, that they don't exist

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.720
[Guest]: in serious discussion, you know, in all these highbrow.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.720
[Guest]: So I think an important point that you're raising, and it's all important, is knowledge.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.280
[Guest]: How does knowledge get created?

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.360
[Guest]: When is something knowledge and who is deciding these things, you know?

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360
[Guest]: And what is documentation?

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.000
[Guest]: You know, it's very odd, no?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.200
[Guest]: At one point, we keep saying Indian culture is not written culture.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.880
[Guest]: Indian culture is what we carry forward.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.680
[Guest]: But then we decide to only codify some of them.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.720
[Guest]: We say both.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.040
[Guest]: We say Indian culture is oral history, or we are an oral system.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.280
[Guest]: We didn't believe in, you know, writing things down.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.900
[Guest]: We celebrate that.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:49.880
[Guest]: But when it comes to judging art or judging cultures, we give more importance to the ones

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.160
[Guest]: that have documents, that have some shastra, and that is not shastra.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.720
[Guest]: So, you know, we play this little game, we choose when we want to be oral and oral, when

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.480
[Guest]: we want to be organized.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And this reminds me of a similar privileging you mentioned in your book where you point

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.480
[Amit Varma]: out that documentaries about Chennai will always show Mylapore and, you know, those

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.880
[Guest]: areas from which you belong.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.880
[Guest]: Of course I do.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm from the innermost circles.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760
[Amit Varma]: You are from the innermost circles.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.960
[Amit Varma]: We'll take a quick commercial break and then we shall come back to talk about Sebastian

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:21.640
[Amit Varma]: and Sons.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:25.680
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art but can't really afford to have paintings

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.720
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.840

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.320
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with TM Krishna about Carnatic music and especially about his new book, Sebastian

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.120
[Amit Varma]: and Sons, which carries this delightful quote from C. Rajagopalachari.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.360
[Amit Varma]: You talk about how, you know, Palgatmani Iyer goes to see Rajagopalachari with a problem

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.540
[Amit Varma]: about the contradiction that the instrument that he uses involves taking the lives of

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.480
[Amit Varma]: three animals because there are three kinds of hide on there.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:00.360
[Amit Varma]: And Rajaji tells him, quote, don't look for the source of a river or the antecedents of

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.320
[Amit Varma]: a saint, stop quote.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:09.280
[Amit Varma]: And this seems to me to not only speak to the question of the Mridangam itself, but

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.760
[Amit Varma]: to all of Carnatic music.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.200
[Amit Varma]: And you've actually, you know, you've done that.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.800
[Amit Varma]: You've questioned the source of the river.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.440
[Guest]: I mean, in Tamil, it's like Rishi moolam nadhi moolam kekka kodathu.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.000
[Guest]: I'm just telling you how it sounds in Tamil.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.200
[Guest]: Rishi moolam nadhi moolam.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.200
[Guest]: Nadhi is river.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.440
[Guest]: So Rishi moolam nadhi moolam.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.440
[Guest]: Never ask for that.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:33.080
[Guest]: You know, when I first, it was told to me, this story was told to me, it seemed very

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.080
[Guest]: normal to me.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.960
[Guest]: It's like certain questions don't ask, you know, why do you want to know?

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.840
[Guest]: But then when I looked at it again and again, this is like, wow, that's so convenient.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.640
[Guest]: We decide what we don't want to see.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.520
[Guest]: That's a rationalization of denial.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.520
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.320
[Guest]: Entirely denial that, you know, cow skin is required for the Mridangam.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.240
[Guest]: And I find Palagatmaneer most interesting here.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.880
[Guest]: He said I wouldn't brush it under the carpet, right?

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.960
[Guest]: He could have very easily said, I don't want to talk about this.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.360
[Guest]: But he's this man who loves the Mridangam.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.600
[Guest]: He's obsessed with it.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.960
[Guest]: He's really obsessed with it.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.520
[Guest]: And he wants to get the best tone.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.000
[Guest]: He wants the best skin.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.040
[Guest]: He's very clear.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.240
[Guest]: He wants to improve the tone.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.840
[Guest]: He's trying his best.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:17.080
[Guest]: And then it suddenly hits him like, wow, but isn't this the cow that I worship, but I want

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.080
[Guest]: the skin.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.680
[Guest]: So he kind of, you can see.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.000
[Guest]: So he's then asking, he wants, he wants reconciliation.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
[Guest]: He wants somehow to make sure that he feels better about it.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.160
[Guest]: And we all do that, right?

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:33.040
[Guest]: And he goes and asks Rajaji and Srirajagopalachari comes up with his answer.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.720
[Guest]: And to me, his answer is more problematic than Maneer's seeking.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.440
[Guest]: Maneer's seeking is very honest.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:43.080
[Guest]: But Srirajagopalachari isn't, he's saying don't ask this because he's almost saying,

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.000
[Guest]: if you go there, you won't be at in peace.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.940
[Guest]: You won't be able to do what you're great at.

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:51.800
[Guest]: You won't be able to play the Mridangam and be this incredible musician because you know,

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.360
[Guest]: you'll have to see things that you should not be seeing.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.480
[Guest]: So that means you forget the maker, you forget the person who's cutting the skin out, you

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.260
[Guest]: forget the person who's cleaning their skin for you.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:08.240
[Guest]: So you're actually removing a whole section of people and culture from the conversation,

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.680
[Guest]: but just saying, I don't, I know what lies behind it.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.080
[Guest]: He's not blind to it.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.240
[Guest]: He knows what happens, but I don't want to see it.

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:20.600
[Amit Varma]: So basically Palgat Maneer accepted Rajaji's advice, but you did not.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.600
[Guest]: Of course.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.360
[Amit Varma]: I took great offense.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:29.440
[Amit Varma]: This reminds me of this old story about Tolstoy that Tolstoy once he became a vegetarian and

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.600
[Amit Varma]: he was very, you know, rigid about his vegetarianism and an aunt came to visit one day and the

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.240
[Amit Varma]: aunt said, I would really like to eat some chicken and Tolstoy was unhappy, but he couldn't

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.240
[Amit Varma]: say no to the aunt.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.240
[Amit Varma]: So he said, okay.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.880
[Amit Varma]: And then at dinnertime, the aunt gets to the dining table and she finds a live chicken

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.400
[Amit Varma]: on her chair.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:48.920
[Amit Varma]: And Tolstoy said that none of us had the heart to carve it up.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.300
[Amit Varma]: You do it yourself.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:57.040
[Amit Varma]: And this reminds me of this beautiful bit I'm going to quote from your book about Palgat

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.640
[Amit Varma]: Maneer Iyer, who is, and this is in the context of Alkaton, who is Parilandu's cousin.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.640
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.680
[Amit Varma]: And quote, Iyer gave Alkaton a job.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:10.240
[Amit Varma]: He said he wanted top draw cow skin, no compromises and the cost did not matter.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.360
[Amit Varma]: Alkaton said it would cost rupees hundred.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:16.920
[Amit Varma]: Iyer gave him that amount immediately in advance and headed out to a restaurant around three

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:17.920
[Amit Varma]: or 4pm.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.920
[Amit Varma]: When he returned, he found Alkaton standing outside his house, cow in tow.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.960
[Amit Varma]: Iyer was startled to say the least.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:30.040
[Amit Varma]: Alkaton informed him that this cow had great skin, but the seller wanted rupees 120.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.240
[Amit Varma]: So he wanted to check with Iyer before completing the transaction.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.920
[Amit Varma]: Iyer was shocked.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Almost certainly this would have been the first time he had to make a decision on the

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:44.280
[Amit Varma]: slaughtering itself and take responsibility for something that was thus far hidden.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.820
[Amit Varma]: He just shooed Alkaton away and demanded that he take the cow with him.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.480
[Amit Varma]: This incident from Iyer's life is a universal condition.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.720
[Amit Varma]: I am certain that no Mridangam artist would like to be placed in a similar situation.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.300
[Amit Varma]: Skin just drops down from the heavens as far as they are concerned.

01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:01.300
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:02.300
[Amit Varma]: This is such a beautiful line.

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Skin just drops down from the heavens.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.240
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, thank you for that moment.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.200
[Amit Varma]: We'll sort of come back to this later.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:12.640
[Amit Varma]: And I want to especially delve into your chapter on how you went to an abattoir and enjoyed

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640
[Amit Varma]: the experience.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:16.160
[Amit Varma]: So I'm totally judging you on that.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:21.680
[Amit Varma]: But first, tell me about how the thought of the book came to you.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:27.200
[Guest]: You know, my first book was called Southern Music, a Carnatic Story.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:33.280
[Guest]: And the book is a more academic book in that sense into technicalities, history, and in

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:38.160
[Guest]: a way, I think all the journey that I went through within music for myself, somehow got

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.320
[Guest]: encapsulated in the book.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:44.220
[Guest]: And I actually think that the book that book helped me in gaining clarity with all the

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.800
[Guest]: different streams of thoughts I had.

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:50.120
[Guest]: So the book really helped me in, you know, figuring out what was happening through almost

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.960
[Guest]: six, seven years.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.240
[Guest]: And there is a whole section on the sociology and the politics of the music.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.160
[Guest]: And there's a whole chapter on caste.

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.720
[Guest]: And that chapter was very heavily debated when the book came out.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.800
[Guest]: And I remember with my editor, we were looking at the second edition or something.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:11.520
[Guest]: And I just flipping through that chapter, suddenly, the instrument maker came to my

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.640
[Amit Varma]: head and I said, and I'll interrupt you because you said editor and I'll point out I'm a big

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:20.560
[Amit Varma]: fan of your editor Ajita Jaya's fantastic job she did on that book and this one continue.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.560
[Guest]: Thank you very much.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.040
[Guest]: She's a fantastic editor.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.040
[Guest]: That's true.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:29.880
[Guest]: So what happened was, I suddenly realized I had said nothing about the instrument maker.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.400
[Guest]: And I was like, what did I do?

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.080
[Guest]: In my head, music was only about the performance.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:43.360
[Guest]: In my head, the instrument was got its life because of the instrumentalist.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.680
[Guest]: What about the person who actually gives it the sound?

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.080
[Guest]: And that's when I said, what about the Mridangam maker?

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:56.400
[Guest]: And that's also because the Mridangam is slightly different from other instruments.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.120
[Guest]: I mean, tabla is also close by.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:02.680
[Guest]: The sense if I buy a tanpura, the tanpura stays with me and my connection with the maker

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.680
[Guest]: is lost.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:08.800
[Guest]: I can retune it, I can change the strings, unless something gets damaged.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.720
[Guest]: The tanpura then is just with me.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.760
[Guest]: So there is no constant relationship.

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.040
[Guest]: It's not the case with the Mridangam.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.760
[Guest]: The Mridangam needs constant change.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.760
[Guest]: It needs skin change.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.880
[Guest]: It needs that black spot to be changed.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.400
[Guest]: So all the Mridangam makers, I mean, players will come and say, you know, this is old,

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.400
[Guest]: I need to go back.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.760
[Guest]: And they're constantly at the Mridangam shop.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.880
[Guest]: You've heard stories about what happens in Mridangam shop.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.240
[Guest]: So I know all this folklore.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.280
[Guest]: So I said, what about them?

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.800
[Guest]: And Amit actually wrote a paragraph to plug in.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:41.080
[Guest]: And, you know, you're writing this to save yourself, actually, right?

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.840
[Amit Varma]: Because you want to be politically correct.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:43.840
[Amit Varma]: Plausible deniability.

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.200
[Guest]: I did not ignore it.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.480
[Guest]: Yes, exactly.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.960
[Guest]: And I think I, I stopped.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:55.760
[Guest]: And I stopped because I realized that it was fake and I realized I've been completely dishonest.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.880
[Guest]: I also realized I knew nothing about them.

01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.880
[Guest]: I knew nothing.

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:00.880
[Guest]: I mean, I knew the names.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.880
[Guest]: I knew Parlan's name.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.400
[Guest]: That was one name people knew.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.420
[Guest]: I knew a few of the stories that people have told me, but I didn't know anything.

01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:11.440
[Guest]: So I paused and I said, maybe I should learn about them.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.520
[Guest]: Maybe there is a story, there are stories to tell.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:19.240
[Guest]: That's when I first started going and interviewing Mridangam makers.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:23.760
[Guest]: And I did this for about three and a half years.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:29.560
[Guest]: I met, I don't know how many of them, I mean, the book comes out of about close to 50 interviews.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:35.440
[Guest]: 30 of them are long, one and a half hour interviews, and then short conversations.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.480
[Guest]: And I just kept interviewing people, makers of different generation, different parts of

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.480
[Guest]: South India.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.920
[Guest]: I also spoke to Mridangam players.

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.280
[Guest]: And it was that whole journey.

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.480
[Guest]: And then sitting with them, honestly, I remember there were points in the interview stage,

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.000
[Guest]: the fieldwork stage, when I was overwhelmed by all the stuff I was hearing.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.520
[Guest]: I was like, how am I going to even say this?

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.840
[Guest]: I mean, how am I going to tell this story?

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.800
[Guest]: There are so many streams, there are so many voices, is it even possible to say this?

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:08.280
[Guest]: And then it took me a long time to just sit with the interviews, watch them again and

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.080
[Guest]: again, look at the transcripts.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080
[Guest]: And then from there evolved.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:14.160
[Guest]: So you actually recorded those?

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:19.080
[Guest]: I actually videoed almost every interview, along with audio.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.080
[Amit Varma]: And I did.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.520
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I find you extraordinarily, and I'm jealous of this because I wish I had

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.800
[Amit Varma]: that quality, extremely self-aware.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.280
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, you know, when it comes to these interviews that you're doing, you are talking

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:39.720
[Amit Varma]: essentially to lower class Mridangam makers, who have essentially played a secondary role

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:44.720
[Amit Varma]: to the people who actually play the Mridangam, who are upper caste people.

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:50.560
[Amit Varma]: And there is, in what you are doing itself, an echo of that instrumentality, where you're

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.200
[Amit Varma]: using these lower caste people for your own purposes of writing this book, and you are

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:59.920
[Amit Varma]: an upper caste man yourself, which is clearly something you must have pondered.

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.360
[Amit Varma]: How did you sort of negotiate that?

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.520
[Amit Varma]: And this is, you know, even outside of this caste angle, this is a question that nonfiction

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:11.360
[Amit Varma]: writers get all the time, that at the end of the day, you might feel tremendous empathy

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.680
[Amit Varma]: with the people you're writing about, you might even be friends with them.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.600
[Amit Varma]: But there is a sense that you're using them.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:20.400
[Amit Varma]: And I guess the standard answer is that, look, I am being very upfront and honest about what

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.640
[Amit Varma]: I am doing.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.120
[Amit Varma]: And they are responding to that.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.440
[Amit Varma]: And then what happens is happens.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.440
[Guest]: I don't think it's as simple as that.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.160
[Guest]: I think it's, it's very problematic.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.480
[Guest]: I've struggled with it.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.800
[Guest]: Because I didn't know at what point, I mean, these are these are people.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.200
[Guest]: And these are their lives.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.320
[Guest]: These are their realities.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.520
[Guest]: These are the stories they've experienced have been told.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.640
[Guest]: It's about family, it's about history.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:50.680
[Guest]: I mean, it's, I mean, it's not just information they're giving you, they're sharing themselves

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.680
[Guest]: with you, right?

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.200
[Guest]: So it really matters.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:56.520
[Guest]: And the big problem is that you come from such privilege.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:02.360
[Guest]: And you know, you can't treat them as some resource material, they're not resource material.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:08.280
[Guest]: I mean, it's like if somebody came and asked me about my life, I mean, I'm opening myself

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.280
[Guest]: to you, right?

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.320
[Guest]: And I'm, you know, I'm asking difficult questions.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:15.080
[Guest]: So, for example, I mean, I've never done any work like this before.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.840
[Guest]: My writing has always been in a way in the more ideational observation and ideational

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:21.840
[Guest]: sense.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.640
[Guest]: I have not done work where I was speaking to people and what they told me is the story.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.160
[Amit Varma]: You've done essays before, this was almost journalism.

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.000
[Guest]: Yeah, this is, it is very journalistic.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.120
[Guest]: And in fact, all the journalists I know understand how difficult your job is.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.000
[Guest]: So it was very different territory for me.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.800
[Guest]: I learned through the process.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.080
[Guest]: I mean, what question crosses the line?

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.120
[Guest]: And I say it in the book at one point, I don't know.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.320
[Guest]: I really don't know what line, what is that line, you know, when am I really pushing it

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:52.520
[Guest]: and I'm not being insensitive and not seeing that I'm able to ask that question only because

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.720
[Guest]: I'm privileged.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.200
[Guest]: I mean, I would not ask this question if not for that, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even think

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.320
[Guest]: about asking that question.

01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.840
[Guest]: So I don't know what that line was.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.360
[Guest]: And I don't know, I may have transgressed, I'm sure.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.800
[Guest]: And but I was always aware of it, you know, I mean, you know, whenever I interview a maker,

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:15.320
[Guest]: does the maker feel confident enough about that conversation to express displeasure in

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.640
[Guest]: a question I asked, for example?

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.640
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.640
[Guest]: Because that's very, you will probably tell me, you know, if I asked you a question that

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:26.400
[Guest]: cross line, you'll just take me off and say, boss, stop.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.400
[Guest]: Because we're both of equal privilege.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.400
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.400
[Amit Varma]: So I can do that.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.680
[Guest]: No, the maker is not going to do that.

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.880
[Guest]: The maker is going to look at me, TM Krishna, who is a great singer, I'm, like I said in

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.400
[Guest]: the book, it's, you know, when I was looking back at the materials, when it hits you, right?

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.920
[Guest]: The amount of respect I got by people who are like three times my age.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.800
[Guest]: You know, automatically, I mean, just by my presence, I was considered to be somebody

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.480
[Guest]: who has to be respected, and somebody who has value.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And is there a danger that they want to please you, so they want to tell you what they think

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:55.640
[Guest]: you want to hear?

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.640
[Guest]: So, yeah.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.400
[Guest]: So that is where you build trust.

01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.920
[Guest]: That is where it's very important.

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:00.920
[Guest]: You have to spend time.

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.120
[Guest]: You have to spend time.

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:05.920
[Guest]: There were interviews there where the trust came early, there were interviews where it

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.840
[Guest]: took a long time where you could ask questions that were personal.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:14.960
[Guest]: So that completely depended on the relationship and the bond you were trying to make, however

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:15.960
[Guest]: temporary it is.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:21.400
[Guest]: You know, I think the first thing was, does the person trust you, telling you all this,

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:25.680
[Guest]: you know, sometimes it took a long time, it took a long time to the person feel comfortable

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.840
[Guest]: to, you know, say these things, or, you know, I had to coax and ask these questions and

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.840
[Guest]: move.

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:35.880
[Guest]: Sometimes, sometimes they did not say to, there were interviews where they did not answer

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.880
[Guest]: difficult questions.

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:40.040
[Guest]: They were not willing to answer difficult questions, which is also fine.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:45.920
[Guest]: That also happens, but it's still, it is, you asked me a question for which, honestly

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.080
[Guest]: speaking, there is, I don't know whether I did the right thing or the wrong thing.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.080
[Guest]: That's your question.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.080
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.080
[Guest]: I mean, I really don't know.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:31:00.720
[Guest]: I, all I can say is that I remained absolutely truthful to what was said.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.720
[Guest]: Okay.

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:02.960
[Guest]: I also took care.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.000
[Guest]: And that was the way I could respond to what you said is to, for example, change names

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.400
[Guest]: when I felt the court were very sensitive, though they never asked me to, like you said,

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:16.240
[Guest]: that even coming into the horizon, they could say that to me.

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:19.440
[Amit Varma]: They wouldn't even have realized how this sort of journalism works.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:24.720
[Guest]: So I took the decision sometimes when I felt the courts were sensitive, that I changed

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.720
[Guest]: the names.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:30.680
[Guest]: Those, I think those were ways by which I was also trying to say that this is not just

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.680
[Guest]: information.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:35.440
[Guest]: This is not just people who are giving me something so that I could gloat for having

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.560
[Guest]: written this radical book that, you know, that says these things, but these are people.

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.560
[Guest]: These are real people.

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.200
[Guest]: They are leading lives.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.400
[Guest]: And I need to respect that.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.440
[Guest]: I need to, I need to remember that.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:51.800
[Guest]: So I think that that was my way of, of remembering that, you know, when I wrote the book.

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:55.920
[Amit Varma]: And before we come to the book itself, a final question about the craft that, you know, your

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.560
[Amit Varma]: earlier books are essays.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.680
[Amit Varma]: This is journalistic nonfiction in a sense.

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:01.800
[Amit Varma]: It's very accessible.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.880
[Amit Varma]: And as is obvious from the parts I read out very well-written, I think my listeners get

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.320
[Amit Varma]: that and they should certainly buy the book.

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.920
[Amit Varma]: So when it came to craft, what kind of thought did you put into it?

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Who were your models?

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Like, were there books that you looked at and said, yeah, it should be like this or

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.440
[Guest]: none, none.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:25.280
[Guest]: So I did read a lot, but I, I think there was one thing that I kept in mind is I wanted

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.520
[Guest]: to be as close to the language as possible.

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:29.520
[Guest]: How do you do that?

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:34.320
[Guest]: So for example, you know, I'll tell you why this, I felt sometime there could be a disconnection

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.160
[Guest]: between commentary and quoting, right?

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.700
[Guest]: So the quotes, many of them are in Tamil, right?

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:42.840
[Guest]: So you're then transcribing it and then you're translating.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:48.880
[Guest]: How much can the English remain Tamil in its source, you know, I kept that in mind.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.440
[Guest]: So it remains as close to the quote as possible because it's possible to change the word to

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:58.760
[Guest]: an extent where it almost transforms in its intonation, in its, in its messaging.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:32:59.760
[Guest]: So that was there.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.660
[Guest]: Then when I write commentary and commentary, I felt that there should be a connection between

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:08.240
[Guest]: my style of writing and the voices of the makers, because ultimately this book is about

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.740
[Guest]: the voice of the makers.

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:14.140
[Guest]: So the way I tell the story must also be part of the voice that is coming.

01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:16.560
[Guest]: So I kept that in mind right through.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:21.380
[Guest]: So the style of writing in this is entirely different from anything I've written, okay,

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:27.440
[Guest]: in terms of language usage, in terms of even vocabulary, it's very different.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:33.400
[Guest]: And that was because I said it should sound as close to the voices that the book is of,

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:38.440
[Guest]: that is of the makers primarily, this is a book being told from the voice of the maker.

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:42.880
[Guest]: So that's those are the things I kept in mind, because I felt then there'll be fluidity in

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.320
[Guest]: reading.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:50.160
[Guest]: If I remained a kind of an academic kind of a tone, then there's a disconnect between

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.040
[Amit Varma]: that and the voice of the maker, which is full of the book.

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:58.160
[Amit Varma]: So though I won't understand it for the Tamil listeners of the show, is there an illustration

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.960
[Amit Varma]: of that you can give about a translating decision that you took?

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:08.360
[Guest]: For example, somebody made some people, the one important thing decision is that we also

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:13.760
[Guest]: wanted to document the various words, technical words in Tamil itself.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:17.040
[Guest]: So you have words like kottu tattu, vettu tattu, which are all completely technical

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:18.040
[Guest]: Tamil words.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.920
[Guest]: And it was very important that they remain that way.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:24.920
[Guest]: I give descriptions once in a while to remind the reader, but we wanted it that way, because

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:27.680
[Guest]: you wanted to feel what that vocabulary is.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.520
[Guest]: I'll give you an example of something.

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.600
[Guest]: So many times, you know, you retain sounds and retain these expressions that are said.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:38.360
[Guest]: Here is one from Varadhan.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.240
[Guest]: So I'll start with a paragraph.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:46.280
[Guest]: The most beautiful part of our conversation was the elegant simplicity with which he described

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.200
[Guest]: the music of artists.

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:51.840
[Guest]: M. Chandrasekhar violinist was set for Madurai Subbu.

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:59.320
[Guest]: Now was set for Madurai Subbu is very much from Tamil, that means they are a team together.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.320
[Guest]: Okay.

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.040
[Guest]: We retain, I retained it because I wanted that sound.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.080
[Guest]: So and it's then it's Varadhan's voice, right?

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.840
[Guest]: Otherwise it becomes my voice and Varadhan says basically, M. Chandrasekhar was set for

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:11.840
[Guest]: Madurai Subbu.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.840
[Guest]: Rumba super.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:18.000
[Guest]: Okay, that's a classic Tamil expression, rumba is of course Tamil.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.640
[Guest]: At a concert in in Mettur, people just lifted him up.

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.280
[Guest]: He played so well.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.400
[Guest]: Of Ramabhadran's playing technique, he said he provided the groove so beautifully, it

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.080
[Guest]: would come along like jile jile jile.

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.720
[Guest]: Now, all this was very important for the way I we took the courts and retained its Tamilness

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.120
[Guest]: to that extent.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:43.640
[Guest]: And that was part of a decision that I made that it should remain close to the sound possible.

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:48.480
[Guest]: I remember there's some expression called sweet, I remember my editor Ajitha and I had

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:53.880
[Guest]: this huge discussion about this expression that Johnson or somebody says, there should

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.640
[Guest]: be this sweetness, the make something to this effect, I don't remember the point, but something

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.760
[Guest]: the fact that sweetness in sound or something like that, you know, which doesn't make any

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.760
[Guest]: sense.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.560
[Guest]: But it's an expression of an idea, a feeling, right?

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:12.600
[Guest]: We retained all that as close as possible to the Tamil original as possible.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.800
[Guest]: So that is a very important part.

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.120
[Guest]: So because when you're reading this book, you're not only reading the stories, but actually

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.280
[Guest]: immersing yourself in language, in the culture, in the way things are said, in the way things

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.280
[Guest]: are exchanged.

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:25.960
[Guest]: And that was very important for me.

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:31.880
[Amit Varma]: No, so I recently did an episode on translation, recorded an episode on the art of translation

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:35.680
[Amit Varma]: with Arunabha Sinha, who's done more than 50 Bengali novels, though it will broadcast

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.040
[Amit Varma]: after this one.

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:40.440
[Amit Varma]: But one of the interesting things I came across while researching for that was this quote

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:45.040
[Amit Varma]: by Richard Pevear, about translation being a dialogue between two languages.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.200
[Amit Varma]: And what you just said about the example that so and so was set for so and so, you know,

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.520
[Amit Varma]: almost seems like you're modifying English as well.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.040
[Guest]: So who knows, that could take off because it's a...

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:59.560
[Guest]: It's very important that we think in that in those terms, especially in India, and wherever

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.840
[Guest]: English is spoken, I think there are many kinds of, you know, this language snootiness

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.680
[Guest]: is also something we're all obsessed with.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.360
[Guest]: I think there are different kinds of English, there are different, you know, even in whether

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.480
[Guest]: it's Kannada or Tamil, there are different kinds of Tamil, different kinds of Hindi,

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:16.080
[Guest]: there is a different forms of idea of English too.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:22.160
[Guest]: And it's very closely connected with Malayalam or with Hindi or with Tamil and these terms

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.160
[Amit Varma]: that come into being.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:26.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's a feature, not a bug, if you're, you know, taking some of that local flavor

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.680
[Guest]: and becoming something of your own.

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:29.920
[Guest]: Absolutely, absolutely.

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.320
[Guest]: That flexibility is what really makes language interesting.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.320
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:36.320
[Guest]: Right?

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.320
[Guest]: If not, you would not, language would die.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:41.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we have language Nazis saying that, you know, pre-poning is not a word and all

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:42.760
[Guest]: of that.

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:43.760
[Guest]: I'm saying everybody uses pre-poning.

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.760
[Guest]: My dad used to keep saying that, by the way, I used to say pre-poning, he used to say advanced.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Pre-poning, one, it has become a word because so many people have used it and two, it's

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.600
[Guest]: a lovely word.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.600
[Guest]: It works.

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:56.600
[Guest]: Yeah, it does work.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.600
[Guest]: It means I like the word.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.600
[Guest]: I'm sticking with pre-poning.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:01.440
[Guest]: So by the way, that's another thing that I love creating words.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:07.520
[Guest]: So sometimes I just land up just creating this word and then we'd have this, my editor

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.560
[Guest]: and I would say, what is this word you've used?

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.800
[Guest]: I said, no, I just created it.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.120
[Amit Varma]: So that's I think part of the.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.400
[Amit Varma]: And then what does your editor do?

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.240
[Guest]: It depends on the word.

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:21.320
[Guest]: And then we argue about it and if it's acceptable, we let it go.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320
[Guest]: Sometimes I know you just can't use it.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320
[Guest]: Give me an example of a neologism.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:28.880
[Guest]: So I'll give you one from the older book, Syllabomelodic Identity.

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.880
[Guest]: Syllabomelodic Identity.

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:34.120
[Guest]: It comes from Southern music that is entirely my creation.

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:40.840
[Guest]: So when I said that language in music is not about the word, but it's about the syllable

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.300
[Guest]: and the movement of the syllable musically.

01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:48.000
[Guest]: So I called it Syllabomelodic Identity.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Quite beautiful.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.680
[Amit Varma]: We'll have to sort of discuss that at a separate time.

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of get to the book.

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.400
[Amit Varma]: And one of the first things that struck me because it's on page one, that's why it struck

01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:03.720
[Amit Varma]: me, is your whole notion when you're talking about Nanganallur, you write, quote, Nanganallur

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:09.400
[Amit Varma]: is a congested urban village, more specifically a Brahman enclave within a village, stop quote.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.800
[Amit Varma]: And then later you say, quote, I've always thought of Nanganallur as a poor man's mile

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.320
[Amit Varma]: apart, a cliched symbol of Brahmanism, stop quote.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:22.120
[Amit Varma]: But one theme that sort of comes up at times during your book is how geographical location

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:24.640
[Amit Varma]: and social location are so interlinked.

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.640
[Guest]: It's very important.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:27.080
[Guest]: It's true of every city.

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.360
[Guest]: It's true of every place.

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:32.000
[Guest]: You know, we think that urbanization somehow dissolves all this.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.440
[Guest]: We have this notion that in the village, it's more stark.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.440
[Guest]: It is more stark.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.360
[Guest]: There's no doubt that the lines are sharper and you can see it.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.400
[Amit Varma]: I think urbanization helps, but nothing is a panacea.

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.400
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:44.960
[Guest]: It helps in certain ways because transactions change and requirements change.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:49.760
[Guest]: But if you look at any city, look at Mumbai, look at any other city, you will find these

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:52.300
[Guest]: multiple enclaves that are created, right?

01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:56.200
[Guest]: You know, for example, who's going to live in South Bombay, you know, you know, all these

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.160
[Guest]: things, you know, where the South Indian population is.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.600
[Guest]: So, you know, and so, you know, some people actually, my friends of mine said, how can

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.800
[Guest]: you start the book by saying you thought of it as a Brahman enclave?

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.800
[Guest]: They got upset.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.040
[Guest]: I said, but that's exactly how I've seen it.

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:11.760
[Guest]: You see it that way too.

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:16.920
[Guest]: Because if you think of Nanganallur, it was a place where people who did not live in Mylapore,

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.720
[Guest]: which is a middle class Brahman enclave, moved to at some point of time.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:22.440
[Amit Varma]: So it's like Bandra is to South Bombay.

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.440
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.640
[Guest]: I mean, we all have it.

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:30.400
[Guest]: So it's very important for us to identify that within our city structures, within our,

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.280
[Guest]: you know, habitations, these, none of these habitations are accidental.

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.200
[Guest]: We're making these decisions because of so many reasons.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.000
[Guest]: So we're looking for similar people.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.040
[Guest]: So when I say similar people, what are we saying, we look at all these markers, we're

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:46.240
[Guest]: looking at caste, we're looking at school, we're looking at many things, who is going

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.160
[Guest]: to be my children's classmate in this school?

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:53.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's not necessary, like we said earlier, that you're thinking of caste per se, but

01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.720
[Guest]: it's what your comfort zone is.

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:56.920
[Guest]: And your comfort zone is designed by all these things.

01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:02.440
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, you know, how many of how many people be comfortable to live in a gay

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.440
[Guest]: neighborhood?

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.840
[Guest]: You know, because they look at it and say, oh, I don't want to be here.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.360
[Guest]: You may not even think that you processed it that way, but you are making these decisions.

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:15.400
[Guest]: And therefore cities themselves have these little little pockets that function in those

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.400
[Guest]: in those manners.

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:18.200
[Guest]: And that's why Nanganallur is a certain pocket.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.760
[Guest]: Even within Mylapore and Alwarpet, there's a difference because there is certain money

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.440
[Guest]: involved and you see those distinctions coming in.

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:32.080
[Guest]: So all our habitations, all our city living is filled with these kind of, I had this huge

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:36.600
[Guest]: argument with a man from Kolkata about this, you know, Kolkata is not like that.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.680
[Guest]: So I said, I'm going to put a wager on this one.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:40.680
[Guest]: I don't know Kolkata.

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.760
[Guest]: He said, okay, he's promised to spend two months about it and get back to me.

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.000
[Guest]: I said, I'm sure you can draw these lines everywhere.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
[Guest]: He did.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
[Guest]: He's not yet got back.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
[Guest]: I'm waiting.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
[Amit Varma]: Okay, he's run away.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm listening to this Kolkata person kindly bite the bullet.

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:57.360
[Amit Varma]: It will help society if you confess that you that you were wrong.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.600
[Amit Varma]: No, but I got to tell you, I mean, although caste is not necessarily involved, there is

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:07.200
[Amit Varma]: more class and coolness, but I live on Johu-Varsova link road, which is basically next to Varsova

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.840
[Amit Varma]: and very far from Johu.

01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:11.360
[Amit Varma]: But all my neighbors say, oh, we live in Upper Johu.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.360
[Unknown]: Yeah, exactly.

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.720
[Guest]: It's the same kind of absolutely shit that's going down there, though, in this case, it's

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:18.720
[Guest]: more.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.680
[Guest]: We live in a place called Nilangare now in Chennai.

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:24.840
[Guest]: The road we live in is not the cool road, the next road.

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:27.360
[Guest]: So anybody I say Nilangare, oh, you live in Kashirena Drive.

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.720
[Guest]: I said, no, I don't live on Kashirena Drive.

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:32.720
[Guest]: I live in this little thing called Singaravelento street.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Kashirena Drive sounds very nice.

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.040
[Amit Varma]: If you were living there, I would have visited you.

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:38.040
[Guest]: But now I'm not.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:41.600
[Amit Varma]: No, you're not going to come to my place.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.720
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, who are Sebastian and Svans?

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:44.720
[Guest]: Give me the background of this.

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:51.440
[Guest]: So Sebastian's, all these names have their Tamil equivalents, it's Sevityan.

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:59.960
[Guest]: And Sevityan seems to be from my research, the oldest full Mridangam maker I can trace.

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:05.040
[Guest]: So Sebastian's cousin Ratnam is somebody who is in the cover of the book.

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.040
[Guest]: He lived in Madurai.

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.860
[Guest]: He'd moved to Madurai when he was much younger.

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:12.160
[Guest]: But he identified and came to, told Sebastian and his father that, you know, you have so

01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.920
[Guest]: many Mridangam players in Tanjavur, why are you making Tawals?

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.920
[Unknown]: This is 1910s, 1920s.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.400
[Unknown]: This must be around that time.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:21.400
[Guest]: See, other thing, you know, timeline's very difficult in oral stories.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.800
[Guest]: You don't know exactly when you're trying to trace it.

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:25.880
[Guest]: So I'll place it around that time.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.400
[Guest]: And he says, what are you guys doing with Tawal?

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.600
[Guest]: You guys have so many Mridangam players in Tanjavur.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:32.640
[Guest]: In Tanjavur, you had a lot of Mridangam players because there was Harikatha happening, there

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.960
[Guest]: was Bharatanatyam, then called Sadir.

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:36.480
[Guest]: Sadir was happening.

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:39.320
[Guest]: And you also had concerts, Carnatic concerts happening.

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.940
[Guest]: So you had a lot of people playing the Mridangam.

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:46.080
[Guest]: So the market was there and he's saying, why are you not exploiting the market?

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.480
[Guest]: So Sebastian begins.

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.160
[Guest]: He begins first working with Tanjavur Vaidyanath Iyer.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.000
[Guest]: And that's when the story, their family story begins.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.960
[Guest]: And Sebastian's three sons turn out to be the most important three names in Mridangam

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:01.960
[Guest]: making.

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:09.080
[Guest]: Shengol, the oldest, probably, probably not the most skilled of the three.

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.800
[Guest]: Second is Parland.

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:14.360
[Guest]: So Parland's actual name is Fernandes.

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.640
[Guest]: And the third is Shetty, okay, whose name is Anthony.

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:20.880
[Amit Varma]: And the point to note is that, you know, there's a distinction, as you point out in your book,

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.560
[Amit Varma]: which people make between converted Christians and, you know, Christians from abroad.

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:30.120
[Amit Varma]: This sort of carries the implication that these are actually lower caste people who

01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.200
[Amit Varma]: converted to Christians.

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.200
[Amit Varma]: So they're still lower caste.

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.320
[Guest]: It doesn't matter if they're Christians, right?

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.320
[Guest]: This remains.

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.320
[Guest]: That remains, that remains.

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.880
[Guest]: The notion that, like you said, they've become Christians does not change the, move them

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:43.120
[Guest]: away from the caste identity.

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:44.760
[Guest]: You can check out, but you can never leave.

01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.760
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:49.080
[Guest]: And then in a way you're also saying that's why they're still there.

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.760
[Guest]: I mean, upper caste people are not going to convert.

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.120
[Guest]: Why should we convert?

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.120
[Guest]: You know?

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:57.120
[Guest]: So there's that whole narration that's going subconsciously in this.

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.120
[Guest]: So they've converted.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:02.200
[Guest]: I mean, I tried, I mean, again, the whole notion that who's converted, who's not converted,

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:03.200
[Guest]: you know, we don't know.

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.720
[Guest]: So they've seemed to have embraced Christianity.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.800
[Guest]: I would say early 20th century, I mean, late 19th century, maybe early 20th centuries when

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.520
[Guest]: they seem to have that period, they've embraced Christianity.

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:19.000
[Guest]: And this family lived in the street called Keerthikar Street, okay, and they still have

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
[Guest]: their homes there.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000
[Guest]: In Tanjavur.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
[Guest]: In Tanjavur.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:28.280
[Guest]: And these three brothers start going to all these towns nearby, Kumbakonam, you know,

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.360
[Guest]: Myladurai, Tiruvannamalur, all these places and doing work.

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:36.880
[Guest]: And at the same time, you have this Vaidyanath Iyer, who becomes this great teacher.

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:41.840
[Guest]: And then you have the biggest superstar of Carnatic percussion, Palgat Maniyar, moving

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.840
[Guest]: to Tanjavur.

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:43.840
[Guest]: And why does he move?

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.160
[Guest]: Because the best makers are there.

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.000
[Guest]: And Paraland is there.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.980
[Guest]: And then, because of such a huge stature that Maniyar has within the whole Carnatic imagination,

01:45:54.980 --> 01:46:00.120
[Guest]: the makers that make for Maniyar automatically become those that everybody else seeks, because

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.800
[Guest]: they want that kind of sound.

01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:06.920
[Guest]: So Maniyar's most powerful competitor was Palani Subramaniam Pillai.

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:11.480
[Guest]: And there is this tussle for makers between them, you know, and Palani is not a Brahmin.

01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:16.760
[Guest]: So there is a tussle there between them, not only because of abilities, because of caste

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:21.480
[Guest]: differences, but there's also a tussle for getting the best maker for themselves.

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:25.160
[Guest]: So there is this multiple little competitions that are happening.

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:30.940
[Guest]: And from Paraland, if you see, in fact, that family tree is mind boggling.

01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:35.800
[Guest]: Now there are about, I don't know how many makers in that family, I think 30 plus.

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.520
[Guest]: And that whole family is now in the business of making mridangams.

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.640
[Guest]: This is Tanjavur.

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:45.000
[Guest]: Then you have a tradition that is happening in Chennai, then Madras.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.340
[Guest]: You have Telugu speaking people making Madras.

01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:50.640
[Guest]: You also have a pretty old tradition in near Palakkad.

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.600
[Guest]: Then you have a tradition in Andhra.

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:55.000
[Guest]: So you have other pockets also.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.400
[Guest]: But the major contribution and the influence comes from the Tanjavur tradition.

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And I found one story really entertaining and telling about how Mani Iyer wants a particular

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:11.280
[Unknown]: kind of sound on his left side, which Palani gets.

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:15.800
[Amit Varma]: But even though they have the same maker, which is Paraland, as you said, if I pronounced

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:16.800
[Amit Varma]: it correctly.

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:18.800
[Guest]: Throughout this episode, I have pronounced everything wrong.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:22.360
[Guest]: Actually you have done a pretty decent job, by the way.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:26.960
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I have no bones about my bad pronunciation in every single language.

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.080
[Amit Varma]: That's what, you know, being half Bengali does.

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.280
[Amit Varma]: You pronounce everything wrong in every language.

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:34.280
[Amit Varma]: So tell us a story about that.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.280
[Guest]: So that's a very interesting story.

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:40.360
[Guest]: This is a very famous story that has been told many times in the folklore.

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.560
[Guest]: And it's a very telling story, like you said, it's a very interesting story.

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.940
[Guest]: So basically the Mridangam has two sides.

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:50.360
[Guest]: The one that you see, if you just go on YouTube, click any Carnatic concert, you will see the

01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:52.480
[Guest]: black spot on the right side.

01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:53.480
[Guest]: That's the dominant side.

01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:57.800
[Guest]: Then you have a bassy end like the Daga of the tabla, which on the left, which you don't

01:47:57.800 --> 01:47:58.800
[Guest]: see.

01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.880
[Guest]: So Palani was known for his, when Palani, by the way, is not his name, his name is Subramaniam

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Pillai.

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Palani is a place.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:05.880
[Amit Varma]: Apologies.

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:06.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:07.880
[Guest]: Okay.

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:08.880
[Guest]: So we all call him Palani.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:09.880
[Guest]: No apologies.

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:10.880
[Guest]: We all call him Palani.

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:11.880
[Guest]: So that's a very, very South Indian thing.

01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:12.880
[Guest]: We start talking, you know, we call Aryakudi.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:13.880
[Guest]: Aryakudi, Ramanuja Yengar is his name.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:14.880
[Guest]: Aryakudi is the place.

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.280
[Guest]: We start calling them by the place.

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:20.360
[Guest]: So Palani's left is like exquisite.

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:26.600
[Guest]: He gets this little, very interesting baritone kind of movement, kind of sound.

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.600
[Guest]: And he has a special technique also.

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.480
[Guest]: Now there is this battle between Maniyar and Palani.

01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:35.520
[Guest]: Nobody can, I mean, they had, they were congenial with each other.

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:41.160
[Guest]: They were friends and they even shared diocese, but yet there is this little thing.

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:47.080
[Guest]: And but the sound of Palani's on this left, on the base side, Maniyar could never get.

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:48.080
[Guest]: Okay.

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:52.560
[Guest]: So in that competition, Paraland is making mridangams for both these people.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.920
[Guest]: So once Paraland has gone to Trichy, where Palani lived, done some work and come back.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.920
[Guest]: So Maniyar doesn't stop.

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:02.640
[Guest]: He says, okay, what do you do there?

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:05.760
[Guest]: I did some couple of, I made a couple of mridangams for him.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:07.880
[Guest]: What do you do special for him?

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.200
[Guest]: No, I just did what I do for you.

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200
[Guest]: Really?

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.200
[Guest]: Are you sure?

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.680
[Guest]: Then he leaves it.

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.120
[Guest]: But he's like, he really wants to know.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.600
[Guest]: He comes back and keeps bothering Paraland.

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:19.800
[Guest]: But I never get the sound on the left like he does.

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:20.800
[Guest]: You do something for him.

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:21.800
[Guest]: No, sir.

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:22.800
[Guest]: I do the same thing.

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.000
[Guest]: So this goes on and finally says, you have to make a mridangam for me so that the left

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.120
[Guest]: sound is as good as Palani's left sound.

01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:33.800
[Guest]: So this man does it once, does it twice, does it thrice, every time Maniyar comes and says,

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.800
[Guest]: this is not it.

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.520
[Guest]: It's not, I'm not getting the same effect that he gets.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:40.520
[Guest]: Finally, Maniyar is off to some city for a concert.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.840
[Guest]: So Paraland tells him, you go and come, sir.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.280
[Guest]: By the time you come, I will get it organized for you.

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.400
[Guest]: I will get special skin also for it.

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.400
[Guest]: He comes back.

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.400
[Guest]: He's testing all mridangams.

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.760
[Guest]: He says, where is that mridangam?

01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:55.560
[Guest]: The family were telling me soon that mridangam started, they start calling the mridangam

01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:56.560
[Guest]: itself Palani mridangam.

01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.560
[Guest]: So it's interesting.

01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:03.040
[Guest]: So he comes back and then he tests that one.

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:04.040
[Guest]: He says, no.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:07.320
[Guest]: I think by this time, Paraland has had enough of it, right?

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:11.480
[Guest]: So he turns around and says, sir, I will say something you should not misunderstand.

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:12.480
[Guest]: He says, what?

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.760
[Guest]: He says, that sound is in his hand, not in the skin.

01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:18.220
[Guest]: So Maniyar is shocked.

01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:21.600
[Guest]: So I can't imagine anybody who would probably tell Maniyar this, right?

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.280
[Guest]: Because he's this huge figure.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:27.680
[Guest]: Maniyar is like, you're telling me that I'll never get this sound all my life?

01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:28.680
[Guest]: That's in his hand.

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:30.400
[Guest]: So in Tamil, the word is kai vaag, okay?

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.960
[Guest]: We say it also for cooking, right?

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:35.560
[Guest]: When people, you make the same dish, somebody, somebody have is in the hair or green fingers.

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.040
[Guest]: It's very similar to that.

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.560
[Guest]: So he says that sound is in Palani's hand.

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.240
[Guest]: So almost Maniyar gives up.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:47.040
[Guest]: But what's interesting is, is that this is a story that has been retold many times.

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:51.880
[Guest]: And that also tells you about that relationship between Maniyar and Palani, which is actually

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.880
[Amit Varma]: very unusual.

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:57.760
[Guest]: It's like an outlier, definitely unusual, which is why I found that relationship extremely

01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:58.760
[Guest]: intriguing.

01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.960
[Guest]: I wish Palani was alive.

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.200
[Guest]: I wish Maniyar was alive.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:06.400
[Guest]: I could interview them separately and find out what there was because it's a complicated

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.480
[Guest]: relationship.

01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:12.440
[Guest]: But in that relationship, there are these interesting what you could call transgressions

01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:18.960
[Guest]: of norms in the way Palani could take liberties with Maniyar or in the care that Maniyar had

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:26.000
[Guest]: for him, not just because he was a great maker, but also because there was something there.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.760
[Guest]: It's actually very, very beautiful.

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:29.760
[Amit Varma]: It's very beautiful.

01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating film to be made on this if someone is sort of interested.

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:41.040
[Amit Varma]: And you talk about how the relationship between the players and the makers is one of the term

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.840
[Amit Varma]: you use as paternalistic feudalism.

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:46.040
[Guest]: So kind of just elaborate on that a bit for me.

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.100
[Guest]: But that's that's the reality of Indian society.

01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:50.440
[Guest]: This is not special of only of these two.

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.440
[Unknown]: It's true.

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.800
[Guest]: If the Indian society is a power equation, it's paternalistic feudalism.

01:51:55.800 --> 01:52:00.720
[Guest]: So there is it's important for us to understand this because we also engage in it every time.

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:04.840
[Guest]: Every time we say that, you know, we are we look at our house, we take care of all the

01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:09.400
[Guest]: people who come into domestic work, we pay for their education, we make sure that their

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.080
[Guest]: health care is taken care of.

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:14.920
[Guest]: You know, I grew up in this lady's arms as a child.

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:17.360
[Guest]: So she's like my mother.

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:18.360
[Guest]: She's like my mother.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:23.360
[Guest]: So but just like if you just dig a little deeper, I mean, are these really equalizers?

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:27.120
[Guest]: I mean, does it make that relationship really like a friend or even like a friend?

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.120
[Guest]: It doesn't.

01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.120
[Guest]: Right.

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:34.040
[Guest]: So there is feudalism allows for this possibility of care.

01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:35.280
[Guest]: OK.

01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:37.920
[Guest]: And but it never removes the feudalistic nature of it.

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:39.920
[Guest]: You're still the giver.

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:44.800
[Guest]: That individual is still the receiver that never goes away in a real friendship.

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.160
[Guest]: This doesn't exist between you and me.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.960
[Guest]: If you wanted something, there's no conversation about it.

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:50.960
[Guest]: You don't want to ask.

01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:51.960
[Guest]: Right.

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:52.960
[Guest]: We just do it.

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:53.960
[Guest]: This is not how feudalism works.

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:57.680
[Guest]: So there is this paternalistic I need to take care of these people.

01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.680
[Guest]: You know, I know what's good.

01:52:58.680 --> 01:52:59.680
[Guest]: I know what's good.

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:00.680
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:01.680
[Guest]: I know what's good for them.

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:02.680
[Guest]: I know that the children need education.

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:03.680
[Guest]: They have to be educated.

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:04.680
[Guest]: So we have to take care of it.

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:09.280
[Guest]: So I mean, there is a certain positivity to it, right, in some sense.

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:15.080
[Guest]: At the same time, it's very important that the power to make the decision is with you.

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:17.000
[Guest]: You are deciding what is good.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.040
[Guest]: You are deciding that this is how it should be.

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:24.640
[Guest]: And the other person is constantly, subconsciously, sometimes overtly reminded that you are the

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:26.720
[Guest]: giver who's taking care of them.

01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:32.360
[Guest]: There is always a feeling that if not for this individual, where would my son go?

01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:33.840
[Guest]: Where would I be?

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.440
[Guest]: So this is the structure of paternalistic feudalism.

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:40.120
[Amit Varma]: And you give an example of this where, you know, different times in the book, you have

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:43.600
[Amit Varma]: a maker growing old and saying, I can't work anymore.

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:45.760
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, what will happen to me?

01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:49.960
[Amit Varma]: And the advice given by the player is that let your sons come into the profession when

01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:54.920
[Amit Varma]: the player's sons themselves have gone abroad and they're doctors and they're computer engineers.

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:59.800
[Amit Varma]: But to him, it's logical that the maker's son must be exactly and then there's no questioning

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:00.800
[Guest]: of that at all.

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.800
[Guest]: Right.

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.000
[Guest]: You know, I took care of you, I'll take care of your son.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.960
[Guest]: Just make sure that your son is also making Mridangams for me.

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.200
[Guest]: That continues the whole thing.

01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.680
[Amit Varma]: It continues to this day.

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:11.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:12.680
[Guest]: That idea still continues.

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:15.440
[Guest]: But I think the younger generation are very different.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:17.200
[Guest]: Younger generation makers are also tougher.

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:22.880
[Guest]: And I think there is great affirmation and there is also aspiration.

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:28.640
[Guest]: So not many of them are going to really want to send their children in this profession.

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:29.640
[Guest]: I don't think so.

01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:32.600
[Guest]: I know the older generation would hope that what I'm saying is wrong, because there is

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:35.760
[Guest]: that whole, whatever is said and done, this is our family.

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.760
[Guest]: That is also there.

01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:37.760
[Guest]: That feeling is also there.

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.400
[Guest]: But I think the younger generation are not probably going to do that.

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:43.560
[Guest]: In fact, I've had one Mridangam player feel very bad that it's not going to happen.

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:47.240
[Guest]: They said, you know, if these people are all going to these IT companies, there's one quote,

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:53.840
[Guest]: one maker, one player told me that they would rather be a peon or a guard in an AC room

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:57.240
[Guest]: than do this work, though this work pays well.

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.240
[Amit Varma]: That's very interesting.

01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.240
[Guest]: Where do you think that comes from?

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:01.080
[Amit Varma]: That's very, that is not just here.

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.880
[Amit Varma]: Is it striking out at the feudalism?

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:03.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:04.880
[Guest]: No, this is said by the player.

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:05.880
[Guest]: Okay.

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:06.880
[Guest]: Right.

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:07.880
[Guest]: The player is upset.

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:13.240
[Guest]: The player is upset that the person would rather be, you know, a chowkidar, who's inside

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:20.000
[Guest]: this AC room or this peon than be a Mridangam maker, though Mridangam making has money.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.520
[Guest]: Forgetting that there's so many other things involved in why they don't want to do this.

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:27.000
[Guest]: This is classic and this you find everywhere else.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.800
[Guest]: People who say that, no, I don't find any agricultural labourers anymore.

01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.880
[Guest]: They would rather go and work in an office.

01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:35.920
[Guest]: You've heard many people say these things, right?

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:37.400
[Guest]: So it's the same mindset.

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.400
[Guest]: Again, it's feudalism.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.280
[Guest]: It is, you know, it's the same kind of feudalism that is at play.

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:46.040
[Guest]: So they would rather have these people in control, take care of them, but make sure

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:52.800
[Guest]: they are there and any kind of mobility, which is seen by the individual as being far better.

01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:55.040
[Guest]: Because it is not just about being the peon.

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:56.040
[Guest]: It's about respect.

01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:01.160
[Guest]: You know, many people like to wear that uniform when they become a, you know, like the security

01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:06.560
[Guest]: in a corporate office, there is dignity that is felt by the individual when they wear the

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.200
[Guest]: uniform and stand there.

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:14.480
[Guest]: You and I may not understand it, but then I'm happier if they are going to the abattoir,

01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:18.640
[Guest]: making sure they get the skin, making sure they're standing under the sun for hours,

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.000
[Guest]: because I believe they make 2000 rupees more because of that.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.280
[Guest]: You know, this is a very, very classic behaviour.

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:32.440
[Amit Varma]: And is it more possible today in your book you write about how at one time it was very

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:35.800
[Amit Varma]: difficult for a maker to be a player.

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.680
[Amit Varma]: No point even aspiring to that, you immediately knew that, oh, this is not going to happen

01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:41.680
[Amit Varma]: and you reconcile with what you have.

01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:45.680
[Amit Varma]: Is it more possible today with a more upwardly mobile aspirational generation?

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:48.560
[Guest]: I like to believe it is, but it's not so easy.

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.720
[Guest]: I mean, I know it's not.

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:50.720
[Amit Varma]: You still have the...

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:51.720
[Amit Varma]: It is very difficult.

01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:54.640
[Guest]: I mean, it's not just about the maker, the caste entrenchment is there.

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.960
[Guest]: So it's not just because, not just as far as Mridangam makers, children are concerned,

01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:03.160
[Guest]: I think it's true of people coming from multiple communities.

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.080
[Guest]: Very difficult to break through this, through the fiefdom, it's very hard.

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.080
[Guest]: But I'd like to believe that it will gradually change.

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.440
[Guest]: Already I know there are two, three people learning, whether they will become professional

01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:17.360
[Guest]: players themselves, I don't know.

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:21.880
[Guest]: But maybe that itself is a transition, you know, that slowly in the next generation,

01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:25.640
[Guest]: the next pedal will be pushed and then you have them as players.

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.840
[Guest]: But it's not easy.

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.840
[Guest]: It's not easy.

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:34.000
[Guest]: It is hard because still these structures are at play, you know, still these attitudes

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.440
[Guest]: are subconsciously there.

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:41.360
[Guest]: So does the teacher teach with the same intensity to the son of a Mridangam maker compared to

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.520
[Guest]: say my son?

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:45.520
[Guest]: That's a big question.

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:51.240
[Guest]: Even though the teacher is not consciously recognizing it, you know, probably not.

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:56.520
[Guest]: They presume that, you know, how much is this guy going to get, you know, enough for him,

01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.520
[Guest]: this is enough for him.

01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:03.520
[Guest]: Whereas TM Krishna's son, oh, this guy's, you know, a lot of talent will also get those

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.520
[Guest]: early opportunities.

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:10.480
[Guest]: And a lot of these things that you think of and who would have rather put on stage first,

01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:14.640
[Guest]: you know, all these things are, are definitely operational.

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:17.800
[Guest]: So I don't know, it's going to be hard.

01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:22.320
[Amit Varma]: That's very interesting, and I'm just thinking that game theoretically, even if every single

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.840
[Amit Varma]: person, every single person who's deciding a concert has a choice between, say, a lower

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:32.720
[Amit Varma]: caste new player and an upper caste new player, even if their individual instincts say take

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.600
[Amit Varma]: the lower caste guy, they will still not do it because they worry of what the others may

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:38.600
[Guest]: say and they might take the safer route.

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:40.640
[Guest]: And also, it's a very simple thing.

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:44.840
[Guest]: I give an example of names, you know, names give away identities.

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:51.320
[Guest]: So a lot of people who come from other non-brahminical communities have names that are very Tamil,

01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:59.720
[Guest]: Arul Selvan, okay, whereas brahminical communities will be Mukund, Srinivas, TM Krishna.

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:06.880
[Guest]: So if I was given two names, I was given the name Mukund, Mukund somebody, and I was given

01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:15.920
[Guest]: the name, you know, like I said, Arul, instinctively I look for Mukund.

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:19.160
[Guest]: It's just something I do like reflex, right?

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:27.040
[Guest]: And somehow I feel in the concert list, TM Krishna vocal, somebody else violin, Arul

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:35.120
[Guest]: Mridangam doesn't sound as cool as Mukund Mridangam, it sounds natural.

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.920
[Guest]: You know, so you are thinking of these things.

01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:42.080
[Guest]: I mean, you're thinking of so many things, you're thinking of the way the person looks,

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:46.280
[Guest]: you're thinking whether the person will be able to speak in, if you're traveling abroad.

01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:50.280
[Guest]: I mean, we all do this, we're traveling abroad, my colleagues, I'm thinking, can that colleague

01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:51.280
[Guest]: speak English?

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:55.360
[Guest]: When we go to a dinner, we are thinking all these things.

01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:58.320
[Guest]: It's not just about the stage, we're thinking of so many other things.

01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:01.980
[Guest]: Culturally, will I be able to have conversations?

02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:04.360
[Guest]: You know, will there be disconnect?

02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:07.080
[Guest]: All this plays a role in these choices.

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:08.440
[Amit Varma]: Can we hang together?

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:09.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:12.240
[Guest]: Can we hang together is a very important part, community building.

02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:16.440
[Guest]: So you want a similar kind of person with whom you can have a conversation.

02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:17.440
[Guest]: Is it cool enough?

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:19.800
[Guest]: You said that's such an important idea.

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:26.120
[Guest]: So in all this, the person who's an, within quote, an outsider is in a hugely disadvantaged

02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:27.120
[Guest]: position.

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:31.040
[Guest]: I mean, even women, for example, I've heard so many men say, you know, I don't want to

02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:35.200
[Guest]: take a woman violinist because, you know, it's the kind of, you know, we'll all be hanging

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.200
[Guest]: out.

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.080
[Guest]: So, you know, conversations cannot be free.

02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:40.080
[Guest]: We're not even talking about talent.

02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:43.440
[Amit Varma]: So basically, they want the freedom to make sexist jokes and stuff like that.

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:44.440
[Guest]: Exactly, exactly.

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:49.320
[Guest]: So you don't feel it's there, you know, it's easy enough, you know.

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:52.000
[Guest]: This is being said even for women, okay.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.320
[Guest]: Or they will say, you know, we can just share rooms, but you know, with women, then it becomes

02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.840
[Guest]: a little complicated.

02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:01.020
[Guest]: All these ridiculous things I said, as far as gender is concerned.

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:05.840
[Guest]: So the same thing in different ways works here too, right?

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.360
[Amit Varma]: So this is how people are thinking.

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, you are thinking about how you are thinking, even if these instinctive thoughts come, you

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.880
[Amit Varma]: are correcting for them.

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:16.840
[Amit Varma]: So you know, how do you then do it?

02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:21.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you've then added this extra layer of consciousness to your decisions, right?

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:23.080
[Guest]: How does that work?

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:29.600
[Guest]: So some people think is I just have just complicated my own life, because they'll accuse you of

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:36.280
[Guest]: posturing or tokenism or not doing enough, or not doing enough.

02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:41.040
[Guest]: People have asked me, you know, name people from other castes that you have on stage with

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:42.040
[Guest]: you.

02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:45.880
[Guest]: I'm not going to be naming people, it's their choice, you know, I'm not going to do that.

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:50.920
[Guest]: So I think that what I try to do is constantly be like you said, have that layer, make sure

02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.920
[Guest]: that layer doesn't go away.

02:01:52.920 --> 02:02:00.400
[Guest]: And I don't find it to be any way limiting my free flow of being, you know, because people

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.040
[Guest]: may think it just stops you from doing very easy thing.

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.960
[Guest]: No, actually, it helps me a lot.

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:10.920
[Guest]: It makes me see people I've never seen before, makes me spot talent that I would not notice,

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:11.920
[Guest]: right?

02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:15.240
[Guest]: Because I realized why I'm not spotted that talent, you know, or when I go somewhere and

02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:20.440
[Guest]: listen to say this person is talented, you know, and so it allows me in fact, to take

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:27.600
[Guest]: a lot of the rubbish in front of my eyes and see things in a way that I would not see before.

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:37.200
[Guest]: If anything, it's helped me find many interesting artists, share non-stage time with people

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:44.160
[Guest]: who are very different and find ways in which you can connect and not limited by wanting

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:45.580
[Guest]: the similar kind of person.

02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:48.400
[Guest]: So it has been extremely liberating.

02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:52.120
[Amit Varma]: So I'll share with you, so this study comes to mind, which I read about in a book, I keep

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:55.980
[Amit Varma]: talking about brilliant book called super forecasting by Philip Tetlock, where he talks

02:02:55.980 --> 02:03:01.280
[Amit Varma]: about this study, which showed that the most important factor in good decision making is

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:05.720
[Amit Varma]: not the things you would expect, like intelligence or education or whatever is diversity.

02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, that's and obviously, this is not about decision making, but do you feel

02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:15.760
[Amit Varma]: that diversity, just ensuring diversity without necessarily compromising on whatever, but

02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:21.520
[Amit Varma]: just ensuring diversity, sort of enhances the level of your thinking or the level of

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.520
[Guest]: your performance?

02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:23.520
[Guest]: Definitely.

02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:24.520
[Guest]: See, diversity is very important.

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:29.880
[Guest]: I think diversity also enhances the art form itself.

02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:34.280
[Guest]: Any work, I mean, if I mean, take the work of journalism or take anything, you need diverse

02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.680
[Guest]: people, diverse voices saying different things.

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:37.680
[Amit Varma]: Diverse points of view.

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:38.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you need.

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:44.120
[Guest]: So even in music, you have different tonalities, different notions.

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:50.320
[Guest]: You need, for example, the Nadaswaram, which is now not considered, not presented as mainstream

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:51.320
[Guest]: Carnatic music.

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:55.160
[Guest]: You need that voice to be amplified because you need that different sound to come in,

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:59.120
[Guest]: different notion of of Carnatic music or different notion of Khyal.

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:05.160
[Guest]: So the diversity is lacking entirely across Indian art forms to a large extent.

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:10.480
[Guest]: So the diversity brings different ways of even hearing the same Sa.

02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:13.000
[Guest]: It could be simple.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:19.160
[Guest]: So it is diversity linguistically, diversity geographically, diversity in caste, in gender,

02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.160
[Guest]: in all this.

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:26.320
[Guest]: I mean, we need people from the trans community singing these art forms, you know, playing

02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:27.360
[Guest]: these art forms.

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:33.160
[Guest]: We need more women playing Murudangam because we need less machismo in all these things.

02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:37.320
[Guest]: It's all full of, you know, showing off, showing off.

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.160
[Guest]: We need we need a different idea.

02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:47.040
[Guest]: So diversity is essential for any community building, which is truly open.

02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:53.800
[Guest]: It also is essential for art, for any job, any any area of work to really be alive and

02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:55.720
[Guest]: vibrant with ideas.

02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:57.200
[Guest]: You want vibrancy of ideas.

02:04:57.200 --> 02:04:58.200
[Guest]: You need diversity.

02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:00.400
[Guest]: Otherwise, it's not going to happen.

02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.120
[Guest]: You will be happy with what you're experiencing.

02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.200
[Guest]: That's a different thing.

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:07.200
[Guest]: But you're not going to have contestation, you're going to have conflicting thoughts,

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:11.000
[Guest]: you're not going to have interesting bouts, you're not going to have different perceptions,

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
[Guest]: and you're not going to have any movement which is forward.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And comfort zones are inherently very restricting.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they are like straitjackets.

02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:22.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, I want to move to a bunch of general questions, leaving the book aside.

02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:26.680
[Amit Varma]: But first, I have to ask you about your visit to the abattoir which I found absolutely fascinating

02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:33.720
[Amit Varma]: because you like, first of all, what really interested me is the intricate science and

02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:38.600
[Amit Varma]: almost the knowledge of which can only come from lived experience of actually constructing

02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:41.040
[Amit Varma]: the Mridangam and the different skins involved.

02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.600
[Amit Varma]: Like you point out that, you know, there are three layers, it's cow, goat, cow, or buffalo,

02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:47.440
[Amit Varma]: goat, buffalo, as it were.

02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:54.680
[Amit Varma]: And the cow layer is always a female who's had two kids, because then the skin is stretchable

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:57.360
[Amit Varma]: enough to just the right degree.

02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:01.920
[Amit Varma]: And, and your, you know, description of how you went to the abattoir and the makers who

02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:06.160
[Amit Varma]: were with you, what they looked for, how they chose what they chose was absolutely fascinating.

02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.200
[Amit Varma]: But tell me about you, you know, you expected to go there and be disgusted and repelled

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.200
[Amit Varma]: and you weren't.

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:12.200
[Amit Varma]: I thought I'll puke.

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:13.200
[Guest]: And you didn't?

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:14.200
[Guest]: I didn't puke.

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:15.200
[Guest]: I really thought I would.

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:18.880
[Guest]: I was warned by all the, by the maker who took me, Suse Nath and said, are you sure

02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:19.880
[Guest]: you want to come?

02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:22.400
[Guest]: I don't think you'll survive.

02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:28.400
[Guest]: And I expected myself to really find the place just difficult to handle.

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:34.240
[Guest]: I still, I'm not able to explain why I did not go through that experience.

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:38.280
[Guest]: You know, I'm able to kind of understand it and I try and place it in the book.

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:39.360
[Guest]: But how did that happen?

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:48.280
[Guest]: I think what was most intriguing was how there are so many reals in the world, right?

02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:51.560
[Guest]: And we don't see so many of the realities in the reals.

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:57.280
[Guest]: And I entered a new real for me as an outsider, that this isn't everyday happening.

02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:58.280
[Guest]: Okay.

02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:02.120
[Guest]: You know, every day in the morning, you have this happening in the upper floor.

02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:03.120
[Guest]: This is their old normal.

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:04.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:05.120
[Amit Varma]: The blood and the gore and the skin.

02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:06.600
[Guest]: This is the normal.

02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:07.600
[Guest]: And this is part of it.

02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:12.560
[Guest]: You know, the meat is taken, like I, the Mridangam maker always told me that there's nothing

02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:14.080
[Guest]: that goes waste here.

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:16.380
[Guest]: I told him that many times.

02:07:16.380 --> 02:07:21.760
[Guest]: It's like from the skin to the meat, everything has, the bones, everything has some utility

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:22.760
[Guest]: somewhere.

02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:23.760
[Guest]: So we don't waste anything.

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:27.480
[Guest]: I remember that, that stays with me, that whole point that nothing is thrown away.

02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:31.000
[Guest]: You know, nothing is discarded as, you know, this is of no use.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:36.920
[Guest]: And you go there, you sit there, you see them work, you see the conversation and you're

02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:39.780
[Guest]: like, this is very normal.

02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:40.780
[Guest]: This happens every day.

02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:46.000
[Guest]: They're having a cup of tea, there is gooey stuff all over the place, there's blood everywhere.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.160
[Guest]: But what does that mean?

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.760
[Guest]: I mean, what does that say of that?

02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:52.800
[Guest]: I mean, can I pass judgment on that job?

02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:55.680
[Guest]: Can I pass, you know, that is why it confused a lot of things.

02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:59.240
[Guest]: You know, I know that, you know, animal activists may find this problematic and, you know, maybe

02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:01.480
[Guest]: they may think that I'm being insensitive.

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:06.080
[Guest]: I don't know, but this is how I experienced it, that there was something that I, this

02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:08.400
[Guest]: was something I couldn't judge.

02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:12.760
[Guest]: There's something I couldn't be judgmental in, like you asked me about the old and the

02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:16.240
[Guest]: new, the previous question you asked me about, are we judging money here, for example, from

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:17.360
[Guest]: this, these standards.

02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:24.020
[Guest]: So am I judging the people there who do this every day from my standards of animal rights,

02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:26.240
[Guest]: my notions of killing?

02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:27.920
[Guest]: I don't know.

02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:28.960
[Guest]: I don't know.

02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:32.840
[Guest]: But the fact is that there was something very real about it.

02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:37.560
[Guest]: There was something, I'm going to use this word with great care when I'm going to use

02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:42.440
[Guest]: it, there's something nonviolent about it.

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:47.160
[Guest]: I know this seems like a misplaced word when cows are being killed.

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:56.000
[Guest]: But I'm saying that because it was not an act of anger, there was no, there was no aggression.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
[Amit Varma]: It's weird.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.800
[Guest]: There's something very, very weird about it.

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:04.600
[Guest]: There's something, the way I experienced it is weird.

02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:08.240
[Guest]: And they go, and I won't tell you that even now people say that, you know, that any skin

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.240
[Guest]: is taken.

02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:10.240
[Guest]: No.

02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:14.280
[Guest]: When a Mridangam maker wants a certain kind of skin, the maker informs a person inside

02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:17.620
[Guest]: the abattoir who chooses a cow correctly for it.

02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:20.040
[Guest]: It has to be skinned in a certain manner.

02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.040
[Amit Varma]: So the cuts are not on the skin.

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, there are no cuts on the skin.

02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:24.080
[Amit Varma]: And you attempted this apparently.

02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.800
[Guest]: I tried peeling out the flesh and it's, oh God, it's very hard to do.

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:36.440
[Guest]: And so there is great science, specificity, observation skills, and the way it's nailed,

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:37.440
[Guest]: it's stretched.

02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:39.680
[Guest]: It's, it's something else.

02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:42.280
[Guest]: And it's not easy and it's a very hard job.

02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:47.720
[Amit Varma]: No, and I've always sort of complained about the hypocrisy of people who are vegetarians,

02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:50.600
[Amit Varma]: but they wear leather belts or they'll carry purses and all that.

02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:55.760
[Amit Varma]: And in this case, any vegetarian Brahmin who is enjoying Carnatic music is enjoying the

02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:00.880
[Amit Varma]: sound of a Mridangam, which is put together with all this animal skin and all of this

02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:03.840
[Amit Varma]: death and blood and gore and all of that.

02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:07.040
[Amit Varma]: And the question is not to pass judgment on it and say that, okay, don't listen to the

02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:08.040
[Amit Varma]: music.

02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:10.140
[Amit Varma]: The question is just to, you know, at least don't be in denial.

02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:11.140
[Guest]: This is what it is.

02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:15.360
[Guest]: That's why I see, I have a problem with Rajagopalachari, exactly what you said, right?

02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:20.560
[Guest]: This denial that, you know, you don't want to talk about this, this doesn't exist, but

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:26.640
[Guest]: you will say, oh, what Nada in that Mridangam artistry, oh, I enjoyed it.

02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:33.160
[Guest]: But you realize that if that Nada came because cow skin was vibrating and it's in that resonance

02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:36.920
[Guest]: that you're experiencing ecstasy, you're experiencing divinity.

02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:44.280
[Guest]: Let's, let's juxtapose those words, notion of experiencing divinity from the skin of

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.280
[Guest]: a cow.

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.760
[Guest]: I mean, you have to accept that this is real.

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:54.080
[Guest]: You have to, there has to be some acknowledgement and also means it's not just acknowledgement

02:10:54.080 --> 02:11:00.040
[Guest]: of that, acknowledgement of the people who make sure that that's possible for you, acknowledgement

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:01.040
[Amit Varma]: of the makers.

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.800
[Guest]: Because someone else is going out there and skinning that cow, it's not you.

02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:08.800
[Guest]: You know, I don't want to sound like I was, you know, just as you were speaking, I'm insensitive

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:13.080
[Guest]: to, you know, animals or insensitive to animal rights, no.

02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:19.400
[Guest]: But I just want to say it's far more complicated in experience than we think it is.

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:20.400
[Guest]: You know, I don't know.

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.160
[Guest]: I mean, it's very, very complicated.

02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.200
[Guest]: You know, like I was saying, a villager rears a goat, loves the goat.

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.960
[Guest]: Any agriculturalist will tell you this.

02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:35.520
[Guest]: They'll rear the goats, they love the goat, take it every day out to graze, bring it back.

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:40.040
[Guest]: They can drink the milk and then they send it out to be killed.

02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:42.520
[Guest]: Now, was there love for the goat?

02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:43.720
[Guest]: Of course.

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:45.600
[Guest]: Was there a relationship with the goat?

02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:46.600
[Guest]: Yes.

02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:51.240
[Guest]: So are they heartless human beings because they sent it to the abattoir?

02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:52.240
[Guest]: No.

02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:54.080
[Guest]: So how does this work?

02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.720
[Guest]: I think we need this nuance when we are dealing with these things, you know.

02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:05.760
[Guest]: Otherwise, there is this, again, evil, good, correct, wrong, you know, judgments that we

02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:06.760
[Guest]: throw.

02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:09.680
[Guest]: So I think we need to be far more careful with these things.

02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:12.480
[Guest]: And that's what that experience taught me.

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:19.680
[Guest]: You know, that experience taught me that even in an act of killing, there is nuance in some

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.360
[Guest]: weird way, you know.

02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:22.840
[Guest]: I'm not encouraging violence.

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:25.640
[Guest]: I'm not saying that we should be killing each other.

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:27.280
[Guest]: But I'm trying to say that there is this complexity.

02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:30.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there's an acceptance that this is the way things are.

02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:34.320
[Amit Varma]: Even if you're not skinning cows, we are killing tiny beings all the time.

02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:40.160
[Guest]: Like you said, we are consuming things, we are consuming belts and shoes and, you know.

02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:43.840
[Guest]: And we ourselves are colonized by bacteria, so lest you think you are better than a cow.

02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:51.680
[Guest]: And sanyasis sat on deer skin or tiger skin and spoke about nonviolence and about love

02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:52.680
[Guest]: and affection.

02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:54.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, that's very interesting, isn't it?

02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:56.200
[Amit Varma]: I'm reminded of Talib's turkey.

02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:00.920
[Amit Varma]: So Nassim Nicholas Talib tells a story of a turkey where a turkey wakes up one day and

02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:01.920
[Amit Varma]: it has a really good day.

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:05.360
[Amit Varma]: It's taken out, it's given a lot of grain, it has its time in the sun.

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.600
[Amit Varma]: And then it assumes, okay, tomorrow will be like this.

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:09.560
[Amit Varma]: And lo and behold, tomorrow is like that.

02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:13.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's like that for 364 days in a row and is completely chilling.

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:14.880
[Amit Varma]: And the 365th day is Christmas.

02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:17.680
[Guest]: So, yeah, so I don't know.

02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:24.120
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I think your book is something that listeners of the show are definitely

02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:27.480
[Amit Varma]: should pick up and I'll kind of recommend that I want to move on to some bigger questions

02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:30.960
[Amit Varma]: because I've taken more than two hours of your time in.

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:33.360
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of move on now.

02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:37.720
[Amit Varma]: One thing that you've, you know, written about in some of your essays is I see disparaging

02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:40.280
[Amit Varma]: mentions of the market and I get where that's coming from.

02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:47.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, the way I see it is that I really object to people who classify state, society and

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:49.040
[Amit Varma]: market as three separate things.

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:50.880
[Amit Varma]: I think there are two separate things.

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.080
[Amit Varma]: And the market and society, I mean, the markets are the mechanism by which society fulfills

02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:56.640
[Amit Varma]: its own needs.

02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:02.080
[Amit Varma]: And where markets seem misogynist and patriarchal and rambunistic is whatever if, is if those

02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:06.400
[Amit Varma]: are the people who can really afford to buy things and who are sort of controlling it.

02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:10.080
[Amit Varma]: But I think what we've seen in recent times, and I was chatting with you over lunch about

02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:16.440
[Amit Varma]: this is, for example, there is TikTok and you could say there is even YouTube and various

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:21.560
[Amit Varma]: other means by which and ironically, Gio has played a part in this by making bandwidth

02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:29.480
[Amit Varma]: so cheap that by which you suddenly have different classes of people possessing both the means

02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:33.360
[Amit Varma]: of production and the means of distribution, which they did not earlier, the means of production

02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:39.200
[Amit Varma]: did come a while ago, but and the means of distribution, which is why I find some tremendous

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:44.600
[Amit Varma]: cutting edge art on TikTok if people look for it, which is far removed from the art,

02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:50.360
[Amit Varma]: for example, produced by Bollywood elites and so on.

02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:52.320
[Guest]: So do you think there is something to this?

02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:58.600
[Guest]: So I mean, I think my criticism of the market is to presume that the market by itself is

02:14:58.600 --> 02:14:59.960
[Guest]: a solution.

02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:04.880
[Guest]: That's my problem, because there is this belief that the capitalist market kind of levels

02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:05.880
[Guest]: everything.

02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:10.680
[Guest]: And I think my criticism comes from that belief system that somehow that the capitalist market

02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:15.520
[Guest]: structure is going to like solve all these issues because everybody has access, which

02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:16.520
[Guest]: is just bull.

02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.320
[Guest]: You know, like you said, it only functions how society functions.

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:21.320
[Guest]: That's my criticism.

02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:26.320
[Guest]: My criticism being that the market is only going to reflect what society is.

02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:27.800
[Guest]: It's not going to do anything.

02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:33.240
[Guest]: So unless you ask, allow society to ask those questions, the market will not transform.

02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:34.240
[Amit Varma]: That's my point.

02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.240
[Amit Varma]: So I agree with you.

02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:37.360
[Amit Varma]: But I'll say that's a criticism of society, not markets.

02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.640
[Guest]: No, but the market is just a part of society, I mean, you can't separate it from society

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:42.640
[Guest]: at all.

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.120
[Guest]: It behaves because market is constructed by people.

02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:50.160
[Guest]: So therefore, social construction itself is a market, right?

02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:53.640
[Amit Varma]: Because everything is being consumed, all everything is being produced and everything

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:54.640
[Amit Varma]: is being used.

02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:56.720
[Amit Varma]: I'd say all voluntary interactions are part of the market.

02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:59.600
[Guest]: So you and I speaking, this is in a sense a market interaction.

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:00.600
[Guest]: This is exactly.

02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.600
[Guest]: So that's my point.

02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:07.280
[Guest]: But to your point of the subversion that happens, that's also always true of most market structures.

02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:12.160
[Guest]: When something is pushed in a certain manner, you always find through history, you'll always

02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:17.880
[Guest]: find the counter voices, subversive voice, finding an opening that allows to ask that

02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:22.720
[Guest]: difficult question, which is why you had incredible subversive voice right through history, irrespective

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:24.560
[Guest]: of which part of the world you're talking about.

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.920
[Guest]: Now, TikTok, I'm not exposed as much to TikTok as you are, but I can see TikTok as being

02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:30.560
[Guest]: another example of that.

02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:34.840
[Guest]: Now, here we go to the idea of technology also, especially in our times.

02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:38.360
[Guest]: So my criticism of that is, again, comes from this notion that technology by itself will

02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:39.360
[Guest]: do something.

02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:45.560
[Guest]: I think TikTok is an example that you have a robust part of society that is willing to

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:50.320
[Guest]: ask these difficult questions, which actually is a good sign for any society.

02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:56.880
[Guest]: And now technology enables that as a possibility to give it visibility and to be a counterpoint

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:59.600
[Guest]: to what is being consumed by most of us.

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:01.720
[Guest]: I see it like that kind of interaction.

02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:04.000
[Guest]: I think it's a very important interaction.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.960
[Guest]: And I think that that's where technology can help.

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:12.800
[Guest]: But for example, people believe that YouTube is going to democratize art, rubbish.

02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:14.620
[Guest]: It's not going to democratize art.

02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:19.880
[Guest]: So you need a counter movement, which is going to allow to push that to happen.

02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:22.260
[Guest]: And that comes from these conversations that we are having.

02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:25.040
[Amit Varma]: So I'll, I'll, I'll just say that we are actually in complete agreement.

02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:27.320
[Unknown]: We are phrasing it slightly differently.

02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:29.880
[Amit Varma]: I do not at all mean that markets are a panacea.

02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:30.880
[Amit Varma]: Of course they're not.

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:34.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I will be completely with you and say that markets will just reflect what society

02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:35.760
[Amit Varma]: is.

02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:40.200
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, in different interesting ways, especially through technology, like

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:44.880
[Amit Varma]: I've actually said that in these difficult political times, I believe that technology

02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:49.680
[Amit Varma]: is a one thing that could surprise us by empowering individuals in ways that the state cannot.

02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:51.960
[Guest]: But Amit, you always had something that surprises you.

02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:52.960
[Guest]: But it's not a panacea.

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:53.960
[Guest]: I'm not saying that.

02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:55.280
[Amit Varma]: You're addressing it as if...

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:59.080
[Guest]: Yeah, I'm just saying that, you know, now it's technology, right?

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.640
[Guest]: And technology is just a medium.

02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:02.120
[Guest]: Technology could mean so many things.

02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:08.640
[Guest]: So people who wrote, for example, texts in the early 19th century, women who wrote very

02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:11.160
[Amit Varma]: sensuous texts that were banned at that point in time.

02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:12.160
[Amit Varma]: Those weren't technology.

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:13.160
[Unknown]: I mean, that's what I'm saying.

02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:14.160
[Unknown]: That's a different...

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:19.600
[Guest]: So I'm saying those, the medium of technology is always being used, I think through history,

02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.280
[Guest]: to challenge these structures.

02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:29.480
[Guest]: The problem happens is when, if the dominant power, societal power, becomes so powerful

02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:34.880
[Guest]: that it's not going to... suppose we ban TikTok in this country, or we ban the internet.

02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:37.600
[Amit Varma]: Suppose I'm in China, for example, I can't even Google search.

02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:40.320
[Amit Varma]: I don't dispute the coercive power of the state.

02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:44.480
[Amit Varma]: But to use an example that you yourself have brought up in your writing, that if you look

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:49.320
[Amit Varma]: at the USA, what has happened over the last century, that first jazz and then hip hop

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:54.640
[Amit Varma]: have become dominant cultural forms, and classical music is basically dying, opera is dying in

02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.200
[Amit Varma]: Mainland England.

02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:01.760
[Amit Varma]: So you know, those elite forms are dying because of the reach of mass media.

02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:03.120
[Guest]: But I don't think they will die.

02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:06.480
[Amit Varma]: Well, I mean, and the reason for that is because of where they're placed.

02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:07.480
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:08.480
[Guest]: And they shouldn't die.

02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:09.480
[Guest]: Every form should survive.

02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:10.480
[Guest]: That's a different thing.

02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:12.040
[Guest]: Whether they should or should not die is a different thing.

02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:15.640
[Guest]: But I think they will not die fundamentally, because they still occupy the same space.

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:16.640
[Guest]: The numbers...

02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:21.360
[Amit Varma]: But the dominance of jazz and hip hop still speaks to a lot, and that is the success of

02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:22.360
[Amit Varma]: the market and technology.

02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:27.240
[Guest]: Without a doubt, it speaks to a lot, but it also speaks to the fact that even now aspirational

02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:30.520
[Guest]: culture remains with classical.

02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:31.800
[Guest]: It remains with that niche.

02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:35.760
[Guest]: The niche may be only 25,000, but it's still aspirational.

02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:42.840
[Guest]: And the question is, for me is, while something like hip hop dominates imagination, mass imagination,

02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:48.920
[Guest]: how can hip hop also dominate, or shall we say challenged very, very frontally, the notions

02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:54.320
[Guest]: of the niche, because the niche still control these kinds of systems of what is accepted.

02:19:54.320 --> 02:20:00.720
[Amit Varma]: I, you know, I totally agree with you in terms of the sort of cultural domination of certain

02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:02.120
[Amit Varma]: elites and all that.

02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:06.120
[Amit Varma]: But I think if there is going to be a fight back from counterculture, as it has been in

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:08.600
[Amit Varma]: the past, then it will happen through markets and technology.

02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:11.840
[Amit Varma]: But I think we're broadly in agreement, just saying in different ways.

02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:16.720
[Amit Varma]: The other question that I want to move on, which we discussed during lunch, at which

02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:17.800
[Amit Varma]: point we were in agreement.

02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:24.200
[Amit Varma]: I don't know what now, no, but is essentially about, you know, moving away for a moment

02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:30.360
[Amit Varma]: from music and your sort of insights on music and the structures around music and moving

02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:36.160
[Amit Varma]: on to what's happening around us in this country and the crisis of liberalism, so to say, is

02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:41.920
[Amit Varma]: that one of the debates between Ambedkar and Gandhi on caste, and I'm mostly on the side

02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:44.920
[Amit Varma]: of Ambedkar, but I think Gandhi had one valid point.

02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:50.520
[Amit Varma]: And Ambedkar's point was that we have to reform society from the top down, sort of echoing

02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:55.400
[Amit Varma]: what Nehru also believed, while Gandhi and others believe that no, the change can only

02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:56.560
[Amit Varma]: happen in the culture.

02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:00.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, despite my other agreements with Ambedkar and my other disagreements with Gandhi, I

02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:05.120
[Amit Varma]: think there is something to this in the sense that I think what has happened in India and

02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:11.440
[Amit Varma]: tell me what you think about it, is that we had a liberal elite found this country with

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:16.920
[Amit Varma]: a relatively liberal constitution when society itself was illiberal.

02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Society has remained illiberal, politics has caught up.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.280
[Amit Varma]: And that is a great failure.

02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:22.680
[Guest]: Is that something you'd agree with?

02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:28.520
[Guest]: Well, more or less, yes, I mean, now in retrospect, this may be wrong to say now, but I don't

02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:36.280
[Guest]: know whether we as a society were ready for the idea of India that we were given with

02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:37.280
[Guest]: the constitution.

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:44.360
[Guest]: I don't know, because like you said, it was, it was a notional idea based on some, it was

02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:45.360
[Guest]: a hope.

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:50.080
[Guest]: Actually, our constitution is hope, is like, can we with its limitations, whatever it is,

02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:55.000
[Guest]: that can we be like this, but what it does not consider, and what it does not, the people

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:00.680
[Guest]: do not consider is unless there is ground level actual work with the multiple culture

02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:06.520
[Guest]: structures that are there in society, which are the complete antithesis of what we hope

02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.400
[Guest]: to be, we are never going to get there.

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:14.400
[Guest]: If anything, things will get worse, which is a big liberal failure, in my opinion, because

02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:20.960
[Guest]: you have this notion, limited notions, whatever they are, of equality, of, you know, of equity,

02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:22.040
[Guest]: all these notions.

02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:29.360
[Guest]: But how is it going to really happen in society unless children, schools, culture systems,

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:32.840
[Guest]: art forms are actually engaging in that manner?

02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:36.720
[Guest]: I mean, even elite private schools, where did we ever speak about equality?

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.160
[Guest]: Where did we ever speak about rights?

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:43.780
[Guest]: You know, we don't have a notion of rights in this country, we don't have what it means.

02:22:43.780 --> 02:22:47.840
[Guest]: We believe it's favorism, we believe that we should be always grateful to somebody who

02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:49.920
[Guest]: has done what they should be doing.

02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:56.400
[Guest]: So there is a complete gap between this hope, and the fact is that we never actually worked

02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:57.400
[Guest]: for it.

02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:01.480
[Guest]: So as a society, we were not ready for any of this, because this was not part of our

02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:02.940
[Guest]: culture conversations.

02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:07.160
[Guest]: This is not part of the fact that this is the India that we're hoping for.

02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:10.280
[Guest]: There is a top down model.

02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:14.040
[Guest]: And people, this doesn't mean the people on top actually completely agree to this model,

02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:19.100
[Guest]: we should also remember that, that the elite who put this structure, many of them in themselves

02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:21.840
[Guest]: were like feudal lords.

02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:25.360
[Guest]: So they wanted this notion of India, but they were not like that.

02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:30.080
[Guest]: So there is this multiple contradictions in the at the level of the constructors at the

02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:35.960
[Guest]: level of social structures, and right through our independent history, we have never addressed

02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:36.960
[Guest]: it.

02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:38.840
[Guest]: I'll give you one example.

02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:42.200
[Guest]: Look at our education, private education system.

02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:45.160
[Guest]: I mean, we expect I, you know, my children go to private school.

02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:50.880
[Guest]: So I expect my daughter, who studied 12 years in a private school, with similar kind of

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:57.600
[Guest]: people, with same kind of ideas, to suddenly come go to the new world in college, and understand

02:23:57.600 --> 02:23:58.600
[Guest]: what equality is.

02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:00.480
[Guest]: This is utter rubbish.

02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:04.400
[Guest]: You're creating an education system that is fundamentally discriminatory.

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:07.120
[Guest]: We know who are the people going to public schools, we know who are the people going

02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:08.120
[Guest]: to private schools.

02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:11.520
[Guest]: Those who are aspiration want to move from public school to private school.

02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:15.300
[Guest]: So you have not addressed a fundamental idea of even education.

02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:21.280
[Guest]: So when you don't have a, don't build a culture, I mean, my daughter's not had shared meal

02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:23.800
[Guest]: with people of diversity.

02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:24.800
[Guest]: She is not.

02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:26.880
[Guest]: So she's never going to understand what that is.

02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.040
[Guest]: How is she ever going to understand equality?

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:33.000
[Guest]: You know, so we don't have a culture of equality, we don't have a culture of fraternity, we

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.380
[Guest]: have no culture of socialism.

02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:43.400
[Guest]: So the interesting point is that unless there is cultural transformation in the way we behave,

02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:49.280
[Guest]: in the way we see each other, this preamble of our constitution is never going to be a

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:55.280
[Guest]: reality, which is why the constitution itself has so many, so many problematic parts.

02:24:55.280 --> 02:25:02.120
[Guest]: The preamble has this incredible set of lines, but there are multiple parts of the constitution

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:05.360
[Guest]: that are exactly a counterpoint to that.

02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:10.000
[Guest]: How do we let that pass after 72 years, how do we have draconian laws?

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.440
[Guest]: How do we don't see that even in the liberal world, we've done nothing.

02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:19.380
[Guest]: So let's not talk about X government or Y government, the socialist spirited government

02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:21.280
[Guest]: of this country did not do anything.

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:22.280
[Guest]: Why?

02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:27.080
[Guest]: Because somewhere we are still feudalistic, somewhere we want that power.

02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:30.640
[Guest]: We want to make sure you have freedom of expression, but we don't want it fully.

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:33.760
[Guest]: We want to draw that line and I want to decide where that line is.

02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:35.840
[Guest]: So that's the problem we're in.

02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:39.840
[Amit Varma]: So cultural transformation is essential for us if we want to move anywhere.

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:43.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I recorded an episode with Madhav Khosla, author of the brilliant book, India's

02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:48.200
[Amit Varma]: Founding Moment, which will air in, I think, three weeks time after you listen to this,

02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:52.320
[Amit Varma]: which kind of talks about many of the decisions that I think our founders got wrong.

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:57.040
[Amit Varma]: For example, all the reasonable restrictions to our rights, which I think make some of

02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:02.280
[Amit Varma]: those rights meaningless with the over centralization of the state, which they did for very interesting

02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:03.280
[Amit Varma]: reasons.

02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:08.200
[Amit Varma]: These weren't sort of, you know, automatic decisions, but you'll have to wait for that

02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:09.200
[Amit Varma]: episode.

02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:11.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm also, you know, reminded in this context of what Andrew Breitbart once said, where

02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:14.520
[Amit Varma]: he said, politics is downstream of culture.

02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:17.520
[Amit Varma]: You want politics to change, you change the culture first.

02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.560
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't go the other way around.

02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:23.880
[Amit Varma]: And this is something I'd done an episode with Akshay Mukul on the Gita Press.

02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:28.560
[Amit Varma]: And this is something that is so demonstrated by what the Hindutva folks got absolutely

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:29.560
[Amit Varma]: right.

02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:33.480
[Amit Varma]: In terms of strategy, in terms of tactics, they completely nailed it.

02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:39.960
[Amit Varma]: Is it a sort of a fundamental problem of liberal elites like us, that we want a thousand flowers

02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:40.960
[Amit Varma]: to flourish.

02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:45.040
[Amit Varma]: So we can't, you know, put a program in place like the communist world or like the Hindutva

02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:46.040
[Amit Varma]: guys did.

02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.080
[Amit Varma]: There's no programmatic way of thinking because that's alien to us as it should be.

02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:51.800
[Amit Varma]: We just want to let diversity flourish.

02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:55.840
[Amit Varma]: But in the process, what happens is that we haven't been able to counter these dangerous

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:56.840
[Guest]: narratives.

02:26:56.840 --> 02:26:57.840
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:59.680
[Guest]: I think they got it absolutely right.

02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:05.680
[Guest]: When they realized that if you want to influence people, we influence their behavior and behavior

02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:08.080
[Guest]: comes from cultural habituation.

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:14.920
[Guest]: So as long as we keep playing that and they had this very, very divisive, you can easily

02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:19.080
[Guest]: manipulate these cultures and they manipulated it right through and now we are where we are.

02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:21.960
[Guest]: So they got it right when they realized that culture is where you need to change.

02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:26.580
[Guest]: Even the anger and the hate you see today is a result of years and decades and decades

02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:30.720
[Guest]: and decades of actually playing around with those notions of cultures.

02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:33.760
[Guest]: Now at the same time, we have this liberal world in India.

02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:38.960
[Guest]: I think one of the, I believe, I know what I said, what I'm going to say is kind of difficult

02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:48.040
[Guest]: and problematic is this inability of the liberal world to engage with faith and belief and

02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:55.560
[Guest]: ritual and also propagate a certain condescension towards any of that.

02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:58.000
[Guest]: Almost say that is not modern India.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.520
[Guest]: Almost say that that is not the way we should be thinking now.

02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:05.080
[Guest]: That is something of the old and that is, of course, it is intrinsically entrenched

02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:10.640
[Guest]: in different discriminative things, but there is also something very real about it.

02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:20.860
[Guest]: The fact that ritual, faith, belief is a fundamental human need and you need to respect it.

02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:22.480
[Guest]: You need to engage with it.

02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.600
[Guest]: Otherwise, what has happened and what the RSS has done very effectively is they've almost,

02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:31.200
[Guest]: I mean the BJP and RSS is almost saying independent India is a fraud.

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:34.480
[Guest]: That whatever you had for 70 years is an evil.

02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:39.440
[Guest]: It's almost against everything that Indianness is that civilizational India knew everything.

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:41.520
[Guest]: We were this people who loved each other.

02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:43.080
[Guest]: We had no discrimination.

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.880
[Guest]: Women were goddesses.

02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:45.880
[Guest]: Everything was correct.

02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:50.560
[Guest]: And all that was destroyed by what the constitution of India without saying it, they're actually

02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:56.400
[Guest]: saying that the constitution and the democratic idea of India is actually a destruction of

02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:57.900
[Guest]: the idea of India.

02:28:57.900 --> 02:29:03.720
[Guest]: And the reason they're able to see that effectively is because of the inability of the liberal

02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:12.280
[Guest]: in the center, in the central left to engage with these very, very nuanced notions of faith.

02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:15.760
[Guest]: Respect it because people of faith feel disrespected.

02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:18.120
[Guest]: Let's be very honest here.

02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:19.440
[Guest]: They do feel disrespected.

02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:21.440
[Guest]: I know how problematic is what I'm saying.

02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:22.940
[Guest]: Of course, you have to challenge notions.

02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:25.840
[Guest]: You have to challenge patriarchy, you have to challenge caste, you have to challenge

02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:33.280
[Guest]: gender, but we have to find a way by which we can find partnership there because otherwise

02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:40.920
[Guest]: you're pushing more people towards being fanatical, you know, because now they're feeling threatened.

02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:47.280
[Guest]: And like I said, Amit, how much of explanation can you actually give me when I feel threatened?

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.280
[Guest]: I believe it.

02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:49.880
[Guest]: Then you lash out viscerally.

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:50.880
[Guest]: That's it.

02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:51.880
[Guest]: I just believe it.

02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:52.880
[Guest]: I believe I'm being cornered.

02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:53.880
[Guest]: I believe I'm threatened.

02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:54.880
[Guest]: You can say a lot.

02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:56.240
[Guest]: This makes, there's no logic in this.

02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:57.300
[Guest]: What are you talking about?

02:29:57.300 --> 02:29:59.120
[Guest]: But it makes no sense.

02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:00.120
[Amit Varma]: But this feeling is real.

02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:03.000
[Amit Varma]: There are two conflicting impulses here.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:09.000
[Amit Varma]: The first impulse is to say that, listen, we have to engage with the reality out there.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:14.640
[Amit Varma]: So at a tactical level, to be able to win, we need to reclaim nationalism, like you've

02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:19.360
[Amit Varma]: said and reclaim Hinduism, perhaps, as some have said, like I think that's Shashi Tharoor's

02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:20.360
[Amit Varma]: whole point.

02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:24.760
[Amit Varma]: But there's another way of looking at it, where somebody could say from conviction that

02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:30.080
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to reclaim nationalism because nationalism by definition is exclusionary,

02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:34.120
[Amit Varma]: but I don't want to reclaim Hinduism, even though it's better and different from Hindutva,

02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:38.920
[Amit Varma]: but I don't want to reclaim it because I want to move past it because I want to move past

02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:42.520
[Amit Varma]: caste and all these other things, which is part of the baggage of Hinduism.

02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:47.200
[Amit Varma]: So it's a battle between first principles and beliefs you might come from and the tactics

02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:49.200
[Amit Varma]: required to win the battle.

02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:52.820
[Amit Varma]: And there is and I'm thinking aloud, so I'm sorry if I'm rambling, but it seems to me

02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:59.440
[Amit Varma]: at some point that if you compromise on those core convictions for the sake of tactics,

02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:00.800
[Guest]: you change until you're no longer like that.

02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:02.880
[Guest]: I am not talking tactically.

02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:04.080
[Guest]: I am not talking tactically.

02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:06.600
[Guest]: I'm not talking about reclaiming Hinduism at all.

02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:08.600
[Amit Varma]: You've spoken about reclaiming nationalism.

02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:09.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:10.600
[Amit Varma]: Two different things.

02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:11.600
[Amit Varma]: I want to place them very different.

02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:12.600
[Amit Varma]: I am not talking about reclaiming Hinduism.

02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:13.600
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:14.600
[Amit Varma]: I wasn't referring to you.

02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:17.800
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm just saying, no, I'm saying those who say, I think, in fact, I disagree with

02:31:17.800 --> 02:31:20.640
[Guest]: the notion of reclaiming Hinduism.

02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:27.520
[Guest]: I disagree with Mr. Tharoor's position in that, because I think it's about, see, every discourse

02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:29.520
[Guest]: has to move.

02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:34.240
[Guest]: I don't believe Hinduism is some ideal discourse in whatever form that we want to reclaim.

02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:36.480
[Guest]: It is not ideal.

02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:37.480
[Guest]: Hinduism is discriminative.

02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:39.560
[Guest]: Let's be very clear.

02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:41.200
[Guest]: Islam is discriminative.

02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:42.960
[Guest]: Christianity is discriminative.

02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:45.760
[Guest]: So when we say we want to reclaim something, you're almost saying there was a point of

02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:48.560
[Guest]: time when it was this perfect body.

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:50.000
[Guest]: Nonsense.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000
[Guest]: It was not.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.000
[Guest]: No structure can be.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.960
[Guest]: I am saying, can we find a way?

02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:56.320
[Guest]: I don't know how.

02:31:56.320 --> 02:31:57.320
[Guest]: Okay.

02:31:57.320 --> 02:32:03.000
[Guest]: Can we find a way by which we don't need to discard the feeling of hope and feeling of

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:07.640
[Guest]: security that people get from certain things?

02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:08.640
[Guest]: It could be faith.

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:09.640
[Guest]: It could be religious.

02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:13.400
[Guest]: It could be even ritual, which is not necessarily connected with faith.

02:32:13.400 --> 02:32:18.560
[Guest]: Could we find a way to have that as a part of our democratic narrative?

02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:21.360
[Guest]: Can that be part of the way we feel?

02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:23.300
[Guest]: That's my intriguing question here.

02:32:23.300 --> 02:32:24.300
[Guest]: How is it possible?

02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:27.920
[Guest]: Can we, do we need new rituals, for example?

02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:31.520
[Guest]: You know, because ritual is a very important part of how we live our life.

02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:34.480
[Guest]: Do we need new imagination of faith?

02:32:34.480 --> 02:32:39.840
[Guest]: We have to think in that manner, that there are certain things that people do and we do

02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:41.360
[Guest]: that is part of who we are.

02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:43.640
[Guest]: That may not essentially be discriminative.

02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:47.320
[Guest]: Everything in the past is not that, but everything in the past is also not positive.

02:32:47.320 --> 02:32:49.440
[Guest]: So it's not about reclaiming Hinduism.

02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:50.780
[Guest]: It's not about reclaiming anything.

02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:57.360
[Guest]: It's about finding a connection between cultural practices that are there across this country

02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:06.480
[Guest]: and giving those cultural practices a democratic, modern space.

02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:08.600
[Guest]: Because right now we don't want to give it space.

02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:11.720
[Guest]: We are saying, oh, leave all that.

02:33:11.720 --> 02:33:13.480
[Guest]: I don't think that works.

02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:14.960
[Amit Varma]: I don't think that works.

02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:18.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, coming from anyone else, I would just say those are just words, but coming

02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:22.160
[Amit Varma]: from you, that's very credible because in a sense, that's what you're trying to do with

02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:27.080
[Amit Varma]: Carnatic music and you know, not, you're not abandoning the form into something else.

02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:28.080
[Guest]: Exactly the point.

02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:29.080
[Guest]: Right.

02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:30.080
[Guest]: So how do I complicate that?

02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:34.080
[Guest]: You know, when you engage with different art forms, you let them communicate with each

02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:36.240
[Guest]: other, talk to each other in some fashion.

02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:38.360
[Guest]: It's a very uncomfortable conversation.

02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:42.600
[Guest]: It's a, it's sometimes just doesn't work, but there is something interesting that form,

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:46.520
[Guest]: there is a reflection that happens, there is a seeing that happens.

02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:49.800
[Guest]: That's why I feel art plays an important role in what I'm saying now.

02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:50.800
[Guest]: Art forms.

02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:54.760
[Guest]: And I'm not talking about, you know, another thing, this country, you know, the political

02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:57.440
[Guest]: world has no sense of art.

02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:04.880
[Guest]: The left thing, art is protests and slogans and plays and songs that is about propaganda.

02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:09.540
[Guest]: These are we've been viewing, but no, I'm just talking about art forms that exist.

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:12.280
[Guest]: You know, they practice across this country.

02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:13.840
[Guest]: How can they become part of this country?

02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:18.200
[Guest]: Because I think that's where they can find ways in what I'm saying that you can't find

02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:19.760
[Guest]: in any other place.

02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:26.080
[Guest]: You know, how can we create places where these, you know, shall we say collaborate, or maybe

02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:31.600
[Guest]: even contest each other, or maybe reach out to people that they don't reach out before.

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:34.900
[Guest]: Sometimes when you experience an art form from a community that you have no connection

02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:38.440
[Guest]: with, just that experience changes the way you relate to the community.

02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:40.440
[Guest]: There's so much possible.

02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:49.520
[Guest]: But I feel discarding these practices as being archaic or as being being reductionist in

02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:55.080
[Guest]: only a sociological sense without taking the experience as being an important part is problematic.

02:34:55.080 --> 02:35:01.800
[Guest]: And I, I feel even more sure that in our present situation, it is essential that we do this.

02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:05.880
[Guest]: Otherwise, we're going to just lose more, because you're not talking about it.

02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:10.480
[Amit Varma]: So you know, you and I are almost the same age, and sometimes I have to remind myself

02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:14.640
[Amit Varma]: that listen, 60% of the country is born after 1991.

02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:17.680
[Amit Varma]: The average age is something like 27.

02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:20.640
[Amit Varma]: Everybody's like, everybody's like a kid to me.

02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's okay for me to feel this, you know, disconnected, because I'm a solitary animal

02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:25.200
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:29.440
[Amit Varma]: But you actually travel around, you engage with young people, you perform everywhere,

02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:33.120
[Amit Varma]: you speak everywhere, you know, you've been to Shaheen Bagh recently, you're part of all

02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:37.200
[Amit Varma]: of this ferment that is happening, you've actively made yourself participant in all

02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:38.280
[Amit Varma]: of this.

02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:42.520
[Amit Varma]: What's your sense that is there hope to be had from this young generation coming up that

02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:47.040
[Amit Varma]: on the one hand, we have a terrible jobs crisis, a terrible employment crisis, a lot of it

02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:51.360
[Amit Varma]: feeds into these, you know, divisive narratives that are floating around.

02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:55.880
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you interact at an artistic level with a tremendous number of

02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:56.880
[Amit Varma]: young people.

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:57.880
[Amit Varma]: What's the sense you get?

02:35:57.880 --> 02:35:59.120
[Guest]: Or where this country is going?

02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.240
[Guest]: Well, I don't know whether there can be a generality in that, but I do think that younger

02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:07.240
[Guest]: people have definitely surprised me.

02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:11.400
[Guest]: I would have thought some time ago that there's no energy there.

02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:14.880
[Guest]: And I actually think it's our generation that has failed.

02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:20.200
[Guest]: It's you and I, who I think really did not engage robustly with ourselves and with what

02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:26.040
[Guest]: was around us, especially if comes from, you know, social capital and cultural capital.

02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:30.400
[Guest]: And in a way, I think the younger generation is reminding us of what we should have been

02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:32.080
[Guest]: doing.

02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:34.360
[Guest]: So it's not just about the protests.

02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:35.360
[Guest]: It's not just about the protests.

02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:39.520
[Guest]: It's also in the way, you know, this whole idea of culture we discussed, I found the

02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:43.000
[Guest]: most interesting conversations about that with young people.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.560
[Guest]: Because when I talk about this, when I talk about the need to find these ways we can bridge

02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:53.760
[Guest]: culture or old culture with the democratic idea of India, and I don't see it as necessarily

02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:59.640
[Guest]: being an impossibility, they almost feel like, yeah, we're unable to connect.

02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:03.920
[Guest]: Because however you are, wherever you are, I think there is this disconnection and they

02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:07.760
[Guest]: feel that, for example, we don't have a language to counter that discourse.

02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:13.040
[Guest]: We don't have a language to counter this, your anti-culture discourse, your anti-Indian

02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:14.040
[Guest]: discourse.

02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:15.440
[Guest]: We have a political point.

02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:20.800
[Guest]: We have an intellectual way, but we don't have an emotional way to counter that.

02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:24.280
[Guest]: And I think that's something I find the younger people willing to engage with.

02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:28.480
[Guest]: I've had a couple of very interesting conversations with younger groups about this, you know,

02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:30.040
[Guest]: and they have great ideas.

02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:36.720
[Guest]: I think one important thing that I think young people have, which we need is imagination.

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:41.120
[Guest]: And that gives me the greatest hope, because I think if there's anything that is dead in

02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:45.440
[Guest]: political India today, it's imagination.

02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:51.920
[Guest]: Because all we have is rhetoric, reaction, followed by a cycle of rhetoric and reaction.

02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:55.960
[Guest]: There is no imagination, there is no creativity, because unless there is creativity, there

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:56.960
[Guest]: can't be politics.

02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:57.960
[Guest]: You're redundant.

02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.800
[Guest]: You're a waste of time.

02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:03.480
[Guest]: And that's why people are getting bored, especially of opposition politics, because everybody

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:05.520
[Guest]: is saying the same parroted thing again and again.

02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:07.760
[Guest]: You and I can say it, you know?

02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:08.760
[Guest]: So where is the imagination?

02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:13.400
[Guest]: And I think the younger people in the way they protest and the creative ways in which

02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:20.440
[Guest]: they're expressing themselves and saying things of great importance and profundity, in sometimes

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:25.000
[Guest]: just two words, in just an image, is magnificent.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.880
[Guest]: But does that mean everything will change tomorrow?

02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:27.880
[Guest]: Probably not.

02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:28.880
[Amit Varma]: Maybe another generation.

02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:29.880
[Amit Varma]: I don't know.

02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:34.280
[Amit Varma]: Shame on you for saying that we were ending on such a nice note of hope and I was suddenly

02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:39.200
