00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640
[Amit Varma]: No man ever steps in the same river twice, an old saying goes.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.560
[Amit Varma]: Historians know this better than others.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.160
[Amit Varma]: Most of us normal folks look back on the past as if it is an immovable block of events.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.640
[Amit Varma]: Through the lens of the hindsight bias, it appears that everything that has happened

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.840
[Amit Varma]: was inevitable.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.480
[Amit Varma]: But every historian knows that like the present moment, every moment in time was once in a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.440
[Amit Varma]: state of flux, full of possibilities, everything up for grabs.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.160
[Amit Varma]: And yet we take it all for granted, geography, culture, politics.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.960
[Amit Varma]: The historian Ram Guha once wrote about how easy it is to look back and feel secure in

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.240
[Amit Varma]: the fact that India is a democracy, that the center did hold, that we are still one nation.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.160
[Amit Varma]: But in the years just after independence, it was all an open question.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.920
[Amit Varma]: Was there such a thing as a coherent idea of India?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.800
[Amit Varma]: Could the Union stay together?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And while India is a fixed notion in our heads, lines on a map, a list of states, an anthem

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.240
[Amit Varma]: and a flag, it is true that our country has been in churn throughout its 73 years of existence,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.280
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps now more than ever.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.760
[Amit Varma]: As we celebrate one more Republic Day, let's take stock of our Republic.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.960
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.880
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.520
[Amit Varma]: It's the year 2020, 70 years after our Republic came into being.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.360
[Amit Varma]: And looking at the present time, I feel cause for both hope and despair.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.240
[Amit Varma]: Hope because I see young people throughout our country animated with the same spirit

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.120
[Amit Varma]: that inspired our freedom fighters, a spirit I had once thought we have lost forever.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And despair because we face an existential crisis and a danger of losing the values that

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.240
[Amit Varma]: our founding fathers and mothers embraced for the nation at its birth.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.000
[Amit Varma]: It seems to me more than ever, that perhaps every conversation we have today has more

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.440
[Amit Varma]: value, more urgency than it would have in some other time.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.860
[Amit Varma]: There's so much to make sense of and to put in context.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: My guest for this episode is Ram Guha, whose books have taught me so much about this country

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560
[Amit Varma]: that I love.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Ram's been on the seen and the unseen before in a two part series to speak about Mahatma

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.400
[Amit Varma]: And those episodes will be linked from the show notes.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Before we begin this conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.040
[Amit Varma]: One of the great pleasures of my life is getting to hang out with very smart people.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.480
[Amit Varma]: Many of them work at the Takshashila Institution in Bengaluru, which also supports the seen

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.680
[Amit Varma]: and the unseen.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.440
[Amit Varma]: Some of the brightest people in the policy world work here.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.120
[Amit Varma]: And every time I'm in Bengaluru, I feel so stimulated by the conversations I have, I'd

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.240
[Amit Varma]: be happy to be a fly on the wall here forever.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.080
[Amit Varma]: And guess what, I can listen into Takshashila conversations from wherever I am.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.080
[Amit Varma]: And so can you.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.080
[Amit Varma]: The Takshashila Wonks and Geeks have a fantastic daily podcast called All Things Policy, in

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.600
[Amit Varma]: which they discuss everything from nuclear submarines to privacy laws to macroeconomic

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600
[Amit Varma]: policy.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.320
[Amit Varma]: The conversations are nerdy, funny, and always insightful.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.440
[Amit Varma]: Listening to All Things Policy always leaves me feeling smarter.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.480
[Amit Varma]: So do search for the show on the podcast app of your choice.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.360
[Amit Varma]: All Things Policy.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Ram, welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.240
[Amit Varma]: Thanks.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Thanks, Amit.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, these days, you're sort of, you're speaking a lot, you're out in the public spaces

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.600
[Amit Varma]: a lot.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.720
[Amit Varma]: During the CIA protests, you were also famously kind of arrested.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.280
[Amit Varma]: You've sort of spent your life and perhaps it's a cliche, but a historian is normally

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.880
[Amit Varma]: thought of as a sedentary figure who's involved in ideas and spends time in libraries.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.800
[Amit Varma]: And now it almost seems that there is a more activist spirit in the things that you do,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.360
[Amit Varma]: much like the people you have written about, like Gandhi.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.920
[Guest]: You know, Amit, when I was young, I participated in a lot of demonstrations on two issues in

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.520
[Guest]: particular.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.840
[Guest]: One was the whole question of interfaith harmony.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.920
[Guest]: I was in several marches and protests in Delhi in 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, in the years leading

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.120
[Guest]: up to the Babri Majlis and after.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.480
[Guest]: And the other theme on which I did take part in street protests was the environment, you

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.960
[Guest]: know, destruction of forests, devastation of Adivasi lands.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.640
[Guest]: I was also part of the anti-nuclear movement, which failed to prevent a nuclear plant coming

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.600
[Guest]: up for the Western Ghats in Kerala, a movement that was led by the great Kannada writer and

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.360
[Guest]: polymath Shivaram Karanth.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.720
[Guest]: So in my 20s and 30s, I protested.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.040
[Guest]: Then I started writing, focusing on books, whatever I had to say was in my columns.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.080
[Guest]: But two years ago, actually, I joined a protest against a steel flyover that would have devastated

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080
[Guest]: the heart of central Bangalore.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.920
[Guest]: And my wife and I came out and I thought, that's it, you know, it's my city is being

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920
[Guest]: devastated.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.960
[Guest]: And it was clearly a Ponzi scheme in which politicians and contractors, incidentally

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.560
[Guest]: of the Congress Party, not of the BJP.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.200
[Guest]: To clarify to your listeners who think I'm always only against the BJP, there was a Ponzi

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.720
[Guest]: scheme of the Congress Party aimed to make money before the election.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.520
[Guest]: There are some listeners who seem to think the contrary.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.160
[Guest]: So my wife and I were there, you know, as middle aged citizens.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.320
[Guest]: My wife is a native of Bangalore, I lived there many years protesting.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.640
[Guest]: And that caught some people's eye and I thought that's it.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.120
[Guest]: Then of course, this thing happened and this thing happened, it's really as a biographer

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.000
[Guest]: of Gandhi that I feel so awful about the CIA and what it represents is discrimination against

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.120
[Guest]: Muslims, the way it was bulldozed through the kind of distorted codes that are used.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.920
[Guest]: And I had a vague inkling I would be detained actually.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.600
[Guest]: I told my wife that it may happen.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.120
[Guest]: And I told her something else I said, look, don't worry, because the Karnataka police

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.880
[Guest]: is not the Tamil Nadu police, not even the UP police.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.000
[Guest]: So I had a vague inkling, I didn't think it would happen, but it happened.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.560
[Guest]: And I'm proud that I did what it was a modest act of individual satyagraha, shall we say.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.800
[Guest]: And I was certainly inspired by the students, I was particularly inspired by the students

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.280
[Guest]: of Jamia, and particularly horrified like many people all over India were by the vandalizing

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.280
[Guest]: of the library.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.520
[Guest]: You know, I mean, let me just tell you one interesting kind of amusing and I suppose

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.440
[Guest]: even informative anecdote.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.880
[Guest]: When the Jamia library was vandalized on the 15th, right, when it was vandalized on the

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:21.360
[Guest]: 15th, I got a SMS, a message from a historian in Delhi, asking for a clarification, a factual

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360
[Guest]: clarification.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.600
[Guest]: And this historian asked me, during the Quit India movement, when students participated

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.560
[Guest]: and in the anti Indira Gandhi pre-emergency struggle when students participated, did the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.640
[Guest]: police ever vandalize a library?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.640
[Guest]: So this is a query to me as a historian, as someone who'd written both about the 42 movement

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.000
[Guest]: and the students movement led by Jai Prakash Narayan.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
[Guest]: And I replied to this friend in Delhi simply, no, because Indira Gandhi and the Viceroy

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.960
[Guest]: were authoritarians who read books.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.520
[Guest]: Now it is partly a joke, partly serious, but I think many people were horrified by what

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.520
[Guest]: happened to the Jamia library.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.000
[Guest]: And I think that led to shortly afterwards, there was a protest in Bangalore, which I

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
[Guest]: did.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.360
[Guest]: And then of course, this is this whole, the 19th, which became a very, very big thing.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.840
[Guest]: And the 19th was the 70th anniversary of two events.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.280
[Guest]: That's why it was chosen to recall why the 19th of December, which I think future historians

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.800
[Guest]: may write about in some detail, was the day on which there were anti-CIA protests all

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.160
[Guest]: over India, right?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.960
[Guest]: In Delhi, there was a big one in Kolkata, in Mumbai, a huge one in Mumbai, and so on.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.640
[Guest]: And the 19th of December was chosen by the organizers for two reasons.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:36.880
[Guest]: I think the principal reason was that it was the 92nd anniversary of 19th December, 1927

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.920
[Guest]: was the day on which two revolutionaries, Ashfaqullah Khan and Ram Prasad Bismil were

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.280
[Guest]: hanged by the British, a Hindu and a Muslim.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.000
[Guest]: So that was one reason it was chosen.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.840
[Guest]: And the other reason it was chosen was because on that same day, 19th December, 1947, Mahatma

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.120
[Guest]: Gandhi assured the mayors of the Mewat region, what is now Haryana, that they would be safe

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.640
[Guest]: and secure in India, and they face horrific ethnic cleansing, particularly in the in the

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.240
[Guest]: princely state of Alwar, and Gandhiji went to Mewat and told them that he would lay his

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.120
[Guest]: life on the line for them to stay.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.920
[Guest]: So it was a very important, it was two major anniversaries on that day.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.320
[Guest]: That's why you had these countrywide protests, and they were amazing.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.480
[Guest]: I mean, it was truly amazing what happened everywhere.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.280
[Guest]: I could say a little bit about the politics of the Bangalore protest, if you wish.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280
[Guest]: Sure.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.320
[Guest]: This is kind of a sociological point, you see, on the 15th, Jamia was vandalized.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.800
[Guest]: That evening, there were auto attacks on the AMU.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.960
[Guest]: And I think the government and particularly the Home Minister believed that nothing would

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960
[Guest]: happen.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.600
[Guest]: You know, it would just die down because we've attacked two Muslim institutions, AMU and

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.640
[Guest]: Jamia and sab log chup honge.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.880
[Guest]: But people were outraged, as I've explained, young students all over were outraged by the

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.200
[Guest]: attacks on these two universities by the pulling out of women from the library of the vandalizing

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.320
[Guest]: of the bookcases.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.080
[Guest]: And you will recall that on the 16th, 17th, tens of thousands of students from totally

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.400
[Guest]: previously apolitical institutions, such as the Institute of Technology, the Institutes

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.640
[Guest]: of Management, the National Law Schools, Christ College, all protested, right.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.800
[Guest]: And then the 19th was announced.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.520
[Guest]: Now, it'd be interesting to know who chose the 19th.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.960
[Guest]: These are the two reasons people chose the 19th.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.040
[Guest]: I mean, I heard of the 19th from Yogendra Yadav, but there would be other people on

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.320
[Guest]: Twitter, but there'd be other people who'd been involved.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.200
[Guest]: And when it was announced that there'd be a countrywide protest on the 19th, the home

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.800
[Guest]: ministry in Delhi, I mean, it is my view that the BJP in Delhi, whether it's the home ministry

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:37.040
[Guest]: with the BJP in Delhi said that in BJP rule states, there'll not be a chuharacha.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.000
[Guest]: And it was a really diabolical plan.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.960
[Guest]: So there was going to be section 144 in Karnataka on the 19th, the 20th and the 21st imposed

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.360
[Guest]: from Delhi, I'm convinced, probably over the heads of the advice of the Karnataka government.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.200
[Guest]: And maybe even sections of the Karnataka BJP did not want it.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200
[Guest]: But it was imposed.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:02.040
[Guest]: And the idea was it'll be imposed on the 19th, the 20th and the 21st of December.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:09.400
[Guest]: And the 22nd was a Sunday on 19th at midnight, section 144 would be lifted on the 22nd.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.200
[Guest]: The state apparatus would have been brought out for a pro-CAA BJP rally in Bangalore.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.520
[Guest]: That was the plan and it went completely all right, because we protested and there was

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.960
[Guest]: a major, you know, kind of a show and when some people got arrested, more people came.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.920
[Guest]: And finally, section 144 wasn't really implemented in any serious way after the first round of

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.740
[Guest]: arrest and several thousand people, you know, came to the town hall.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.280
[Guest]: But it's the kind of diabolical mentality of the ruling regime.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.280
[Guest]: That 19, 20, 21, section 144.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.840
[Guest]: And it will be lifted on the Sunday when people will be bused to show some kind of manufactured

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.300
[Guest]: support for the CAA.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.800
[Guest]: So I think this is the kind of things that prompted all of this.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.280
[Guest]: And it's very heartening.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.840
[Guest]: You mentioned in your introductory remarks, the students, right now, one of the very interesting

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:01.120
[Guest]: aspects of these protests, which started, I think, with Jamia was that the kind of iconography

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.640
[Guest]: of these protests, who are these people upholding, Ambedkar, Gandhi and Bhagat Singh.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.000
[Guest]: Normally one doesn't see these people together.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.280
[Guest]: I mean, normally, you know, the kind of presentation is Ambedkar and Gandhi were rivals or Gandhi

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.720
[Guest]: and Bhagat Singh were rivals.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.340
[Guest]: But it's very interesting that the students have brought these three people together.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.880
[Guest]: And I think there's a reason for this.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.120
[Guest]: Ambedkar, because he gave us our rights.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.040
[Guest]: I mean, today there was a very good Twitter thread by Omer Ahmed, where he said that though

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.120
[Guest]: Gandhi led the freedom struggle, it was Ambedkar who gave us our rights.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.480
[Guest]: And that's why Ambedkar, in many ways, predominates in these protests, right?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.280
[Guest]: But Gandhi, because Gandhi lived and died for Hindu Muslim harmony.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.480
[Guest]: And Bhagat Singh, because he represents the idealism and the spirit and the unquenchable

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.880
[Guest]: spirit of the young.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.920
[Guest]: So it's a very interesting juxtaposition, you know, and I think it's also kind of, I

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.360
[Guest]: salute it because we can draw from all these.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.000
[Guest]: It is, you can draw from Ambedkar and Gandhi and Bhagat Singh.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.800
[Guest]: And it's interesting to see who's not there.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.920
[Guest]: You know, Savarkar will never be there or Golwalkar will never be there.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.560
[Guest]: So I think the students have been quite extraordinary.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.160
[Guest]: And 99% have been nonviolent.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.760
[Guest]: And whenever I've spoken, I've always urged the students to be nonviolent.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.440
[Guest]: I think that's where it's either must be resolute, courageous, but above all, nonviolent, not

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.000
[Guest]: just in deed, but also in words.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.760
[Guest]: You know, I think one of the ways of shaming the ruling regime is to not to use their resort

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.640
[Guest]: to their demonizing, abusing language.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.720
[Amit Varma]: So I recorded an episode earlier today, we are recording this on January 23rd, I recorded

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.880
[Amit Varma]: an episode earlier today with Rane Koteswani on Radically Networked Societies.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.080
[Amit Varma]: And he made the very interesting point that one of the fundamental clashes in all our

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.560
[Amit Varma]: society is not just in India, is between a society that is in his words, radically networked

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.160
[Amit Varma]: by radical fundamentally networked, not the other sense of the term, and therefore fairly

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.240
[Amit Varma]: flat and you're up against a state which is very hierarchical and top down where information

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240
[Amit Varma]: flows slowly.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.040
[Amit Varma]: So the term that Pranay in fact used was that we have a state which is a relic of the industrial

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.160
[Amit Varma]: age against a society which is a product of the information age.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.300
[Amit Varma]: And listening to you when you were talking about, for example, plans from Delhi to sort

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.360
[Amit Varma]: of section 144 on the 1920 or 21st and all of that, it struck me that we also have a

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:20.280
[Amit Varma]: state with a tribal mentality against a society with a globalized mentality.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.280
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that you would say is an accurate character?

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.920
[Guest]: I mean, it's very interesting insight, it's probably too early to say how this, you know,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.640
[Guest]: because unfortunately, because, you know, the state has deep pockets and vast resources,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.280
[Guest]: including punitive resources, which the protests don't, you know, so even if they have a tribal

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.560
[Guest]: mentality, and they're not so agile, in the way in which the protesters are, they have

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.240
[Guest]: the resources to exhaust the protesters.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.880
[Guest]: So it's a little early to say, it's a little early to be incredibly celebratory about these

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.280
[Guest]: protests and where they'll take us.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.440
[Amit Varma]: I think these phrasings didn't come out in a celebratory way, but just in a way to try

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.680
[Amit Varma]: and understand what's happening.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.400
[Amit Varma]: Obviously, the state has enormous coercive power and monopoly and violence.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.800
[Amit Varma]: Another thing that struck me when you were talking about the attack on the library in

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.080
[Amit Varma]: Jamia is something I read last night, in a book by the Turkish author, Zeynep Tufekci,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.960
[Amit Varma]: and which is called Twitter and tear gas.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.960
[Amit Varma]: And she talks about all the protests of the Arab Spring across Tunisia and Egypt and later

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.240
[Amit Varma]: spreading to Spain and Turkey and so on.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.440
[Amit Varma]: And there's one very interesting fact, which just blew my mind like my eyes popped out,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.960
[Amit Varma]: which was that one common element to many of these protests, you know, whether it is

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.360
[Amit Varma]: in Istanbul, or whether it is even the Occupy movement in New York, is that wherever you

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.720
[Amit Varma]: have these large gatherings in these parks, or whatever, become centers of protests, a

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.600
[Amit Varma]: library springs up.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And I immediately thought of what's happening in Shaheen Bagh, where you know, there's been

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.920
[Amit Varma]: a spontaneous library springing up.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And and of course, you know, many things in common with what's happening right now, the

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.160
[Amit Varma]: role of the youth, the role of women, and so on and so forth.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.800
[Amit Varma]: But this really struck me, because I mean, are there sort of echoes of this through history

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.960
[Guest]: that libraries have some kind of significance?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.400
[Guest]: The echoes through history are possibly the reverse, that authoritarian regimes don't

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.800
[Guest]: like books, don't like learning, don't like education.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.360
[Guest]: And certainly this regime doesn't, you know, as shown in the various education ministers

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.000
[Guest]: is appointed in the ways in which ministers, including the Prime Minister's first day qualifications,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.720
[Guest]: in the ways in which vice chancellors are appointed in the ways in which modern science

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.200
[Guest]: is delegated.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.800
[Guest]: So authoritarian regimes, you know, don't like free speech, learning scholarship, ideas

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.600
[Guest]: of that was true of Stalin, it was through Mao and his Cultural Revolution, in which

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.360
[Guest]: all the professors were dismissed from their jobs, and it's true of this regime.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.600
[Amit Varma]: So I wasn't planning to actually ask this question during this episode, but it strikes

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.480
[Amit Varma]: me now and I'll ask it anyway, since you're talking about authoritarian regimes and their

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.400
[Amit Varma]: sort of disrespect for learning, I'd written a piece a while back where I had speculated,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it was based on a story that a friend of Narendra Modi told me.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.760
[Amit Varma]: And the story basically was this that once she was sitting at his place in when he was

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.440
[Amit Varma]: CM of Gujarat in 2007, 2008, sometime around that time, and there was a gathering of seven

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:09.440
[Amit Varma]: or eight people and the Prime Minister told them a story about how once when he was young,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.600
[Amit Varma]: his mother was very ill, she had fever.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.720
[Amit Varma]: So he went to switch on the fan and he flicked the switch on and he found that the fan didn't

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.800
[Amit Varma]: come on because there was no electricity.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.760
[Amit Varma]: And at that time, apparently Modi teared up genuinely because it affected him.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.120
[Amit Varma]: And my friend's point was that Modi because he does not read, which mind you, was not

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.320
[Amit Varma]: his fault, because obviously, he's not born to privilege and doesn't have access to books.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.120
[Amit Varma]: Because he doesn't read his understanding of the world is an experiential understanding.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.800
[Amit Varma]: So he experiences what the lack of electricity can do.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.960
[Amit Varma]: So when he is CM in Gujarat, he makes that a priority power in every village.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:49.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, he can see he can experience the value of roads and cleanliness and water and

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.280
[Amit Varma]: water.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.360
[Amit Varma]: So all of those, he makes a priority, but at a larger level, when you're actually governing

00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:00.880
[Amit Varma]: a country, in fact, the higher up you go, you also need a great grasp of abstract concepts

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.720
[Amit Varma]: and to be able to deal with learning.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.440
[Amit Varma]: And of course, while it's not his fault that he is not a well read person, because you

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.620
[Amit Varma]: know, he didn't have that sort of privileged childhood, one would then say that the requirement

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.000
[Amit Varma]: for a leader is to have the humility to surround himself with learned people and take the advice.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.960
[Guest]: In fact, you know, he's a phenomenally intelligent man.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.680
[Guest]: So first of all, I completely agree with you.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:26.400
[Guest]: I think I've also heard this from other people, that he saw his mother suffer, go far away

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.720
[Guest]: for water, and so on and so forth.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.640
[Guest]: And this is part of his welfare agenda.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.920
[Guest]: I completely believe that based on seeing him in interact and speak, I think he's a

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.920
[Guest]: very quick learner.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:43.840
[Guest]: He is an autodidact who picks up things incredibly quickly, much quicker than any other politician

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.240
[Guest]: I have seen, certainly much quicker than the likes of Rahul Gandhi.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.680
[Guest]: You know, you can talk to him on solar energy, and he will then pick up on the important

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:57.360
[Guest]: aspects of solar energy, or agriculture, or infrastructure, or artificial intelligence.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.940
[Guest]: He's got a very amazing ability to pick up new facts, new things.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:11.040
[Guest]: But the real flaw he has, and I wrote a column last week in The Telegraph about this, is

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.080
[Guest]: he doesn't, what you just said, he doesn't cultivate or trust advisors, partly because

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.040
[Guest]: of this suspicion of acquired scholarship.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.000
[Guest]: You know, he's notoriously mocked about Harvard versus hard work, but also partly because,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.360
[Guest]: you know, he can't build a team.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.600
[Guest]: Brian Modi is always more important than Team Modi.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.920
[Guest]: You know, in that column, I quoted someone who has worked with him, who said that the

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.760
[Guest]: golden rule of working with Modi is, when you give advice, total obsequiousness, no

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.760
[Guest]: credit.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:49.080
[Guest]: All right, now that's, you know, it's like, you can't, you can't run a large complex government

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.080
[Guest]: in that way.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.080
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at his first term, he had Raghuram Rajan at different points, Raghuram

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:02.040
[Guest]: Rajan, Arvind Subramanian, Urjit Patel, and Arvind Palagriha, four top class economists.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.120
[Guest]: But none of them could work with him.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.160
[Guest]: I mean, Palagriha maybe, you know, could, but then left, right, now he has none of them.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.800
[Guest]: He had people in the civil service who were capable in his first term.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.840
[Guest]: But in his second term, he doesn't have any, because, you know, if you only cultivate a

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.640
[Guest]: certain kind of obsequiousness, you'll get that kind of advisor who's second guessing

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:26.960
[Guest]: what the prime minister wants, who can never give you frank and open hearted advice.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.920
[Guest]: So I think that is really his great flaw.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.760
[Guest]: And apart from his sectarianism, which has been noted and widely commented upon, but

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:40.360
[Guest]: apart from the ideology, I think it's a personality flaw, a person who cannot build a team, who

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:46.960
[Guest]: thinks that a few bureaucrats will run the show for him, who consistently undermines

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960
[Guest]: his cabinet ministers.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:54.600
[Guest]: I'll give you one example of this, you know, Arun Jaitley was very close to Modi.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.320
[Guest]: He saved his job in 2002.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.520
[Guest]: He advised him on many legal issues.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.560
[Guest]: They were very close, right, had been for many years.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:10.240
[Guest]: But he was still not willing to give Jaitley, you know, complete autonomy in running his

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.240
[Guest]: ministry.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.920
[Guest]: Now it's well known, or it's overwhelmingly likely that Jaitley was not consulted about

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920
[Guest]: demonetization.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.080
[Guest]: This has been spoken about, but there's another telling, smaller, but telling episode, which

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.400
[Guest]: tells you how he did not even respect Jaitley in the way you should respect your senior

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.720
[Guest]: cabinet colleague.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:35.280
[Guest]: Jaitley had gone for an IMF meeting in Washington, when his beto noire, an arch enemy within

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.440
[Guest]: the party, Subramaniam Swamy was appointed a Rajya Sabha MP.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.960
[Guest]: So Mr. Modi was telling Jaitley, even you better watch out, I'll put someone, you know,

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960
[Guest]: at your heels.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.400
[Guest]: Now you can't run a team like this, you just can't run a team in this kind of insecure

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400
[Guest]: paranoid way.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, I intended this episode and intend this episode to be more about the broader

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.000
[Amit Varma]: currents of history than individuals.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.320
[Amit Varma]: But I can't help but follow up and ask another question, which is, how much of and this is

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.520
[Amit Varma]: not just in the context of Modi, but you know, I'll come to that.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.120
[Amit Varma]: How much of history is determined by the happenstance of particular individuals and positions of

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.920
[Amit Varma]: power and I'll break it up into two parts.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.760
[Amit Varma]: One part is of course, the present part, where it isn't necessary that the head of the BJP

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.280
[Amit Varma]: would necessarily be somebody like Modi when we've had leaders like Vajpayee before.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.200
[Amit Varma]: That's one thing and you have a current of events like what happened in Gujarat where

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, it the rights arguably helped him consolidate his position, Pramod Mahajan dying

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.800
[Amit Varma]: at a point where he was fairly strong influence in the party and so on and so forth.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And eventually he comes to power.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.480
[Amit Varma]: And the other element of happenstance, which I suspect that you'll have a strong opinion

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.520
[Amit Varma]: on is, it strikes me that, you know, over the last year, I've done a number of episodes

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.000
[Amit Varma]: trying to understand Hindu conservatism and sort of looking at the history of this last

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
[Amit Varma]: century.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.120
[Amit Varma]: And it struck me over this time that we were in a sense, very lucky to have Nehru as Prime

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.120
[Amit Varma]: Minister at the time he was, because it seems to me that a lot of the leaders around him

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:08.160
[Amit Varma]: in the Congress Party were either conservatives, and I don't mean that in a bad way, as you

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.360
[Amit Varma]: know, the current, but were Hindu conservatives leader, not Hindu conservative leaders, like

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, Patel, Prasad, Pant and so on.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.960
[Amit Varma]: And he almost seems like a force apart, even when it comes to the episode of the Ram idol

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.000
[Amit Varma]: being actually planted in the Babri Marjid, which was a Hindu Mahasabha plot.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.240
[Amit Varma]: But when Nehru said get the idol out immediately, you know, Pant was CM of UP, Lal Bahadur Shastri

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.960
[Amit Varma]: was Home Minister of UP and they ignored him because their sympathies lay with the cause.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.680
[Amit Varma]: So how much of our history is determined by this sort of happenstance and in the case

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.880
[Amit Varma]: of Nehru, I've asked this to various people, I'd love to know what you think.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.320
[Guest]: I think it's a balance.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.520
[Guest]: I think Marxist historians diminish the role of individuals in history.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.480
[Guest]: Though ironically, they exalt Lenin and Mao as great figures, I mean, the first great

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.560
[Guest]: personality cult was of Stalin, and then of course, the second one of Mao, the other biographically

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.200
[Guest]: oriented historians, for example, in North America, where you have all these biographies

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.600
[Guest]: of founders, you know, this great Washington, Jefferson, they're the people who changed

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.880
[Guest]: everything, which is the balance, the social, political, structural forces that operate

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.800
[Guest]: that constrain what even the most remarkable individual can do.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:25.200
[Guest]: But individuals in positions of power, particularly, can shape the direction a society, a government

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.080
[Guest]: and administration, a regime takes.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.840
[Guest]: There's no question about that.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.760
[Guest]: Also, you know, the removal of individuals, I mean, you mentioned Pramodh Majan, right?

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.200
[Guest]: Now, you're absolutely right.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.880
[Guest]: Now, if Pramodh Majan had been around, he'd have been a major challenger to Modi, because

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.120
[Guest]: he had very good relations, he was close to the Bombay moneybags, he had good relations

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.520
[Guest]: across parties, he was very smart, he was self made, he had administrative experience,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.520
[Guest]: right?

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.760
[Guest]: Similarly, if Tilak had not died when he did, maybe Gandhi would not have had the opening

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.320
[Guest]: to become the leader of the freedom movement.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.000
[Guest]: So accidents of this kind do play a part, without question.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.960
[Guest]: But of course, as Marx himself said, you know, men make history, but not in the circumstances

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.120
[Guest]: of their choosing.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.040
[Guest]: So Modi could not have done what he did, right early on to become prime minister had the

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.360
[Guest]: Congress regime not had the kind of, you know, problems that it did, right?

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:22.740
[Guest]: So but this is really, I mean, this is really a two person regime.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.800
[Guest]: And there's not been a two person regime in India.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.520
[Guest]: Even Nehru, you know, trusted, of course, Patel died, but he trusted his ministers and

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.920
[Guest]: above all, he respected, he would take advice from professionals, you know, he would not

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.840
[Guest]: not decide the Gamla Reserve Bank, if he wanted to do something, he would consult the Gamla

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.680
[Guest]: Reserve Bank on science policy, he would consult Bhabha, right, and so on and so forth.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.920
[Guest]: So this kind of absolute centralization of decision making,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one could argue Indira Gandhi, we have not noted since Indira Gandhi's time.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920
[Amit Varma]: True.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about broader trends now in this in an excellent speech you gave at the Kerala

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:06.920
[Amit Varma]: Lit Fest, where unfortunately, once, you know, stray line at the end got all the media attention,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.520
[Amit Varma]: but I really enjoyed the speech, especially for the and it'll be linked from the show

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.440
[Amit Varma]: notes, especially for the meat of the speech, where you talk about how the notion of nationalism

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.560
[Amit Varma]: evolved around the world, but the divergent path that notion took in India, can you can

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.560
[Guest]: you elaborate a bit on that?

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:28.280
[Guest]: Yeah, so essentially, nationalism in 19th century Europe, where it was the first force

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:34.440
[Guest]: in a systematic way, was oriented towards, you know, making the citizens of a nation

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:40.400
[Guest]: or a particular unified territory, protected by boundaries and an army, making those citizens

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.720
[Guest]: come together on the basis of a single religion, a single language and frequently a common

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.720
[Guest]: enemy.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:51.360
[Guest]: So to be English, you have to speak English, the minority tongues were obliterated or marginalized.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.440
[Guest]: To be truly English, you had to be a Protestant, which is why the king was also head of the

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.840
[Guest]: church, and you had to hate France, right?

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:02.000
[Guest]: Now, that kind of model of nationalism, of course, and I argued only partly in just that

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.840
[Guest]: Pakistan is really a perfect 19th century European nation, India, I think, again, very

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.280
[Guest]: much because of Gandhi and very much because of Gandhi's diasporic experience, but he recognized

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.240
[Guest]: that extraordinary religious and linguistic diversity of India, which he encountered in

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.200
[Guest]: South Africa, was something that we nurtured, appreciated, enhanced, and nationalism had

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.240
[Guest]: to be built on shared values, not on shared identities, not on common religion, common

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.920
[Guest]: language, common enemy, but on gender and caste equalities, economic self-reliance,

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.760
[Guest]: non-violence, Hindu-Muslim pluralism, Hindu-Muslim unity, and so on, right?

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.320
[Guest]: Now, and the constitution in many ways takes that vision much further.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:49.200
[Guest]: I also argued that there were sections of the Indian left that did not subscribe to

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.560
[Guest]: this because they did, I mean, their heroes were somewhere else and it's also got me in

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.120
[Guest]: trouble in Kerala, among the leftists, because I said, you know, for them, it was always

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.160
[Guest]: Stalin and Mao over Gandhi, right?

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.320
[Guest]: And today, it may be Hugo Chavez, and I don't know, Hugo Chavez is dead.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.240
[Amit Varma]: So I don't know who the hero of the global left is.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.560
[Amit Varma]: Corbyn and Sanders, perhaps.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.560
[Amit Varma]: Corbyn and Sanders.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560
[Guest]: Corbyn and Sanders.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560
[Guest]: I mean, Corbyn and Sanders.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.600
[Guest]: I mean, it's astonishing how some young Indian leftists revere Corbyn.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.080
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, the only thing that can be said about Corbyn is that he's a slightly

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.080
[Guest]: better version of Rahul Gandhi.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.080
[Guest]: I mean, he's a born loser.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.640
[Guest]: Basically, he's a born loser with huge flaws, huge flaws in his ideology, in his personality,

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640
[Guest]: in the way.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.120
[Guest]: So but this kind of sentimental looking outside, right, to heroes, meant that the left was

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.120
[Guest]: kind of marginalized.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.920
[Guest]: So great pity, great pity, because they could have contributed a lot had they stayed within

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.440
[Guest]: the mainstream of the freedom movement.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.480
[Guest]: On the other hand, the gun, more strongly and more viscerally and more effectively,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.080
[Guest]: the Gandhian model of patriotism was attacked from the right by Hindutva, which actually

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.480
[Guest]: prescribed in a curious way to a European model of nationalism.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.360
[Guest]: To be an Indian, you have to be a Hindu.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.680
[Guest]: To be a true Indian, you have to speak Hindi.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.280
[Guest]: And to be a truer Indian, you have to hate Pakistan, you know, that's kind of the model

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.280
[Guest]: of nationalism.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.120
[Amit Varma]: Hate Pakistan later, but hate Muslims to begin with, pre-independence.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.560
[Guest]: Yes, hate Muslims to begin with, but also actually hate Pakistan to begin with, because

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.000
[Guest]: hate Muslims came from, why did partition happen?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.720
[Guest]: Because the Muslims, we could not trust them, right.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:19.920
[Guest]: So I talked about this, why the Gandhian model of patriotism ceded ground to the Hindutva

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.680
[Guest]: model of Jingoism and why we need to reclaim it.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.160
[Guest]: But I also talked about, you know, the failures of the left, the failures of the Congress

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.960
[Guest]: Party, the growth of religious fundamentalism worldwide, and how this is played into the

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.200
[Guest]: hands of Hindutva.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.960
[Guest]: But I mean, I'm someone who has always called himself a patriot.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960
[Guest]: I've never been shy.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.120
[Guest]: I mean, I don't believe you can be a world citizen.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.600
[Guest]: I mean, I believe that you can be a citizen of Bangalore, of Church Street, where we are

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:50.800
[Guest]: talking, of the contourment, of Karnataka, of India, but because you can identify with

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.560
[Guest]: your locality, your town, your taluk, your district, your watershed, you could even be

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.160
[Guest]: a citizen of the Kaveri Delta if you live there, right?

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.160
[Guest]: All right.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.240
[Guest]: The Kaveri Delta may spill over more than one state.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.320
[Guest]: But world citizen is an abstract idea.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.320
[Guest]: It's a cop out.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:12.800
[Guest]: I, in the last, absolutely in the last paragraphs of India after Gandhi, I quote J.B.S.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.240
[Guest]: Haldane, who's a British scientist who became an Indian and whom Saban Sivaramanandan has

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.520
[Guest]: recently written a book.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:24.420
[Guest]: And he says, you cannot be a world citizen because there is no world government.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.160
[Guest]: And one of the chief duties of a citizen is to be a nuisance to his or her government.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.120
[Guest]: That's one of the chief duties of a citizen.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.840
[Guest]: That's what the citizens of Shaheen Bagh and a hundred other places are doing.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.120
[Guest]: They're being a nuisance to the bad policies of their government.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.640
[Guest]: Another remark relevant to that is by Benedict Anderson, the great theorist of nationalism.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.380
[Guest]: And he says, a true nationalist will feel a sense of shame at the crimes committed by

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.380
[Guest]: his state.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.380
[Guest]: Right.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.560
[Guest]: So, again, one of the aspects of the Gandhian model of nationalism, which actually comes

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.160
[Guest]: more from Tagore than from Gandhi, or two aspects of the Gandhian model of nationalism,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.960
[Guest]: which comes more from Tagore than from Gandhi, are the openness to other civilizations.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:13.200
[Guest]: So when Tagore says, a glory in the lamp, a glory in the illumination of a lamp, lit

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.880
[Guest]: anywhere in the world, right, that is that you learn from other cultures, you know, no

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.920
[Amit Varma]: nation is a frog in the well, you learn from other cultures.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Tagore also famously said, nationalism is, quote, the particular thing which for

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.840
[Amit Varma]: years has been at the bottom of India's troubles.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:34.200
[Guest]: So, and also the sense that no nation is perfect, it's always, you're always trying to redeem

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:40.440
[Guest]: yourself by improving yourself, you know, you're not flawless in the way in which, Hindutva

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.680
[Guest]: believes ancient Hindus were fine, perfect, you know, they invented everything.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.360
[Guest]: And they even claim that the caste system came with the Muslim, which is totally absurd.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.600
[Guest]: You know, it's been there before ever, right?

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.760
[Guest]: They claim that we practice, that Shivaji practiced perfect gender equality, which is

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.120
[Guest]: complete nonsense, right?

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.920
[Guest]: So I think these are aspects of the Gandhian model of patriotism, and not just religious

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:06.840
[Guest]: diversity, religious pluralism, not just caste and gender equality, but the ability to reflect

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.880
[Guest]: on your flaws, your failures, to overcome them, to look at what our other countries

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.920
[Guest]: are doing, maybe learn from them, and this kind of, you know, you can also learn from

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.120
[Guest]: other states, Karnataka can learn from Tamil Nadu, Tamil Nadu can learn from Kerala, UP

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.680
[Guest]: can learn a hell of a lot from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, all right.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.320
[Guest]: So I think these are aspects of patriotism, I think, that are glossed over in the kind

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:33.600
[Guest]: of jingoistic, hyper nationalistic, Hindutva view of what it is to be an Indian.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600
[Amit Varma]: So I have a follow up question.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:39.480
[Amit Varma]: But before a follow up question, an interesting anecdote for my listeners that the last time

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.800
[Amit Varma]: you and I recorded Ram, I happened to mention to you at the end of the recording, that you

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.560
[Amit Varma]: know, Church Street is of course, the best street in the world for me.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.960
[Amit Varma]: And part of that is because it has Blossoms, which is the best bookshop in the country.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.760
[Amit Varma]: And you responded by saying Blossoms the best bookshop in the country, it's not even the

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.760
[Amit Varma]: best bookshop in its own street.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's a joint best.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.840
[Amit Varma]: So my follow up question is this, that your thesis there was that there was a kind of

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:12.720
[Amit Varma]: European nationalism, which is bound up in love for a particular, you know, identity,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.000
[Amit Varma]: a land, a language, and a hatred for the other, and a religion.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.340
[Amit Varma]: And that has now taken form in India in the form of Hindutva, which is inspired by that.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.920
[Amit Varma]: And you pointed out that Gandhi's kind of nationalism was sort of different.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.280
[Amit Varma]: Now I have two questions.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:39.160
[Amit Varma]: One is that, is it the case that during the freedom struggle, that they were contesting

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.000
[Amit Varma]: notions of nationalism, not just these two, but various others.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Bose had his own notions, Gandhi had his own notions, Motilal Nehru had his own

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.600
[Amit Varma]: notions, and you have all of these different notions, and we could be in hindsight saying

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600
[Guest]: that, oh, okay.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600
[Guest]: You're right.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.600
[Guest]: Right.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600
[Guest]: Right.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:00.320
[Guest]: So you mentioned three people right now, Bose, Motilal Nehru and Gandhi himself.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:07.560
[Guest]: So there were things that, you know, Bose, Motilal Nehru, and Gandhi, all completely

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.320
[Guest]: believed in Hindu-Muslim harmony, totally shared it, right?

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.440
[Guest]: Like Gandhi differed from them, Bose, like Gandhi, believed in gender equality, in fact,

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.520
[Guest]: in a more radical way than Gandhi, I mean, he started a women's regiment, for example,

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.520
[Guest]: right?

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.880
[Guest]: Gandhi's, I think Gandhi's originality lay in two things.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.400
[Guest]: One, his attack on the caste system, and particularly untouchability.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:36.080
[Guest]: I mean, I know, I believe he's been unfairly demonized by the Ambedkarites, you know, with

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080
[Guest]: the virtue of hindsight.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.280
[Guest]: I mean, Ambedkar was a great leader, a great prophet.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.640
[Guest]: He was the emancipator of the untouchables.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:47.160
[Guest]: And you know, not just the Dalits, but all of India owes enormous debt to him.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:52.480
[Guest]: But you should not polarize Ambedkar against Gandhi when it comes to the question of caste

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.640
[Guest]: and untouchability, because if Ambedkar was a great emancipator of the Dalits, the greatest

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:03.320
[Guest]: leader to emerge from within the Dalits, no upper caste Hindu did more to challenge untouchability

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.560
[Guest]: than Gandhi, right?

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.880
[Guest]: And that the sin of untouchability, Gandhi recognized in a way in which Bose, Motilal

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.240
[Guest]: Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhagat Singh did not.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.920
[Guest]: He called untouchability diarism of Hinduism.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.080
[Guest]: He compared it to general diarism, you know, where Hindus would treat other people as being

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.320
[Guest]: inferior to them because of the caste in which they were born.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.080
[Guest]: He compared it to general diarism.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.400
[Guest]: And finally, nonviolence.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.520
[Guest]: I think that's, of course, the major departure that he had from Bose.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.840
[Guest]: So there was a shared common ground between Gandhi and many of the others, you know, Srinivasa

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.320
[Guest]: Shastri, who was a great liberal, Tej Bahadur Sapru.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:48.240
[Guest]: But I think nonviolence, economic self-reliance, and above all, the attack on untouchability,

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.720
[Guest]: I think sets Gandhi apart.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.280
[Guest]: And finally, two other things set Gandhi apart.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.480
[Guest]: One was his ability to have a debate, reflect, change his mind.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.160
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at how his views on caste became more radicalized, it was because of

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.080
[Guest]: his exchanges, first with Narayana Guru, the great Malayali reformer, and then with Ambedkar.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.220
[Guest]: So his ability to grow, change his mind.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.440
[Guest]: And the second truly remarkable thing about Gandhi, which in a way brings us back to Moli

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:20.160
[Guest]: and Nehru, is that Moli and Nehru left no second run, they had no successors.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160
[Guest]: Gandhi left a whole team.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:27.680
[Guest]: I mean, I wrote a piece to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, which

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.280
[Guest]: I called the 12 Apostles of Mahatma Gandhi.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.680
[Guest]: I could have called it 24, right?

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:38.880
[Guest]: But I chose 12 people, you know, so in government, Nehru, Patel, Rajendra Prasad.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.480
[Guest]: In opposition, Kripalani, Jayaprakash Narayan, Rajaji.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:49.520
[Guest]: In social work, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, Medulla Sarabhai, you know, Jessie Kumarappa,

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.520
[Guest]: Meera Band, that's 10.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.160
[Guest]: Then I talked about Gafar Khan, I forget who the 12th was, because, you know, but there

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.800
[Guest]: could have been many, many more, you know, Zakir Hussain in education.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.720
[Guest]: So Gandhi was a great team builder.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:06.320
[Guest]: You know, he nurtured people, he identified talent, he met people, identified their talent,

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.960
[Guest]: nurtured their talent, and then set them free.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.360
[Guest]: He told Kumarappa, the work of village renewal is yours.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.720
[Guest]: He told Zakir Hussain, the work of education is yours.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.560
[Guest]: He told Nehru and Patel, the work of running an independent India is yours.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:23.720
[Guest]: Now that kind of extraordinary ability that Gandhi had is given to very few, is given

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.880
[Guest]: to very few, you know, it may have been there in, you know, there may have been some great

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.880
[Guest]: entrepreneurs who built teams of that kind, but political leaders who nurtured talent

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:39.240
[Guest]: in that way, and, you know, Gandhi died, but the country continued because of all these

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:44.600
[Guest]: people who are there in public office, in the civil society movement, in universities,

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600
[Amit Varma]: all inspired by him.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, as an aside, you know, just regarding the dichotomy and possibly the false dichotomy

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.000
[Amit Varma]: between Nehru and Ambedkar, I've been reading this book by D. R. Nagraj called The Flaming

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:04.480
[Guest]: Feet, and D. R. Nagraj, by the way, was a close friend of mine, and I miss him almost

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.480
[Guest]: every day.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.800
[Guest]: And he was the most brilliant intellectual of his generation.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.000
[Guest]: We are speaking in Takshashila office in Church Street.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.080
[Guest]: I met him for the last time in Koshy's, which is down the road, the day before he died.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.080
[Guest]: Oh, my God.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.080
[Guest]: I mean, he was extraordinary mind.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.080
[Guest]: He was brilliant.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.080
[Guest]: He was in his 40s.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.680
[Guest]: He was going to contribute enormously to our cultural and intellectual life, had he lived

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.680
[Guest]: another 10 or 15 years.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.520
[Guest]: He had a wonderful, subtle mind.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:34.760
[Guest]: He bridged the vernacular and the cosmopolitan, the civilizational and the kind of, you know,

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.760
[Guest]: ground up view of peasants.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.760
[Guest]: He came from a religious background, he knew several languages, he was a theorist but deeply

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.680
[Guest]: grounded in empirical reality.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:51.480
[Guest]: And his student Prithvi Datta Chandrashobhi, fortunately has edited two outstanding books

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.540
[Guest]: of his essays, one of which is Flaming Feet and the other I think is called Listening

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.920
[Guest]: to One's Loom, Listening to the Loom.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.000
[Guest]: But he was truly, I mean, I said I miss him and my understanding of Gandhi and Ambedkar

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.400
[Guest]: is deeply indebted to what he wrote and to our conversations in Koshy's Cafe.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.080
[Amit Varma]: Those books will be linked from the show notes.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:15.680
[Amit Varma]: So I have a follow up question on nationalism and at one level, I would even perhaps respectfully

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.640
[Amit Varma]: dispute your terming Gandhi's view of the world and all of the other great leaders that

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.640
[Guest]: we spoke about as nationalism itself.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.640
[Guest]: I call it patriotism.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'd call it, I'd call it something else.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.120
[Amit Varma]: What do you call it?

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'd call it patriotism or I'd call it whatever, but because for example, and there's

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.440
[Amit Varma]: a larger sort of question I'm coming to, you know, Popper once described nationalism as

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.400
[Amit Varma]: something that, quote, appeals to our tribal instincts, to passion and to prejudice and

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.640
[Amit Varma]: to our nostalgic desire to be relieved from the strain of individual responsibility, which

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.640
[Amit Varma]: it attempts to replace by a collective or group responsibility, stop quote.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And I was kind of thinking about how the only kind of nationalism which has any kind of

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:01.160
[Amit Varma]: resonance and which is on the resurgence today is a model of that 19th century European nationalism,

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.800
[Amit Varma]: which is all over the world and which is in India.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:09.560
[Amit Varma]: And there's a very interesting book by the Israeli scholar Yael Tamir called Why Nationalism?

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.480
[Amit Varma]: And she points out a couple of things here.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.080
[Amit Varma]: She says that one, this kind of nationalism is inevitable because only the stat she gives

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:23.440
[Amit Varma]: us only 3.3% of the world's population actually lives outside their country of birth.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.480
[Amit Varma]: And you know, which is a surprise to me because I have lived and traveled in globalized cities

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:35.560
[Amit Varma]: sort of all my life, and she therefore says that that nationalism is necessary because

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.400
[Amit Varma]: it quote, endows a state with intimate feelings linking the past, the present and the future,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.400
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:46.240
[Amit Varma]: And she makes a distinction I found very useful in thinking about it between thick identities

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:52.720
[Amit Varma]: and thin identities, where I think she would hold that a humanist liberal like me who you

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:58.400
[Amit Varma]: know, sees himself as part of a globalized world, but that identity is too thin and thick

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.800
[Amit Varma]: identities which are bound by communities and cultures and ways of doing things and

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.520
[Amit Varma]: norms and conventions are much thicker.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.640
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it is necessarily the case that that kind of nationalism will win out

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:16.720
[Guest]: over whatever we see is a very special case because of the persecution of the Jews.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.040
[Guest]: And they had to find a homeland because they were so brutalized and, you know, subject

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.760
[Amit Varma]: to really some exterminate almost exterminate.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:29.400
[Guest]: I think Yael Tamir lives and teaches in London, but I think my talk was called patriotism

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.400
[Guest]: versus jingoism.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.600
[Guest]: So I believe there are two I mean, these are two, two, you could say, cousins, both from

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.640
[Guest]: the same offspring from nationalism.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:42.960
[Guest]: One takes the path of openness, dialogue, diversity, and the other is like the hard

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.080
[Guest]: line kind of, you know, jingoistic model.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.680
[Guest]: And I said that patriotism is suffused with love and understanding and jingoism by revenge

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.680
[Guest]: and hatred.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.680
[Guest]: That's how I put it.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.680
[Guest]: Right.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.680
[Guest]: Now, I also believe to expand on a point I made briefly, that you can have overlapping

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.680
[Guest]: identities.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:04.720
[Guest]: You can be a South Sea patriot, a Bangalore patriot, I mean, even in Israel, Israel is

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.720
[Guest]: much smaller, right?

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:11.040
[Guest]: You can be a Haifa patriot, you know, a Negev, a dead desert patriot, identify with the land

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.080
[Guest]: and also, but you can't really be a global citizen.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.280
[Guest]: In that sense, this scholar is right.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.040
[Guest]: I mean, that, you know, you can't be a cosmopolitan going all over the world.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:25.000
[Guest]: And because, particularly because of that figure she quoted, 97 percent of the world's

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.440
[Guest]: population continues to live in the nation state in which they were born.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.920
[Guest]: So that's where they have to claim their rights from the state.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.640
[Guest]: You know, a Columbia professor can say, I'm a world citizen, right?

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.840
[Guest]: The resident of upstate New York who has never had a passport, right, has to be an American

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:50.120
[Guest]: citizen demanding that his or her government treats him or her fairly and, you know, respectfully.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.120
[Guest]: Right.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:59.800
[Guest]: So I think the globalized left and the cosmopolitan liberal have underestimated the force of not

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.600
[Guest]: just the force, the importance and the legitimacy of nationalism.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.640
[Guest]: Now, I mentioned Benedict Anderson.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.040
[Guest]: Now you quoted Popper.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.840
[Guest]: Now I'm not sure what, was Popper Jewish?

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.160
[Amit Varma]: Almost certainly he was.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.080
[Amit Varma]: His grandparents were Jewish, but they were not devout.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.080
[Guest]: Okay.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.080
[Guest]: All right.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.080
[Guest]: Now, this is very interesting.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.080
[Guest]: I'll tell you why.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.640
[Guest]: Because Benedict Anderson says in his book, it says somewhere, the great theorists of

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:32.280
[Guest]: nationalism, Eric Hobson, Ernest Gellner, Hans Kohn, Anthony Smith, were all Jewish.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.280
[Guest]: And Jews are congenitally suspicious of nationalism in the way in which Popper was also Jewish

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.520
[Guest]: is because they suffered so much from nationalism.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.560
[Guest]: You know, it's like, and hence they had to then find a state of their own, right.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:48.440
[Guest]: But to be an Indian, I mean, there is a choice, there's a choice between a capacious, open

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:55.240
[Guest]: minded, dialogic form of nationalism and a hateful, visceral, vindictive, vengeful form

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.240
[Guest]: of nationalism.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.720
[Guest]: There is a choice between Gandhi and Golwalkar, you know, there's a choice between Ambedkar

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.720
[Guest]: and Savarkar.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.640
[Guest]: These are choices that are there for us.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:08.520
[Guest]: And we must choose, I mean, we must not say nationalism is tribal, nationalism is bad.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.960
[Guest]: Nationalism is a Western invention.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.920
[Guest]: No, because I think most ordinary people want to know, I think what the anti-CIA movement

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.880
[Guest]: has done is brought back the idea, I mean, Indian flag, I mean, in a few years, the Indian

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:27.120
[Guest]: flag has gone from being imposed by the Supreme Court to being claimed by ordinary people.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.540
[Guest]: It's great.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.280
[Guest]: And the preamble is being read all over the country.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.280
[Guest]: And the flag, I mean, the symbolism of the flag, what is the symbolism of the flag?

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.440
[Guest]: If you read Gandhi on the flag, if you read Gandhi on the flag, it is the saffron is Hindu

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.440
[Guest]: Hindu.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.880
[Guest]: The green is Islam, and the white is all the other religions who are being protected by

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.880
[Guest]: the two larger ones.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.880
[Guest]: I mean, it's a beautiful image.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.920
[Guest]: That's a Gandhi's image of the colors of the flag.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.040
[Guest]: That is the understanding of the colors of the flag.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040
[Guest]: Right now.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.520
[Guest]: So I think these are things which shows that nationalism mean, I mean, it may not matter

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.720
[Guest]: to intellectuals.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.640
[Guest]: It may not matter to global travelers, to entrepreneurs who travel around the world,

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.800
[Amit Varma]: but it matters to ordinary people.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I have two thoughts here.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.320
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, that we are hardwired for tribalism and nationalism plays into that.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.960
[Amit Varma]: But my other thought, and this is where I'll be a bit of a skeptic with, you know, when

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.760
[Amit Varma]: you talk about a good nationalism and a bad nationalism, it almost seems good and bad.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:21.760
[Amit Varma]: I would say more accommodating, more accommodating and more hateful.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:27.200
[Amit Varma]: The issue I take with this is that any kind of ideology, which is based on identity, isn't

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.760
[Amit Varma]: it necessarily exclusionary?

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.520
[Guest]: No, if it's based on values, then it's based on values.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.840
[Guest]: It's not based on values within the boundary or controlled by the state, you know, I mean,

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.880
[Guest]: I can't demand rights from the Bangladeshi government.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.680
[Guest]: The Bangladeshi citizen can't demand rights from the Indian government.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:54.200
[Guest]: If you live in a world of territorially bounded nation states, you have to choose between,

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.880
[Guest]: to use your phrase, good and bad nationalism, a nationalism of values and a nationalism

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.880
[Guest]: of tribalism.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.400
[Guest]: You have to choose between that, right?

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.560
[Guest]: But if they're completely open borders and this is a world state, you know, who knows

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.280
[Guest]: when that will come, you know, climate change will take care of all of us before that can

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.280
[Guest]: ever come.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.800
[Guest]: Maybe then, maybe then you can talk about, you know, something else, right?

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.880
[Guest]: But where you have passports, where you have national armies, where you have national currencies,

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.840
[Guest]: you have to think of what kind of nationalism you want.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.240
[Amit Varma]: So what you're really saying is that nationalism based on identity is almost inevitable, if

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.440
[Amit Varma]: not necessary, as Sameer would have held.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:36.280
[Amit Varma]: And what we need to do is layer upon it a system of values, which can make us more...

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:41.000
[Guest]: Values that are a combination of universal values and particular values.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.720
[Guest]: In the sense that a resident of Israel doesn't really have to bother about, has to bother

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.640
[Guest]: about gender equality, but not about caste equality.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.640
[Guest]: Right?

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.000
[Guest]: If you know what I mean, right?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.280
[Guest]: I mean, they all find they can all speak Hebrew, but in a country like India, which has 14

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.320
[Guest]: classical languages, should we all speaking Hindi?

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:06.080
[Guest]: So it has to be a blend of local things determined by a local cultural context and truly universal

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.080
[Guest]: values.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:12.640
[Guest]: I mean, individual freedom, gender equality, nonviolence are universal values.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.240
[Amit Varma]: Those are universal values.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.320
[Amit Varma]: So I'll now ask you to expound on patriotism.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:21.360
[Amit Varma]: But before I do that, I'll read out one of my favorite passages from an essay that Orwell

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.680
[Amit Varma]: wrote on it, where he gives a distinction between nationalism and patriotism.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And he says, quote, by nationalism, I mean, first of all, the habit of assuming that human

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.600
[Amit Varma]: beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions of 10s of millions

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.200
[Amit Varma]: of people can be confidently labeled good or bad.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.080
[Amit Varma]: But secondly, and this is much more important, I mean, the habit of identifying oneself with

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.200
[Amit Varma]: a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil, and recognizing no other

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.160
[Amit Varma]: duty than that of advancing his interests.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.480
[Amit Varma]: Nationalism is not to be confused with patriotism.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Both words are normally used in so vague a way that any definition is liable to be challenged.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.960
[Amit Varma]: But one must draw a distinction between them, since two different and even opposing ideas

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:00.960
[Amit Varma]: are involved.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.640
[Amit Varma]: By patriotism, I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:10.480
[Amit Varma]: one believes to be the best in the world, but has no wish to force on other people.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.760
[Amit Varma]: Patriotism is office nature defensive, both militarily and culturally.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:18.200
[Amit Varma]: Nationalism on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:23.120
[Amit Varma]: The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:28.880
[Amit Varma]: for himself, but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.600
[Amit Varma]: And in your excellent speech at the KLF, you also expounded on the sort of the different

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.600
[Guest]: elements of patriotism.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:40.160
[Guest]: There is obviously a strong resonance between what Orwell is saying, what I'm, you know,

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.040
[Guest]: what I said that, you know, I've read Orwell all my life.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:49.400
[Guest]: I mean, between my MA and my PhD, a Bangalore friend, Meera Rao, gifted me four volumes

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.080
[Guest]: of his collected essay journalism.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.680
[Guest]: So six months before my PhD, all I read was Orwell.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.680
[Guest]: So you know, quite a lot of Orwell seeped into me.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.840
[Guest]: But there's a still I'd like to elaborate on Orwell says, he says somewhere, you know,

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.040
[Guest]: nationalism is about defending, advancing the interests of the nation.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.040
[Guest]: Just see the first.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040
[Guest]: Yeah, I'll just read that out.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.040
[Amit Varma]: The interests of the nation.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.200
[Amit Varma]: Where he says, interests of the nation or something like that, identifying oneself with

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.640
[Amit Varma]: a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good or evil, recognizing no other

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.920
[Guest]: duty than that of advancing his interests.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.920
[Guest]: So the interests of the nation.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.920
[Guest]: Yes.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.480
[Guest]: Now, what Gandhi did, there is a subtle difference between Orwell and me or between a British

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.400
[Guest]: patriot and Indian patriot.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.120
[Guest]: It's the interests of the citizens.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:35.160
[Guest]: You know, Orwell talks about a land and a kind of mystical attachment to the land because

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:40.600
[Guest]: England is a island and far away, and it was never colonized, right?

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:47.120
[Guest]: Indians were talking about, in some ways, Indian patriotism is actually more advanced

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.000
[Guest]: because they're talking about the interests of the citizens because we are building it

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000
[Guest]: afresh.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.360
[Guest]: I mean, we had to get rid of the British and then cultivate these values and virtues among

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.560
[Guest]: our citizens.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.080
[Guest]: So what we're talking about, you know, is not the interests of the nation, but the interests

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:06.360
[Guest]: of the citizens of the nation, which is which sometimes may be congruent and in many other

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.640
[Guest]: times may not be congruent.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.640
[Guest]: And Hindutva is only about the interests of the nation.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.640
[Guest]: They always reside.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:18.280
[Guest]: I mean, that's what I think, you know, also, I think a very interesting difference between

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.360
[Guest]: British patriotism, even of the best kind of the Orwellian kind.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.800
[Guest]: I mean, though Orwell may have been a Republican, is that we are Republicans.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.920
[Guest]: We don't believe in inherited status.

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.240
[Guest]: You know, nothing offends me more than one, not many things offend me, but one thing that

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.920
[Guest]: offends me a hell of a lot is when people, including people in the Congress party, like

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.320
[Guest]: Jyotindra Singh, Indian capitol Amrita Singh, in private want to be addressed as your highness.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.320
[Guest]: In private?

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.320
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.320
[Guest]: I mean, sometimes in public too.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.000
[Guest]: They claim that they are, you know, because of the Royal Indians and British patriots

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
[Guest]: are see the monarchy as part of their patriotic tradition.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
[Guest]: It holds them together.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.840
[Guest]: It's been there for centuries.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:07.880
[Guest]: But we, I mean, why 26 January is so important is that it denotes the time when India transformed

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:11.280
[Guest]: itself was no longer a dominion, but became a republic, right?

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.880
[Guest]: In a republic, every citizen is equal, right?

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:19.760
[Guest]: It's like the French and the Americans had true revolutions, the British never did because

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.240
[Guest]: they never got rid of their royalty, right?

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.400
[Guest]: We had a true democratic revolution in the same way when the constitution came into effect.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.960
[Guest]: And the republic implies that every citizen is equal.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.440
[Guest]: Of course, in theory, that's not true.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.720
[Guest]: You're still entitlements of birth and privilege and caste and class and gender.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:44.120
[Guest]: But broadly, I mean, I would say, I mean, obviously, I agree as much as Orwell says,

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:50.160
[Guest]: but we had to struggle for the freedom struggle and Britain never had a freedom struggle.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:53.280
[Guest]: And the great thing about the Indian freedom struggle, this is where I want to bring up

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.280
[Guest]: Gandhi again.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:00.560
[Guest]: You know, Sunil Khillani, in a review of my Gandhi biography, had a wonderful phrase.

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.760
[Guest]: You know, he often comes up with profound insights.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.920
[Guest]: And this was in a book review of somebody else's book.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:11.160
[Guest]: He said, Gandhi was battling the British, but he was also battling India.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.320
[Guest]: That is the darker side of India, oppression of women, oppression of caste, hatred of minority.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320
[Guest]: It's a fabulous phrase.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.640
[Guest]: You know, Gandhi was battling India too, right?

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.480
[Guest]: It was a battle against India, as well as a battle against the British.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:30.800
[Guest]: And it's in that struggle, in that struggle against the more unpleasant, unappealing

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.800
[Guest]: sides of Indian tradition, that Indian patriotism was born.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:39.600
[Guest]: You know, for the Hindutavadi, Indian tradition had no unpleasant and unappealing sides.

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.600
[Guest]: It was always fabulous.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.600
[Guest]: And we were always better than the rest of the world, right?

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.760
[Guest]: And I think the great thing about the freedom struggle, and the great thing about people

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:50.800
[Guest]: like Gandhi and Ambedkar, and even Nehru, was they recognized that Indian society was

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.160
[Guest]: deeply fraught.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.160
[Guest]: The way we brutalized our women, the way we treated our low caste, the way we were not

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.840
[Guest]: open to modern learning and science, and were self-satisfied about our past achievements,

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.560
[Guest]: our past civilizational achievements, and this self-critical aspect of the freedom struggle,

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:12.680
[Guest]: I think is incredibly important to remember and renew today.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:16.120
[Amit Varma]: And that's actually just a fantastic quote by Sunil Killani, which you pointed out.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.440
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to ask a follow up question based on that, after we take a quick commercial

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.640
[Amit Varma]: break.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:27.140
[Amit Varma]: If you've gotten so far in this podcast, it means you like listening to good audio content

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.960
[Amit Varma]: and you're thirsty for knowledge.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.920
[Amit Varma]: In that case, I'd urge you to check out Storytel, the sponsors of this episode.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:38.480
[Amit Varma]: Storytel is an audiobook platform that has a massive range of audiobooks from around

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.480
[Amit Varma]: the world.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:43.240
[Amit Varma]: Their international collection is stellar, but so is their local collection.

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.880
[Amit Varma]: They have a fantastic range of Marathi and Hindi audiobooks.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.520
[Amit Varma]: What's more, I do a weekly podcast there called The Book Club with Amit Verma, in which I

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.600
[Amit Varma]: talk about one book every week, giving context, giving you a taste of the book and so on.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:01.560
[Amit Varma]: As long as Storytel sponsors the show, I will recommend an audiobook that I liked on that

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.040
[Amit Varma]: platform every week.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:08.480
[Amit Varma]: My recommendation for this week is Open by Andrei Agassi, the best sports autobiography

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.480
[Amit Varma]: I have read.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Most sports autobiographies tend to be about the glory of the sport and the sportsperson,

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.840
[Amit Varma]: a collation of high points.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.880
[Amit Varma]: But Open is about pain and insecurity and weakness and self-doubt, told with honesty

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880
[Amit Varma]: and self-awareness.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Lovely book.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Open by Andrei Agassi on Storytel.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.080
[Amit Varma]: Download their app or visit Storytel.com.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Remember, that's Storytel with a single L. Storytel.com.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:39.120
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Ram Guha, and we are taking stock of our republic, as it were.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.460
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you quoted Sunil Khilnani, you know, who said these words in a book review

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.640
[Amit Varma]: of your book on Gandhi, where he said that India was not just battling the empire, Gandhi

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.680
[Amit Varma]: was not just battling the empire, he was also battling India.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.300
[Amit Varma]: And my question here is, and again, this is something I've tried to explore over multiple

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:59.840
[Amit Varma]: episodes with multiple people, is that there is a notion that the constitution that we

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:04.120
[Amit Varma]: got was a liberal constitution, though to my mind, it's not liberal enough, but whatever

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.800
[Amit Varma]: the constitution that we got was a liberal constitution, but imposed upon an illiberal

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.880
[Amit Varma]: society.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.840
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, can that imposition be liberal at all?

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:17.400
[Amit Varma]: Taking that thought further, it is held by some now that what has happened today with

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:22.240
[Amit Varma]: the BJP in power, with Modi in power, is that politics has caught up with society, that

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.880
[Amit Varma]: this is always how our society was.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.680
[Amit Varma]: So now I have a couple of questions there following up from this.

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.680
[Amit Varma]: Let me answer that.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.720
[Guest]: It's a very good question.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:37.080
[Guest]: It's a very good question, where you say that it was a liberal constitution imposed on a

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.080
[Guest]: illiberal society.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:44.320
[Guest]: Now Gandhi recognized this, Gandhi recognized that and Ambedkar and Nehru all recognized,

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:51.160
[Guest]: which is why they spent the decades leading up to independence, trying to reform society.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:54.520
[Guest]: Particularly Gandhi and Ambedkar on the question of caste, Gandhi and Ambedkar on the question

00:54:54.520 --> 00:55:00.040
[Guest]: of caste and Ambedkar and Nehru on the question of gender equality, recognized that this was

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.440
[Guest]: an illiberal society.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:09.640
[Guest]: Now, as a historian, I'd like to reemphasize that Gandhi was absolutely alert to this.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:14.480
[Guest]: What did Gandhi's early death, premature death read us off?

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:20.440
[Guest]: Now again, I'd like to give some historical facts that would not be known to your listeners.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:28.520
[Guest]: Had Gandhi not been murdered on 30th January 1948, what would he have done in the following

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.680
[Guest]: weeks?

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:37.280
[Guest]: He was due to go leave for Sevagram on the 2nd of February to have a meeting with constructive

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.280
[Guest]: workers.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:45.640
[Guest]: Pushed back one day, 29th January 1948, Gandhi said to casually, he said to some people,

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.920
[Guest]: we must think of disbanding the Congress and making it Lok Sevak committees.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.040
[Guest]: He didn't mean disband the government.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:59.160
[Guest]: He meant that while the government will run, while Nehru and Patel, people like Nehru and

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.840
[Guest]: Patel will be in government, he placed them there, he blessed them as running government.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:08.040
[Guest]: We will have a countervailing force in civil society composed of freedom, people from the

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:14.480
[Guest]: freedom movement who are temperamentally not interested in administration, but in reforming

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.680
[Guest]: on the ground and in liberal society, right?

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:22.600
[Guest]: So Gandhi's clear understanding was constructive work is as important as politics.

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:29.600
[Guest]: It goes back to the 1920s and he was going to go to Sevagram on the 2nd of February to

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:36.160
[Guest]: meet social workers to tell them what could have been done or what should be done to keep

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.360
[Guest]: the government honest, to keep it on its toes, right?

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:45.120
[Guest]: And if Gandhi had not died, if he'd lived another few years, you would have had a spread

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.120
[Guest]: of the social reform movement within society.

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:55.840
[Guest]: Gandhi recognized that you can't simply trust the state to reform society.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:01.040
[Guest]: You have to have on-ground reforms by activist individuals working non-violently, you know,

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040
[Guest]: going from Mahalla to Mahalla.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.760
[Guest]: You just can't have a law saying untouchability is abolished.

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:10.240
[Guest]: You have to go have people going from Mahalla to Mahalla, village to village saying open

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.200
[Guest]: every well to every person.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.200
[Guest]: You can't just have a law saying women are equal to men.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.340
[Guest]: You have to go travel around and to use a later phrase, conscientize ordinary folks

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.060
[Guest]: about the importance of giving women equal rights.

00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.360
[Guest]: So Gandhi absolutely recognized this.

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:33.320
[Guest]: Now among the tragedies of Gandhi's premature death was that Gandhi had not had clearly

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.720
[Guest]: anointed his political successors.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:41.760
[Guest]: He had said Nehru and Patel will succeed me politically, but he had not anointed his successors

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.920
[Guest]: in the social work field.

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:49.240
[Guest]: And through a, I mean, this is maybe a separate discussion, but through pure accident, Gandhi

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.280
[Guest]: died and Vinoba Bhave appointed himself.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:56.760
[Guest]: And in my view, he gave that social reform movement a totally wrong direction and a spiritual

00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:01.880
[Guest]: and mystical direction rather than focusing on proper ground level constructive work.

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.160
[Guest]: So I think Gandhi recognized this.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:09.160
[Guest]: Gandhi is, again, this is the difference between Gandhi and people like Bose and Bhagat Singh,

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:15.760
[Guest]: who said political power first and foremost, get rid of the British as early as possible.

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.680
[Guest]: On the other hand, Gandhi said, we must prepare ourselves for independence to go back to what

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.480
[Guest]: Khilani remarks, his battle was against India too.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:28.120
[Guest]: And he would have, even after independence, Gandhi would have continued the battle against

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.600
[Guest]: India at the level of everyday life.

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.860
[Amit Varma]: And that's what we missed.

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.640
[Amit Varma]: And here I have to say that, obviously, I agree completely with Gandhi.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:38.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one of my favorite quotations about politics is by Andrew Breitbart, which is

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:42.760
[Amit Varma]: quote, politics is downstream of culture, stop quote, which is that, you know, unless

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.320
[Amit Varma]: you change the culture, you cannot change the politics.

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.320
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:51.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, what seems to have happened is that one, the political infrastructure that then was

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.160
[Amit Varma]: shaping the constitution and the country who are today disparagingly termed as liberal

00:58:55.160 --> 00:59:00.560
[Amit Varma]: elites, basically framed a constitution that at that time was out of sync with the culture.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.680
[Amit Varma]: And what also seems to have happened at that fight, and it wasn't just Gandhi's fight,

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:09.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure a lot of people cared about it, of bringing about a liberal society, essentially,

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.600
[Amit Varma]: some would argue pessimistically that it has failed.

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.760
[Amit Varma]: And because it has failed, today, we have the kind of politics we have.

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.560
[Amit Varma]: And tangentially, the other contestation, like I did an episode with JP Narayan, the

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:24.960
[Amit Varma]: great political thinker, and his point was that India is not necessarily an illiberal

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.960
[Amit Varma]: society.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And to some extent, I get where he's coming from, I call it an illiberal society because

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.280
[Amit Varma]: of the way women are treated and the lower caste are treated and so on.

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:38.240
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, our traditions of tolerance and diversity are such that it strikes me

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:43.040
[Amit Varma]: that it's both and that the so called conservative government in power is actually in one sense

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:46.560
[Amit Varma]: a radical government, because they're going against our traditions of tolerance.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:53.400
[Guest]: I mean, as in, you know, you know, this whole question of Ayodhya, one, one temple, one,

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.440
[Guest]: one holy city for the Hindus and so on.

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.440
[Guest]: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:01.480
[Amit Varma]: So, so would you say that that Gandhian struggle is finally lost today?

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:07.640
[Guest]: You know, I would have said it two months ago, I would have not said it's lost, I would

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:13.240
[Guest]: have what I would have said, Amit, is, and I have said it in print, is to invoke my friend

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.280
[Guest]: Gopal Krishna Gandhi, who is only incidentally a grandson of Gandhi, but essentially a scholar

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.080
[Guest]: and thinker and profound modern interpreter of Gandhi's thought.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:26.800
[Guest]: And Gopal Gandhi often used to say to me in private, particularly in the 1990s, the brutal

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.560
[Guest]: decade that saw the demolition of the Babri Masjid and so on, he used to say to me, like

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.640
[Guest]: the Buddha, India will kick out Gandhi.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.040
[Guest]: And like the Buddha, the rest of the world will affirm Gandhi.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.440
[Guest]: So I knew that Gandhi would never die.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.560
[Guest]: I mean, that, you know, there would be people in Eastern Europe, in Latin America, everywhere

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.520
[Guest]: else who would pick up Gandhi and renew his ideas.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.120
[Guest]: But maybe I was taught by Gopal that Gandhi's influence was steadily diminished within India

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.520
[Guest]: over the last two months, and particularly the protests against DCA.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.880
[Guest]: Because of these two aspects of Gandhi that they brought, one is Hindu-Muslim harmony,

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.480
[Guest]: and individual civil disobedience, you know, people's power, individual and collective.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.040
[Amit Varma]: And the photograph of the young girl offering a rose to the policeman was so Gandhian.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040
[Guest]: Correct.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.160
[Guest]: And individual in the sense that it is not organized, contrary to what the BJP says,

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.220
[Guest]: this is totally spontaneous.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:24.640
[Guest]: You know, I mean, I said, the day I was detained and came out in an interview, I said that

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.960
[Guest]: in the detention center, there were 400 people, students were overrepresented, and the Congress

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.880
[Guest]: Party was underrepresented, even though, you know, Karnataka is the gutter of the Congress

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.640
[Guest]: Party, but it's pretty strong here as the main opposition party.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.680
[Guest]: So I think these two aspects of Gandhi have come back in India through this, the current

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:47.360
[Guest]: wave of protests, you know, spirited coming out in the streets, non-violently.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.080
[Guest]: And you know, this whole, I mean, that great, the slogan, I don't know who coined it in

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.080
[Guest]: Bombay.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.080
[Guest]: Jab Hindu-Muslim razi, kya karega nazi?

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.080
[Amit Varma]: The name escapes me, actually, you know, somebody put this up on his Instagram, and then it

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.080
[Guest]: got onto a t-shirt.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.080
[Guest]: Okay.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.520
[Guest]: Jab Hindu-Muslim razi, kya karega nazi?

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.440
[Guest]: Now, it's that kind of sharp satire.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.840
[Guest]: The phrasing is not Gandhian, but the sentiment is totally Gandhian, the phrasing is too satirical

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.000
[Guest]: and sharp to be Gandhian, right?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:26.040
[Guest]: So this aspect, you know, I mean, Hindu-Muslim-Sikh-Isai razi, you know, I mean, the whole Rangarhad

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.240
[Guest]: in Shaheen Bagh by Sardars, you know, that's fabulous.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.280
[Guest]: I mean, that's like, that's just wonderful, right?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.120
[Guest]: So I'm hopeful that Gandhi has not been forgotten in his homeland.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.040
[Guest]: I mean, two months ago, I would have thought that it's elsewhere that people are, you know,

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.040
[Guest]: truly remembering him.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.920
[Guest]: I mean, the Prime Minister quotes him totally cynically and instrumentally.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.600
[Guest]: I mean, the Prime Minister can write an article on October 2nd in the New York Times, and

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.560
[Guest]: not mention Hindu-Muslim harmony, which is what Gandhi lived and died for.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.960
[Guest]: You can mention Einstein praised him, Mandela praised him, all kinds of stuff, right?

01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:00.640
[Guest]: So but I think ordinary people, and admirably, not only Gandhi, but also Ambedkar, also Bhagat

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.640
[Amit Varma]: Singh.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.640
[Amit Varma]: That's great.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:08.160
[Amit Varma]: And I wrote a piece on this, where I was sort of looking at politics through the lens of

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.080
[Amit Varma]: economics and trying to examine why is it that during our freedom struggle, we had so

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.560
[Amit Varma]: many great leaders, and people often bemoan that we don't have leaders like that anymore.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.680
[Amit Varma]: And to me, the economic answer boiled down to incentives, that at that point in time,

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.000
[Amit Varma]: all the leaders that we had, they weren't motivated by the lust for power, because it

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.120
[Amit Varma]: was no power to we had, they were motivated by abstract ideals, and that idealism to them

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120
[Amit Varma]: there.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.480
[Amit Varma]: And it was that kind of person who got attracted.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.520
[Amit Varma]: And in the modern Indian state, where the state is such a rent-seeking predatory behemoth,

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:41.400
[Amit Varma]: it attracts the kind of people who will lust for power and who will go on.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:47.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, what has given me hope in the last couple of months, as you said, is that that kind

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:52.640
[Amit Varma]: of spirit, that kind of idealism seems to be reappearing in the public spaces right

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.160
[Amit Varma]: now, but is not yet there in politics, but is reappearing in public spaces and maybe

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.280
[Amit Varma]: out of the crucible of this future politicians will emerge.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.560
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, I sort of look at the political marketplace.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.360
[Amit Varma]: And we'll talk about the BGP in the Congress.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.600
[Amit Varma]: But the example that kind of struck me was that in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party made the

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.160
[Amit Varma]: perhaps practical, perhaps cynical decision to not fight this battle for principles just

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.160
[Amit Varma]: because they are running an election on governance very soon, extremely soon, and therefore not

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.840
[Amit Varma]: to get involved in all of this.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.800
[Amit Varma]: But what they have done because of this is that they didn't speak out against 370.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, they supported the abolition of 370.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.280
[Amit Varma]: They have completely ignored this issue.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.460
[Amit Varma]: So what is therefore happening is that in the political space, there is no one speaking

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:40.480
[Amit Varma]: of for these principles anymore, because the incentives of oh, I have to win the next election

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.600
[Amit Varma]: is coming into play.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.800
[Amit Varma]: And they're behaving rationally.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.400
[Amit Varma]: We can't judge them for this.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.800
[Amit Varma]: But how do we get past this?

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.360
[Guest]: You know, it's hard to say.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.560
[Guest]: I mean, it's very, very hard to see how societies transform themselves.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.960
[Guest]: And I mean, the last time we had a movement of this kind, you know, the India against

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.720
[Guest]: corruption, it gave birth to the cult of Kedriwal, who, you know, threw everyone else out of

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.840
[Guest]: his movement and his party, right.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.040
[Guest]: But I think there's, I think, because there's so many young people and across India, it's

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.480
[Guest]: not just Delhi, I mean, the media is focused on Delhi, because the media is in Delhi and

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.160
[Guest]: Shaheen Bagh is in Delhi and Jamia is in Delhi.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:18.520
[Guest]: But all over, you know, if you see the scenes from Bihar, today, there's something from

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.160
[Guest]: Nagaland, Kerala, Kerala, Kerala, of course, Kerala, of course.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.520
[Guest]: But many in Bombay, I mean, I think the BJP's hubris in not striking a deal with the Shiv Sena

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.680
[Guest]: has been good for Indian democracy, whatever else, you know, and Indian pluralism.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:39.840
[Guest]: I mean, it's made, you know, just as an aside, Eric Hobsbawm, in his memoir, in Interesting

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:48.280
[Guest]: Times, has a kind of a throwaway line where he says, there are many ex-communists.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.480
[Guest]: But have you ever met an ex-fascist?

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.560
[Guest]: All right, now, I thought that's quite a profound line.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.360
[Guest]: But I think in Maharashtra now, there are quite a few ex-fascists, I mean, if you look

01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:03.040
[Guest]: at what the Shiv Sena is talking about now, which is great, I mean, if the Shiv Sena has

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.240
[Guest]: abandoned his hardline Hindutva, you know, much more hardline even than the BJP, right?

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.520
[Guest]: And now, I was told, I don't know that the preamble is going to be read out in every

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.280
[Guest]: school in Maharashtra, right?

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:20.600
[Guest]: So I think these things are happening, and whether they translate into diminished returns

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:25.200
[Guest]: for the BJP, in the ballot box, whether they translate into true pluralism and tolerance

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.720
[Guest]: and governance, we don't know.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.600
[Guest]: But the last two or three months have been the most hopeful in India for a decade.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:37.800
[Guest]: Well before, I mean, I think from 2010-11, Manmohan Singh lost the plot, you know, in

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.880
[Guest]: many different ways.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.520
[Guest]: And I'm not one who is nostalgic for Manmohan Singh's regime, his first term was okay, second

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.800
[Guest]: term was disastrous.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.440
[Guest]: He demeaned the office of the Prime Minister in many, many ways, including in his utterly

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.960
[Guest]: shameful comment that I'd be honored to serve under Rahul Gandhi.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.240
[Guest]: He prepared the way for Narendra Modi comments of that kind.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.800
[Guest]: So I'm the most hopeful I've been in a decade, I'd say.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.400
[Amit Varma]: And let's kind of talk about the BJP, because it's very interesting that again, it might

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.600
[Amit Varma]: seem from this vantage point, that it was inevitable that it would end up here with

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.000
[Amit Varma]: Modi and Shah doing the things that they are doing.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.680
[Amit Varma]: But it wasn't inevitable long ago, you once had a Prime Minister in Vajpayee, who many

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.880
[Amit Varma]: regard as one of the best we have had, a far more cultured man than the people in charge

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880
[Amit Varma]: today.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.840
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, what does the evolution of the BJP tell you, and also, there is a dichotomy

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:32.080
[Amit Varma]: here that on the one hand, the BJP is a one party driven by ideology, which is the ideology

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.680
[Amit Varma]: of the Sindhu Rashtra, and blah, blah, blah, which comes from its parent, the RSS.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:41.000
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, they are brought to power and are expanding by the will to power,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.240
[Amit Varma]: yes, where they are doing mergers and acquisitions and expanding vote base and all of that.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.500
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so what gives are they at some point going to become an efficient vote gathering

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:55.480
[Amit Varma]: machine much like the Congress once was and ideology doesn't matter, or is this ideology

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.280
[Amit Varma]: actually going to play out in the ways that in the last year, it seems certainly it's

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.280
[Amit Varma]: accelerated?

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.960
[Guest]: No, I think the ideology is has accelerated.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.280
[Guest]: There's no question about it has become more strongly ideological in his second term.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:15.000
[Guest]: And he's done things that I mean, I'm in some ways, because it's shown its naked ugly face,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.760
[Guest]: you've had the pushback because they thought that with Kashmir and Ayodhya was not enough,

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.280
[Guest]: we should also have this third, you know, radical move.

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.760
[Guest]: But I think the way the BJP has transformed, and I'm not the first to say this, I mean,

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.320
[Guest]: people like Suhashpal Sikar and others said it before, is that it's become a high command

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.440
[Guest]: party, which it never was.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.960
[Guest]: I mean, it's sort of mimicked what Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi did to the Congress

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:43.480
[Guest]: in the 70s, that they converted a decentralized, diverse party with many vigorous state units,

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.280
[Guest]: district units, important state leaders into this high command party.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.320
[Guest]: I mean, in that column, I mentioned that I wrote about Modi not trusting advisors.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.760
[Guest]: I mean, why didn't he take Shivraj Singh Chavan and Rahman Singh into this cabinet, right?

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.680
[Guest]: Because they have to push everyone down.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.960
[Guest]: Modi and Shah have to control everything in the way in which Indira Gandhi and Sanjay

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.360
[Guest]: Gandhi did and later Sonia Gandhi and Ahmed Patel did.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.560
[Guest]: I mean, Sonia Gandhi and Ahmed Patel are the same.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.360
[Guest]: And even now, if the Congress wants to revive itself, it has to rid itself of that culture.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.040
[Guest]: I mean, it has to give people like Amrindar Singh and Sindhara Maiya and Bhupesh Bagel

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:19.160
[Guest]: much more space than Mr. Ahmed Patel and Mrs. Sonia Gandhi are willing to give them, right?

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.200
[Guest]: So this transformational BJP, right, that it's not a grassroots party, it has become

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.200
[Guest]: a high command party.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:30.080
[Guest]: And you know, this may of course, it's already had some diminishing returns.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.640
[Guest]: You know, one very interesting, I mean, these are things that have to be empirically studied.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.800
[Guest]: It's also become a cult of personality party, which it never was before.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.800
[Guest]: It was always against Vyakti Pooja, right?

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.280
[Guest]: Even in Vajpayee's time, there was a three murti, Vajpayee, Advani, Joshi, right?

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.040
[Guest]: It was always against Vyakti Pooja and now it's a cult of personality.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.800
[Guest]: It's a cult of personality promoted by the Prime Minister and endorsed by second in command.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.880
[Guest]: Who thinks, rightly or wrongly, that Modi's name wins elections.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.480
[Guest]: So he has also abandoned this RSS's belief in collective leadership and it's all cult

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480
[Guest]: of personality.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.120
[Guest]: Now, this has had diminishing returns in the sense that in Jharkhand, for example, the

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.200
[Guest]: argument was that when social reform was done by the Manmohan Singh regime, so Mandrega

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:18.920
[Guest]: was Dharmanand, if Raman Singh implemented Mandrega well, he would get some credit.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:23.520
[Guest]: But now if Raghubir Das implements, you know, Swachh Bharat well, he'll get no credit because

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.440
[Guest]: it's only Modi's photograph everywhere, you know.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.440
[Guest]: So, right.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:32.160
[Guest]: So, this is the kind of the khaikabad culture and the cult of the personality are transforming

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.920
[Guest]: the BJP in ways in which actually may be sowing the seeds of his long term decline.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920
[Guest]: That's the hopeful part.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:45.200
[Guest]: You know, obviously, the not so hopeful part is that while adopting a high command culture,

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.960
[Guest]: while promoting and embellishing a cult of personality, it is not abandoned, but rather

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.600
[Guest]: consolidated its hardcore sectarian ideological bigoted beliefs against minorities.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.080
[Guest]: And that's the dangerous part.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.840
[Guest]: But electorally, I think they may have still win state elections, they may win by a grand

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.960
[Guest]: start in four years and so on and so forth.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:09.080
[Guest]: But I think once you undermine state units in the way that they're doing, and local leadership,

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.920
[Guest]: you know, you, you catapult people from the top that you know, in Haryana, even the election

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.880
[Guest]: Amit Shah will decide, Maharashtra, even Amit Shah will decide, it won't be the local legislature.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.400
[Guest]: That's what Indira Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi used to do and see what happened to the Congress

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400
[Amit Varma]: Party.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, when I was a child, I remember seeing this very striking image of a group of of

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.480
[Amit Varma]: a chronology, chronology, Samjhi, of a chronology of mafia dons, from one to another.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.600
[Amit Varma]: And the first guy was five foot six, and everyone who succeeded him, which was basically a second

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.000
[Amit Varma]: in command taking charge after he died, or whatever was shorter than him, till you got

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.840
[Amit Varma]: to a guy at the end, who was four foot nine, which kind of seems to speak to the tendency

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.800
[Amit Varma]: of some leaders to always appoint people next to them who cannot threaten them.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.800
[Amit Varma]: That's it.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.960
[Guest]: And, and, and which is why you have these different parties.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.240
[Guest]: I mean, what Modi should really have done, Shivraj Singh Chavan, Raman Singh and Vasundhara

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.520
[Guest]: Jain to the cabinet, and they would completely have differed him, they did they don't want

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.720
[Guest]: his job, you know, he's the Supreme Leader, but there are three competent and experienced

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.720
[Guest]: administrators, right?

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.720
[Guest]: Surely you want them in your team.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:12.480
[Guest]: Are you so insecure that you must only have your Rajya Sabha MPs like Nirmala Sitharaman

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.760
[Guest]: and Jai Shankar and others to just, you know, who are toadies to you?

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is mystifying.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.200
[Amit Varma]: The other tendency which people have pointed out about the BJP is that each leader seems

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.240
[Amit Varma]: to make the leader before him seem moderate, like Vajpayee to Shama Prasad and Advani to

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.040
[Amit Varma]: Vajpayee and Modi to Advani and maybe Amit Shah.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.120
[Guest]: No, I don't think Vajpayee was less moderate than Shama Prasad.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120
[Guest]: You didn't?

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120
[Guest]: Not at all.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.120
[Guest]: Not at all.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.120
[Guest]: Shama Prasad was essentially...

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:40.920
[Guest]: No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think so, I don't think so, but certainly, Advani, Vajpayee

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:47.400
[Guest]: made Advani seem moderate, and you know, Advani made Vajpayee seem moderate and Modi makes

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.400
[Guest]: Advani seem moderate.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:58.120
[Amit Varma]: Is there a logic to this procession that each successor then has to become more strident

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.120
[Guest]: to appeal to the base or something?

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:05.000
[Guest]: You know, there's one aspect of what's going on in our country today, which I think insufficient

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.240
[Guest]: attention has been paid, is the regional diversity.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:13.920
[Guest]: Modi is an all India leader, but Adityanath cannot become an all India leader, not because

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:20.720
[Guest]: he doesn't have charisma, but his charisma is of a kind that will appeal in UP and Bihar

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:26.560
[Guest]: and not in Maharashtra and in Karnataka and in Kerala, but this is something that Modi

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:34.000
[Guest]: shared only with Indira Gandhi and Nehru, that his charisma, you know, went across state

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.800
[Guest]: boundaries for whatever reason, you know, you felt this guy is for all of India, maybe

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.960
[Guest]: not for the Muslims, but for Hindus everywhere, at least, right, but Adityanath went to Kerala

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.920
[Guest]: to lead a march and had to return within one day.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.360
[Guest]: So I think it'd be interesting to see, he clearly is positioning himself as some kind

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.920
[Guest]: of successor in the short to medium term, I mean, if you look at it, what he's been

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.680
[Guest]: doing in UP.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.320
[Guest]: But I think this kind of pan Indian appeal that Modi has, which even Vajpayee didn't

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.400
[Guest]: have in the same way, you know, Vajpayee was a great coalition builder, a great team builder,

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:15.560
[Guest]: but he didn't have that kind of vote gathering ability that Modi had, even still today has,

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.520
[Amit Varma]: and only Nehru and Indira had it.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.080
[Amit Varma]: And now we inevitably also have to turn our attention to the Congress.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, my sentiment of the Congress is this way I see the nation today, the our

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.280
[Amit Varma]: big problem is that Modi is in power.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Part of the reason for that is that there is a terribly weak opposition.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.440
[Amit Varma]: Part of the reason for that terribly weak opposition is that our largest opposition

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:41.920
[Amit Varma]: party, the only other national party has been crippled by the feudalism within the party.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.840
[Amit Varma]: So if you oppose Modi, you have to oppose that feudalism.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.840
[Amit Varma]: You have to therefore oppose the family and you've got a lot of flag for it recently.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.320
[Amit Varma]: And I absolutely felt for you and I share your views on this.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.840
[Amit Varma]: But and to me, what I tell my friends is whatever anger you might have against the family for

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.680
[Amit Varma]: all the harm they've done through the decades, the point is, and this is something that I'm

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.200
[Amit Varma]: sure you'd feel viscerally that the Congress was once a vessel for really great leaders.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.920
[Amit Varma]: And that organizational infrastructure still exists.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.720
[Amit Varma]: So if only the spaces are for new leaders to come up, that's where the hope lies.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.080
[Guest]: No, they still are some good leaders in the Congress.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.880
[Guest]: And they're not the normal leaders whom Delhi people talk about.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.880
[Guest]: They're not Sindhiya and Pilot.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:27.000
[Guest]: They're not Sindhiya and Pilot or Shashi Tharoor, no, no, no.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.680
[Guest]: As far as I can see, there are three leaders of the Congress who are, I think, are actually

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.800
[Guest]: mass leaders.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.720
[Guest]: One is Amarinder Singh, the other is Siddharam Iyer of my state.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.920
[Guest]: And the third is the most interesting because he's the youngest and he's from a Hindi-speaking

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:49.080
[Guest]: state is Bhupesh Bagel of Chhattisgarh, who in a year in power has actually grown enormously.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:52.400
[Guest]: And it'll be interesting to see whether the high command and the family sees him as a

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.840
[Guest]: threat, which they very well might already.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.040
[Guest]: But he's so I think not Kamal Nath, none of these people, but I think Amarinder and Siddharam

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.400
[Guest]: Iyer are strongly rooted in their state.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.560
[Guest]: You know, they have stoked regional pride in a very strong way.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.600
[Guest]: They're seen as tough, authoritative and with a mass connect, right.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.360
[Guest]: And Bhupesh Bagel is a very interesting character.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.120
[Guest]: And if Sonia Gandhi was wise, she would make him the next Congress president, someone like

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.560
[Guest]: him the next Congress president, because that's the only way you can take on Modi.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.360
[Guest]: You know, several things have changed, you know, in the popular perception of the Congress

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.440
[Guest]: Party.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:30.400
[Guest]: One is, you know, Sonia Gandhi 20 years ago, many ordinary Indians were sympathetic towards

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.400
[Guest]: her.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:37.120
[Guest]: They said, here is someone who's known to horrible bereavements, you know, the brutal

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.400
[Guest]: murder of her adored husband and her revered mother-in-law.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.740
[Guest]: And yet she's come to serve us.

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:46.480
[Guest]: She was hardworking, unlike her son.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.680
[Guest]: She had political acumen, unlike her son.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.000
[Guest]: But today, she's seen in a different light.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.400
[Guest]: 20 years later, she's not seen as the courageous, sacrificing person, but as someone who simply

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.960
[Guest]: wants to promote her son.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.960
[Guest]: That's how she's seen.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.960
[Guest]: Right.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.080
[Guest]: So even Sonia Gandhi is bad news electorally.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.240
[Guest]: She may be better news for the Congress Party than her son, because she's a more adroit

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:13.040
[Guest]: tactician and because coalition partners trust her.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.720
[Guest]: You know, Sharad Pawar will go and meet Sonia Gandhi, he will not go and meet Rahul Gandhi.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.720
[Guest]: Right.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.460
[Guest]: To that limited extent, she has done some damage control.

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:22.400
[Guest]: But she cannot be the future of the Congress Party.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:26.480
[Guest]: The family cannot be the future of the Congress Party, if the Congress Party wants to mount

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.480
[Guest]: an effective opposition to the BJP.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:33.000
[Guest]: And I think that's something which I have said many times before.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.080
[Guest]: It so happened that when I said it in Kerala, it got much more flack than ever before, because

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.480
[Guest]: I think partly because people felt this is not the time to say it.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.080
[Guest]: When there's an all India movement against this nasty regime, and of course, I yield

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.400
[Guest]: to no one in saying it's a nasty regime, why is he diverting attention by talking about

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.400
[Guest]: leadership?

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.400
[Guest]: Right.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400
[Guest]: That's why it got so much flack.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:57.300
[Guest]: I think the closer we come to 2024, this question will have to be posed more and more insistently.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:02.160
[Guest]: That elections, national elections today, are about ideology, we can fight Hindutva

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.520
[Guest]: ideologically, they're about organization and coordination, the opposition needs better

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.400
[Guest]: organization and coordination.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.840
[Guest]: But they're also increasingly presidential and hence about personalities, right?

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.640
[Guest]: So I think that's a question that will come.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.640
[Guest]: And we'll see how it unfolds.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.480
[Amit Varma]: There's also a question of deeper party cultures, like I remember watching this interview of

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.720
[Amit Varma]: Mahua Maitra a while ago, and whatever one thinks of her, she's a young leader who's

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.720
[Amit Varma]: captured the imagination.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.720
[Amit Varma]: Correct.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.600
[Amit Varma]: And I remember Mahua Maitra said that she was once part of the Congress 10 years ago,

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.880
[Amit Varma]: but she left because she felt there was an ingrained sexism, and that people were condescending

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.760
[Amit Varma]: towards her and were not letting it come up.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.560
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, she had to make a space somewhere.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.640
[Amit Varma]: And my argument always has been that if the Congress can just, you know, get past that

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.920
[Amit Varma]: feudal culture and make space for new leaders, you know, nature abhors a vacuum.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:48.920
[Amit Varma]: My other sort of...

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.920
[Amit Varma]: I completely agree with you.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:51.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.840
[Amit Varma]: And my other sort of follow up question is that, like on the one hand, of course, you

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.720
[Amit Varma]: know, just to go back to the criticism that you received for a moment, I thought what

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.960
[Amit Varma]: a lot of people were doing were creating these false binaries, where on the one hand, there's

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:05.160
[Amit Varma]: Modi, on the other hand, there's the opposition, including Rahul.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And if you're criticizing Rahul, you're somehow helping Modi.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.040
[Amit Varma]: And I think absolutely the opposite is true.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.040
[Amit Varma]: They're both part of the problem.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.800
[Amit Varma]: My other question here is that if we look at Indian political parties, and I always

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.920
[Amit Varma]: say that we can't look at Indian politics through the standard prism of left and right.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.840
[Amit Varma]: And that's, you know, we are mimicking the West in that frame of thinking, but that frame

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.960
[Amit Varma]: is not relevant.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:27.800
[Amit Varma]: And the reason is that if you apply that frame, you will find that every Indian party in its

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.760
[Amit Varma]: economics is left of center in the sense it is statist, and in its approach to society

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.560
[Amit Varma]: and culture is right of center in terms of denying freedoms and, you know, the things

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.520
[Amit Varma]: that Kamal Nath has done as the CM of MP is the cow protection and all of that.

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.120
[Amit Varma]: This then points to a fundamental problem in the culture itself, right?

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.920
[Amit Varma]: So where is our hope going to come from?

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.280
[Guest]: Well, that's very true.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:54.760
[Guest]: I broadly absolutely right that when it comes to, you know, economics, leftist or statist

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.360
[Guest]: more statist, at best welfarist, most often statist, yeah.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.400
[Guest]: And with a few favorite 20 capitalists are there an open market for everyone.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.400
[Guest]: And when it comes to, you know, culture and freedoms, they are authoritarian.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:11.840
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, this is partly, you know, I don't know, it's partly our diversity, our

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.680
[Guest]: size, our poverty, our feudal heritage, so change will be slow and incremental.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:22.160
[Guest]: But I think young people, things are changing, for example, one way in which India and that's

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:26.520
[Guest]: why Rahul Gandhi is not liked, India is now more democratic, less feudal at the level

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.520
[Guest]: of how people think.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:33.080
[Guest]: I mean, I've said this often before, that why is MS Dhoni an icon?

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.520
[Guest]: Because he's not Gavaskar, English speaking from Mumbai, why, you know, why is some young

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.000
[Guest]: entrepreneur an icon?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.720
[Guest]: Because they're self made, you know, you know, sons of Ambani's and Bajaj's and Birla's.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.760
[Amit Varma]: So there is a journey going on.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:52.600
[Guest]: I mean, speak to the aspirational energies of economic growth, urbanization, you know,

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:58.160
[Guest]: social media, the influence of the world is leading to a kind of in some ways, I mean,

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:05.400
[Guest]: look at the transformation in my life, which is attitudes to sexuality, and gay rights.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.000
[Guest]: I mean, it's fantastic, right?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
[Guest]: You couldn't have thought of this.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.600
[Guest]: When I was young, I mean, homophobia was everywhere.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.600
[Guest]: That's not true.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.520
[Guest]: I mean, my mother thinks it's absolutely okay to be gay, right?

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.600
[Guest]: I mean, she's 93, right?

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.960
[Guest]: And this kind of thing is, she's not alone in this, people recognize that these are freedoms

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:27.400
[Guest]: which people must enjoy, you know, so I think they are kind of, I mean, India's always moves

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:32.760
[Guest]: in different, different places, even if the state is, wants to curb dissent and diversity,

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:38.200
[Guest]: and individual freedoms, I think the world is changing in that direction.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:42.000
[Amit Varma]: I've taken a lot of your time, I'd initially let me inform my listeners, I'd initially

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.800
[Amit Varma]: asked Ram for three hours of his time, because I thought we'll do a really nice leisurely

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.160
[Amit Varma]: episode, but you you've been you've been traveling a lot, and you're a bit tired.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.000
[Amit Varma]: So we'll sort of wind it up at the 90 minute mark before we go sort of, you know, just

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.160
[Amit Varma]: looking at India now, I mean, you're not just a person who's lived his whole life in India,

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.920
[Amit Varma]: you have actually lived your significant part of your life in an India that goes before

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:06.280
[Amit Varma]: all of this in your deep studies of history, and so on.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:12.120
[Amit Varma]: And you have sort of, in a sense, you're a prominent public intellectual, and in a sense,

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:17.840
[Amit Varma]: you are out there in the public square as well today, you know, shaping the discourse.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.120
[Amit Varma]: Just looking at what's happening now, if I if I were to say that, what is your greatest

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.800
[Amit Varma]: cause for fear of what could happen, say, by 2030?

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.560
[Amit Varma]: And what is your greatest cause for hope?

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.680
[Amit Varma]: What is the India you are afraid could happen?

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:30.680
[Guest]: And what is the India that?

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:35.080
[Guest]: No, I think, as I said, I'm more hopeful now than I've been for a long time.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:44.080
[Guest]: I think we have lost a lot of time and ground in the last 15 years to go back to what I

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.080
[Guest]: said today.

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:49.640
[Guest]: I think Manmohan Singh second term, and the two terms of Modi have set us back a great

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:56.480
[Guest]: deal economically, institutionally, socially, morally, culturally, they've set us back.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:03.960
[Guest]: But three months ago, I may have thought to be going to descend into full fledged authoritarianism.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.960
[Guest]: That's not going to happen.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.120
[Guest]: I think the young have seen to that.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:11.320
[Guest]: And also what happened in Maharashtra has seen to that because a large state going out

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.520
[Guest]: of the BJP state of that kind means federalism is a bulwark against full fledged authoritarianism

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.520
[Guest]: of the right.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.020
[Guest]: Every half of India is outside the BJP.

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:26.040
[Guest]: And even if four years later, the BJP reclaims MP in Rajasthan, even if they are reelected

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.600
[Guest]: in UP, the south and the west and now increasing the east, you know, in the northeast, for

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.520
[Guest]: example, is a great amount of discontent.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:39.120
[Guest]: So but I think this I'd say, if you take the medium term view, not the very long term view,

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:47.840
[Guest]: I think Manmohan Singh, a big one, Narsimha Rao, Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh one, elevated

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:48.840
[Guest]: India.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:56.400
[Guest]: You know, I've always been skeptical of India, but in different ways, despite their flaws,

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400
[Guest]: they were not perfect.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:02.300
[Guest]: For prime ministers, they made many flaws, but overall, the balance sheet was positive.

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:09.680
[Guest]: That is, a country as large, as diverse, as complex as India, can progress only incrementally.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.560
[Guest]: You can't have a great revolution where you remove inequality, become a world power and

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.120
[Guest]: you know, economic growth is 10% all the time.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.240
[Guest]: And there's no Hindu Muslim conflict, there's no caste atrocities.

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:28.560
[Guest]: But Narsimha Rao, Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh, term one, took us to a level where I would

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:38.120
[Guest]: say we were becoming a wealthier, a more secure, a safer, a more comfortable place to live

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.120
[Guest]: in.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.120
[Guest]: Right.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:45.960
[Guest]: Manmohan Singh two, and the two terms of Modi have set us back.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960
[Guest]: Quite a lot.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960
[Guest]: Right.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:53.000
[Guest]: And so in that sense, we have lost quite substantially in the last 15 years, we would have by the

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.440
[Guest]: time Modi completes the second term.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:02.400
[Guest]: But you know, if I'm allowed to, you know, quote myself, you know, in India after Gandhi,

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.560
[Guest]: I kind of sort of said India is a 50-50 democracy, right?

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.560
[Guest]: You remember that, right?

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:14.520
[Guest]: Now, last year, I said, after Kashmir, I said, we are 40-60, going towards 30-70.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.600
[Guest]: I think now we're up to 35 or 40%, right?

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:25.280
[Guest]: So in that sense, we could have crossed the hump, those three prime ministers, Narsimha

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.260
[Guest]: Rao, Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh, were leading us to cross the hump.

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.400
[Guest]: And now we've gone back somewhere, you know, we're just muddling along in the middle as

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.680
[Guest]: we have been.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.320
[Guest]: But the last few months have made me more hopeful.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.960
[Guest]: I mean, I don't think we are going into the abyss as I may have thought three or four

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.960
[Guest]: months ago.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:43.800
[Guest]: It was very, very dark three or four months ago, the pall of fear is broken.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.160
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the jokes about our ruling duo, I mean, they're delightful.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.200
[Guest]: I mean, you know, Modi met some students, he doesn't have, he won't meet the students

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.320
[Guest]: protesting the seat, but he'll have these curated, specially curated meetings with students.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.720
[Guest]: And he was going to tell them all the exams.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.840
[Guest]: And this great cartoonist Satish Acharya had a cartoon which said, you know, if I fail,

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.840
[Guest]: can I blame Pakistan?

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.840
[Guest]: Lovely.

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.840
[Guest]: So the pall of fear is broken.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:09.840
[Guest]: And I think that's great.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.760
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, that's one of the things that gives me hope, all the art and the humor.

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.760
[Guest]: Absolutely, absolutely.

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:20.440
[Guest]: I think there's a, I mean, there's a kind of book that will be written on the music,

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:25.560
[Guest]: the poetry, the poems, the art, the cartoons, the graffiti, the slogans that have emerged

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.560
[Guest]: from this movement.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.480
[Guest]: I'm sure there'll be, there's a great book, a young anthropologist will write about this.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.600
[Guest]: And I think these are very heartening signs.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Very inspiring words.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.360
[Amit Varma]: And people keep asking me for transcripts of the show.
