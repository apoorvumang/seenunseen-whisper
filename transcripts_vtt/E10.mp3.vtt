00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to the IVM Podcast Network.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.280
[Amit Varma]: A few days ago, I was walking down the boulevard when a man in a long black coat and a long

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.600
[Amit Varma]: black hat wearing dark glasses stepped in front of me and said, I know what you did

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.600
[Amit Varma]: last summer.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600
[Amit Varma]: I was surprised.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.880
[Amit Varma]: I told him so even I know what I did last summer.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.880
[Amit Varma]: The guy seemed surprised by that.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.680
[Amit Varma]: He took a deep breath and then he said, I also know what you did last evening.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.680
[Amit Varma]: He paused.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.280
[Amit Varma]: Then he took out his phone and held it in front of my face.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.080
[Amit Varma]: There was a picture of me in my underwear.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.240
[Amit Varma]: And I won't tell you what else was in that picture.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.240
[Amit Varma]: But I was shocked.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.080
[Amit Varma]: How could you get this picture?

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.800
[Amit Varma]: I will complain to the police.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.120
[Amit Varma]: Ha ha ha, he laughed like a maniac.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.020
[Amit Varma]: If you go to the police, I will show them what you did last week.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.880
[Amit Varma]: He swiped the screen and showed me what I did last week.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.880
[Amit Varma]: I freaked out.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm getting out of here, I said.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.520
[Amit Varma]: Get away.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.600
[Amit Varma]: But as I brushed past him, he laughed and said, you can't get away from me.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200
[Amit Varma]: For one thing, you can't run fast enough.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.240
[Amit Varma]: You had 18 malai malpuas on Saturday.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.960
[Amit Varma]: You have a BMI of 29.2.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.240
[Amit Varma]: If you run now, you will be out of breath in 41.3 seconds.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Remember what your doctor emailed you a month ago, your cholesterol level is too high for

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.320
[Amit Varma]: this.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320
[Amit Varma]: I was angry now.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.560
[Amit Varma]: Who are you?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.960
[Amit Varma]: And how do you know so much about me?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.320
[Amit Varma]: He replied, maybe I'm the government.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.200
[Amit Varma]: And maybe I am you.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.480
[Amit Varma]: At this point, he whipped off his tall black hat and dark glasses and I saw that he looked

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.840
[Amit Varma]: just like me, only a little more handsome.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.240
[Amit Varma]: I almost fainted.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.240
[Amit Varma]: What shit is this?

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240
[Amit Varma]: Who are you?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.960
[Amit Varma]: Didn't you hear me, he said, I am you.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.520
[Amit Varma]: I have stolen your identity.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
[Amit Varma]: You don't exist anymore.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.520
[Amit Varma]: You are a ghost that walks.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520
[Amit Varma]: Muahahaha!!!

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.520
[Amit Varma]: Muahahaha!!!

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:11.920
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.120
[Unknown]: behavioral science.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.000
[Amit Varma]: the unseen. Everyone these days is talking about digital India. Digital India is this.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.800
[Amit Varma]: Digital India is that. So much convenience. Let's go cashless. This is heaven on earth.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.120
[Amit Varma]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, I have with me today on the show a man who would

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.240
[Amit Varma]: advise caution. Devanshu Dutta is a columnist based in Delhi who has written extensively

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:51.720
[Amit Varma]: on technology and economics. Devanshu, tell me, what are the downsides of digital India?

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.460
[Guest]: There are two major downsides. One is privacy and the other is data protection. They're

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.600
[Guest]: not exactly the same thing. Privacy leads into surveillance in the sense that there

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.880
[Guest]: could be an all-seeing, all-monitoring netra, as it's called, system which takes my data,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.040
[Guest]: your data, collates our metadata, figures out, for instance, that we are sitting right

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:31.160
[Guest]: here right now using our various locational bits and pieces on the phone, and by inference

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:39.160
[Guest]: figures out that we must be either doing a podcast or some other kind of recording. That's

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.800
[Guest]: one level. The fact is that for a modern human being, if you're carrying anything like a,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:56.480
[Guest]: let's say a metro smart card, or your phone is just switched on, you can be located pretty

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.440
[Guest]: much to within a hundred meters of wherever you are 24-7, which means if that data is

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.440
[Guest]: put together with other things, for example, if you visited a medical lab and you happen

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.360
[Guest]: to have searched online for, let us say, HIV tests, it doesn't require a great deal of

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.040
[Guest]: intelligence and a deep learning AI program could take this and say that, well, you know,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.000
[Guest]: we have reason to believe that this man might have, you know, been interested in testing

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.480
[Guest]: for. So sensitive medical information can be inferred, even if it cannot be directly

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:45.040
[Guest]: proved. If you're using a card to pay for a medical test, a pathological test, then

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:53.160
[Guest]: we take that one step further. That's privacy. Let us say we need to define what is private

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:04.560
[Guest]: and what is not private in a more clear way. The second thing is criminal use of data.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.760
[Guest]: If something like Aadhaar gets hacked, you could, first of all, shut down a lot of government

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.000
[Guest]: schemes. Secondly, you could do, you know, fairly nasty things like transfer huge sums

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.600
[Guest]: of money either into bank accounts or out of bank accounts. You could cause a completely

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:30.640
[Guest]: chaotic situation. You could potentially cause identity theft or you could swap identities.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.200
[Guest]: For example, if your biometric information is swapped with my name and mine is swapped

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.640
[Guest]: with somebody else's name, you'll have complete hysteria up and down the line. Again, it's

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.680
[Guest]: not very clear A, what level of security exists to prevent such malicious acts happening.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.640
[Guest]: And if something like that happens, it's not clear what kind of restitution would be available

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:06.640
[Guest]: for an affected entity. It might not be an individual, it could be a corporation which

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.320
[Guest]: got hit with something like this.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.120
[Amit Varma]: So, I have two further lines of questioning from there. The first one is fairly trivial,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.320
[Amit Varma]: but to go back to the privacy point, a lot of common Joes say that, look, the point about

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.000
[Amit Varma]: privacy matters if, say, you're a political dissident, like you and I might well be, and

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.280
[Amit Varma]: the government wants to shut down your free speech or whatever, then it matters that they

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.840
[Amit Varma]: can see where you are 24-7 and can, you know, spy on you. But for the common Joe, what is

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.000
[Amit Varma]: the big deal if various bots everywhere are figuring out their preferences and serving

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.040
[Amit Varma]: them more targeted ads?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.760
[Guest]: Well, it can run into a problem in the sense that, for example, if you happen to have a

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:53.120
[Guest]: taste for eating beef, and you happen to have gone to Goa or Kerala or West Bengal, where

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.080
[Guest]: it is perfectly legal, and you have bought and cooked and eaten beef, and you come back

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.320
[Guest]: to Bombay, and your neighbor happens to get this information and decides to embarrass

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:12.960
[Guest]: you a lot by making it very public, you could run into social opprobrium. You might, for

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.720
[Guest]: example, have, you know, gone to a massage parlor in Delhi, which is again perfectly

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:27.800
[Guest]: legal, and you might have paid the masseuse an extra, something extra. Again, this is

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.880
[Guest]: perfectly legal, but it is also information that could be potentially embarrassing to

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:40.200
[Guest]: you. It is really no one else's business if I, if I choose to let, this is one of the

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.200
[Guest]: points many people make, it is my data, I would like to own it. If I choose to tell

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:53.040
[Guest]: Google that, hey, I happen to be at the crossing of SV Road and Linking Road, or I want to

00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:00.200
[Guest]: know the nearest place where I can buy a bottle of wine, that's fine. I'm telling, I'm asking

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:06.280
[Guest]: for a certain amount of information, and you're welcome to make what you will of that information.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.880
[Guest]: But I would like to be in control of my data. I would like to know how much of my data is

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:17.920
[Guest]: out there, and how much of it is digitally dispersed in different silos, and how much

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:26.880
[Guest]: of it is available at one spot to one all-seeing eye. Again, this is an example I'm taking

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:36.400
[Guest]: from a friend of mine, who is fairly wealthy, and since he drives an Audi, if he commits

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:44.840
[Guest]: a minor traffic infraction, he tends to get hit for huge sums in bribes. I drive a much

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:52.760
[Guest]: less upmarket car, and committing the same infractions, I get asked for smaller bribes.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.320
[Guest]: This is the copper who's going by the fact that, well, making a judgment call that, fine,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.000
[Guest]: this man is the owner of a very expensive car, so he can afford to pay a certain amount

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.320
[Guest]: more in the way of speed money. Now, if the copper actually had access to your PAN number

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:21.240
[Guest]: and your IT account, he could fine-tune his demands in a much more fine-grained fashion.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.280
[Guest]: He could actually say that, well, you know, I know you've just withdrawn 15,000 rupees

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.320
[Guest]: from the ATM, and give me 10, as the case may be.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.760
[Amit Varma]: So, for someone who's into rent-seeking, this is a feature, not a bug?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:42.000
[Guest]: It is a feature, and the point is that it is also a feature which, if I was a black

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.400
[Guest]: hat, I would be rubbing my hands with glee because I could be into rent-seeking and get

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.480
[Guest]: into these systems and news runs somewhere. There's so much you can do.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.200
[Guest]: There's so much you can do. Okay, my second question is really a two-part

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.240
[Amit Varma]: question. One is that countries which are further down this road than we are, what kind

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.440
[Amit Varma]: of safeguards typically have they put in place to protect both privacy and sensitive data?

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:15.640
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, what are we doing wrong? What more should we do?

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:23.320
[Guest]: I think the first thing, I think, is that you have to see data protection and security

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:30.600
[Guest]: as part of your essential infrastructure. It's just as essential as having a good high-speed

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.800
[Guest]: optic fiber line which can run at 20 Gbps or 60 Gbps or whatever.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.760
[Guest]: It is as much part of your infrastructure as that.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.400
[Guest]: If you put in the security and the precautions right at the beginning, it will not be patchwork.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.440
[Guest]: It will be much more holistic and it will also be cheaper and more cost-effective.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.080
[Guest]: Second things other countries have done, you start with the basics.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:05.080
[Guest]: First you define what is sensitive data. Then you define who owns what, as in how much of

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.640
[Guest]: your personal data is actually your personal data and how much of it is stuff that, for

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.000
[Guest]: example, your PAN and your IT is known to the government on a need-to-know basis.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.120
[Guest]: They are imposing taxes on you. They need to know your income.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.400
[Guest]: However, only one specific department of the government needs to know your income.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:34.360
[Guest]: That should not be accessible without a warrant to any other random government officer.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.880
[Guest]: If there is no need for it, it should not be asked for and it should not be available

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:49.160
[Guest]: except under warrant. Second, you impose certain basic norms on

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:55.160
[Guest]: the guardians of that data. As of now, there is no punishment if, for

00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.880
[Guest]: example, a hospital keeps its medical records unencrypted online.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:07.320
[Guest]: We had an incident last week where somebody downloaded 43,000 path lab reports in Bombay

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.360
[Guest]: just to show that it was available and protected. Now that is sensitive information.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:20.240
[Guest]: It affects insurance, it affects possibly friends and partners of the people who went

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:29.480
[Guest]: through those tests and it affects their careers. There is no legal liability for the lab in

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.480
[Guest]: question because it is not recognised under law as a breach.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.800
[Guest]: You need to impose certain basic security considerations on guardians of this data and

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.760
[Guest]: that includes the government. In fact, the government is the biggest guardian

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:50.560
[Guest]: but on banks, on governments, on insurance companies who have to have a lot of sensitive

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:57.200
[Guest]: data on hand. They do have very carefully defined laws as

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.240
[Guest]: to what is sensitive data which includes things like location which are not considered sensitive

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:10.960
[Guest]: even in the most broadest of Indian laws. Your right to privacy does not include location.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.400
[Guest]: In fact, the government has argued that privacy should not be a fundamental right but location

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.360
[Guest]: is not even considered sensitive. Your medical records are at least considered

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.640
[Guest]: sensitive. So nobody has an obligation to protect your

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.160
[Guest]: location. Google could sell your location if tomorrow

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.240
[Guest]: somebody wanted to know what does Amit Verma do. Google could say we don't really know

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:42.560
[Guest]: but 24-7 this is where he is and this is his weekly routine.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.160
[Guest]: Other countries have then imposed certain basic security norms on guardians of that

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.320
[Guest]: data. They have to be kept in digitally secure worlds.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:14:00.600
[Guest]: They have to be maintained with that security being upgraded as computer systems improve

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:06.760
[Guest]: because obviously yesterday's digital encryption is not good enough to last today.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:14.480
[Guest]: And finally, there is restitution in the sense that if data is hacked and put online or there

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:22.840
[Guest]: is a breach, you can sue and the guardian in question will be forced to pay a certain

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.240
[Guest]: amount of compensation. There have been class action suits for example

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.480
[Guest]: every time that credit cards have got hacked in America.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:39.820
[Guest]: Here in October you had 4 million odd debit cards being hacked across five different banks.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.880
[Guest]: The question of restitution does not arise. I mean the banks will at best settle whatever

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:52.000
[Guest]: bills happen to be run up by the people who hacked those cards and they will issue new

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.880
[Guest]: cards but they can't be taken to the cleaners as they should be for having kept them in

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:06.640
[Guest]: an insecure way. So you need to impose those mandatory safeguards

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:14.760
[Guest]: and to punish people who do not maintain those mandatory safeguards and overall you need

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.120
[Guest]: a data protection law. We do not have a data protection law.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:28.200
[Guest]: You need of course to define privacy. There should not be a scenario where to take

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.800
[Guest]: a very famous case, Nira Radia, the Radia tapes were leaked.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:39.280
[Guest]: They were supposedly collected as evidence by a wing of the CBI.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.700
[Guest]: They leaked. No one has really debated the authenticity

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.800
[Guest]: of those tapes. People have implicitly agreed that those tapes

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.880
[Guest]: were by and large authentic. They may have been fiddled with but by and

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.520
[Guest]: large they were authentic. They were gathered for an investigation which

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:02.660
[Guest]: went nowhere, some 50,000 hours worth of tapes were recorded and they were released.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.800
[Guest]: Have you heard of a single policeman being even indicted for this rather than going to

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.760
[Guest]: jail? There are other laws of evidence.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:19.280
[Guest]: If you walked into a police station and stole evidence which had been gathered in a physical

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:25.080
[Guest]: crime, let us say you took away all the weapons which had been gathered in a terrorist encounter,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.480
[Guest]: you would be liable under law. So would the police for letting you have it.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.200
[Amit Varma]: Now here, there is a much greater laxity because it is data.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.520
[Guest]: Yes, and you know the buck. If the buck doesn't stop with the Home Minister,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.880
[Guest]: does it stop with the Home Secretary, does it stop with the Commissioner of the Police

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.840
[Amit Varma]: Department which allowed this to happen, who does it stop with?

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.200
[Amit Varma]: Maybe in a cashless society there is no buck. Who does it stop with?

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.040
[Amit Varma]: So I have a further question, almost all of my data probably is saved with big companies

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.440
[Amit Varma]: like Google and Facebook. Now, do they have different policies in different

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.720
[Amit Varma]: countries to safeguard this data? How does it work?

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.640
[Guest]: Can you talk a little bit? They do have different policies in different

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.400
[Guest]: countries and they have, for example, Facebook and Google have run into a lot of problems

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:21.240
[Guest]: with the EU because the EU has much higher privacy standards than America even.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:28.160
[Guest]: In certain cases, for example, Russia has insisted that if you are going to be running

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.480
[Guest]: services in Russia, you have to have your servers located in Russia which is, of course,

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.240
[Guest]: the big state surveillance thing because then they have much more control over being able

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.840
[Guest]: to suck data out of your servers. But yes, they comply with local privacy laws

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.520
[Guest]: where those laws exist. Now in India, in fact, it was people from

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.640
[Guest]: Google who told me that, well, you know, location data is not considered sensitive under Indian

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.560
[Guest]: law. And in other countries it is?

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.040
[Guest]: It is, of course, considered sensitive. I mean, it is obviously, I would have thought

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.600
[Guest]: this is completely self-evident that, you know, location data is sensitive.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:13.840
[Guest]: It's only Indian law which, for some reason, when they made the initial IT Act, presumably

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:20.440
[Guest]: they did not think that location was possibly gettable. At that point of time, it wasn't

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.840
[Amit Varma]: common to be able to GPS. So would it be correct to say that at that

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.600
[Amit Varma]: point in time when the IT Act was put together, it was more an act of commission because they

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.400
[Guest]: didn't understand the implications well enough? Yes, possibly. But then you do need to update

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:40.520
[Guest]: and act like that. And so it's, you know, and you will, there will be other unforeseen

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.920
[Guest]: bits and pieces of data which become sensitive as things get more fine-grained.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.640
[Amit Varma]: So without specifying what they are, you need to account for the possibility right now?

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.600
[Guest]: Yes. For example, you know, the whole thing about if I have a phone which is turned on

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.160
[Guest]: and if I have allowed an app access to my microphone, it is technically quite possible

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:09.480
[Guest]: for the app to be recording this conversation as we have it. And while it may not be very

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:16.680
[Guest]: easy right now, you have to allow for this possibility. And if you're writing a new law,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.040
[Guest]: you have to have, let us say, a catch-all category which says any data which may become

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.960
[Guest]: sensitive in future. We are dealing with a science fictional situation that way.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.640
[Amit Varma]: So I have a two-part question to follow up on that. Part one is that if you then had

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.360
[Amit Varma]: to update the IT Act or make laws regarding privacy, would you want to customize them

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.280
[Amit Varma]: to India or could you just say copy-paste from one of the European countries which has

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.400
[Amit Varma]: handled it well so far and they would suffice, number one? And the question number two is

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:52.640
[Amit Varma]: that what are the obstacles to these kind of reforms in India? Are there any obstacles?

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.920
[Amit Varma]: Is it just bureaucracy? Is somebody protecting their turf? What's the deal?

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.440
[Guest]: You could largely, I think, copy-paste from the EU's norms which are the most evolved

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:11.920
[Guest]: where these things are concerned. For example, EU even has something slightly controversial,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.000
[Guest]: the right to forget, meaning you can ask a search engine for non-index information about

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:26.520
[Guest]: you. You might need to mildly tweak it for Indian context, but yes, I think that would

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:33.360
[Guest]: make a good working template. The second part of this, resistance to this,

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:46.040
[Guest]: I think is because of two things. One is there is reluctance on the part of India Inc., of

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:52.800
[Guest]: commercial start-ups, etc., to let these protections happen, because right now there are a lot

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:59.080
[Guest]: of commercially positive implications to being able to, for example, locate you.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:04.760
[Guest]: Give me an example. Well, Zomato can figure out how many restaurants

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:11.960
[Guest]: will deliver to your exact area. Google can figure out whether you are more likely to

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:21.760
[Guest]: read military history or books on cooking, for example, two fairly common hobbies. So

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:29.040
[Guest]: there is a reluctance to let commerce be impeded by this. And at the government level, I think

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:35.800
[Guest]: there is a reluctance to have safeguards put on the government's ability to survey, to

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:43.280
[Guest]: track and survey people. For example, in theory, Britain has just put in an extremely regressive

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:50.720
[Guest]: surveillance act, which looks a bit odd because Britain also has fairly high privacy safeguards.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:57.080
[Guest]: The point here is that Big Brother can watch you in Britain, but Big Brother also has to

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:04.080
[Guest]: get an okay from his Big Brother. So there is a chain of potential consequences.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.560
[Guest]: We don't have those safeguards. We don't have those safeguards, and I don't

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.360
[Guest]: think the government would like to have those safeguards. Right now, as it stands, a verbal

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:21.200
[Guest]: order from a policeman of, you know, any IPS officer, basically, can give a verbal order

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.640
[Amit Varma]: saying put a tap on this guy's, you know. And I suppose this is especially a worry as

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.520
[Amit Varma]: we get more and more authoritarian, and a classic example of that which comes to mind

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:35.960
[Amit Varma]: is the leak about Teesta Settlebadh using her credit card to buy alcohol, which is,

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, again, a massive breach of privacy. And it's besides being completely irrelevant

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.480
[Guest]: to anything. It is purely an attempt to embarrass somebody

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.480
[Guest]: who is a critic of the government. And yes, I mean, if her credit card had been used to

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:58.360
[Guest]: buy whatever birth control pills or whatever, again, and the fact is that, again, that that

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:06.320
[Guest]: leak was happened with impunity, because the government has every right to collect financial

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.800
[Guest]: information on you, specifically, in a case where it suspects that, you know, you have

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:21.280
[Guest]: financial improprieties, involving a tax, an organization which is, which gets tax breaks,

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.760
[Guest]: it has every right to collect that information. As the law stands, it also has the right to

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:34.320
[Guest]: dump it in public domain to in order to embarrass you. If you had a privacy law, you this was

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:41.320
[Guest]: at an open, in fact, the example you use was open press conferences. It wasn't hush hush.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:48.920
[Guest]: Take it wasn't like it wasn't hush hush. Take it out the side door. It was so you know,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:54.000
[Amit Varma]: it has a right to embarrass you. So one final question for you. I mean, we are ending this

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.400
[Amit Varma]: episode on a slightly pessimistic note, because it's obvious that there are powerful interests

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.200
[Amit Varma]: such as a government and big corporates ranged against giving us a kind of privacy and data

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.040
[Amit Varma]: protection that we might want. But my question to you is that as an individual user and as

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:13.640
[Amit Varma]: an individual generator of data, so to say, what can we do as best as we can to safeguard

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:20.920
[Guest]: our interests? There's a level of individual security, which you can put in to try and

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:28.400
[Guest]: see that your own communications are not, for example, use email, which has fairly strong

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:39.000
[Guest]: encryption, use something like Signal or WhatsApp, which is end to end encryption, encryption.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.160
[Guest]: Beyond the point, you can't because you're engaged with a banking system. This is an

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:51.880
[Guest]: example I've used increasingly in conversations in the last couple of weeks after demonetization

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.720
[Guest]: happened that, well, you know, as the government says, it is very easy to transfer money into

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:03.400
[Guest]: your account using a direct benefit for gas subsidies and MNREGA, etc. It is equally easy

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:12.320
[Guest]: to transfer the money out. Right. And assuming you're engaged with the economy in any given

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:19.920
[Guest]: way, unfortunately, you are at, without laws, you are entirely at the mercy of the government

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.000
[Guest]: if it decides tomorrow at its discretion to transfer money out of your account. So a cashless

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.800
[Guest]: economy, in a sense, is the end of freedom. It is. In that sense, it is very much the

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:37.680
[Guest]: end of freedom. You are, I mean, you're talking about electronic bytes. If there is no law

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:44.960
[Guest]: to protect that data, and it might not even be the government, it could be a clever hackers

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960
[Amit Varma]: collective.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:51.920
[Amit Varma]: Devanshu, thanks a lot for being on the show. And in case Big Brother is listening in, hey,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:26:03.800
[Amit Varma]: Big Brother, what's up? Thanks. You're welcome. Talking to Devanshu made me wonder why I call

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:10.120
[Amit Varma]: the show the seen and the unseen. In the times we live in, can anything really be unseen?

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Having said that, in this shallow age of short attention spans, can anything even be seen?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.080
[Amit Varma]: Maybe there's no seen, maybe there's no unseen. That's an apt philosophical note on which

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:33.480
[Unknown]: to end this episode. See you next week.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.520
[Unknown]: Next week on the seen and the unseen, Amit Varma will be talking to Alex Tabarrok about

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.920
[Unknown]: Floor Space Index or FSI. For more, go to seenunseen.in.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.760
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to the seen and the unseen, check out this exciting new podcast

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.560
[Amit Varma]: from IndusVox Media called Keeping It Queer. Keeping It Queer is hosted by my friend Naveen

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.480
[Amit Varma]: Narona, and he profiles LGBT people from all across the country, and some of the stories

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.960
[Amit Varma]: are really poignant. Check it out on Audioboom or iTunes.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.120
[Unknown]: Hi, this is Amit Doshi, and I wanted to thank each and every one of our listeners. It's

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.360
[Unknown]: been two years since I founded IVM, and it's been an amazing two years. We wanted to learn

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.640
[Unknown]: a little bit more about who is listening to our shows, and so we put together a short

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.400
[Unknown]: survey. The survey is anonymous, and we aren't going to be collecting any personal information.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.200
[Unknown]: I would really appreciate it if you could take a couple of minutes out of your day and

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.400
[Unknown]: go to ivmpodcasts.com slash survey and fill it out. Thanks, and please keep listening.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:33.400
[Unknown]: Hey, man, just help me out, man. I need some podcast, man. I haven't had a fix in a week.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.480
[Unknown]: I just need some. Don't you worry about it. I got podcasts

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:40.880
[Amit Varma]: galore for you, man. Just go to ivmpodcasts.com. You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter,

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:47.880
[Amit Varma]: and Instagram. Thanks, man. I'm going to check it out.
