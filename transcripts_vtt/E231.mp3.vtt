00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320
[Amit Varma]: In January 2020, China had entered a crisis. Wuhan had become the first city struck by

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.200
[Amit Varma]: COVID-19, and things were bad, similar to if not worse than what Delhi went through

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.040
[Amit Varma]: in the recent second wave. Governance seemed to have broken down, and the Chinese President,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.040
[Amit Varma]: Xi Jinping, even seemed to vanish from the public eye for a while. But after that, China

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.160
[Amit Varma]: got its act together. They controlled the pandemic, got the economy back on track and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160
[Amit Varma]: lifted the morale of their people. Part of this was decisive governance, and part was

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.800
[Amit Varma]: exceptional narrative building. Whatever the reality was, the Chinese knew how to spin

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.240
[Amit Varma]: a story. And sometimes, they also bent reality to their will. Over the last few months, China

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.880
[Amit Varma]: has rebounded and flourished, while both the Western world and China's neighbour to the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.280
[Amit Varma]: South have struggled to contain the pandemic. Before COVID-19, China was building itself

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.720
[Amit Varma]: up as an emerging superpower. If anything, recent months have validated that impression.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.400
[Amit Varma]: And the story of how China managed this crisis is so fascinating. Now, given how opaque China

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.640
[Amit Varma]: can be, will we ever know the full story? Well, you know what, we know a lot of it already,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.120
[Amit Varma]: thanks to a guy who once wanted to be a Bollywood star, and then went on to become India's finest

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:35.560
[Unknown]: China analyst. He calls himself the China dude.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Manoj Kevalramani, who works at the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.340
[Amit Varma]: Takshashila Institution and writes a brilliant newsletter, Eye on China. Manoj has just written

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.880
[Amit Varma]: a book called Smokeless War, which has riveting details of how China rebounded after COVID-19

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.320
[Amit Varma]: hit. It has stunning insights on politics, economics, narrative building, and the state

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.960
[Amit Varma]: of Chinese society, as well as the state of the Chinese state. Manoj has been on the show

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.640
[Amit Varma]: before, and I will link all our previous episodes in the show notes. Taken together, his body

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.880
[Amit Varma]: of work is a masterclass on China. But when I invited him for this episode, my aim was

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.000
[Amit Varma]: not just to talk about this wonderful book, but also his journey so far, which I find

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.920
[Amit Varma]: so fascinating. He tried to get into Bollywood, but Bollywood does not deserve him. He spent

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.200
[Amit Varma]: a few years in journalism, but journalism does not deserve him. He spent a few years

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.240
[Amit Varma]: in China, but China does not deserve him. Who deserves him? You deserve him. You're

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.200
[Amit Varma]: about to be treated to a conversation I loved having about Manoj's wild journey through

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.520
[Amit Varma]: life. And there are so many insights packed in there. We speak about his journey for the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.160
[Amit Varma]: first half of the show, and then we speak about China and his book in the second half.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.920
[Amit Varma]: While you fasten your seatbelts, here's a commercial, or rather a public service message

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.600
[Amit Varma]: about how you can get your reading habit going again.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.920
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.520
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.520
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.360
[Amit Varma]: face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.160
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.720
[Amit Varma]: awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people uplevel themselves

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.160
[Amit Varma]: by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.360
[Amit Varma]: covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.360
[Amit Varma]: me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.240
[Amit Varma]: better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to

[Amit Varma]: Manoj, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.760
[Guest]: Thank you so much. I'm a pleasure being here.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Or actually welcome back rather because you've been here before. But you know, this is the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.880
[Amit Varma]: first time you've actually been here after the pandemic struck. How have the last few

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.880
[Amit Varma]: months been for you?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.840
[Guest]: It's been really interesting. We've been mostly locked up in the house and being locked up

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.280
[Guest]: with a four year old has been a boon and a bane. It's been lots of fun because he's kept

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.800
[Guest]: us entertained. But it's also been quite difficult because he's been fed up of being locked in

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.120
[Guest]: the house. And you know, and you constantly every time he falls in, you start to wonder

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.240
[Guest]: as to what's happened. So yeah, and kids will fall in. So there's lots of anxious days,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.960
[Guest]: but there's also lots of fun because he keeps us entertained. But then yeah, it's not been

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.600
[Guest]: easy from a work point of view. But then I don't think I can really complain given how

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.960
[Guest]: difficult people have had it, right, you know, so it's been much, much more comfortable than

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.360
[Guest]: most people in the country or around the world. So can't complain too much. But then right,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.760
[Guest]: you know, like I said, I whinged a little bit, but I can't complain too much.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.280
[Amit Varma]: What is what is life without whinging indeed? So you know, you've been on the show before

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.680
[Amit Varma]: we've kind of chatted about your personal history a little bit, we've gone through some

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.000
[Amit Varma]: of that, but you've been on the show after such a long time. And in that time, the scene

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.140
[Amit Varma]: and the unseen has kind of become this sprawling thing where, you know, we go into a person's

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.620
[Amit Varma]: personal journey, a fair bit, and so on and so forth. And yours is particularly interesting

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.180
[Amit Varma]: because it's not as if I mean, no policy scholar is born a policy scholar out of the womb.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.760
[Amit Varma]: But you've taken a very unusual journey, which includes a detour through Bollywood and all

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.880
[Amit Varma]: of that. So take me take me back to your growing up years. Like when did you grow up? What

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.400
[Amit Varma]: were you like as a kid? What did you want to be? I presume the film star thing was a

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.360
[Amit Varma]: bachpan se kind of thing. Take me back to the young non serious or non serious policy

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.120
[Amit Varma]: expert, non policy expert Manoj, as it were. So I had quite an interesting childhood, right?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:35.280
[Guest]: I mean, we've, I'm a Sindhi, my family is sort of lived all over the place in many ways.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.600
[Guest]: I was born in Kuwait, I spent most of my early years in Saudi Arabia, we moved to India in

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.400
[Guest]: the late 80s. And you know, my memories of Saudi Arabia in the 80s as a kid, are very

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.080
[Guest]: different to the Saudi Arabia that I sort of realized existed once I grew up, you know,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.600
[Guest]: for me, it was this wonderfully protected environment where everything was really great.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.160
[Guest]: People were really friendly, everything was safe and secure. And for me, the shift to

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.200
[Guest]: India, I remember we I moved to India when we were in when I was in my third standard.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:13.280
[Guest]: And it suddenly felt like everybody's really, really sharp. Everybody's really, really smart,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.200
[Guest]: street smart. And I felt like sort of completely a deer in cotton headlights, I had no sense

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.240
[Guest]: of and this is me in third standard, right? And I remember, again, cribbing about it at

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.640
[Guest]: home and to my teachers saying, why are people lying? Why are people doing this? So it just

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.720
[Guest]: gives you a sense of what a protected environment being in that place was. But yeah, I mean,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.600
[Guest]: I sort of, I think I was fortunate that we came here as when I was young, because it

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.840
[Guest]: allowed me to adapt, because I know that for my older siblings, it was a bit of an effort

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.440
[Guest]: because it spent most of their schooling abroad. And, again, like I said, protected environment

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.240
[Guest]: in the Middle East. And when you came to India, suddenly, you had this rush of ideas, freedom,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.040
[Guest]: and all of that. And that can be quite overwhelming if you're not used to it. And it can be quite

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.680
[Guest]: difficult. But yeah, I mean, I adapted quite early. I had zero interest in politics or

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.040
[Guest]: policy growing up. I was a typical Bombay kid. I shouldn't even say Bombay kid, I should

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.600
[Guest]: say suburban Bombay kid, because we are a different breed compared to the South Bombay

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.920
[Guest]: folks. And I was a typical Bombay kid. You know, I was interested in Bollywood, I was

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.680
[Guest]: interested in cricket. I was not really interested in studying too much. And I grew up most of

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:30.360
[Guest]: my time playing outdoors. You know, I mean, for folks who've lived in Bombay, this constant

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.600
[Guest]: thing of rivalries between different towers playing cricket. So that was most of my childhood,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.400
[Guest]: doing all of that watching lots of Bollywood movies. And I think growing up, I had this

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.760
[Guest]: thing as a kid, I was quite a boisterous kid, I always had this thing of, you know, I used

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.920
[Guest]: to ape Amitabh Bachchan a lot. So I used to walk around the house, reciting dialogues.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.760
[Guest]: And I think that stayed with me. So as I grew up, I wanted to get in Bollywood in one way

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.840
[Guest]: or the other. So I spent some time as I grew up, as I entered college, I spent some time

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.360
[Guest]: trying to, you know, get in shape. Because, you know, by that time, by the late 90s, being

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:14.840
[Guest]: in acting, wherever you were, whether it was on television or on the big screen, the requirement

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.960
[Guest]: for men had become that you needed to become bodybuilders and wrestlers and everything.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.360
[Guest]: You can't just be a normal looking person. So I spent a lot of time trying to do that.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:29.360
[Guest]: I spent lots of hours in the gym. And the peak of my career in entertainment was, I

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.560
[Guest]: won a talent contest, I think it was Lions Club or Rotary Club, one of those clubs, which

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:42.400
[Guest]: had a talent contest called Talash, which is essentially a pageant, which I ended up

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.640
[Guest]: winning. And for that brief fleeting moment, I thought this is my launch into Bollywood.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.760
[Guest]: Alas, after spending a long time trying to do that, and realizing I don't have the aptitude

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:59.320
[Guest]: for it, neither do I have the skills for it. And then one fateful narration outside, if

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.960
[Guest]: anybody's familiar with Lokhandwala, outside Lokhandwala, there are lots of coffee shops

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.280
[Guest]: where you would see, particularly through the late 90s, 2000s, I don't know if even

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:12.400
[Guest]: today, lots of aspiring actors, models sitting outside speaking to producers, storytellers.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.080
[Guest]: And I remember sitting through one narration outside a coffee shop. And this is after I

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.440
[Guest]: had spent a year in England studying IR. And I was listening to the narration, I was telling

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.720
[Guest]: myself, this is not what I can do. It's just not for me. The idea of, I can't remember

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.840
[Guest]: the story, but it was something about, you know, a song and a dance and a death and then

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.480
[Guest]: a rebirth. And I was like, yeah, this is not for me. And I remember at that point of time,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:43.320
[Guest]: it was sort of my final decision that I can't do this anymore. It doesn't work for me. And

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.320
[Guest]: I need to find myself a serious job. Because I'm kidding myself by saying I'm just doing

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.160
[Guest]: this to pay the bills, because I'm spending 10 hours of the day trying to do this. So

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.760
[Guest]: yeah, so that was my sort of brief foray into Bollywood, a little bit of modeling, a little

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.400
[Guest]: bit of acting on theater and thing and a little bit of work with regard to television. But

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.040
[Guest]: yeah, I mean, like I said, before that, I spent a year in Britain, I studied international

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:12.800
[Guest]: relations, I got to that course, purely through happenstance. I wanted to do an MBA. And like

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.560
[Guest]: most again, most sort of middle upper middle class Sindhi family living in Bombay, my family

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.200
[Guest]: has been involved in business, my father's runs a business, and has been running that

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.920
[Guest]: for the last 45 years. And the aspiration was that, you know, the kids will follow and

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.960
[Guest]: get into the business. For me, the idea was, I didn't know if I wanted to do that business,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.160
[Guest]: but I wanted to get out of the country and experience the world. And the easiest way

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.080
[Guest]: to do that was to go and study abroad. So I spent about a year or two years while I

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.640
[Guest]: was doing my modeling and trying to pay some bills by studying for GMAT and TOEFL and trying

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.560
[Guest]: to go out. I got admitted to universities in the US, but my visa was rejected. And this

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.880
[Guest]: is soon after 9-11. And the course that I was going to go and study was a two year MBA

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.960
[Guest]: with a option to take a couple of credits of anything else that you wanted. And because

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.440
[Guest]: of 9-11, I thought well IR might be fun, you know, just because suddenly it felt like the

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.480
[Guest]: world had, you know, something had changed in the world, which again is quite strange

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.200
[Guest]: because a couple of years before that we had the Kargil war, and I had zero idea that there

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.760
[Guest]: was a war happening. You know, again, this is Bombay, I knew, I knew when was Shahrukh

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.680
[Guest]: Khan's birthday, I had no idea Kargil was happening. I knew Barkha Dutt was doing something.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.960
[Guest]: But beyond that, I didn't know anything. So yeah, so I, and my visa ended up getting rejected

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.920
[Guest]: for the United States. And, you know, the pressure from the family was that maybe it's

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.860
[Guest]: time you quit all of this, you're 21, why don't you just get on to the family business.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.640
[Guest]: And I didn't want to do that. So the next best option was let me try and look for an

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.240
[Guest]: IR course in Britain, maybe, because I was going to do a few months of IR in the US.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.280
[Guest]: And it is too late to apply for quality MBAs in Britain. So maybe IR in Britain, because

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.680
[Guest]: the courses are one year, the master's courses, I said one year of IR, and then one year of

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.680
[Guest]: MBA, I'll walk out with two degrees, I'll be super qualified. And, you know, most importantly,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.460
[Guest]: it will give me two years away from the family pressure of trying to work in the family business.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.640
[Guest]: And so I applied to Britain to a number of universities, I was lucky to get into a couple

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.720
[Guest]: and even get a scholarship. And I decided, yeah, why not, I'm going to go and study IR.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:29.260
[Guest]: And three months into that course, I was fairly clear that while I still want to do some acting

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.940
[Guest]: and all of that, I this is an area of my interest. And I want to pursue this and journalism became

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:41.000
[Guest]: of interest following that. And that's how eventually I sort of landed into journalism

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.800
[Guest]: and sort of pursuing IR in terms of just reading much more in the field, rather than pursuing

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.280
[Guest]: professionally. Professionally, I moved towards journalism thereafter. And yeah, and so for

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.800
[Guest]: about 2005 2006, onwards, at least I've, despite all the different thoughts that I've had of

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.680
[Guest]: all the different strange things that I want to try and do as a career, I've stuck to journalism.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.800
[Guest]: And I stuck to it till I moved to Daksha Shila in 2017.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.600
[Amit Varma]: So fascinating arc. And by the way, you mentioned Lokhandwala cafes, which of course, I'm very

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.840
[Amit Varma]: familiar with in the sense that I live in Warsaw, right? So and I have lived in Lokhandwala

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.320
[Amit Varma]: as well. So one is aware of those cafes. In fact, I invoke them often, like, I think one

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.800
[Amit Varma]: of the most dangerous pieces of advice given to people, which I guess I'm glad you didn't

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.280
[Amit Varma]: follow for too long, is you know, when young people are told, follow your dreams. And that's

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.280
[Amit Varma]: really dangerous, because it's a survivor bias at play, where you see a bunch of people

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.560
[Amit Varma]: who followed their dreams and who made it big and all of that and overcome initial hardship

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.360
[Amit Varma]: and all that. But the bottom line is that most people simply don't 99% of the people

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.520
[Amit Varma]: who follow their dreams, so to say, don't make it. And the reason I invoke the cafes

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.920
[Amit Varma]: of Lokhandwala is I often say that just go to the cafes of Lokhandwala, sit down for

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.120
[Amit Varma]: a few minutes, eavesdrop to the conversations around you and you'll see what I mean. It's

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.120
[Amit Varma]: kind of poignant that you follow your dream and then you're in your 40s or 50s or whatever,

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.840
[Amit Varma]: and you're sitting in a cafe and Lokhandwala narrating a story to a bunch of fellow wannabes

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.080
[Amit Varma]: and everything has kind of passed you by. But thankfully, that cautionary tale doesn't

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.680
[Amit Varma]: apply to you when you're in Bangalore now, not in a Lokhandwala cafe, so to say.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.600
[Guest]: So, you know, I think, I mean, I wanted to, I want to add one more story to this, because

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.360
[Guest]: I think it's sort of, and it's, this is just a little bit of people like I completely agree

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:34.040
[Guest]: with you, you know, it's really, really difficult. And there is a survivor bias to all of this.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.480
[Guest]: And there are moments in which, you know, I mean, I still very vividly remember that

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.240
[Guest]: phase where you have to have a tremendous amount of self confidence and self belief,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.240
[Guest]: to the point of delusion to be able to do some of that. At the same time, you have to

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.920
[Guest]: sort of be realistic. And I remember for me, one of the moments when that, you know, those

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:59.080
[Guest]: two worlds of realism and delusion collided was when, again, I had visited a model coordinator.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.560
[Guest]: And a lot of times model coordinators ask you for money upfront to register you as talent,

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.680
[Guest]: and then they will sort of help you get more jobs. And I remember going there and this,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.640
[Guest]: and this is again, this is maybe late 1990s, early 2000s, the gentleman asked me for 5000

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.560
[Guest]: rupees to register and of course, in sort of 2000 for a in 1999 or 2000 for a college

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.240
[Guest]: going fellow 5000 rupees was too much. And I was sitting there I was thinking and I was

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.360
[Guest]: like, okay, this is a lot of money. And okay, maybe I will, maybe I won't. And I said, okay,

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.080
[Guest]: let me think and I'll come back to you. And at that moment, he sort of, there's a call

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.240
[Guest]: that comes, he picks up the call and he goes like, Kiran is not available. I have this

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.200
[Guest]: bright young man in front of me. And you know, the moment I saw that I was like, look, I

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.280
[Guest]: mean, this guy's playing me, it's so straight that he's playing me. Yet, a big part of me

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.600
[Guest]: wants to really believe that he's not playing me. But I mean, like you said, at that moment,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.880
[Guest]: I remember going back home and thinking to myself and saying, you know, a big part of

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.440
[Guest]: me want to say, okay, let's just pay the money, maybe you'll get this job. So that desperation

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.280
[Guest]: sort of stays with you. But as realism sort of hits, and I think it's important for people

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:09.600
[Guest]: who sort of do follow their dreams, as disheartening as this might sound, it's important to keep

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.480
[Guest]: that realism in mind. Because at the end of the day, the deeper down the rabbit hole you

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.080
[Guest]: go without realizing and being realistic, the more difficult it becomes to climb out.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure there are a whole army of ex Bollywood wannabes listening to this podcast right now

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:30.840
[Amit Varma]: and thinking to themselves, oh, that phone call was fake. But that's a poignant and a

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.520
[Amit Varma]: deep point about self delusion. Like I've always held that self delusion is one we are

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.560
[Amit Varma]: wired to be self delusional, because it's an essential quality that you sometimes need

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.000
[Amit Varma]: for survival. And to become good at anything self delusion helps in the sense that how

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.040
[Amit Varma]: do you become good at something, you become good at something by iterating endlessly,

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.020
[Amit Varma]: you do something again and again and again and again, and you suck to start with because

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.160
[Amit Varma]: everybody sucks to start with, and then they finally become good. And the point is, if

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.000
[Amit Varma]: you knew at the start how bad you are, you might lose heart, you might give up hope,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.240
[Amit Varma]: you might, you know, not go on. So maybe you need to be self delusional. So you can fake

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.080
[Amit Varma]: it till you make it like one advice I kind of give my writing students is that if you

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.320
[Amit Varma]: enter a phase where you write something and you think it's shit, and you want to stop,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.760
[Amit Varma]: that's actually the wrong conclusion you've come to one, it may not be shit, you may be

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.600
[Amit Varma]: being too hard on yourself, which is a good quality to have. But to all it means if you

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.360
[Amit Varma]: write something and you think is shit, is that your judgment, your taste is ahead of

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.560
[Amit Varma]: your ability right now. How do you get your ability to that level by just doing it again

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.960
[Amit Varma]: and again and again, you know, there's this, like I keep saying that in writing, I really

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.440
[Amit Varma]: don't believe that natural talent such as it is, is an essential thing. It's just a

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.920
[Amit Varma]: matter of, you know, getting your ass on the chair and just working hard at it and all

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.440
[Amit Varma]: of that. What did you do to win the talent contest?

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.000
[Guest]: So it was so I entered this again with the hope that you know, maybe I'll get some exposure.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.960
[Guest]: And I mean, as I say all of this, I have to add, I'm as a person, I used to be generally

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.320
[Guest]: at least at that age, fairly introverted. Despite doing all of this, I was fairly introverted

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.360
[Guest]: because I was somebody who grew up, like I said, in a very protected environment. I was

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.800
[Guest]: a very chubby kid. So when it came to that, I had lots of body issues. And then there

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.160
[Guest]: came a point where I said I sort of tried to work out and I blame Hrithik Roshan for

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:21.560
[Guest]: all of that in my life. But at the end of it, what happened was that the talent contest

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.520
[Guest]: came about, I said, Well, why not just take part, it'd be a good networking opportunity.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.240
[Guest]: We so we had these sort of rounds through the talent contest. So if I remember correctly,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:39.020
[Guest]: the first round was a general sort of, it was a casual wear round. The next round was

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:45.200
[Guest]: an Indian wear round. And the final round was, again, you had final five participants

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.480
[Guest]: and you had a final question. I remember the final question was something like, if you

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:59.000
[Guest]: had one power that you could have asked for, what would that be? And I don't remember my

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.360
[Guest]: exact answer, but it was a twisted way of saying world peace. It was, I think it was

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.400
[Guest]: basically to the point that, you know, I would want to sort of inculcate, talk to people

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.080
[Guest]: about tolerance, acceptance, you know, openness, and so on and so forth. But then when I think

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.280
[Guest]: back about it, I think that as a human being who's had the opportunities in life that I've

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.360
[Guest]: had, I already have those capabilities, maybe I just need to exercise them better. So it

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.080
[Guest]: was just a slightly more fancy way of saying world peace. And that worked. After that,

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.240
[Guest]: there was the I don't know if the channel still exists, but there was a Sahara news

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.920
[Guest]: channel. So I remember being interviewed by them. And again, that's the moment where I

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.840
[Guest]: felt Oh, my God, I've arrived. That to me was like that big moment. And again, I realized

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.840
[Guest]: that after that, nothing really changed in my life. Apart from me, getting a trophy and

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.600
[Guest]: a photograph with I think there was Jukta Mukhi, who was one of the judges. And yeah,

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.000
[Guest]: and those things I still cherish. And sometimes when I'm reminiscing about days when I was

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.440
[Guest]: thinner, and I had more hair, I put out those pictures on social media.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I came across one of those pictures. And I must say, you're quite striking. I mean,

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.840
[Amit Varma]: maybe if you had a godfather or something, you could have made it in the industry. And

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.840
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned Jukta Mukhi. So again, just throwing a little bit of trivia out there.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.280
[Amit Varma]: One of my friends lived or maybe still lives, but lived in the same building as her and

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.400
[Amit Varma]: her dog used to pee outside his door every single day. And and her attitude towards that

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:27.200
[Amit Varma]: was that, hey, you know, just a dog, what's a big deal? So anyway, that's really chill.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but my poor friend could not be so chill about it. Sadly, a very famous journalist

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.760
[Amit Varma]: also, I won't, I won't name him. So you mentioned world peace. And subsequently, of course,

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.800
[Amit Varma]: you did IR and you studied it a bit more and you figured out that, you know, it's not quite

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.480
[Amit Varma]: that easy. So tell me about the time studying IR, you know, is it just an interesting subject

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.040
[Amit Varma]: that you're doing? And because you're doing it, you kind of study it and all of that?

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.720
[Amit Varma]: Or is there a moment where you begin to fall in love with it, where you sort of begin to

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.640
[Amit Varma]: read outside the essential reading, so to say, or outside what you're required to read,

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.120
[Amit Varma]: and really get into it? Does that happen at any point? What is that process like?

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:12.640
[Guest]: Yeah, so for me, I was, I went to study in 2002. So my course began in September 20,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.400
[Guest]: September 2002. And the first book that I picked up was in August 2002, to really sort

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:23.440
[Guest]: of study and I think it was a compilation of world history from 1945. And it took me

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.040
[Guest]: I think, the first quarter of the course. And again, to me, this was something really,

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:36.200
[Guest]: really new. Okay, I did most of my schooling in Bombay. My college was in Bombay, I went

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:42.200
[Guest]: to a commerce college, barely attended college. And again, the system in which how we teach

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.500
[Guest]: in India, at least how we taught then was so strict classroom based direct lectures,

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.480
[Guest]: as opposed to any engagement. And the perception in my head also through college was essentially

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:59.200
[Guest]: college life is there to sort of have fun, rather than really study, which is phenomenally,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.760
[Guest]: I mean, I regret that after growing up that, you know, this is this was an error. But when

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.760
[Guest]: I went to Britain for my master's, one of the reasons why I probably spent more, paid

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.240
[Guest]: more attention was because I was spending much more money, but also because the environment

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.360
[Guest]: was such that you were sitting in a classroom with 15 people, and you came reading something

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.920
[Guest]: and then you discussed it. And everybody was equal, even your professor who was sitting

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.240
[Guest]: over there. And that was an interesting environment, it took some getting used to, but once I got

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.520
[Guest]: used to it, it allowed you to sort of spend some time with the material that you were

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.000
[Guest]: reading and that you were engaging with. And that allowed you to think a little bit more

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.880
[Guest]: about it. I think the fact that you were required to discuss and engage forced me in some way

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.400
[Guest]: to, you know, take things more seriously. And once I took things more seriously, I realized

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:52.520
[Guest]: I really enjoyed it. I liked the idea of thinking through an event, a concept, taking it to

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.560
[Guest]: a logical conclusion, and then trying and I'm sort of debating that with other people.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.840
[Guest]: And I think that was the process that sort of got me interested. By the time I finished

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.280
[Guest]: my first term, which was December 2002. Again, we had a break during Christmas, I had the

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.560
[Guest]: option of coming back to India. And I said, Nah, I'm not flying back. I'm staying in Britain

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:18.160
[Guest]: and exploring. And I spent a lot of that Christmas break in libraries, a little bit of traveling

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.960
[Guest]: was spent most of it in libraries reading more, because I suddenly felt very inadequate,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.760
[Guest]: that I'm sitting here in a course with people who have come here with the intent and background

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:34.200
[Guest]: in the subject that I have not sort of cultivated. So I spent a lot of time studying thereafter.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.680
[Guest]: And again, I sort of fell in love with the subject because it just opened up my mind

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.720
[Guest]: to a world that existed, but I'd never seen. And thereafter, sort of, by the time the course

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:50.000
[Guest]: was over, I remember my dissertation was on the role of the United States in the Kashmir

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.520
[Guest]: conflict. And this is again, just two years after Clinton had left office, Bush had just

00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:02.000
[Guest]: taken office, US Pakistan relationship was undergoing a tremendous change after 9-11.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.920
[Guest]: For me, I came back to India for my research on that particular dissertation. And I traveled

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:13.720
[Guest]: to Delhi, spent time visiting the US embassy, the Pakistani embassy met with Indian diplomats.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.960
[Guest]: And again, that to me was an eye opening experience because Bombay, Delhi are two different worlds.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.360
[Guest]: I suddenly was in Delhi, suddenly was talking to all these people. I remember sitting and

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:30.400
[Guest]: having tea inside the Pakistani embassy. And I remember walking out of the Pakistani embassy

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.920
[Guest]: saying, what a nice gentleman, he offered me tea, he was so polite. Of course, things

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: are much different as you go deeper into a subject, but the experience of trying to engage

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.880
[Guest]: with people and trying to actually see what you've learned from a theoretical point of

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.080
[Guest]: view and from an academic point of view, and how diplomats actually operate, how things

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.640
[Guest]: actually function, it just fascinated me. So that's where sort of my love for the subject

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:00.040
[Guest]: picked up. What I had picked up along with that was an interest in journalism. So the

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:06.160
[Guest]: idea of how stories are told, how narratives are built, how you try to investigate something

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.480
[Guest]: that's happening, or how you try to contextualize the world around me. Those are the kind of

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.520
[Guest]: things that sort of fascinated me beyond just IR as a subject. And that's why when I sort

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.400
[Guest]: of got back, I mean, I spent some time thinking whether I wanted to do a PhD immediately after.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.440
[Guest]: I would have done it at that point of time. But then I was about 23 years old, feeling

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.920
[Guest]: the sense that I need to get some work experience, I need to sort of make some money, or get

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.520
[Guest]: a stable job, lest again, the idea of, you know, you're getting old, you're getting old

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.600
[Guest]: starts to come up. And again, it sounds silly. Today, 20 years later, when you say somebody

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.960
[Guest]: who's 23, you say, Oh, you're getting old. But at that point in time, the idea was, oh,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.920
[Guest]: in a couple of years, you're going to get married. And you know, so all of those sort

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.560
[Guest]: of things played in your head. But yeah, from from a subject matter point of view, my interest

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:56.200
[Guest]: in IR sort of picked up by the end of the first term of the course. And I was fascinated

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:01.600
[Guest]: by how history had worked, how the world works today, and so many things that I had just

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.440
[Guest]: not paid attention to. And then, of course, the role of journalism in contextualizing

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:12.880
[Guest]: the world around you, and how that works as a tool for storytelling, but also as a business.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.280
[Guest]: And that's what I eventually sort of lean towards journalism.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.360
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating. So what was the journey in journalism? Like, like, what kind of journalism did you

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:26.200
[Amit Varma]: want to do? What did you eventually start doing? And how different were your expectations

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.160
[Amit Varma]: from the reality that you confronted? I mean, you're not a journalist now, you were a journalist

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:38.040
[Amit Varma]: for a long time. So what about it made you sort of move on? And the interesting thing

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.640
[Amit Varma]: is just reading your book, I just felt that a lot of what is true of the Chinese media

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.040
[Amit Varma]: in different ways, can also be true of the Indian media in a certain way. And there are

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.720
[Amit Varma]: just like so many parallels, and we'll get into them, even though they're such vastly

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.920
[Amit Varma]: different countries. But just looking at the arc of journalism, like one, how different

00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.480
[Amit Varma]: was it from what you expected? What excited you about it? What turned you off about it?

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.480
[Amit Varma]: And to, you know, what do you think has changed? Like, if you were 23 today, would you get

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.080
[Amit Varma]: into journalism today?

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.120
[Guest]: So I have a kid when he grows up, I wouldn't advise him to get into journalism. When I

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.880
[Guest]: got into the field, and it might sound a bit of a cliche, but yeah, there was a tremendous

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:22.520
[Guest]: amount of idealism. There was a sense that what you do can have an impact on not just

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:28.400
[Guest]: people's lives, but also on society as a whole, you know, that you can change things. And

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.680
[Guest]: I think that anybody who's young and who wants to get into journalism, if you don't have

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:39.480
[Guest]: that sort of a sense, and that fire in your belly, don't get into the field, you know,

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.360
[Guest]: because it doesn't really help what's happened to the field anyway, right now. When I got

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.720
[Guest]: into it, that was one of the things I mean, I remember, you know, again, I'm segueing

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.920
[Guest]: to Bollywood, but I remember watching Swades on television, sorry, on cinema with my family.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.840
[Guest]: And I remember watching the movie. And I remember going like, yeah, you know, that's how you

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.960
[Guest]: need to have an impact. And again, I'm coming from a very privileged position to be able

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.080
[Guest]: to make that statement, you know, I mean, so this is about a privileged man, trying

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.400
[Guest]: to bring change. And therefore, it sort of appeals to me because I'm somebody who comes

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.440
[Guest]: from privilege, but that desire for, if you do something, you can affect change in this

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.040
[Guest]: country. And that, you know, and journalism was my sort of tool of trying to affect that

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:26.040
[Guest]: change. When I got into the field, my first job in journalism was with a small suburban

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.320
[Guest]: newspaper in Bombay, I worked there for about three months, I think the newspaper was called

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.800
[Guest]: on track suburbs, it was a very local thing. And I was the sub editor over there. So my

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.880
[Guest]: first job was sub editor of that paper, which was really amusing, because I had zero experience,

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:47.360
[Guest]: my English was good. And that's why I was a sub editor. But the lady who was junior

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.560
[Guest]: to me and our crime reporter, who was the key guy who got all the news that we got,

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.320
[Guest]: what the people who are basically running the show, you know, and it was an experience

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.280
[Guest]: for me to see that, okay, even though you may be higher above in the hierarchy, because

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:04.700
[Guest]: you don't know stuff, you know, you're still, you're not the person who's running the show.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.080
[Guest]: And the other sort of learning that I had from those three months was how much field

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.080
[Guest]: reporting matters. If you have field reporting, you can do things journalism is not about

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.640
[Guest]: sitting inside an office. And that was a two big learnings for my first three months. But

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:22.280
[Guest]: my first sort of big job, the subsequent year came at NDTV. NDTV had a online presence,

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.640
[Guest]: it was expanding its online presence. And I remember joining them in Delhi, I moved

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.100
[Guest]: really for that job. And I was really excited. I mean, to me, that was a huge deal, getting

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:38.860
[Guest]: into NDTV. And I know that job at NDTV was the first thing that gave me some respectability

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:44.680
[Guest]: at home. It was no longer this somebody who's trying these silly things in Bollywood and

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.280
[Guest]: talking about journalism, but yet working, you know, in jobs that aren't really paying

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.320
[Guest]: him so much, and can't take care of himself. Suddenly, you know, it's not like NDTV was

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.280
[Guest]: paying me the word. But it was suddenly a case of, oh, that brand value is attached

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.960
[Guest]: to him now. So now there is something of value that he's doing in life. And it gave me a

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.920
[Guest]: lot of confidence also that okay, there is something that I'm doing that's now working.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.800
[Guest]: Getting into the job on sort of on the website, it wasn't what I expected it to be. For me,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.920
[Guest]: there was a steep learning curve. And I think I did fairly well learning fairly quickly,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.920
[Guest]: not just the basics of journalism, but also realizing how important it is to understand

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.160
[Guest]: the medium that you're using. If you're on television, if you're on print, if you're

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.080
[Guest]: on digital, and evolving with the medium, because if you don't do that, then you die

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.360
[Guest]: very quickly. So that was again, another thing that I sort of picked up fairly, fairly quickly

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.160
[Guest]: at NDTV in terms of, I mean, when I think of digital journalism that time, because I

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:46.000
[Guest]: was in digital, to today, it's a sea change, right? At that point of time, I remember having

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.360
[Guest]: conversations with colleagues talking about how, as dot com journalists, we are, you know,

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.760
[Guest]: there's a barrel, there's gunk at the bottom of the barrel, then there are stones, and

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:02.320
[Guest]: then there's some more gunk, and then we lie there. That was us at the hierarchy of journalists,

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.960
[Guest]: because essentially, what you were doing was that you were repurposing stories that people

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.920
[Guest]: for television were doing, and you were just repurposing them for the website. And you

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.240
[Guest]: weren't adding any more value. And again, this is not a story that I've ever told publicly.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.880
[Guest]: But one of my most memorable experiences at NDTV was, there was an interview that was

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.760
[Guest]: done with Parvez Musharraf, who was then president of Pakistan. And in that interview, he'd spoken

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:31.360
[Guest]: about a four point formula to resolve the Kashmir issue. And it was a long interview,

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.040
[Guest]: we were sent a clip, it was like about 1130 12 in the night, the interview was supposed

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.400
[Guest]: to run the next morning, my colleague and I were the last people in the office in the

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:44.160
[Guest]: dot com team. And we were told, can you put this up on the website? And you know, with

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.600
[Guest]: a small clip and the interview will run on air tomorrow morning onwards. So put it up

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.760
[Guest]: early so that it's done. Okay, we put up the interview. Now, the headline had a character

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.840
[Guest]: limit. And the headlines that we were putting were very long, they weren't fitting the character

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.760
[Guest]: limit. None, neither of us was tech savvy enough to go and change the code. And Musharraf

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.160
[Guest]: in the interview said something to the effect of I'm ready to give up the claim on Kashmir

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:14.680
[Guest]: if you accept this four point formula. So as good journalists who wanted something clickbaity,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.800
[Guest]: we put up a headline saying Musharraf and in quotes, ready to give up Kashmir claim,

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.080
[Guest]: because that was the character limit within which it would fit. Apparently, it caused

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:30.600
[Guest]: a bit of a crisis the next day. And it was really good of the senior most management

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.520
[Guest]: of the of the organization to basically brush it off and saying, Look, guys, everybody makes

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.140
[Guest]: mistakes get on with life. But I think for a good 12 hours after that, once the issue

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.040
[Guest]: became a big deal, I think that was the first time that I genuinely worried I'm going to

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.080
[Guest]: lose my job. And I've caused something tremendously problematic. But yeah, but that was sort of

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:55.760
[Guest]: my experience of, you know, getting to grips with making mistakes, understanding why you

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:02.480
[Guest]: shouldn't do clickbaity things with sensitive things, understanding how you sort of contextualize

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:07.160
[Guest]: comments reports in much better fashion, understanding that at the end of the day, everything can

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.680
[Guest]: be changed. If you want even the source code to be changed, you can change it. But this

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.760
[Guest]: is my first six months at NDTV where I was trying to figure out all of this stuff. It

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:22.080
[Guest]: was a fascinating experience from there. And I went from NDTV to other news outlets, NewsX,

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:27.240
[Guest]: subsequently a very brief period in India today, before heading off to China, and working

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:32.880
[Guest]: with Chinese state media. But what the experience that I gained was essentially about how newsrooms

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:38.360
[Guest]: function, how do stories move through a newsroom, you know, I didn't spend too much time on

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.160
[Guest]: feed on the field, but I liaison with a lot of field reporters. So that gave you a sense

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:48.000
[Guest]: of at a desk level, what are the priorities of field reporters? What are the challenges

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.160
[Guest]: that they feel that they encounter? And what at the desk, can you assist them with? Because

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.600
[Guest]: often, you know, the reporter is on air, the reporter is doing a lot of the work. But the

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.560
[Guest]: team sitting on the desk in assignment are the guys who are essentially facilitating

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.520
[Guest]: everything. And they don't get the kind of credit that they should because they end up

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.400
[Guest]: doing a crazy amount of work to try and facilitate that one particular soundbite to come out

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.920
[Guest]: just as the field reporter is running around 24 seven to get that. So it's a team effort

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.800
[Guest]: and to figure out how that team effort flows is one of the things that I sort of also picked

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:25.320
[Guest]: up. The other and the most important learning that I've had throughout my time in journalism

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:31.360
[Guest]: is opinion is a dime a dozen. Reportage is what's of value. So you need to invest in

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.160
[Guest]: reportage. Unfortunately, that's not how the field has developed right now. The field has

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:42.620
[Guest]: evolved to favoring much more opinion, because again, it's cheap, and reportage is expensive.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.880
[Guest]: Another important sort of learning and we I mean, in the course that we teach at Takshashila

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:50.960
[Guest]: I sort of, I take the media component of that course. And I talked about this, the idea

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:57.520
[Guest]: of objectivity. Fairly early on, you realize that there isn't something or anything like

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:03.720
[Guest]: complete objectivity. We all come from our biases, explicit, implicit, known, unknown,

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:10.840
[Guest]: unseen, unseen. And at the end of that, you need to the most that you can do is recognize

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:16.040
[Guest]: your biases and see how they filter and try to see if you can see them away. If you can

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.880
[Guest]: find if you can't find, but at the end of the day, if you can sort of sit back and say,

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:25.680
[Guest]: I've done an honest job on this, also explaining your limitations with regard to a certain

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.040
[Guest]: story, then you've done all that you can do. You know, beyond that, there's little that

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.720
[Guest]: you can do. Unfortunately, today, when I see journalism, I mean, I'm extremely disappointed

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:41.280
[Guest]: with the field, how it's evolved. In my last role in a media outlet, I was essentially

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:48.120
[Guest]: in charge of assignment at Veeon. And again, it was a year or a year and a bit about a

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.160
[Guest]: year and a year and a half of experience over there. It was exhausting, because we were

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.200
[Guest]: launching a new channel. There was so much work to do. And the idea was to launch a channel

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.280
[Guest]: which had a global appeal, which talked about world news and things like that. So you needed

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:08.560
[Guest]: a different kind of skill set. You needed different kinds of reporters. And just coordinating

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.680
[Guest]: with all those people, it was exhausting at the end of it. My favorite sort of experience

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:19.120
[Guest]: throughout these years has been, was an experience in Veeon where we had a reporter deployed

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:26.200
[Guest]: in Iraq, along with the Kurdish militia, an Italian gentleman, Daniele Pagani, excellent,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.160
[Guest]: excellent guy. And he did a tremendous job of reporting throughout that time. I was his

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:36.440
[Guest]: handler from India, we would talk every night, sort of three o'clock, four o'clock at India

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:41.520
[Guest]: time, where he would give me updates randomly, if he had to head out for, you know, if the

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:45.560
[Guest]: militia was moving in on a certain area, and he was embedded with them. So he would call

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.960
[Guest]: me, he would give me a security update, and the call to agree, we both had to agree for

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.400
[Guest]: him to go, you know, with the militia for that particular raid. And there were at points

00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.000
[Guest]: of time where I would say, No, you can't go. And we argued a lot. So this is like at 4.30

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
[Guest]: in the morning, India time, I'm half asleep, he's basically telling me I'm going, you know,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.760
[Guest]: and your yes is a formality. And I'm arguing with him saying, No, you're not going, no,

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.760
[Guest]: you're not going, sometimes on security grounds, sometimes just in the reason that just for

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:20.920
[Guest]: the reason that I need you on air at 10am. Because even if you're in the field for the

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:27.280
[Guest]: next 30 days, if I can't show you on air repeatedly, I can't register with my audience that I have

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.560
[Guest]: a presence here. So my incentives are slightly different from your incentives, your incentives

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.120
[Guest]: are the story, my incentives are the story and the channel and the rest of it. So to

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.040
[Guest]: learn some of those things, and to experience some of those things, and to be in a position

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.200
[Guest]: where with the reporter, you're taking a call about essentially his security and his safety.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.600
[Guest]: To me, that was something that I had never done. And that was an experience in itself.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:54.840
[Guest]: It was frightening, it was exhilarating. It gave you a sense of power, yet you felt tremendously

00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:00.240
[Guest]: powerless. And I think all of that is sort of what I take away from my media experience.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.400
[Guest]: I haven't included my experience in the Chinese state media so far in this entire thing.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.120
[Amit Varma]: So let's come to that. Tell me about that. Tell me about your relationship with China,

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.840
[Amit Varma]: as it were just just kind of getting into the subject. Because you know, the thing is,

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.120
[Amit Varma]: the rest of the world, even if you think of essentially any part of the world is far more

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:21.440
[Amit Varma]: familiar to us, because because of our history of colonization, because of the English language,

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.640
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. So we can talk about Europe, we can talk about the US, we can of

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.080
[Amit Varma]: course talk about our neighborhood in terms of Pakistan, because I mean, we were all this

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.440
[Amit Varma]: same country to begin with. And we are the same people in a sense. But China for many

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:39.900
[Amit Varma]: people is just so deeply mysterious, like even after doing so many episodes on it, including

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:44.240
[Amit Varma]: a couple with you, I just feel like I barely scratched the surface of beginning to understand

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.720
[Amit Varma]: it or beginning to be able to think about it. So how did that start with you? Like,

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:54.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, you get into any territory, I'm guessing, with a bunch of preconceptions,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.480
[Amit Varma]: and then they fall apart, then you get to meet people, then you get to kind of understand

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.040
[Amit Varma]: the society a little bit more. Did you end up learning the language? And why China? Why

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040
[Amit Varma]: did you go there?

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.400
[Guest]: Right. So this was, I mean, again, like most things happenstance in some ways, but also

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.880
[Guest]: in some ways, not by design, but there was sort of, there were markers to take me there.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.400
[Guest]: Firstly, like I said, my father's been, my father and his brothers have been running

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.600
[Guest]: this export business for the last 40-45 years. And if you're exporting for the last 40 years,

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:29.080
[Guest]: you're doing something with China for sure. So we've had sort of export linkages with

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:35.800
[Guest]: China for many, many years. My first visit to the country was in early 2000s. But that

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:41.480
[Guest]: was a very brief visit to Shenzhen. And in my head at that point of time, China was essentially

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:46.800
[Guest]: crowded cheap goods. Those are the two sort of adjectives that went with the country.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.800
[Guest]: And beyond that, I didn't really have a sense of the place. The first real time that I sort

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:58.160
[Guest]: of stayed, spent some time in the country was I think about 2004-2005. My father put

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.960
[Guest]: me on a bus from Hong Kong to a city, to a small town in Fujian province in South China,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:10.480
[Guest]: where my cousin was living. And I didn't speak the language. I didn't understand anything.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.280
[Guest]: It was a late night bus from Hong Kong. And for anybody who's traveled from Hong Kong

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:21.600
[Guest]: to China on buses, what happens is that as you exit Hong Kong customs, you get on the

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.440
[Guest]: bus in Hong Kong, you leave the customs, you get off, you exit the customs, you get on

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.440
[Guest]: the bus again, they take you to the customs terminal in Shenzhen, you get off the bus,

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:37.880
[Guest]: you enter China, and then the bus changes. Now, once you enter China, nobody spoke English.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.720
[Guest]: And now the bus is changing. And I have no idea which bus I'm supposed to be on. So I'm

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:47.200
[Guest]: standing there dumbfounded. Somebody comes, young lady comes, she sticks a sticker on

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.240
[Guest]: my chest, which has some sort of a logo which is supposed to signify where I'm supposed

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.680
[Guest]: to go. I have no idea how she knows that. Next thing I know, I'm sort of in the sea

00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:00.720
[Guest]: of people, tremendous, many, many buses. And somebody herds me inside a bus. I asked 10

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.480
[Guest]: times, is this going here? And they just nod because they can't answer in English. I don't

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.120
[Guest]: understand the language. It's about 11 in the night. And these are really nice buses

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:15.480
[Guest]: because they have beds in the buses. And each bus has a tiny TV attached to it. I'm watching

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.680
[Guest]: a Chinese movie, which I can't understand, but I'm lying down on the bus, just wondering,

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:25.560
[Guest]: am I going to the right place? My cousins told me that I will ideally reach the town

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:30.480
[Guest]: by about 630 in the morning, and he will meet me at the bus station. And I'm like, okay.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.240
[Guest]: And again, this is a small town, right? So it's not like it's a big city where you can

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.160
[Guest]: find people and whatever. And again, this is not the time where you have Google maps

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.080
[Guest]: and everything. So you can actually even find things or even translator apps. So I'm sitting

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:49.960
[Guest]: in the bus at 330. The bus stops at a terminal. Everybody gets off. I don't get off. And I'm

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.920
[Guest]: like, I'm not getting off. It's 330. It's still three hours from my destination. The

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.360
[Guest]: lady and the driver basically come in. They politely forced me off the bus saying, this

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.400
[Guest]: is it. This is where it ends. And I remember sitting at the terminal, trying to call my

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.880
[Guest]: cousin who's not answering his phone for the next two and a half hours, wondering where

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.920
[Guest]: am I because it looked like an absolutely deserted sort of bus stop at the center of

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.920
[Guest]: nowhere.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.640
[Guest]: People in China, the sort of cab drivers are sort of reaching out to me. Again, it seems

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.520
[Guest]: like you don't see too many foreigners in that part of the country. So cab drivers are

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.840
[Guest]: reaching out to me, they're sort of looking at me, they're talking about me, they're pointing

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.560
[Guest]: at me. And I'm absolutely petrified as to what's going to happen, because I just don't

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.920
[Guest]: know what to do. And at 530, my cousin shows up at the bus stop. And he basically comes

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.560
[Guest]: laughing and saying he was drunk overnight because he was he'd gone for a barbecue and

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.400
[Guest]: he forgot that I was supposed to come and the bus might have come early. So that was

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.720
[Guest]: my introduction to China, where I suddenly felt like I'm in this alien. So the sense

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:51.380
[Guest]: of you know, being in a different place was very, very strong in a place that I'm not

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.920
[Guest]: familiar with at all. And then in a place that feels incredibly inaccessible. It was

00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.520
[Guest]: really, really strong. In that trip, when I stayed in China, I stayed for a month, I

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.600
[Guest]: think. And at that point of time, it took me a few days to sort of settle down, get

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.840
[Guest]: a sense of the place, get a sense of things. And then at that point of time, I traveled

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:15.280
[Guest]: to Beijing and Shanghai, myself just to sort of experience the place. And it was difficult

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.680
[Guest]: at that point of time to travel alone, particularly if you didn't know the language. But it was

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:25.160
[Guest]: fine, like you could manage and again, this was China was I think this was 2005 or 2006,

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.640
[Guest]: 2004 because China was preparing for the Beijing Olympics. And I remember going to Beijing

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.720
[Guest]: and seeing the countdown clock for the Beijing Olympics. It was that sort of gave me a sense

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.920
[Guest]: of Oh, because I remember my visit to Beijing was really, really nice. I found it fascinating.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:45.480
[Guest]: I found the city absolutely enchanting. I found the sort of way the old city had been

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.840
[Guest]: maintained and how that had been blended with the new. I found that absolutely enthralling.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:55.480
[Guest]: I remember walking on Chang'an Avenue outside the Forbidden City. I didn't have the time

00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:00.200
[Guest]: to go inside at that point of time, but just the environment over there. And this was right

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:06.280
[Guest]: next to in the seat of Chinese power. And it was open, it felt free. And I was like,

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:11.080
[Guest]: this is really strange to what the perception of in my head is of communist China. And to

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:16.540
[Guest]: me, that was a bit of a shock. I remember on Tiananmen Square, meeting a bunch of young

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:23.120
[Guest]: Chinese who would walk up to you and who would say that, well, where are you from? Your English

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.200
[Guest]: is good. Can I speak to you in English? Because I want to improve my English. And I remember

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:35.600
[Guest]: randomly going for dinners with young Chinese, you know, for a hotpot meal while they practice

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.440
[Guest]: their English. I learned something about China and we had a good meal and we split the bill.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.980
[Guest]: And I just thought that that was really, really interesting. I didn't experience anything

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:50.400
[Guest]: like this in the West, where somebody would randomly come up to you, you know, or in India.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.880
[Guest]: And even if I had, I probably would have been deeply suspicious. For some reason, at that

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.900
[Guest]: point of time, I was not that suspicious. Or maybe I had, you know, youthful confidence

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.800
[Guest]: to the level of delusion that again, I was like, it's alright, it's not an issue. But

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.800
[Guest]: I thought it was really, really fun to be able to do that. And again, that was my sort

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.800
[Guest]: of shattering of the misperception of a place which is inaccessible, of a place which is

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:18.640
[Guest]: so closed that, you know, the idea of the sort of stereotype of a communist country,

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.680
[Guest]: where there is no freedom of thought, expression, whatever. I also remember, again, stereotypical

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:29.800
[Guest]: questions asking some of the, some of those students that I met about religion, politics,

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.240
[Guest]: and they were quite free to talk about those things, which I thought was fascinating, because

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.300
[Guest]: again, one thought that they would not, but they had very free, engrossing discussions

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:43.160
[Guest]: about some of these things. So that started to change my perceptions about what China

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:48.280
[Guest]: is like that, after that first few days of the trip where I found it, you know, the first

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:55.840
[Guest]: change was that China became more than just crowded and cheap goods to people who are

00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:02.140
[Guest]: young, who are exciting, who are thinking, who are free, who don't have the kind of inhibitions

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:07.360
[Guest]: with regard to strangers. Again, it's very different from the China of today. You know,

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.040
[Guest]: it's changed quite a bit again. But as a society, I thought it was very, very interesting. It

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.720
[Guest]: was, it had, there were lots of similarities with India, in the sense that family was a

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:24.040
[Guest]: key component of people's lives. Parents in China also went out to marriage bureaus to,

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.560
[Guest]: you know, those parks where you have profiles listed to find a child, lots of pressure on

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.720
[Guest]: women with regard to marriage. So a lot of similarities also in terms of how our societies

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:39.320
[Guest]: are also structured. Even when it came to sort of things like food habits of the food

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.920
[Guest]: is obviously very different. And the habits are also very different in terms of the timings

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:48.680
[Guest]: of their lunch and dinner and all of that. But just the way they approached life, the

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:56.120
[Guest]: idea of you need to work hard to do something in life, it doesn't come easy. You don't demand

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:01.560
[Guest]: too much in terms of welfare, you depend on your own ability and your ability, you know,

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.280
[Guest]: some people come from privilege, some people come from cultivating it. But all of those

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.560
[Guest]: sort of, you know, values of hard work, of dedication, of perseverance, and things like

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:15.800
[Guest]: that, which I felt comfortable and familiar with, I sort of saw there and I said, look,

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.440
[Guest]: we're not really that different. We speak different languages, but we are in the sense

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.680
[Guest]: of yes, there is a certain Asian culture to all of this, which is very different from

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:29.200
[Guest]: the West. You got I got glimpses of that. And that made it much more accessible to me

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.400
[Guest]: as a society. And again, I cultivate, I develop friendships with people which I have maintained

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.640
[Guest]: over the years. And it's been fascinating to therefore sort of see, have conversations

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.040
[Guest]: with them today about where China is today.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.960
[Amit Varma]: Wow. So a couple of these differences, actually, I'd like to explore because this is really

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.280
[Amit Varma]: interesting. Like one, you've pointed out the similarities, but you also said that there

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.680
[Amit Varma]: are differences. So what are these essential cultural differences like and then you pointed

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:01.440
[Amit Varma]: out that China today has changed a lot and it's different from what it was. So what is

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.960
[Amit Varma]: that difference like? So two questions, really.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:11.200
[Guest]: So firstly, in terms of cultural similarities, I've spoken about in terms of differences.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:18.120
[Guest]: I'll give you an example of how conversations around politics went. When I asked people

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:24.920
[Guest]: about their political beliefs, their political desires, participation in sort of the political

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:31.800
[Guest]: environment, the answer that I got, particularly from people outside Beijing, was, yeah, all

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.600
[Guest]: of that is for people in Beijing to worry about, you know, I'm here to try and make

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.720
[Guest]: my living. So in some way, that social contract that was offered by the party in the late

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.880
[Guest]: in the 80s, and the early 90s, particularly, about will give you opportunity will give

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:51.440
[Guest]: you opportunities to grow will give you opportunities to become more well off, improve your livelihood

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:57.560
[Guest]: and all of that. But you surrender political control to us, that has some way been internalized.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.680
[Guest]: And I thought that was very different from what happens in India. In India, that's not

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.440
[Guest]: the bargain that we are making with the state. And we are constantly fighting to not make

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:09.640
[Guest]: that bargain with the state. You know, even when you have a strong mind leader who comes

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:14.720
[Guest]: and says, I'm going to give you a chedin or whatever else, we are still fighting for the

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:20.880
[Guest]: bargain that that does not mean you can take away my liberty in terms of my political liberty.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.800
[Guest]: In China, you saw that that bargain had been accepted in some way, at least my experience

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.400
[Guest]: was that it had been expected in some way. That's the scope for that was expanding at

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:32.040
[Guest]: the time that I had gone in 2005 2006, where it was a moment where China was much more

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:37.640
[Guest]: open and people were still talking much more about politics. But in general, that bargain

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:42.320
[Guest]: had sort of settled in people's mind in some ways. But again, some people were still pushing

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:47.560
[Guest]: boundaries. And these were activists, you know, people who believed in, you know, constitutional

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.480
[Guest]: rights and so on and so forth. People who believed in democracy and democratic processes.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.680
[Guest]: But that was happening at in sort of in an elite level in some ways, the general people

00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.400
[Guest]: that I encountered, I felt that, you know, they'd accepted that bargain. And they didn't

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:08.200
[Guest]: mind having given away their political rights for having this opportunity at a better life.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:12.160
[Guest]: So that was one sort of big political difference. Again, from a religion point of view, this

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.960
[Guest]: was also fascinating. Again, I was new to the place. So when I asked people about what

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:20.400
[Guest]: they believed in, the answer that I got was most often was, what do you mean? What do

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:25.120
[Guest]: I believe in? Or who do I believe in? I believe in myself. And I thought again, that was quite

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:30.560
[Guest]: a fascinating answer. In time, as I've studied China much more deeply, I realized that religion

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:35.720
[Guest]: is much more than that simplistic answer in China, it's it is a powerful force. And not

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:41.120
[Guest]: just in terms of the, you know, Islam, Buddhism, whatever. But, you know, even local religions

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.400
[Guest]: are a powerful force in terms of organizing society and getting people to congregate.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:50.520
[Guest]: But that sort of response to me was striking, very different from what I would get in India

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:57.880
[Guest]: from people. In terms of just day to day values, I felt that people, particularly the youth

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:03.440
[Guest]: in China, and even in urban sort of cities, was very independent. It was very independent,

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:10.040
[Guest]: they were very independent, they very early on people were sort of taking on responsibilities,

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.520
[Guest]: which for many people would be far beyond their age. And perhaps it had something to

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:19.200
[Guest]: do with the one child policy. From a family culture point of view, what I also found fascinating

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:25.600
[Guest]: was the fact that millions, hundreds of millions of people in China work as migrant laborers.

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:31.760
[Guest]: Lots of parents leave their children with grandparents in villages, while they are working

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:38.280
[Guest]: in cities. And you don't see your child for a year. You travel back once a year during

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:43.080
[Guest]: the spring festival or Chinese New Year, and you greet your children. And again, that to

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:48.160
[Guest]: me was a fascinating experience in terms of how these families survive, and what that

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.640
[Guest]: might do to these children as they grow up, what that does to parents as they're working

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.120
[Guest]: in cities that distance from their family, what that does to grandparents, because at

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:01.480
[Guest]: that age, you're now having to raise a child essentially. And I thought that was very different

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.400
[Guest]: from again, what we do in India, you know, people migrate, but people migrate with children

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:10.760
[Guest]: in India, you don't leave your children behind. But again, that that is a legacy of the hukou

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:15.000
[Guest]: system in China, the household registration system, but it's just shaped society in such

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.200
[Guest]: a way. So I thought some of these were really, really fascinating trends and fascinating

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.840
[Guest]: differences in terms of how China is structured, how India is structured. And I again, every

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:28.800
[Guest]: time you hear some of these conversations in India about in Bombay, you'd hear this

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.640
[Guest]: conversation about oh, Bombay is too crowded, we need to have a separate visa to enter Bombay

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:37.360
[Guest]: or some sort of system to block people. And some of the sort of hints are at the Chinese

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:42.200
[Guest]: hukou system. We don't sort of talk about the unintended consequences, the sort of challenges

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.160
[Guest]: that come up with that system. Likewise, when we talk about population control, again, a

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:50.840
[Guest]: topic which in India today is also becoming relevant again, we don't look at what the

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:55.560
[Guest]: Chinese have done and how the kind of problems that that's created, not just at a social

00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:00.120
[Guest]: level, but also at an economic level today where they're having to undo everything. So

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.880
[Guest]: I think that some of these differences persist. And I think it's good for us to have gone

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.840
[Guest]: down the roads that we have gone down, rather than trying to ape them, because that degree

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:14.520
[Guest]: of re-engineering of society has tremendous challenges that come up for individuals, families,

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:19.960
[Guest]: which honestly, you know, if I was put in that position, I would find it really, really

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.680
[Guest]: difficult. And that's sort of my sense of the differences that exist between the two

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.000
[Guest]: societies in terms of, you know, I mean, I could go on and on about the differences.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.540
[Guest]: So from from a political structure point of view, it's a unity structure, ours is much

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.960
[Amit Varma]: more representative participatory.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.680
[Amit Varma]: Let me make a couple of observations and then go on to my next question, which kind of arises

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.400
[Amit Varma]: from what you said. One thing, of course, as far as population is concerned, is that

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:48.840
[Amit Varma]: I know that it's going to be an issue in India soon once again. And it's just it's just horrible,

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:54.320
[Amit Varma]: because I, you know, I've gotten so tired of kind of pointing out to people that overpopulation

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.360
[Amit Varma]: is not a problem. In fact, there's no such thing as overpopulation. People are our greatest

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:04.000
[Amit Varma]: resource. All the failures which we ascribe to, you know, too many people is actually

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.480
[Amit Varma]: the fault of bad governance. And the history of humanity is actually a history of people

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:14.840
[Amit Varma]: moving from places with less population density to more population density, moving from rural

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:21.320
[Amit Varma]: areas to cities. Why do people do that? Population density is a damn good thing. So I'll link

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:26.520
[Amit Varma]: to a column I wrote on that in the show notes. Meanwhile, just going to your observation

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:32.280
[Amit Varma]: about this sense of, you know, the politics is for people to Beijing, for people in Beijing

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.960
[Amit Varma]: to worry about, I'll just do what I do. And why India is kind of different. I'd say that

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.160
[Amit Varma]: yes, at one level, of course, India is different because democracy and local democracy, especially

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:48.100
[Amit Varma]: to whatever tiny extent it is there and all of that. But I'd also say that, conversely,

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.920
[Amit Varma]: in India, there's a certain apathy also that has developed over politics. I mean, one of

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:57.200
[Amit Varma]: the reasons I think that we don't punish the bad governance of our rulers, as it were,

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.920
[Amit Varma]: because rulers is indeed what they are, since we took the colonial state that they left

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:06.120
[Amit Varma]: us. One reason that we don't punish bad governance as often at the polls as we should, is the

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:10.800
[Amit Varma]: sense of apathy that the state will always be dysfunctional. It is what it is. Just get

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.000
[Amit Varma]: on with life. Just do your jugaar and get on with life. Now, my question is this. There's

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.400
[Amit Varma]: an old observation Jagdish Bhagwati made where he pointed out that people in China have a

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:24.680
[Amit Varma]: profit-seeking mentality where people in India have a rent-seeking mentality. And my hypothesis

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:30.560
[Amit Varma]: for why that might be the case is not so much to do with culture inherently, but more to

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:35.640
[Amit Varma]: do with the sort of institutions we have lived with for decades, where over here, where everything

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.800
[Amit Varma]: is top-down and the state has such a heavy part of the economy, certainly till 91. You

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.560
[Amit Varma]: know, rent-seeking was where you made your money. You got ahead by being close to the

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:51.600
[Amit Varma]: believers of power as it were. So people would think in this zero-sum way, whereas Bhagwati's

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:57.040
[Amit Varma]: point was that in China, it's more a positive some way, which is what you seem to be alluding

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.680
[Amit Varma]: to as well. So what do you think of this observation? Yeah, I mean, I don't entirely agree with

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:06.360
[Guest]: it. If you look at the Chinese system, you know, throughout the imperial times, you know,

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:10.880
[Guest]: for the past, whatever number of thousands of years, you will see that yes, there is

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.800
[Guest]: enterprise, there is innovation, there is all of that. But the state and the central

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:21.680
[Guest]: government plays a very, very strong role in the entire process. In fact, the entire

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.560
[Guest]: sort of towards the final few dynasties, what you will see is that, and a lot of it, actually

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.960
[Guest]: not even just the final few dynasties, even throughout history, what you will see is that

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:36.520
[Guest]: a lot of the sort of struggle in China in terms of social mobility is about reaching

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:41.880
[Guest]: the point of aristocracy, where your nobility associated with the state, you're the scholar,

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.360
[Guest]: nobleman, and you're associated with the state. So I don't necessarily think that that is

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:51.080
[Guest]: so, and that is essentially that sort of breeds rent-seeking over a period of time, because

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:55.400
[Guest]: then, you know, your family connections and so on and so on breed all of that. So I don't

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:59.960
[Guest]: think that necessarily, that has been the motivation. I think that there is a change

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:06.000
[Guest]: definitely that took place in the late 1970s and early 80s. The idea that the Communist

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.600
[Guest]: Party, and again, I'm making a very broad stroke here, but the idea that the Communist

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:16.360
[Guest]: Party officially sort of said that, look, we need to be rich, you know, and you need

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:21.680
[Guest]: to go out and make money. And that richness does not have to come with generating simply

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.240
[Guest]: wealth from within and creating rent-seeking. There is tremendous rent-seeking that still

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:31.640
[Guest]: took place. Through the 80s, you'll hear about, 80s and 90s, you'll hear about stories that

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:36.240
[Guest]: are called suitcase enterprises, where essentially bureaucrats are leaving the government and

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.760
[Guest]: they're, you know, selling off enterprises and they're, you know, cutting these deals.

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.280
[Guest]: And then sons of these bureaucrats or party members are eventually becoming chairpersons

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:48.440
[Guest]: of private institutes who are then winning government contracts. So there's a tremendous

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.440
[Guest]: amount of all that that's taken place. At the same time, what's essentially happened

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:58.600
[Guest]: is that once the economy was opened up in terms of price controls, in terms of opportunity,

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:03.240
[Guest]: that allowed people to make more money and the government encouraged it. It basically

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.680
[Guest]: said, look, our job is to grow rich. I mean, Deng Xiaoping's statement was essentially

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:11.640
[Guest]: that being poor is not socialism. And today, when we look back sort of 40 years down the

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:17.960
[Guest]: road, when the Communist Party gives us its official version of its own history, it describes

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.440
[Guest]: its history in three phases. The first phase is standing up, which is forming the state

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:29.080
[Guest]: under Mao Zedong. The second stage is growing rich. And today, the first stage is becoming

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:34.840
[Guest]: strong. So I think in that context of Mr. Bhagwati sort of saying that I sort of see

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:38.720
[Guest]: the logic of it, that yes, it's true. But it's also the case that there was tremendous

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:44.720
[Guest]: rent seeking, there is tremendous rent seeking that happens today. And that is why anti-corruption

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:50.440
[Guest]: campaigns by leaders have been critical to every leader. And every leader has launched

00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:55.160
[Guest]: sweeping anti-corruption campaigns at different levels. In fact, sort of an acknowledgement

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:59.800
[Guest]: of this rent seeking came in early 2000s, when Jiang Zemin, who was then General Secretary

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:05.040
[Guest]: of the party, came up with this theory. So each leader has a theory. Mao Zedong had a

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.920
[Guest]: thought, Deng Xiaoping had a theory, you know, Jiang Zemin had a theory, Hu Jintao had a

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:16.080
[Guest]: theory, Xi Jinping has a thought. And in the Chinese system, thought is above theory. Jiang

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.480
[Guest]: Zemin's theory was called Three Represents. It essentially talks about how different factors

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:25.600
[Guest]: and different elements of society are going to be represented by the party. And one of

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.920
[Guest]: them is private enterprise. And the reason that he came up with that theory, or he sort

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.960
[Guest]: of framed it that way, is because a lot of the bureaucracy and the elite had sort of

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:41.400
[Guest]: moved from, you know, and sort of created these enterprises. Also a lot of private enterprises,

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.400
[Guest]: you know, folks who've done well, although who may not be members of the party, felt

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:50.320
[Guest]: that it's important to be members of the party to do well, and to do better. So the party

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.520
[Guest]: membership expanded because of this. And that sort of tells you that there is tremendous

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.160
[Guest]: rent seeking that's taking place. So I don't entirely agree with him, if I was to go back

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.480
[Guest]: even historically, through the thousands of years of imperial rule, to even the PRC period

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:11.960
[Guest]: from 1949. But I do see that the loosening of controls in the 1980s, and subsequently,

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.640
[Guest]: did create this impetus to, you know, become rich, because the party basically said that

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.840
[Guest]: we need to become rich. And whatever policies are needed to facilitate becoming rich, we

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:26.040
[Guest]: will do, and we will experiment with. And if that's the stated goal, then yes, people

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.640
[Guest]: that gave the encouragement to people to go out and seek profit, maximize profit, which

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.240
[Guest]: I don't think necessarily is something that existed throughout the history of imperial

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.880
[Guest]: China. I think the history of imperial China has not been about becoming, it has been about

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:45.000
[Guest]: occupation, it's been about defense, it's been about maintaining the glory of the Emperor,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.440
[Guest]: it's been about people wanting to become noblemen and scholars and those sorts of things, and

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.280
[Guest]: tremendous rent seeking and all of that. Because if you go back to even the last dynasty, the

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.200
[Guest]: Qing, what you will see is that through the 1800s, there is tremendous poverty in China,

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.520
[Guest]: and there is tremendous inequality also. But there is obviously, China is playing a bigger

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.920
[Guest]: role at the world stage as a key trading nation, key provider of goods and all of that. But

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:14.120
[Guest]: I don't think people are driven by profit motivation, the higher goal is self actualization

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:19.600
[Guest]: in terms of the Confucian idea of how you rise above in society, and at the top of it,

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.400
[Guest]: you are a scholar, nobleman, and so on and so forth. So I think, therefore, I don't entirely

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.160
[Guest]: agree with that. But yeah, for the last since the 80s, I can sort of see where that logic

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160
[Guest]: fits in.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.840
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, and you know, some of the listeners might worry that what is this Amit and Manoj

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.800
[Amit Varma]: are talking about seeking profit as if it is a good thing, what is going on, but you

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.800
[Amit Varma]: know, which kind of goes back to sort of what Jawaharlal Nehru once said to JRD Tata, where

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.120
[Amit Varma]: he said, quote, do not speak to me of profit, it is a dirty word, stop quote, and, and there

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.040
[Amit Varma]: has been this sort of suspicion of it. But you know, just to drive home that basic one

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.680
[Amit Varma]: on one point, how do you make profit, you make profit by providing someone something

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.240
[Amit Varma]: that makes them better off. You know, I keep referring to the double thank you moment,

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.240
[Amit Varma]: the famous phrase coined by John Stossel, where if you buy a cup of coffee in a cafe,

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.760
[Amit Varma]: you value the coffee more than the money you pay for it. And the cafe values the money

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.240
[Amit Varma]: more than the coffee. So both of you say thank you, both of you are better off. Whereas in

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.760
[Amit Varma]: India, there is perhaps too much of an exploitative mindset, which Bhagwati and anyone who has

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:19.240
[Amit Varma]: lived here might well have seen, but people can often have a sort of a more surface view

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:24.120
[Amit Varma]: of China. And earlier, you spoke about a broad strokes as well. Now, what happens is that

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.320
[Amit Varma]: you enter a strange place, or you, you know, start learning a new theory or whatever you

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.400
[Amit Varma]: get into something new, your initial notion of it is very broad brush, right? And that

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:38.800
[Amit Varma]: will include misconceptions. And right at the start, it will be incredibly simplistic.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.280
[Amit Varma]: And then gradually, the scales fall off, and you discover more and more layers, and you

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:47.640
[Amit Varma]: go deeper and deeper and so on. So what was that process like for you where you really

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.960
[Amit Varma]: get into it? Like, what is that moment in time where you feel at home in China, where,

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, you're chilling, you're no longer surrounded by strange people you don't understand,

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.840
[Amit Varma]: for example, you're no longer nervous about, you know, what others might think of you?

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.360
[Amit Varma]: Or can you understand them? Or am I in the wrong city? What is this lonely bus stop?

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.760
[Amit Varma]: So what was that process? Like for you, as it were,

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:16.280
[Guest]: I went back to the country in 2011. And again, I went back as a trader, I got fed up of journalism

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:22.200
[Guest]: stepped away, went back as a trader. And I spent two years doing some freelance writing

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.080
[Guest]: work from China and traveling across the country, and trying to run a trading business, which

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:33.200
[Guest]: I was terrible at doing. And very early on, my father sort of realized that and he told

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.880
[Guest]: me, you know, if you want to move out, I wouldn't, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.040
[Guest]: So you know, please try and do that. But so I spent those two years were really useful

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.640
[Guest]: for me, because it allowed me to travel, it allowed me to travel to many factories, and

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:50.400
[Guest]: different places where China was, where people were manufacturing things. And it sort of

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:56.880
[Guest]: took you to the heart of what is it that's gotten China this boom, this low end manufacturing

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.600
[Guest]: that's happening. And just to understand how factories are structured, what are the incentives

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:10.800
[Guest]: that people have, how negotiation happens, and how the system had changed, in terms of,

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.160
[Guest]: you know, it was no longer just, again, this is 2011, 2012. So low end manufacturing was

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.560
[Guest]: starting to somewhat lose its steam also. So to just see that, you know, there is this

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:26.800
[Guest]: gradation of factories from really high end places, which is manufacturing stuff for Europe,

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.800
[Guest]: the United States, to factories, which are actually in just somebody's bungalow. And

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:36.640
[Guest]: I've seen some of this in India, but never to the scale that what I saw over there. So

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.480
[Guest]: to me, that was an experience at the heart of China's economic power as to how some of

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.320
[Guest]: this is happening today, again, and just how rapidly things have changed is that today,

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:49.720
[Guest]: I think this is a, is a sea change today, technology plays such a huge role in China,

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.840
[Guest]: and just 10 years that I don't think that it's any more recognisable to what I saw in

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:59.760
[Guest]: 2011, 2012. But in 2013, eventually, I sort of, I wanted to continue to stay in that part

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:03.920
[Guest]: of the world, I was intrigued by the place, I found it comfortable by that point of time,

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.120
[Guest]: while I was travelling, I enjoyed chatting with people in cabs, I started to pick up

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:14.000
[Guest]: a little bit of Mandarin, even today, I think I there's so much more that I need to do to

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.280
[Guest]: learn that language. But I started to pick up a little bit enough to have a basic conversation

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.960
[Guest]: enough to crack a joke or two, you know, to be able to engage in some sort of a banter.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.840
[Guest]: Fortunately, technology had improved. So you had translation apps for the more difficult

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.240
[Guest]: things. Despite that, I think I spent many times telling, telling a cab driver to go

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:37.440
[Guest]: left when I actually wanted him to go right. So I've done a lot of that. I've gotten lost

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.840
[Guest]: in the country a lot of times and sort of found my way back, which I think is one of

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.840
[Guest]: the I mean, once I got comfortable, to me, that was the best way to learn about the country

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.320
[Guest]: to just get lost in a place and then figure it out and then find my way back. You find

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.840
[Guest]: a lot of helpful people on streets. I saw a lot of I mean, I experienced a lot of warmth

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:59.480
[Guest]: with regard to India. Bollywood had a huge role to play with it. Old sort of Nehru had

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.920
[Guest]: some role to play with it because people did remember him. People followed current things

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.600
[Guest]: in India current developments. So that was entertaining. I started to get charmed by

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.720
[Guest]: the culture. I thought it was fascinating that this is a place where in the evening

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:17.480
[Guest]: in cities and towns and villages, you have these giant public parks. And suddenly, at

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.920
[Guest]: about six o'clock in the evening, you have music playing in the public parks, and you

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:26.880
[Guest]: have 50 6070 people gathering on the square and doing synchronized dances. And that's

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.600
[Guest]: the evening sort of community routine. So in smaller towns, it's a community routine

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.200
[Guest]: in bigger cities like in Beijing or someplace, there may be a routine by a group. But it's

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.800
[Guest]: also just you know, people in a public park, somebody's practicing Tai Chi, somebody's

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:44.360
[Guest]: there with a sword practicing his movements, somebody's dancing. And I just thought that

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:50.480
[Guest]: sense of freedom, that sense of being outside and doing all of that, I thought it was really,

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.400
[Guest]: really interesting. And it felt in some ways comfortable again, growing up in Bombay, as

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:59.560
[Guest]: soon as September, October comes till the next January, there's constantly music outside.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.080
[Guest]: So it felt familiar in some ways also. So to me, that was the time where I sort of really

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.520
[Guest]: felt that I'm comfortable in this place. I'd gotten, you know, I'm a non-rich kid, and

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.000
[Guest]: I'd gotten the food had what had not been too much of an issue for me, I got comfortable

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.080
[Guest]: with it, I found interesting places to eat, I tried to experiment much more. And again,

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:21.360
[Guest]: I made friends, which really helped. Because, you know, you could talk about all sorts of

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.600
[Guest]: things. And, you know, and they were very curious, they were very, very curious people.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.520
[Guest]: So I thought, again, that's fascinating that it's not like this is a closed society where

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.240
[Guest]: they also don't want to know about the world. And they don't want to share quite open people,

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:41.080
[Guest]: very friendly, very hospital. I moved to Beijing in 2013, when I joined China Central Television.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:45.480
[Guest]: That was my first time staying in a big city for a prolonged period of time in China. Otherwise,

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:51.560
[Guest]: I was traveling and I was staying in smaller towns doing low end manufacturing. When I

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:57.160
[Guest]: moved to Beijing, to me, that was a process of getting used to how cities function in

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:02.880
[Guest]: China, and treated very well, the organization treated me very, very well. But very early

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.320
[Guest]: on, you sort of started to realize that this is different. This is not journalism. I'm

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:13.520
[Guest]: not exploring a story and nobody's interested in me wanting to explore a story. You know,

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:21.680
[Guest]: this is top down. What I can give them, and what they wanted from me, were English skills,

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:29.920
[Guest]: and my ability to try and build a digital newsroom. What they can give me is a steady,

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.120
[Guest]: really well paying job, and an experience into how China functions. So that was the

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.000
[Guest]: bargain that I essentially made that, okay, I'm going in there to try and figure out,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.720
[Guest]: try and make some money, but try and also figure out how the system works, how things

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.840
[Guest]: work. And I think it was within a few months that I realized that, okay, I'm not going

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.600
[Guest]: to be doing any interesting journalism here. So I need to spend my time learning as much

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.240
[Guest]: as I want to learn about China. And it was a very comfortable life. It was the first

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:04.960
[Guest]: time that I was working in a media organization where after my eight-hour shift, I was not

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.240
[Guest]: expected to be in office. In India, if I said ever that after my eight-hour shift that,

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.040
[Guest]: okay, my shift is done, I'm going home, I'd be threatened with being fired. You know,

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.720
[Guest]: and I had most of my friends were in office. So if I felt like, okay, I'm sitting here

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.880
[Guest]: for half an hour more because I'm watching something on my laptop. And in case you guys

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.720
[Guest]: need some help, ask me, my work's over. But in case you need some help, just feel free

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:32.800
[Guest]: to ask me. And that was this huge thing that, oh no, a foreigner is okay to work overtime.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.360
[Guest]: And I was like, it's not a big deal at all. But then that was their experience with

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.840
[Guest]: Westerners, right? People from Britain, from the US, they had very clear boundaries about

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.760
[Guest]: how long they would work and, you know, what they were contracted to do. Whereas for me

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.600
[Guest]: and for other Indians also working in the organization, it was, it was all right. It

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.360
[Guest]: didn't feel like it was a big burden. And again, I think that's where there was again,

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.720
[Guest]: a culture of work culture blending, right? Because the Chinese employees of the organization

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.120
[Guest]: worked insane hours, they didn't work eight hours. And I remember talking to them and

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.240
[Guest]: telling them, well, it's, you know, put your foot down. And then I was like, yeah,

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.600
[Guest]: I'm saying this from a position of privilege here. In India, I would never say that put

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.000
[Guest]: your foot down, because I know I would lose my job. So but you've understood that sort

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.200
[Guest]: of environment. By that point of time, I was very comfortable with the country with people,

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.720
[Guest]: I had learned how to engage with people in the organization also. And to be fair, we

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.200
[Guest]: used to have these morning edit meetings with the entire top brass of the English News.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:35.040
[Guest]: So CCTV is a huge entity. It's China's national broadcaster. The English News is a small component

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.840
[Guest]: of it. The Mandarin News is obviously the biggest component. And then CCTV has sports,

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:45.360
[Guest]: entertainment and so many other networks. The English News editors, we used to have

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.480
[Guest]: this meeting every morning. And as somebody who's in charge of the digital newsroom,

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.440
[Guest]: I would go to that meeting and talk about what are the big priorities that we are covering today,

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.120
[Guest]: and also how world media is covering China. I don't think there was ever a day where I was

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:07.040
[Guest]: told not to say anything that was critical. So even on June 4, even on Tiananmen Square's

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.120
[Guest]: anniversary, I could sit there and I could say this is what's being covered. This is what's

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:17.040
[Guest]: being said. I think, you know, CCTV should cover this, you should talk about this. We were always

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.760
[Guest]: given a patient year, and then people went continued. So there was never a case of don't

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.760
[Guest]: talk about this. But there was a certain sense of, you know, look, the foreign staff may not

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.160
[Guest]: entirely get what our priorities are, what our incentives are, and where we come from, and all

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.080
[Guest]: of that. At points of time, that would annoy you, but at points, but sort of sitting back,

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.760
[Guest]: and when you think back, you understand where that where they're coming from. These are

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:45.920
[Guest]: individuals who are working in a system who are accountable to a hierarchy, and you will function

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.960
[Guest]: accordingly. You know, in my time there, I remember there was a former CCTV journalist

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.400
[Guest]: who had come up with a documentary called Under the Dome that was about pollution in China. I

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.400
[Guest]: think I've got the name right under the dome. She's a former CCTV journalist, very popular

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:06.160
[Guest]: journalist, who'd come up with a documentary. And you saw that there was debate around that.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.080
[Guest]: And there was, I mean, you go back and anybody who's listening wants to go back and research

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.240
[Guest]: that controversy, you will see that the documentary got censored, it got banned,

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.800
[Guest]: and so on and so forth. Yet it got covered, it got tremendous social media coverage.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.120
[Guest]: So it was a moment still where China was very vibrant, where there was lots of social media

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.160
[Guest]: conversation of different kinds. Today, social media environment is still very vibrant,

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:33.840
[Guest]: but it's become much more nationalistic. At that point of time, there was a far more freer debate.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.640
[Guest]: And that space for freedom was becoming constrained. Likewise, I remember when,

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:44.240
[Guest]: again, I was in CCTV, when the US Supreme Court passed its judgment on gay marriage,

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.840
[Guest]: and CCTV, the network covered it, we covered it. But there's a certain ambivalence in China with

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:54.880
[Guest]: regard to policies with regard to, you know, the LGBTQ community. It used to at one point of time

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.840
[Guest]: be treated as a illness, and that's no longer the case for a long time. But still, it's not

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.000
[Guest]: really talked about, you know, policy issues of that nature are not talked about. And, you know,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
[Guest]: we were all told, don't get into it, cover the news, but don't get into it. Now, but this was

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.840
[Guest]: huge on social media in China, you know, China has a huge LGBTQ population. Yet we were not covering

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.160
[Guest]: it. Apart from just saying the US Supreme Court has done this. I remember us putting out a post

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.360
[Guest]: on Chinese Twitter platform, you know, Twitter, like microblogging platform, Weibo. And we put

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.800
[Guest]: out a post about how there's a rainbow in Beijing today, and it had rained in Beijing. So one of my

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.840
[Guest]: colleagues just took a picture of the rainbow and we put out the and we said, oh, let's just

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:39.600
[Guest]: surreptitiously put it out on our organization's Weibo platform. And there was tremendous conversation

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.160
[Guest]: on that on the platform, which subsequently we took to the editors of the channel and saying,

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.920
[Guest]: look, we did something like this. And you know, we're sorry, but we did this. And can you see

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.640
[Guest]: that there is this conversation. And again, some of the incentives are also about reach,

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.040
[Guest]: even though it's a state run entity, there is an incentive about reach, because how do you

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.480
[Guest]: otherwise assess what influence you're having on society. So that is impressive. And that sort of

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.240
[Guest]: created this impetus that, okay, maybe let's have a conversation about something to do with gay

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.200
[Guest]: rights in China, you could try and push some boundaries. And as you remained in the organization

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.920
[Guest]: for longer, you try to figure out which is the best way to push these boundaries, you try to

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.400
[Guest]: figure out figure out which are the best battles that you can fight and win and which you should

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.920
[Guest]: just let go of. I mean, sooner or later, I just sort of realized that there was no point in talking

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.160
[Guest]: about Tiananmen Square during his anniversary, because it's a battle that I'm never going to

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.200
[Guest]: win. So I might as well not talk about it. But I remember in 2014, when the umbrella protests were

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:41.680
[Guest]: happening in Hong Kong, I remember having very loud arguments with my editor, basically saying,

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.720
[Guest]: we should be covering this, we should be covering this. And the organization was not covering it

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.320
[Guest]: for some time. It did eventually. But in those initial days, in hindsight, when I thought about

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.640
[Guest]: it, and as I studied China much more, I realized that the reason that we were not covering it at

01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:03.360
[Guest]: that point of time, was because there was no clarity from politically at the top of how do

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.720
[Guest]: you approach this? You know, what is the narrative that you want on this? As that parity came, you

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.920
[Guest]: saw Chinese media, including CCTV and CGTN, which is the English language network, cover it from

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:19.600
[Guest]: the point of view of, yeah, these protesters want this, but look, they are inspired by the West and

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:24.240
[Guest]: also look at the fact that they are disrupting society and cab drivers are losing business,

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.280
[Guest]: and so on and so forth. And again, anybody who's looking at protests in India can see similar sort

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.600
[Guest]: of themes that get picked up by media which want to cover and that tells you where that media's

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.960
[Guest]: incentives are coming from. But for the first couple of days to a week or so, it wasn't covered

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.200
[Guest]: that umbrella protest movement. And the reason it wasn't covered in hindsight, I realized is because

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.840
[Guest]: the political line was not clear. For me as a journalist, it was a case of this is a massive

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.400
[Guest]: story. Why are we not covering it? And you know, yeah, you may want your spin on it, but at least

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:57.360
[Guest]: start covering it. And that was not happening. So you start to realize as you spend time,

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.640
[Guest]: what boundaries you're pushing, what boundaries you need to push, where you can win, where you

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.520
[Guest]: can't win. And to me, that was fascinating. I think the last sort of example that I will give

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:15.040
[Guest]: of my time at CCTV was every year in March, the Chinese parliament meets. So there are these two

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:20.160
[Guest]: bodies, the NPC, which is the parliament and the CPPCC, which is a consultative body for the

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.800
[Guest]: legislature. And these are really sort of big sort of, you know, there's lots of fanfare around these

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.720
[Guest]: events. These are called the two sessions. And again, this is about the Chinese state wanting

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:36.640
[Guest]: to use digital media as a platform to send their message and to sort of boost their message. And

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:42.960
[Guest]: CCTV had decided at that point in time that, okay, what do we do on digital media that we can do

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:47.040
[Guest]: different from television? Because television is giving you the standard stories, right? But how do

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.320
[Guest]: we do something different on digital media? And the idea was, okay, we will get different

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.800
[Guest]: spokespersons from different ministries and government departments to come into the office,

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.360
[Guest]: and they can take live questions from Weibo and Facebook and whatever. Now, of course, these

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:07.840
[Guest]: questions were not live in the sense that they weren't vetted and censored. But the experience

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:14.080
[Guest]: of having bureaucrats and spokespersons from ministries come in, and to have that experience

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:20.640
[Guest]: of what is it like to engage with these people, to set all of that up, to me was an absolutely

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.280
[Guest]: incredible sort of setting of, you know, and nothing like that I'd experienced in India and

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.240
[Guest]: Indian media. And that's where I sort of differentiate between the freedom in the

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:34.160
[Guest]: Indian media and the Chinese press, where I remember listening to responses being given by

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.960
[Guest]: the spokesperson who had come in, I think the most vivid memory I have is of the spokesperson

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.440
[Guest]: from the National Health Commission. He was answering questions, and we were typing out

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.800
[Guest]: the answers, you know, because while he's answering live, you're also answering live

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:52.560
[Guest]: on Facebook and posting the responses. And there was a censor standing behind me,

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:58.480
[Guest]: who would look at certain words and say, not that. And you delete that particular sentence.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:03.920
[Guest]: So again, very, very different from what this is. So at that point of time, I mean, of course,

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.200
[Guest]: to me, it was just an interesting experience at that point of time as a journalist. But

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:12.640
[Guest]: when I sort of get back to looking at Chandler from an analyst's point of view, you know,

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:18.400
[Guest]: that I've done for the last three years, I realized this is, and I talk about this in the

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:24.320
[Guest]: book that we will talk about, that this was sort of early days of cultivating tools for discourse

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:30.880
[Guest]: power. And this was fairly well thought in the sense that the leadership had a vision of,

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:36.480
[Guest]: we want to do some of these things to cultivate these tools. And this was the process of doing

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:41.520
[Guest]: that and creating these tools. And now when I think back at all of this, I think that

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.800
[Guest]: it's fascinating that I was at the heart of that process when at least in one organization,

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.280
[Guest]: this was being cultivated. And in some ways, how futile some of the pushback was that I was trying

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:59.920
[Guest]: to do, but in some ways also how fascinating it was that, you know, the people who were working

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:07.040
[Guest]: on these things, my Chinese colleagues, they were not people who necessarily entirely bought

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.480
[Guest]: everything the party was telling them. These are smart, intelligent, articulate people

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:20.000
[Guest]: who understood how the system functions and who much more than me, of course, had a sense of

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.920
[Guest]: what battles to pick and what battles not to pick. And it's truly a credit to some of these,

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:31.200
[Guest]: some of them, you know, like how they've managed to push back against some of the pressures in the

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:37.200
[Guest]: system over the years. And I sort of empathize with a lot of and look at them and think that

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:44.560
[Guest]: I don't think in the Indian media, we've had half the pressure, yet, we seem to have succumbed much

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:49.040
[Guest]: more easily. And therefore, so I have a lot of regard for my colleagues who I worked with,

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.320
[Guest]: and generally journalists in China. Yeah, I mean, talking about succumbing,

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.800
[Amit Varma]: there was a famous comment made during the emergency where someone spoke about Indian

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.400
[Amit Varma]: journalists and said that when they were asked to bend, they chose to crawl, you know, words to

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.280
[Amit Varma]: crawl, you know, words to that effect. And it struck me that, you know, with a lot of your editors,

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:12.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, at CCTV deciding what is cautious to talk about and what is not, the incentives are

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:17.200
[Amit Varma]: clearly tailored towards erring on the side of caution, towards crawling rather than bending,

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.520
[Amit Varma]: because you know, why take the slightest chance? Why do you want to even go there? So before we

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.440
[Amit Varma]: get back to your personal arc, question that strikes me from something you said, where you

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.360
[Amit Varma]: spoke about how, when you were there, the Chinese were so friendly, they were always kind of willing

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.360
[Amit Varma]: to talk earlier, you spoke about how those students would meet you when you went for the

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:38.880
[Amit Varma]: first time to Beijing, and, you know, take you out, ask you questions, all of that. I visited

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:45.360
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan in 2006, I was covering the cricket tour. And one of the things that struck me there was

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:50.240
[Amit Varma]: the incredible friendliness of the local people, right? Like I remember on the evening, we landed

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.440
[Amit Varma]: in Lahore, you know, three of us journalists, we went to a nearby grocery store or whatever to buy

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.760
[Amit Varma]: pencil cells and all that for our equipment. And at one point, one of us mentioned that,

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.320
[Amit Varma]: hey, we are from India, and they refused to take any money. And this is almost like a cliche of

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.920
[Amit Varma]: hospitality or you are our guest and so on. But literally, throughout the tour, that's the kind

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:15.200
[Amit Varma]: of friendliness that we got. And it struck me that in India, a Pakistani would not get that kind of

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.960
[Amit Varma]: friendliness. Like, of course, if you're white, you've come from the US, you've come from England,

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:24.080
[Amit Varma]: of course, we'll pander to your white ass because colonialism and all that. But not to not to a

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.320
[Amit Varma]: Pakistani and even Chinese people here would often be treated with so much distrust and xenophobia.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.560
[Amit Varma]: And, and of course, African Americans, like I remember back in college, how people would look

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.280
[Amit Varma]: at students who are from Africa, I don't know why I said African Americans, that students were from

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:44.640
[Amit Varma]: Africa and the kind of racism that was there. I'm kind of thinking aloud here because it strikes me

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.600
[Amit Varma]: that maybe I'm reading too much into it because the sort of things I would notice about my own

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:54.640
[Amit Varma]: people is the stuff that I don't agree with or which kind of repulses me and I would take the

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.120
[Amit Varma]: rest of it for granted. And it is possible that no, on the whole, we are also friendly and hospitable.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.480
[Amit Varma]: So I thought, hey, why not ask you and what's your take on it?

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:08.000
[Guest]: No, I think on the whole, we are also reasonably friendly and hospitable. I don't think that's the

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.200
[Guest]: case. And I mean, if I look at China, what I would say is that it depends, right? You know,

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.520
[Guest]: it depends who you are, where you're coming from, where you where you are encountering the person

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:22.720
[Guest]: and how. All of that matters. I don't think you'll find people in China saying, no, it's on me,

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.800
[Guest]: don't need to pay the bill unless it's your friend and you've gone out for a meal, then they'll be

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:31.680
[Guest]: like extremely hospitable. But a bargain is a bargain. That's very, very clear. And it deals

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:37.600
[Guest]: a deal which I sort of respect that I think it's a very healthy sort of way to do things that,

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.760
[Guest]: you know, we talk about money first up, like particularly we say with tourist guides.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:48.160
[Guest]: And when I took my family to Beijing for a holiday, we were about five or six people.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.920
[Guest]: I asked somebody as a tourist guide to accompany us because we wanted to go to the,

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.480
[Guest]: you know, the tomb of Mao Zedong, the mausoleum of Mao Zedong and all of that. And we wanted to

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.480
[Guest]: sort of explore other parts of the city, which I didn't necessarily know of as well. And it was a

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:06.400
[Guest]: college student who was our guide. And we were very clear, he had a very clear conversation up

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.560
[Guest]: front about money and everything. And once that is out of the way, you can have fun. And you know,

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:14.160
[Guest]: the person can be very engaging and all that. So I appreciate that about the Chinese in some way,

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:19.360
[Guest]: that they are very, very clear about money. The other thing in terms of hospitality, again,

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:25.280
[Guest]: there can be a tremendous amount of racism, xenophobia in China. We see that even in policies

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.520
[Guest]: with regard to ethnic minorities in China. You know, that's been one of the biggest issues for

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.080
[Guest]: the last couple of years with regard to Xinjiang. So that exists. And I don't think that is,

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:38.000
[Guest]: there's a certain amount of chauvinism with regard to ethnic minorities in the country.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.520
[Guest]: In terms of foreigners, I think there's also a gradation, right? I mean,

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.720
[Guest]: the kind of treatment that a white person would get is very different from the kind of treatment

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.760
[Guest]: that I would have gotten, you know. And I think that reflects not just in terms of

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:55.200
[Guest]: hierarchies in organizations, but also pay scales, ability to say things and get away with them and

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.600
[Guest]: things like that, you know. And I think that exists. And that is, to me, that's a case of

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:04.560
[Guest]: internalized, you know, racism in terms of hierarchy of systems. And I think if you go back,

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.840
[Guest]: there's an interesting book by Bill Hayton, The Invention of China, in which he talks about this

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.280
[Guest]: concept of race, about 100 odd years ago. And he talks about how Chinese thinkers at that point of

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.960
[Guest]: time saw the world as divided among different races, white, yellow, brown, black at the end.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.080
[Guest]: So there is a hierarchy in that persists in your head. And it may not be as obvious and as, you

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.560
[Guest]: know, distinct in somebody's head, but you internalize these things over generations.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.760
[Guest]: And I think that exists. I don't think there's a case. I mean, just last year, we saw an example

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.040
[Guest]: of this, right? African immigrants living in China and Guangzhou, there was a huge controversy

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:46.720
[Guest]: around racism. And, you know, lots of Chinese diplomats had to go to African leaders in their

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:53.600
[Guest]: countries and sort of get a dressing down. And a lot of these African leaders also put out the

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:59.120
[Guest]: dressing down that they gave the Chinese ambassador on social media to signal to their own communities.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:05.760
[Guest]: So obviously, racism exists, obviously, that exists. It works in much more subtle ways sometimes.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:09.760
[Guest]: And I think you will see right, a lot of the times, like just like in India, right, you know,

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.680
[Guest]: if you if you have a foreigner who's visiting, and you want to make a snarky comment, you make

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.960
[Guest]: it in Hindi, a lot of that would happen there also. So I don't sort of see it as that distinctly

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:24.560
[Guest]: different. But I do see that, you know, in general, depending on where you are, whom you're

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.320
[Guest]: meeting, and particularly if you're meeting somebody for the first time, and maybe this is

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:36.720
[Guest]: because women are much more active in the public sphere in China. Right. So and women don't tend

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.920
[Guest]: to be as hostile when you meet them first, because the approach is you're selling something and you're

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:47.040
[Guest]: friendly. So my experience, therefore, was essentially meeting people who are generally

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:53.440
[Guest]: very hospitable, hospitable, who are very friendly, who laughed a lot. And again, if you're a good

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.760
[Guest]: salesperson, you laugh a lot. Particularly if I'm your customer, you will laugh a lot at my jokes.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.280
[Guest]: And that's what happened a lot with me. So again, maybe that's the power dynamic,

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.520
[Guest]: which I'm coming from. And therefore, I felt that it was much more as a trader. But as a

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:11.360
[Guest]: as an employee, I thought that there was a gradation in which I fit in, you know, as

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:21.200
[Guest]: a South Asian, as opposed to a white person. And and again, as the Arabs working in the organization

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.480
[Guest]: fit into a different grade, the whites were the highest in that sense. So I think that existed.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:32.880
[Guest]: So I wouldn't sort of read too much into us being that way. I think we also have our ingrained

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:37.280
[Guest]: biases from generations. But in generally, I think we are also fairly friendly, at least,

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:43.120
[Guest]: again, it all depends on where you come from, who you meet in what context, and all of that.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.880
[Guest]: That's what determines to me whether a person's implicit sort of biases and, you know,

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.240
[Amit Varma]: tendencies sort of come to the fore or not. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, all these are,

01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:00.000
[Amit Varma]: after all, such impressionistic takes. So let's get back to your personal arc. Why did you decide

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.920
[Amit Varma]: to leave then? And when you decided to leave, you didn't come back to Indian journalism,

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.840
[Amit Varma]: you didn't give trading another shot, you came into the world of policy, you came to

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:12.640
[Amit Varma]: Takshashila. And thank God you did, because that's how I met you. And that's why you're

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.480
[Amit Varma]: on the show now. But how did that that sort of journey take place?

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:23.360
[Guest]: So I got married in 2015. And see, it's just five years, six years, and I still am sort of

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.080
[Guest]: going back and saying, thinking about it once. But yeah, I know, I got married in 2015. And

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.480
[Guest]: my wife joined me in Beijing. And I think there were two things that were happening. One was that

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:41.360
[Guest]: we were thinking about having a kid. And the challenge was that, you know, I was not as

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:47.840
[Guest]: I was not as comfortable with my own lack of knowledge of the language ability to manage

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:53.280
[Guest]: having a child in that environment, because I wasn't familiar with healthcare as much,

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.360
[Guest]: despite having spent a lot of time there. And the idea was, if we, you know, if we are planning a

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.920
[Guest]: child, do we want to go back to India, because it might just be easier with family and everything,

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.840
[Guest]: and everything, and everything. The second strand that was running was the fact that I was

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.640
[Guest]: increasingly reaching a point of fatigue in the organization in CCTV, because I was increasingly

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.760
[Guest]: feeling like, I think I've done what I needed to do here, or how much ever I needed to do here,

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:23.840
[Guest]: I've hit a certain ceiling, where increasingly, the environment, which was somewhat free has

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.520
[Guest]: become even more controlled. The role that I was playing for the last two, two and a half years,

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.000
[Guest]: is increasingly shrinking, because the organization is taking away editorial

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.800
[Guest]: discretion from foreigners even more. It wasn't like you had a tremendous amount of editorial

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:44.720
[Guest]: discretion, but you had a say. And on a lot of things, I felt that what I was saying was taken

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:50.800
[Guest]: on board, that was shrinking very rapidly. And that had to do with how the organization was

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.280
[Guest]: changing and how the political environment in the country was changing. I was uncomfortable

01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:02.400
[Guest]: with some of the things that were done, not in CGTN, but CCTV, which was, say, airing of

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:07.840
[Guest]: confessions of people who are detained. And of course, CGTN was then asked to carry it. I used

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.760
[Guest]: to, I remember resisting saying, we don't want to carry this, and you know, not on our platform,

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.360
[Guest]: why do you want to carry it? It's, you know, but some of those conversations have started to

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.960
[Guest]: eventually grate. And I was reaching a point where I was like, look, I don't think I want to do this

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:25.520
[Guest]: anymore. So that coupled with the sort of personal desire, I sort of felt like it's time for me to

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:31.840
[Guest]: move out, because I valued the relationships that I had built in that organization with the people.

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:37.680
[Guest]: And I was increasingly, and I took a lot of credit to my editor in chief. She was a wonderfully

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:45.120
[Guest]: enthusiastic, energetic woman who worked 24 hours a day, and who never cribbed, who always smiled,

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:50.800
[Guest]: always laughed. And she, I fought a lot with her. And she still had a lot of regard for me,

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:54.960
[Guest]: which I thought was remarkable, because I wouldn't, I would start becoming sour.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.760
[Guest]: And at the end of it, I remember talking to her and telling her that, look,

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:03.120
[Guest]: I'm at a point where I feel I will increasingly fight much more with you, because I don't agree

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.040
[Guest]: with even more where we are going. I didn't necessarily agree too much at the beginning,

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:11.040
[Guest]: in the beginning of all of this, but I'm now at a point where I just completely disagree with

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:16.560
[Guest]: everything. So I'm finding it difficult to stay here. And she was kind enough to tell me,

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:20.800
[Guest]: take a month off. You know, I don't want you to leave, take a month off and think about it.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:25.680
[Guest]: And I said, no, you know, I don't think it'll change in a month's time. So I might as well just

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:31.040
[Guest]: move. And she was fairly good about it. And she said, fine, you know, whenever you want,

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.560
[Guest]: whatever you want, serve out your notice period, and you can leave whenever you want,

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:39.440
[Guest]: there's no issue at all. Again, the way the organization treated me, I don't have a bad

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:43.440
[Guest]: thing to say about them. In terms of their priorities. Yeah, I don't agree with a lot of

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.040
[Guest]: things. But yeah, but that's where I sort of ended. And again, I moved to India, just to sort

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:52.000
[Guest]: of, I didn't join Takshashila immediately, I moved to Vyond when I came to India. And I spent a year

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:59.760
[Guest]: and a half over there, at which point, I moved away. And I took basically, after we after my

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:05.920
[Guest]: kid was born, we basically decided that and because of changes also in Vyond's editorial,

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.320
[Guest]: I didn't feel like I wanted to continue over there. And I moved out of the organization

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:16.400
[Guest]: without a job, basically saying I want to take some time to spend with my newborn baby,

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:20.400
[Guest]: which was much more hard work than I could have imagined, much more hard work than I could have

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:26.960
[Guest]: imagined ever having done. And I think joining Takshashila was something that was during that

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:32.640
[Guest]: break, I think Takshashila was, it was 2017, the Doklam standoff had happened, there was lots of

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:41.040
[Guest]: interest in China. And unfortunately, there are very few Indian journalists in China. So I don't

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:46.160
[Guest]: count myself as an Indian journalist in China, even when I was there, because I would see myself

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:51.520
[Guest]: as an employee of CCTV, but journalists like Sudhirto from Hindustan Times, Anand Krishnan

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:58.400
[Guest]: from The Hindu or back then from India Today, lots of people from PTI, INS. To me, that's the

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:03.680
[Guest]: Indian journalist in China, not people like me. There are hardly any, I think there are four,

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:09.200
[Guest]: you know, three or four. And there's very little information in India about China.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:17.600
[Guest]: A lot of that is repurposed reportage from Reuters, AFP, whatever. And there's no real

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:21.840
[Guest]: original Indian view that's evolved. Although, like I said, some of the names that I've mentioned,

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:27.200
[Guest]: these guys have done tremendous work. But there's no real, you know, view that's been that's evolved.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:33.840
[Guest]: A lot of our media conversation is very hollow, very shallow. And I was like, look, in Veeon,

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.360
[Guest]: one of my hopes was to try and do that, try and sort of actually get but then again, the nature

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:41.840
[Guest]: of the organization, the way it was evolving, this was not a priority. But when I left it,

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.080
[Guest]: I said, I want to sort of spend some time trying to do that. So I was trying to teach develop a

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:51.200
[Guest]: short course, like a 101 to teach. And at that point of time, like I said, because Doklam was

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.760
[Guest]: happening, Takshashila had run a one month course with four or five sessions on China.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:01.840
[Guest]: I knew Nitin Pai from Takshashila from many years ago, I'd written for Pragati,

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.560
[Guest]: a magazine that you edited at one point of time, and I'd written for them in 2009, 2010.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.080
[Guest]: So I had familiarity, I had done the Takshashila course in 2014, while I was in Beijing. So,

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:18.960
[Guest]: you know, at least he and I both knew each other briefly. When that course was starting,

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.600
[Guest]: I remember in the first day at the first session of the course, Nitin messaged me as one of the

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:28.320
[Guest]: students in the course, and asked me what I was doing. And was I still in China? And I told him,

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.160
[Guest]: No, I've moved to Delhi. And he said, Oh, what are you doing in Delhi? I said, No, I've just

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.560
[Guest]: taken a career break right now. I was trying to be as nice about it, not saying that I'm unemployed.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:41.440
[Guest]: I was just saying, I've taken a career break, and I'm trying to focus on my child. And his first

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.720
[Guest]: response to me was, Can you change a diaper in 30 seconds in the dark? If you can't do that,

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:52.480
[Guest]: you're not good enough. And I said, No, I still can't do that. And then he said, Well, okay,

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:57.680
[Guest]: look, we're interested in doing something in China. Let's talk after the course. And that's

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.360
[Guest]: where the conversation began. And a few months down the road, you know, six, eight months,

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.680
[Guest]: six months down the road, three, four months down the road, I started a newsletter on China.

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:10.080
[Guest]: And a few months after that, I joined Takshashila full time to sort of try and set up a

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.360
[Guest]: China research unit in the organization, while myself also trying to sort of, you know,

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:22.720
[Guest]: spend time on academic research. I remember, in one of my first few weeks, having a conversation

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.400
[Guest]: with, you know, Pranay, Pranay Kotasani, who used to head research that time at Takshashila,

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:33.200
[Guest]: and him telling me that you should write a book. And I was telling him that look,

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:39.920
[Guest]: at present, my mindset is that of a journalist, and a journalist working in television and

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.440
[Guest]: digital media, I cannot stay with a story for more than eight hours. You know, for me,

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.920
[Guest]: once it airs, it's over, it's gone, I'm looking at the next thing. So you're asking me to stay

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.240
[Guest]: with something for three months, six months in my head, a concept, work on it, develop it,

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.920
[Guest]: and I'm going to struggle with it. And he was very nice about it. He said, Yeah, yeah,

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.760
[Guest]: I totally understand. Take your time. But you know, this is what I need you to do. So just

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:06.560
[Guest]: try and focus on that and settle yourself down to do that. And so the journey from there sort of

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.880
[Guest]: began, and it took me a good six months, I think, for that mindset to change. In many ways,

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:21.520
[Guest]: television and digital journalism gives you your your mind is geared towards gratification at 10

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:27.840
[Guest]: o'clock at nine o'clock in the night. Right. And that was no longer the case. So tendency to sort

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.800
[Guest]: of drop off, get bored, get sort of uninterested over a period of time, I sort of feared that a lot.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:37.680
[Guest]: But I mean, I think maybe it's just because I was older, it sort of allowed me to manage and,

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.040
[Guest]: you know, as you grow older, you become a little bit more patient. So maybe I'd gotten a little

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:46.080
[Guest]: more patient. But it took me six months to get comfortable with that and get into China related

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:52.720
[Guest]: research, to then sort of spend some time understanding better from an academic point

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:58.320
[Guest]: of view, frameworks of how do you study China? What is the work that a tremendous number of

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.120
[Guest]: a tremendous number of people have done to try and study China? And what are the frameworks that they've devised?

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.240
[Guest]: How would I look at the India China relationship, partly from an academic point of view, but also

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:14.640
[Guest]: from a policy point of view, which I think is something that's not done enough in India,

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.080
[Guest]: on most things, but specifically on this, it's not done enough, because an example of that is

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.480
[Guest]: that the current discourse on if India wants to deal with China, it needs to work with America

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:30.240
[Guest]: and whatever, whatever, and the quad and everything, but what should you do with that?

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.880
[Guest]: You know, everybody says, yes, we will work with the quad and we will balance,

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:40.240
[Guest]: but what is it that you will do? And what are those? And how will you do it? I think those

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:45.600
[Guest]: are the kind of policy questions which public discourse in India doesn't talk about. And as

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:50.720
[Guest]: I've worked at that, Sheila, my effort has been to now move towards more towards trying to answer

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:55.920
[Guest]: those questions as to what do you do it? How do you do it nuts and bolts rather than the grand

01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:00.880
[Guest]: big sort of question. But yeah, but that's been my journey, getting to the Sheila and

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:06.400
[Guest]: over the last three years in the organization, we've done actually quite well to establish not

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:11.360
[Guest]: just one of the sort of premier China studies unit in the country from a policy point of view,

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.960
[Guest]: but also now expanding it to a to the broader sort of domain of the Indo Pacific. So we've

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:22.560
[Guest]: now got a new Indo Pacific studies program where we're trying to expand, again, trying to answer

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:28.880
[Guest]: these questions of, okay, so if supply chain resilience is a key part of what we need to do,

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.160
[Guest]: how do we do it? And what does it mean? How do we do it? What are the incentives of different

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.360
[Guest]: players in this game? What are our interests? And how is what is the mechanism that we need

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.280
[Guest]: to set up? How should it operate and try and answer some of those questions over the next

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.320
[Amit Varma]: couple of years? You know, the first time I started reading a lot of you was obviously,

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:52.960
[Amit Varma]: when I was editing Pragati and we would carry your newsletter on China, which I don't tire

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:58.480
[Amit Varma]: of telling people is so incredibly good, because not only did you put in an enormous amount of

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.880
[Amit Varma]: effort, just getting all those links and all of that, but you weren't merely collating links,

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.320
[Amit Varma]: you were giving perspective, there was a narrative to every newsletter. In fact,

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:11.440
[Amit Varma]: there were four or five separate narratives, like, like, it was just so insanely deep,

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.240
[Amit Varma]: definitely. I mean, I don't want to embarrass you with flattery, but by far the best writing on

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.240
[Amit Varma]: China that I've read, coming out of India and so enlightening. So tell me a little bit about

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:26.480
[Amit Varma]: your working habits, your work ethic, like number one, I imagine when you come to Takshashila,

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.720
[Amit Varma]: certain amount of time as you're looking at all the frameworks, and building your own framework

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:35.280
[Amit Varma]: out of that and how do you look at something and that's where the clarity and the sharp viewpoints

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:41.520
[Amit Varma]: really emerge from. And then there is just what I would call the weekly grind because, you know,

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:47.680
[Amit Varma]: I did a blog actively for five years between 2004 and 2008. I do like five posts a day,

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:53.280
[Amit Varma]: 8000 posts in that time. And I and these kind of posts actually seem easy to the outsider where

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.760
[Amit Varma]: you're putting together a bunch of links and you're giving perspective and all of that. It's

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.080
[Amit Varma]: incredibly hard. And it boggled my mind that you would do this week after week after week.

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.360
[Amit Varma]: So what's the deal with that? Tell me a bit about your work ethic. Do you have any insights

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.160
[Amit Varma]: on productivity? Would you ever have like writer's block or whatever? And you're just like,

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:17.200
[Amit Varma]: shit, I can't do it this week. Take me a bit through your process doing that.

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:26.320
[Guest]: So I think I have, I mean, it's not writer's block, but there is fatigue. And there are certain

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.720
[Guest]: weeks and certain days where you basically end up saying, Look, I don't want to do this,

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:34.880
[Guest]: because I'm tired or, you know, and the anticipation that it's going to take me five

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:39.520
[Guest]: hours to do this, and I don't want to spend those five hours. So you sort of don't want to do it.

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:44.720
[Guest]: But I think that in general, initially, what drove my work in that was just that,

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:50.480
[Guest]: and I bought this idea, right? So when Nitin sold me this idea of doing this newsletter,

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:57.360
[Guest]: I bought the idea and I have to give him credit for basically telling me that whatever the quality,

01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.840
[Guest]: just keep doing it. And I bought the idea. And I said, Okay, I'll keep doing it, whatever the

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:09.440
[Guest]: quality. And after about two months, what I realized was that my understanding of what was

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:14.080
[Guest]: happening was evolving. You know, I knew much more, along with the newsletter, what we used

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.400
[Guest]: to do. And this is I started the newsletter when I was still in Delhi. The newsletter would be

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:24.560
[Guest]: published every Friday, but every Thursday, I had to I would collate most of it. And Thursday at

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:30.000
[Guest]: lunch, I'd have a call with folks in Takshashila, where I would tell them basically what's happened.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.800
[Guest]: So they'd be eating lunch, and I'd be talking and I tell them what's happening in China.

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.880
[Guest]: To me, what I realized was, I mean, one in on one of the first calls,

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.600
[Guest]: Lieutenant General Prakash Menon, who's the Director of Strategic Studies at the organization,

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:47.440
[Guest]: he asked me a question about, I think about how India can use, how can India counter BRI and

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.080
[Guest]: whatever, something like that. And I basically sat there and said, I have no idea. I haven't

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.240
[Guest]: read, I haven't thought about it. So I have no idea. To me, I mean, I'd never met the man,

01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.080
[Guest]: he introduced himself as somebody who had been in the National Security Establishment and everything.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:03.840
[Guest]: So I was overawed. And I was like, okay, he's asking me this question, I'm supposed to be the

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.720
[Guest]: fellow who understands China, and I have zero idea. And I realized that I had not spent time

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:13.600
[Guest]: on the idea. I had not spent time, I had not focused my reading, whatever. But after like,

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.280
[Guest]: two or three months, I realized that I could respond to those questions with a certain degree

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:23.360
[Guest]: of certainty, along with a certain amount of information that I had gathered. As time went on,

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.240
[Guest]: it was a need for me that if I don't do this, I miss out. So there was a certain degree of

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:33.840
[Guest]: FOMO also, that I don't know what's happening in this week and whatever. And if I'm answering

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:38.240
[Guest]: questions, I don't have enough data, I've not thought it through. So I want to do it even more.

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:45.680
[Guest]: And I think that's what drove me in terms of my work ethic. And I, as I got more comfortable with

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:51.840
[Guest]: format, structure, where do you get information from? How do you source things? It became much

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:58.720
[Guest]: easier, it didn't feel like a lot of work, you know, it feels like a lot of work manually.

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.080
[Guest]: But mentally, it doesn't feel like I'm doing so much, you get tired physically. And in fact,

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.360
[Guest]: today, I've expanded my work. So today, I do that I on China, every Sundays, I moved from Friday to

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:17.200
[Guest]: Sunday, because from Monday to Friday, I do a separate blog, in which I read the people's daily,

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.480
[Guest]: and I put out what's being covered with a little bit of analysis here and there. So it's allowed.

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.000
[Guest]: So that tells you a little bit about, you know, once you become comfortable with the space,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.760
[Guest]: you know what to expect and what you're doing, and also comfort with your sources.

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:37.760
[Guest]: In terms of my sort of work ethic of what I do, I work six days a week, I take Saturdays off,

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:43.920
[Guest]: which I usually spend, you know, at home with my kid, mostly trying to sort of, you know,

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:49.040
[Guest]: play football with him. But other than that, even I mean, since this lockdown has happened,

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.640
[Guest]: work has increased much more, because you're at home, your environment doesn't change,

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:59.120
[Guest]: weekends have blended into weekdays. So you don't really know where one comes in where the other

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:07.280
[Guest]: goes. So I sort of start usually at eight ish in the morning, I end by about 435. And through the

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:13.120
[Guest]: day, I try to make sure that I keep a track of what's happening in terms of news in China. But

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.680
[Guest]: again, once you do this for a certain amount of time, you get very comfortable with certain things.

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:23.360
[Guest]: And you get comfortable by with reading between the lines. So it becomes much more easier to pick

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:28.560
[Guest]: up on certain things. The biggest sort of benefit that I've sort of been able to generate for myself

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:34.880
[Guest]: is my Twitter feed. I mean, to most people, Twitter is a hellhole. To me, it is an absolute

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:42.240
[Guest]: blessing. Because I've been able to cultivate a feed by following x number of people whose work

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:48.400
[Guest]: on China I regard and respect. And I get most of my news via Twitter. But there are many days where

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.160
[Guest]: I will have no idea what's happening in India, what's happening in Bangalore, but I know really

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:57.120
[Guest]: well what's happening in China, because that's how my feed is sort of nurtured. And I think it's

01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:03.040
[Guest]: really useful. So it allows me to sort of bookmark store things, read things, and keep them down.

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:10.080
[Guest]: I try to read, I'm not a very fast reader, with regard to books, I try to read a book a month,

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:16.080
[Guest]: which is really slow. But I try to do because when I read, I do a lot of underlining, marking,

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:21.600
[Guest]: note taking, I do all of that. And then I sort of try to revisit things. So for me, reading,

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.240
[Guest]: therefore may not necessarily be a leisure activity. It's a stressful activity. So it

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.880
[Guest]: takes me a month to maybe go through a book most times. But I try to then therefore be picky about

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:37.440
[Guest]: what I'm reading. And again, this is sort of a blind spot where my reading is very China focused.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.480
[Guest]: So I tend to sort of miss out on a lot of other things. But yes, that's how essentially I operate.

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:50.240
[Guest]: My reading is more to understand history, look at frameworks, so history from a popular history to

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:55.360
[Guest]: an academic history point of view, and papers and journal articles to try and understand frameworks

01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.440
[Guest]: and approaches to research. And the third level is news, which is what I'm doing on a daily basis.

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.760
[Guest]: And that to me sort of equips my mind and it's sort of, it's strange. It's been many years now,

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.160
[Guest]: but it still stimulates me. It still gives me a rush, it still gives me the excitement. I'm

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:15.040
[Guest]: currently reading a book by Bloomberg's Peter Martin on Chinese diplomacy and the history of

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.960
[Guest]: Chinese diplomacy. And it's fascinating because there will be still like a 1030 in the night,

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:22.320
[Guest]: I'll be reading something and I'll burst into the room telling my wife that, did you know this? Did

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:27.440
[Guest]: you know this? So it still excites me that much. And I think till that continues, I'm happy to sort

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:32.560
[Guest]: of keep doing this. Because unless you find that degree of excitement in what you're doing,

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:37.520
[Guest]: it's difficult and it can become very dry, what we do from a policy point of view. So if so for

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.880
[Guest]: anybody who's listening, who's interested in the space, I think if you can find it, if you can find

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:47.120
[Guest]: that excitement in discovering these new things about a country, a space, an issue, then you'll

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:52.640
[Guest]: keep to it. But that's how I essentially operate. I mean, I try to shut down work at five so that I

01:46:52.640 --> 01:47:00.720
[Guest]: can have some space to myself. Most days, you don't get that as much, but most days, you manage

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.720
[Guest]: with a, particularly if you have a, like I said, I mentioned this before, if you have a small kid,

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:08.560
[Guest]: the moment you shut down your laptop, your kid's at the door. So you're sort of playing with him

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.080
[Guest]: and you're doing all of that. And that can be stressful and de-stressing depending on how the

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:17.120
[Guest]: day is. So, yeah, but that's how it functions. But in terms of reading, that's how I structure

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:22.480
[Guest]: myself. And that's how I try to upgrade myself because I feel that things move fairly, fairly

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:28.720
[Guest]: quickly. From an academic point of view, China studies has changed so dramatically in the last

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.840
[Guest]: decade. And this is also something that happens. It's happened in academia. Subject matter

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:39.120
[Guest]: specializations have become so narrow that, you know, you can't be a generalist and say,

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.120
[Guest]: I'm in the world anymore. So you need to cultivate as, you know, if you're a generalist,

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:49.520
[Guest]: you need to have greater breadth or some degree of insight, which is different. Otherwise,

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:54.400
[Guest]: you do hyper-specialization. I don't want to do hyper-specialization because I know it will bore

01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.160
[Guest]: the life out of me. So I want to remain in that generalist sort of space, use the journalistic

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:08.080
[Guest]: skill that I've had, use some academic learning to try and, at least, you know, be able to

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:14.000
[Guest]: at least then address policy issues rather than be a generalist academic. So that's the sort of

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.960
[Guest]: career path that I'm hoping for also going forward that be somebody who's working on policy, but

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.760
[Guest]: while remaining a generalist enough to know enough about technology, to know enough about diplomacy,

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:29.280
[Guest]: to know enough about the economy, but not spend your time trying to address that one narrow

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.440
[Guest]: question and spend three years to do that. So that's the sort of struggle that I have with

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.160
[Amit Varma]: regard to my work. Yeah, you know, this is so delightful, because it seems to me that you've

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:42.240
[Amit Varma]: been fortunate enough to get into this kind of virtuous cycle, where number one, you love what

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:46.640
[Amit Varma]: you're doing, so you do more of it. And number two, as you mentioned, because you're forced to

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.280
[Amit Varma]: write as an expert in the process of writing, in the process of doing that hard work of writing,

01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:55.840
[Amit Varma]: whatever it is you're writing, you actually become more of an expert over a period of time. You know,

01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:01.920
[Amit Varma]: the word generalist actually has almost taken on a pejorative tint in modern times. I mean,

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Prem Panicker did an episode with me where he was saying that what's happening in the media is that

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.840
[Amit Varma]: journalists are becoming generalists, because there's more and more cost cutting, there are

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.760
[Amit Varma]: fewer and fewer of them. And that's obviously in a pejorative sense, where they are just going

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:18.400
[Amit Varma]: a mile broad and an inch deep. But in your case, it seems to me that you are the kind of generalist

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:24.240
[Amit Varma]: who does have, at least from, you know, my vantage point, tremendous amount of deep knowledge of what

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:30.160
[Amit Varma]: you're doing. Like I think most people in their lives will possibly have deep knowledge of just

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:36.320
[Amit Varma]: one or two or three things at the most. And, you know, I'd certainly sort of China there for you.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.960
[Guest]: If I can just sort of clarify on that generalist and specialist thing. So from a journalistic

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:45.200
[Guest]: point of view, I agree with Prem Panicker that, you know, and that's a problem that, you know,

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:49.680
[Guest]: people don't know what they're doing. And they are generalist to that degree. From an academic

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:54.880
[Guest]: point of view, the generalist and specialization debate is very different. Because I think from

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:59.280
[Guest]: an academic point of view, and this is the example that I would give, somebody can be working on

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.480
[Guest]: India China relationship, and the challenge of urbanization, which may be common to both.

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:09.120
[Guest]: And you approach that from a broad general perspective, you could then approach that

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.600
[Guest]: from the point of view of city development cooperation between India and China and do

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:19.200
[Guest]: a paper on that. And then you could approach that from the point of view of Chinese Indian

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:25.040
[Guest]: methodologies to manage sewage pipeline construction. And, you know, now that the

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.000
[Guest]: challenge of academia is it is going to that third, fourth, fifth degree, where you are

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:36.080
[Guest]: answering such a narrow question, which is very useful in some ways, but you're spending two,

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.120
[Guest]: three, four years to answer that narrow question. And that's what I don't want to do. I don't want

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:48.720
[Guest]: to answer that narrow question. I am very happy to be a parasite on somebody else's narrow questions,

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.920
[Guest]: and try and answer the bigger question and look at the more broader question, because I don't want

01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:59.120
[Guest]: to spend those many years answering that narrow question. So while I may understand that narrow

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:02.240
[Guest]: question, and I may want to grab that knowledge and all of that, I don't necessarily want to

01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:08.240
[Guest]: answer that matter question. My interest is therefore much more into how at a policy level

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:14.880
[Guest]: should this Indian state and engage with the rise of China? What does the rise of China mean for the

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:18.400
[Guest]: world? So these are much broader academic questions, which you will not find being

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:22.480
[Guest]: answered in university papers, or in journal papers, you know, some of them will, of course,

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:27.200
[Guest]: but not necessarily, because their questions need to be far more defined, and far more narrow,

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:30.160
[Guest]: which is very different from the journalistic, generalist and special education.

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:35.520
[Amit Varma]: I'm so I'm so happy you chose that illustration. Because, you know, getting from urban planning to

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:42.560
[Amit Varma]: sewage, you literally drilled down. So that was nice. So tell me about your book. Now,

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:47.680
[Amit Varma]: how did the idea of the book come about? You know, I wrote a column on when the pandemic started in

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:54.560
[Amit Varma]: April, was that our experience of the pandemic in India, actually revealed and laid bare a lot

01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:58.640
[Amit Varma]: of things that are wrong with India, you know, whether it's a dysfunctional state, or whether

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:03.200
[Amit Varma]: it's what's happening with society, and even things which are right with India, actually,

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:10.000
[Amit Varma]: but it brought all of these starkly into relief. And now your book is about a subject that, you

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:16.720
[Amit Varma]: know, so deeply as a generalist, but you know, so deeply, and it's very interesting to take

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:22.560
[Amit Varma]: what has happened after the pandemic as a peg for talking about all these other transformations that

01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:28.800
[Amit Varma]: are happening. And so, so is that also how you see it? Is that like, is that how you conceptualize

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:34.400
[Amit Varma]: the book? So did it come from this sense of, I want to write about China, and this is a good

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:39.680
[Amit Varma]: way to get into it, because it reveals so much? Or was it that this is an interesting period of

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:48.880
[Amit Varma]: time? So let me sort of recounted chronology in the words of another great Amit. So tell me a

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:52.720
[Amit Varma]: bit about how the book took shape and and how you wrote it so damn fast.

01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:00.960
[Guest]: So, I think I'd lean towards the second point that you raised, or the latter point that you

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:05.040
[Guest]: raised, that it was about documenting what was happening to begin with. Actually, I've been

01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:10.400
[Guest]: teaching a course on China, which sort of deals with certain fundamental issues, you know, foreign

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:15.840
[Guest]: policy, economics, introductory level, usually for people who are from, who are journalists,

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:21.120
[Guest]: who may be from the armed forces, or people who are just, you know, interested, sort of like a

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:25.440
[Guest]: first step to get in. And I thought that, okay, look, I've got a lot of this stuff written down,

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:30.400
[Guest]: I've got lots more stuff that's a deeper level written down. And I want to talk about that,

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:36.480
[Guest]: but I hadn't conceptualized of a book. In April last year, when the pandemic started in China,

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:41.520
[Guest]: in January, when the outbreak started in Wuhan, I don't think in my mind, I had this idea of a book

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:45.440
[Guest]: or anything like that. I mean, we were still, I was just so taken aback with what's happening.

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:50.560
[Guest]: And my newsletter allowed me to keep documenting every week what was happening in quite detail.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:56.000
[Guest]: By April, once Wuhan was reopening, I remember, and I mentioned this in the introduction of the

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.760
[Guest]: book, there was an article in The Economist, which talked about is China winning because

01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:04.400
[Guest]: the world was shutting down, but Wuhan was reopening. That sort of, it struck me what

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:08.640
[Guest]: was happening, you know, in March, you could see this changing, where the Chinese were starting to

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:15.280
[Guest]: give pandemic related advice and aid to the world. And the world was sort of closing down. But China

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:19.760
[Guest]: was opening up again. And that sort of question of is China winning sort of stayed with me for

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:25.760
[Guest]: some time. Particularly, when Wuhan was opening up, there was lots of sort of in the months before

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:30.240
[Guest]: that there'd been a lot of stuff regarding what had happened in the city with regarding

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:35.840
[Guest]: Dr. Li Wenliang with regarding Fan Fang, the diarist, and all of that had stayed with me.

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:40.160
[Guest]: But in April is when I sort of really started thinking when they say is China winning,

01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:45.760
[Guest]: what does it really mean? Who is winning? Who is China? What does victory mean? You know,

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.800
[Guest]: and that sort of stayed with me for some time. And April, I thought I want to write something.

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:55.840
[Guest]: In May, I wrote the first chapter of the book, which is in the book, as you see it, it's the second

01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:00.560
[Guest]: chapter. It's about it's a chapter on heroes and martyrs. And it begins with Xi Jinping standing

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:05.120
[Guest]: with the Communist Party with the leadership of the party, mourning the deaths of all these people

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:09.200
[Guest]: because of the pandemic. To me, I remember this, this happened in April with the mourning happened

01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:13.440
[Guest]: in April, I remember watching it. And I remember documenting it for my newsletter. And I kept

01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:19.520
[Guest]: thinking this is such wonderful political theatre that's playing out. And I am amazed by people in

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:24.560
[Guest]: India who keep saying that the Chinese system is such, you know, the common refrain in India is

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.520
[Guest]: that China has no politics, that's why it's so prosperous. India has a lot of politics. And I

01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.080
[Guest]: was like, your definition of politics is wrong. China has a lot of politics. And this is political

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:38.640
[Guest]: theatre playing out in front of you. So by the time May hit, I was in my head, I was clear that

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.600
[Guest]: I want to at least write about this, you know, this particular what this has meant. And I started

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:49.680
[Guest]: writing the first chapter. And I finished the chapter and I reached a point where I thought,

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:53.920
[Guest]: well, this is interesting, I have lots more to say here. And then I sort of vigorously spent

01:55:53.920 --> 01:56:00.320
[Guest]: about a week or so structuring what is it that I want to say, I listed out eight or nine chapters,

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:04.400
[Guest]: I sort of documented them and said, detailed them saying, in each of these, this is what I want to

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:09.360
[Guest]: talk about. And I said, Okay, I'm going to try and approach publishers, I've got a sample chapter

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:13.680
[Guest]: ready, I have structure in my mind. I'm going to reach out and see if there's any interest.

01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:19.440
[Guest]: Thankfully, you know, the interest came very quickly. And that sort of because I have a

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:24.960
[Guest]: feeling that if I didn't have have the publisher's interest quickly enough, I would have probably

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:30.240
[Guest]: lagged and said, Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it later. Because with my regular work, it was

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.720
[Guest]: stressful to be able to do this, particularly given that we were all in lockdown for the first

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:39.520
[Guest]: time. And it was all very new and all very difficult. The other thing that I started to realize, and

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:43.920
[Guest]: I don't know if it comes across in the book, but I hope it does. But I don't think it does. I don't

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:50.240
[Guest]: think I don't know if it does, is it was very different to sit in India and look at Wuhan in

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:58.480
[Guest]: January and February, you had certain degree of sympathy. But by April and May, you had empathy,

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:03.520
[Guest]: you started knowing what it's like. And I think today after the second wave in India, I have far

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:10.640
[Guest]: more empathy for what's happened, what happened in Wuhan, how tremendously difficult the second

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:15.760
[Guest]: wave has been in India. If I think about what it might have been like for those people in Wuhan who

01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:21.360
[Guest]: didn't even know what this virus was, to suddenly have to encounter that,

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:24.640
[Guest]: there's a certain amount of challenge that I mean, I mean, I can be very critical of the

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:29.200
[Guest]: Chinese state. But for the people of Wuhan, you know, one does feel that this must have been

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.840
[Guest]: really, really difficult and really, really challenging. And I think that is something

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.880
[Guest]: that stayed with me for a certain period of time. But yeah, I mean, that's how I started writing the

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:42.400
[Guest]: book, I sort of did that first chapter felt that this has something here that I want to say,

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:45.760
[Guest]: drew out an outline of all the other chapters that I wanted to write.

01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:51.280
[Guest]: Eventually, what I wrote, there were changes from my initial outline. In fact, I think the last

01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:55.040
[Guest]: three chapters are quite different from what I had initially thought of.

01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:00.320
[Guest]: But yeah, and once I had publishers interest, and once we sort of agreed on the book,

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:03.520
[Guest]: my publishers are very clear and very straightforward saying that, you know,

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:08.560
[Guest]: it's topical, we want to get it out as quickly as possible. So we're going to give you a tight

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:11.360
[Unknown]: deadline and we would like you to I mean, you can pick it but we're going to tell you that we

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:17.440
[Guest]: wanted to be fairly quick. So we came up with a deadline of end of October, I didn't stick to it.

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:21.440
[Guest]: I finished it sometime in the end of November. That was on purpose because

01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:25.200
[Guest]: but as I started writing, and like I said, the last few chapters changed.

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:29.120
[Guest]: And with the way the American elections were going, I wanted to capture what was happening there.

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:36.720
[Guest]: So I sort of pushed it further. But it was a fun process because I was documenting something on a

01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:42.000
[Guest]: weekly basis in my newsletter, I was trying to then contextualize it in the book, I was trying to,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:48.880
[Guest]: I sort of saw an opportunity to incorporate all these different frameworks with regard to China

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:54.400
[Guest]: that I had studied from these different scholars from around the world, and incorporate that to

01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:59.280
[Guest]: tell a story of China far more engagingly rather than from an academic point of view, you know,

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:04.080
[Guest]: which might sort of not engage people in general. So I saw this as an opportunity to talk about all

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:09.600
[Guest]: of that eventually. But when I began with it, it was just the idea of this is fascinating.

01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:14.000
[Guest]: This is something really big that's happening in the world. Something deep is changing all

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.680
[Guest]: around us. And I want to document it. That's how I began. But the project, like I said,

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:25.280
[Guest]: as it evolved, I hope that it's as the reader reads the book, it's evolved into something where

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:30.960
[Guest]: it is a quasi journalistic exercise where I'm documenting facts and saying what's happened,

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:37.200
[Guest]: what's not happened, clarifying misperceptions. But I'm also quasi journalistic, quasi academic,

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:42.320
[Guest]: where I'm introducing frameworks for you to contextualize how certain events are, how do you

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:46.720
[Guest]: how do you understand, say, the media environment in China or the political environment in China?

01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:51.840
[Guest]: Why is the party resilient? Why is it brittle? And look at that from a partly academic point

01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:56.320
[Guest]: of view. Why is it that initially you didn't necessarily see, you know, why did the people

01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:00.880
[Guest]: say that there is an information flow problem in the Chinese party system, which led to delayed

02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:05.840
[Guest]: reporting with regard to the outbreak in Wuhan? And how do you look at that from an academic and

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:11.760
[Guest]: analytical point of view? And lastly, it's sort of policy analysis, which is sort of towards the

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:18.880
[Guest]: final few chapters, where I'm trying to talk about how what's happened in this last year

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:25.120
[Guest]: is going to shape potentially the next five, 10 years, you know, sort of geopolitics over the

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:30.320
[Guest]: next five, 10 years. And hopefully, as a reader, what you take away is that there is a framework

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:35.840
[Guest]: for you to understand some of these events that may have that may now happen. And I think if

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:40.800
[Guest]: anyone's observed over the last three, four months, particularly the meeting of the quad,

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:46.240
[Guest]: the Chinese and American leaders, sort of the bureaucrats meeting in Alaska and the fight that

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:50.720
[Guest]: happened in Alaska between them, or the G7 summit and the NATO summit and all of that right now,

02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:56.720
[Guest]: or the sanctions with regard to Xinjiang and Hong Kong. I hope you can take a framework away of how

02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:02.240
[Guest]: do you look at these things. And all of the talk about let's decouple from China, ban Chinese

02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:07.760
[Guest]: products, and so on and so forth. You can take away at least how do you analyze these things

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:13.440
[Guest]: beyond what your immediate news break or emotional response may take. And that was my approach

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:18.480
[Guest]: towards the end that I wanted to do that towards the end because again, and I can mention this in

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:23.920
[Guest]: the preface of the book that I'm writing about history that's unfolding in front of me. And

02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:29.520
[Guest]: the good bit about that is that I can capture what's happening in lots of vivid detail.

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:33.600
[Guest]: The challenge with regard to that is that it's still evolving. So I don't know in which direction

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:38.640
[Guest]: it might go. So therefore, my hope is for you to be able to document this year and to be able to

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.040
[Guest]: analyze, give you frameworks to analyze the next 5-10 years and events that may take place.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I guess in a sense, if your newsletter is like a documenting of the first draft of history,

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.320
[Amit Varma]: your book is like the second draft or the one and a half draft as it were. And I enjoyed reading your

02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:56.880
[Amit Varma]: book thoroughly without thinking about what category it is in. Is it journalism? Is it

02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:03.280
[Amit Varma]: analysis? Didn't strike me. And one of the things I'd like to kind of tell my listeners about the

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:07.520
[Amit Varma]: book is that it doesn't just give frameworks on China, it also give frameworks on narrative

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:13.200
[Amit Varma]: building. It also give frameworks on politics. A lot of the stuff made me kind of think deeper

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.240
[Amit Varma]: about what is happening here in India itself. So you know, for that reason as well, I think it's

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.000
[Amit Varma]: in many ways, it's an eye opening book. You know, I have to say I admire your work ethic,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.120
[Amit Varma]: because if you're supposed to give something by the end of October, you give it by the end of

02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:29.920
[Amit Varma]: November. That's mind blowing, you know, the publisher's interest acting as an imperative

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:34.080
[Amit Varma]: that finish the book, finish the book simply hasn't worked for me. So if my publisher has

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:39.040
[Amit Varma]: gotten so this far into the podcast, and she's like, where are the where are the three or four

02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.920
[Amit Varma]: books or whatever, because I have actually, you know, got yeses for multiple books, not all of

02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:49.520
[Amit Varma]: which I've spoken about, but it simply simply kind of hasn't happened so far, which is a good

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:53.600
[Amit Varma]: note for us to take a break. And on the other side of the break, we'll actually get down to

02:02:53.600 --> 02:03:00.960
[Amit Varma]: talking about your book and about China. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In

02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:06.320
[Amit Varma]: fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:12.320
[Amit Varma]: active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form

02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:18.400
[Amit Varma]: gave me. And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day

02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:22.560
[Amit Varma]: and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:28.000
[Amit Varma]: things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.120
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter

02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:39.440
[Amit Varma]: at indiancut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:44.560
[Amit Varma]: I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do

[Amit Varma]: head on over to indiancut.substack.com and subscribe. It is free. Once you sign up,

02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.840

[Amit Varma]: So subscribe now for free. The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you.

02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:29.840
[Amit Varma]: Gave me a framework by which I could start thinking about the issue. Now obviously,

02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:35.280
[Amit Varma]: I'll link that episode from the show notes and I'd ask all the listeners to go and listen to

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:43.120
[Amit Varma]: that as well. But can you give a brief CliffsNotes summary version of how Chinese foreign policy and

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:50.080
[Amit Varma]: how the way it looks at itself has changed through the last four or five decades since

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:58.000
[Guest]: Mao and you know, landing up all the way to Xi? Right. Um, I think there's been tremendous change

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:03.520
[Guest]: that's happened over the last five decades, seven decades, actually. And even today, this is

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:08.240
[Guest]: currently undergoing a tremendous amount of change. And in fact, I'd say what's happening today

02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:14.000
[Guest]: is going to impact the world for the next 1520 years. And we'll get to that as we talk more

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:20.400
[Guest]: further. But sort of just to go back to history, the Communist Party of China, which is celebrating

02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:27.920
[Guest]: its 100th anniversary shortly, and when it was formed, it was formed at a point of time where

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:33.360
[Guest]: hundreds of years of imperial rule of the Qing dynasty had collapsed. There had been an experiment

02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:41.120
[Guest]: with republicanism, which failed. There had been a return to the imperial rule, which again failed.

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:48.480
[Guest]: And China was poor. There was warlordism. Towards the last few decades of the Qing dynasty,

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:54.320
[Guest]: China had suffered through foreign invasion, starting with 1839, the First Opium War,

02:05:54.320 --> 02:06:00.160
[Guest]: and then you had the Second Opium War. Then you had, you know, fighting, you had defeat with the

02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:06.400
[Guest]: Japanese, and you had different sort of concessions given to the Germans, to others. And the idea that

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:12.880
[Guest]: China was being sliced up by Western powers. And the reason that it was being sliced up was because

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:19.120
[Guest]: it had fallen back. You know, it had fallen back in terms of technological development,

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:25.200
[Guest]: social cultivation, economic growth, all of that. And a lot of the blame in the 1800s,

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:29.520
[Guest]: when this was happening, was laid on, you know, there were different strands of thought.

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:35.200
[Guest]: One strand of thought was that we've been closed minded. One strand of thought was that there is

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:40.640
[Guest]: deep corruption. One strand of thought is that we've relied too much on, in terms of our governance,

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:46.080
[Guest]: we've relied, we've emphasized too much on literature, literary ideas, these Confucian

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:51.920
[Guest]: ideals of nobility, as opposed to actually cultivating power. And the phrase that sort

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:56.160
[Guest]: of Fuxiang, the phrase that sort of captures this is wealth and power. And that's what we

02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:00.800
[Guest]: need to cultivate. And this is a debate that's going on within Chinese society, at least among

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:06.560
[Guest]: the elites in the late 1800s, as you are experiencing this onslaught of, you know,

02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:12.320
[Guest]: gunboat diplomacy and Western imperialism, as the Chinese would call it. And what starts to

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:16.640
[Guest]: happen is that there is a movement called the self strengthening movement that's developing.

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:21.200
[Guest]: And there are these green shoots of, you know, let's focus on technology, let's focus on the

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:28.240
[Guest]: Industrial Revolution, let's focus on growth, rather than focusing on imperial glory. And

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:33.120
[Guest]: there is pushback in all of that going on. But yet, China is fundamentally weak, right? It's

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:39.440
[Guest]: really fallen behind. In 1911, the Qing dynasty collapses. Like I said, then you had these decades

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:44.640
[Guest]: of experimenting with different rule. You have a lot of warlordism in China, where different parts

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:49.600
[Guest]: of the country are essentially under the command of different warlords. And there's a lot of

02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:53.200
[Guest]: fighting going on. And within this environment, obviously, you have the First World War that

02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:58.240
[Guest]: takes place. At the end of the First World War, you have that conversation in Versailles, you've

02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:03.680
[Guest]: got that meeting in Versailles. The Chinese are very hopeful that at that meeting in Versailles,

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:10.400
[Guest]: they will get back their concessions given to the Germans, particularly in Shandong. But

02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:14.480
[Guest]: there is this underhanded deal that's been agreed upon by the great powers,

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:19.680
[Guest]: and the Chinese don't get back their concessions that were in Shandong, and they were given to the

02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:26.480
[Guest]: Japanese. That sort of sparks an angry movement, which is called the May 4th movement of 1919,

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:31.440
[Guest]: which is a student protest revolution, whatever across different parts of the country,

02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:37.280
[Guest]: against sort of imperialism. Now, in this May 4th movement, a lot of the people who are

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:43.200
[Guest]: participating are also people who end up leading the Communist Party of China. So and that's an

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:47.040
[Guest]: important thing to keep in mind, because also the same time you're seeing the Bolshevik revolution

02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:53.520
[Guest]: happening in Russia. In this entire period of time, what you're seeing also is a deep discussion

02:08:53.520 --> 02:09:00.800
[Guest]: among Chinese intellectuals, and quite an anguished discussion about what form of government should

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:05.760
[Guest]: survive, you know, what form of government should we have? And what is the kind of government that

02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:11.200
[Guest]: we need to truly acquire this power and whatever. And there is tremendous writing that's happened

02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:16.000
[Guest]: here from people like Liang Chaochao, Liu Shun, lots of people whom I would sort of recommend

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:21.200
[Guest]: people go and read. Some of these writers are also quite critical of India, as India is,

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:26.560
[Guest]: and India is used as a negative example, actually, of a society that is deeply divided and, you know,

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:34.720
[Guest]: all of that. And we don't want that. So what you see at the end of all of that is Marxism-Leninism

02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:42.720
[Guest]: is seen as one mode of organizing society, which when they see Russia, Soviet Union,

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:49.120
[Guest]: they sort of see it as a revolutionary thing in terms of how, you know, the people who were

02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:54.400
[Guest]: oppressed, not privileged, the serfs, have sort of now become the rulers, you know, and the idea

02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:59.920
[Guest]: that you can organize and strengthen through that. And that's how essentially the Communist Party

02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:04.640
[Guest]: sort of gets formed. So, and obviously, the moment it's formed, it's a very small party.

02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.040
[Guest]: There's a larger nationalist KMT, which is much more powerful, which has some legitimacy

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:15.840
[Guest]: politically, also, because the leader, Sun Yat-sen, was the first president, essentially,

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:21.280
[Guest]: after the 1911 collapse of the Qing Dynasty, although he was very, he sort of left very

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:25.920
[Guest]: early, he left the scene very early, with the military general Yuan Shikai taking charge at

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:30.880
[Guest]: that point of time. Now, what happens in the 1920s is that the Communist Party and the KMT,

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:35.360
[Guest]: the Kuomintang, they come to some sort of an agreement that we'll work together to sort of

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:40.160
[Guest]: try and get society together and all of that. That agreement collapses as the KMT becomes much

02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:46.560
[Guest]: stronger, and it feels it has much more control. Sun Yat-sen dies, Chiang Kai-shek takes over the

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:54.560
[Guest]: KMT, as he's also a military leader. And in 1927, you have a split between the Communists and the

02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:59.200
[Guest]: KMT, that united front that they created splits. It was anyway quite tentative, because they were

02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:04.640
[Guest]: coming from very, they're sort of, philosophically, these are very two different ideas, governing

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:10.720
[Guest]: governing ideas that sort of colliding. And then you have a long period of a civil war in China.

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:16.560
[Guest]: And that civil war sort of nearly decimates the Communist Party of China. It retreats in what is

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.320
[Guest]: called the Long March. Today, that's used as a thing as a Long March forward, but that was actually

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:26.800
[Guest]: a Long March backward, you were retreating into the caves to go and try and figure out what you

02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.280
[Guest]: can do. And in that throughout that process, a Long March, 10s of 1000s of Communist Party members

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.920
[Guest]: died, just because they were constantly being attacked. And they retreated to this place in

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:42.480
[Guest]: Yan'an, where they sort of regroup and whatever. The big break that they get is the is the invasion

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:48.320
[Guest]: by the Japanese, which gets worse as the 30s go on. And then of course, through the Second World

02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:53.040
[Guest]: War, that entire period, the Communists work with the KMT. Although the history that they tell you

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:58.240
[Guest]: today is that the Communist Party led the charge against the Japanese, whereas actually, that's not

02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:04.880
[Guest]: true. That's not entirely true. The Communist Party played a secondary role to the KMT.

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:10.000
[Guest]: At the end of the Second World War, the civil war between the KMT and the Communist Party sort of

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.760
[Guest]: reignites, which by then the Communist Party is in a much, much stronger position. They've got

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:24.080
[Guest]: weapons, they've got battle hardened. Their base has shifted from urban China to rural China. And

02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:30.160
[Guest]: this is now a peasant led sort of group. This happened in the 1930s. And this sort of philosophical

02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:35.920
[Guest]: shift from urban base to rural base and peasant base was what also led Mao Zedong to assume charge

02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:43.520
[Guest]: of the party. And by 1949, they sort of essentially capture power and Chiang Kai-shek flees to Taiwan,

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:48.720
[Guest]: which is where we have now the Republic of China and Taiwan and that sort of continuing tussle

02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.640
[Guest]: between the two of them. The reason that I said this, that I sort of outlined all of this before

02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:58.160
[Guest]: talking about foreign policy, which was your question, is it allows one to understand the sort

02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:04.720
[Guest]: of mentality with which these people came into power. These were not nobility who had a sense

02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:10.000
[Guest]: of diplomacy, who had a sense of, you know, how things are. These are battle hardened revolutionaries

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:16.160
[Guest]: who had deep commitment, loyalty, belief in hierarchy, with, you know, leadership playing

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:23.360
[Guest]: flowing from top to bottom, a deep sense of siege around them, because you have constantly lived in

02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:29.360
[Guest]: that fear. And now they find themselves in a world where they are ideologically aligned, obviously,

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.560
[Guest]: to the Soviet Union. They were supported by the Comintern and the Soviet Union over the number of

02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:40.240
[Guest]: decades that they existed. They had differences with the Soviet Union. And now they find themselves

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:45.760
[Guest]: in a place where there is this deep nationalistic sentiment about China having been weak,

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:51.520
[Guest]: about the need to grow national power. At the same time, there is an ideological sort of

02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:56.560
[Guest]: vision of revolution. And you know, how society has to be organized based on Marxist, Leninist,

02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:02.560
[Guest]: and subsequently Maoist thought. So the first few decades of Chinese foreign policy is driven by

02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:06.960
[Guest]: these two impulses. The first is, like I said, nationalistic, and the second is revolutionary.

02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:12.160
[Guest]: And therefore, you will see a tremendous amount of effort being spent by the Chinese,

02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:16.320
[Guest]: not just to consolidate, but by the Communist Party of China, not just to consolidate its hold

02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:21.840
[Guest]: on territories like Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and these places, sort of to gather

02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:26.080
[Guest]: these territories that they have lost, or they believe that were theirs and they have lost,

02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:30.560
[Guest]: which is also what spawned this big conflict with one big part of the conflict with India.

02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:38.320
[Guest]: At the same time, you're seeing a desire to export revolution. So you're training revolutionaries

02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:42.800
[Guest]: from Africa, from Latin America, from South Asia, whether it's Sri Lanka, whether it's,

02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:47.520
[Guest]: you know, Myanmar, wherever else, and you're want to becoming the center of revolution around the

02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:52.960
[Guest]: world, which is a time when the Soviet Union is trying to sort of rebalance its relationship with

02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:59.280
[Guest]: the US, whereas Mao Zedong is much more active, he wants to do much more. And the Chinese also,

02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:05.120
[Guest]: the PRC also splits with the Soviet Union in the 60s. And that again, is a huge sort of change.

02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:10.320
[Guest]: I think, though, with those impulses sort of driving Chinese foreign policy, you see a much

02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:15.840
[Guest]: more active and aggressive Chinese foreign policy throughout the 50s and 60s, while it's also

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.320
[Guest]: finding its feet. And this is evident in terms of its engagement with India, it's sort of finding

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:24.960
[Guest]: its feet, it's trying to renegotiate things, it's trying to negotiate boundary agreements with

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:30.480
[Guest]: so many of its neighbors, because it has 14 neighbors, 14 land boundary neighbors. And it's

02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:37.440
[Guest]: also understanding what are the pushes and pulls of power and international politics. In the 60s,

02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:41.440
[Guest]: with the launch of the cultural revolution, Chinese foreign policy becomes much more insular,

02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:46.240
[Guest]: because society is going through such a tremendous churn, that it's not really looking outside.

02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:53.360
[Guest]: It's done some of the tasks of cultivating, you know, in 64, the Chinese carried out their first

02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:59.520
[Guest]: nuclear test. So it had developed the bomb, it focused on missile technology, focused on satellite

02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:05.120
[Guest]: development, and those sorts of things. It's done some of those key things of cultivation of power

02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:10.960
[Guest]: in terms of hard power, in terms of economic power, Mao's in a hurry. So he's trying to create as much

02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:15.360
[Guest]: economic power as possible. And he's committing tremendous mistakes. The Great Leap Forward is

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:20.720
[Guest]: one such mistake, where driven by ideology without understanding economics, he ends up launching

02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.560
[Guest]: what's the Great Leap and the idea of, you know, everybody should have factories in their

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:29.840
[Guest]: backyards, you know, and those sorts of things collapse. So there's a tremendous flux that's

02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:33.920
[Guest]: going on in China. But you can see that the impulse is coming from a sense to cultivate national

02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:37.600
[Guest]: power. By the 60s, like I said, with the launch of the cultural revolution, China becomes much more

02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:41.840
[Guest]: insular, yet it's sort of renegotiating its relationship with the Soviet Union and with the

02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:50.160
[Guest]: US. So despite that flux, it manages to engineer that pivot, where it moves away from the Soviet

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:57.600
[Guest]: Union towards the US in the early 1970s, in 1971, with the Kissinger visit, and then the Nixon visit,

02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:02.480
[Guest]: and then you start to get some degree of normalcy and Sino-American ties. So these are impulses

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:08.320
[Guest]: that continue. Another impulse was Third Worldism, which is Mao's theory of three worlds, in which

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:12.240
[Guest]: he talks about China sort of being one of the leaders of the third world, again, something that

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:15.920
[Guest]: even India talked about at that point of time. So there are these different sort of impulses through

02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:22.240
[Guest]: which foreign policy is being driven. By 1978, so 1976, Mao dies, by 1978, for two years,

02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:25.840
[Guest]: there's another internal power struggle after which Deng Xiaoping comes to power.

02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:31.280
[Guest]: And he sort of reorients the party. A reform process economically had begun even in the later

02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:36.080
[Guest]: years of Mao, where you sort of talked about loosening controls over the economy. In the late

02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:41.200
[Guest]: 1970s and early 1980s, this becomes very clear that we are going to do this. There's still a lot

02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:46.160
[Guest]: of pushback from the more conservative, ideologically left inclined elements in the

02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:52.560
[Guest]: party, from party elders, but sort of the reformers navigate these concerns well. And you start to

02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:56.480
[Guest]: liberalize the economy, you start to see opportunities. In early 1980s, Deng Xiaoping

02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:00.960
[Guest]: visited the US, and you saw that China's pivot in terms of its foreign policy had taken place.

02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:06.160
[Guest]: It was saying we want to grow rich, it was saying we want economic prosperity, and we want to put

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:11.680
[Guest]: disputes that we have on the side. And Deng Xiaoping sort of approach was to cultivate a

02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:16.800
[Guest]: favorable balance of power for these objectives. He wanted to sort of get away from that siege

02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:22.080
[Guest]: mentality in some ways. Of course, the Tiananmen Square incident of 1989 changes that to some

02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:28.480
[Guest]: degree. And for the next three years, there is again a compact that has to be engineered among

02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:34.080
[Guest]: the party elders and across through different carders. And by 1992, this again happens,

02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:40.480
[Guest]: you again see Deng Xiaoping visited Guangdong province, and which is one of the sort of

02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:45.520
[Guest]: manufacturing engines of China. And he talks about economic reform and whatever. And that sort of

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:51.120
[Guest]: that southern tour, as it's called today, gives a direction to the party saying, we are moving ahead

02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:55.440
[Guest]: with economic liberalization. You know, to a certain degree, we are moving ahead with,

02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:01.200
[Guest]: you know, reform of reducing state control, reducing party state control over the economy.

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:05.840
[Guest]: And that message sort of filters down, and you start to see much more reform taking place,

02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:11.280
[Guest]: like I said, in terms of price controls, in terms of factor markets, in terms of new policies with

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:16.000
[Guest]: regard to SEZs, and opening up the Chinese market to foreign investment, and so on and so forth.

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:20.960
[Guest]: And that then continues for a period of time. So a lot of Chinese policy throughout that time,

02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:25.840
[Guest]: throughout the decades from the late from the sort of early 80s, despite that brief interlude

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:32.720
[Guest]: after Tiananmen, through the 90s, the 2000s, is oriented towards economic prosperity,

02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:38.800
[Guest]: giving people a better life at home, cultivating economic wealth, and making sure that growth

02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:43.040
[Guest]: continues because that's the party's compact, that if we are going to give you growth,

02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:46.640
[Guest]: you don't challenge our political authority. And if you challenge our political authority,

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:50.960
[Guest]: we will crush it. We will crush any challenge because the party is supreme. And that continues

02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:55.040
[Guest]: in terms of foreign policy, how that plays out is that you keep disputes on the shelves. And this is

02:19:55.040 --> 02:20:00.480
[Guest]: evident in the Indian-Chinese relationship, right? In 1988, Rajiv Gandhi visits China,

02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:05.200
[Guest]: we put the disputes aside in terms that we don't fight anymore about it. But we say we'll start

02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:09.520
[Guest]: talking about them, we'll start building confidence, and we sign a number of agreements over

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:15.280
[Guest]: the next few decades. But the focus is on economic growth. And even India-China trade relationship

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:20.960
[Guest]: grows significantly over the next couple of decades. That starts to change somewhere around

02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:27.680
[Guest]: 2007-2008. There are many reasons for it. In my view, one of the reasons is that you see,

02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:33.760
[Guest]: firstly, the financial crisis that hits the world, particularly the West, and China finds itself in

02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:38.160
[Guest]: a place where it's actually aiding the West. And in the book, if you see also, there's a quote by

02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:43.760
[Guest]: the current Vice President of China Wang Qishan to Henry Paulson, where he talks about how

02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:47.120
[Guest]: you were once our teacher, and today, you're no longer our teacher. And we don't know what

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:51.360
[Guest]: we can learn from you anymore. And there's a sense of confidence. At the same time, there's a sense

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:56.000
[Guest]: of brittleness, because you're seeing colour revolutions taking place in Eastern Europe,

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:03.360
[Guest]: you're seeing the Arab Spring. And you're seeing sort of protests in Tibet, in Xinjiang, around

02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:09.280
[Guest]: 2008-2009. In Tibet, before the Olympics, there was an entire series of monks simulating themselves.

02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:14.880
[Guest]: And there's a sense of China's periphery being brittle. And that fear about these colour

02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:19.760
[Guest]: revolutions. At the same time, there's a sense of corruption that's, you know, seeping into the

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:24.960
[Guest]: party. I spoke about Jiang Zemin's Three Represents, and rent-seeking, and the fact that the party had

02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:29.920
[Guest]: grown unwieldy, and the ideology had become so diluted that it didn't matter to anybody.

02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:34.720
[Guest]: So you see that tightening happening at home, and that tightening, which is happening at home

02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:38.720
[Guest]: impacts foreign policy. You see, therefore, a much more nationalistic approach. You know,

02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:43.440
[Guest]: after Tiananmen, the party had launched a patriotic education campaign in 1994,

02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:49.280
[Guest]: you know, by 2008, there are many more people who are graduating, who are coming into the system,

02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:56.000
[Guest]: who are educated in a very different narrative, a narrative of, we faced humiliation for a century,

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.600
[Guest]: and the Communist Party came and it changed everything. And since then, we've had growth

02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:04.240
[Guest]: and these wonderful things, trust in the party and all of that. And this idea of these foreign

02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:08.800
[Guest]: devils who try to capture our land, humiliate us and all of that. People start to imbibe some of

02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:12.800
[Guest]: those things, right. And so therefore, foreign policy structurally starts to shift to a

02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:17.600
[Guest]: much more aggressive posture. And I'll leave it at that. So that's sort of a broad sweep about how

02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:22.800
[Guest]: you went from revolutionary and a mix of revolution and nationalism to a mix of economic

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:27.360
[Guest]: growth driven foreign policy to today of foreign policy, which is much more nationalistic.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.080
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating. And, you know, you mentioned Mao's Great Leap Forward, and that actually contains

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:39.840
[Amit Varma]: one of the finest examples of the seen and the unseen, as it were, that in, you know, in 1958,

02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:44.720
[Amit Varma]: Mao decided that, hey, you know, the farmers of China are suffering because sparrows are

02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:48.800
[Amit Varma]: destroying their crops. So let's kill all the sparrows. And he gave an order that sparrows

02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:53.440
[Amit Varma]: should be massacred, and sparrows were massacred en masse. So that's your sort of seen effect,

02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:56.640
[Amit Varma]: as it were, that sparrows are no longer messing up with crops. But the point is,

02:22:56.640 --> 02:23:01.520
[Amit Varma]: the balance of the ecosystem was messed up, because sparrows ate locusts. So what really

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:06.320
[Amit Varma]: happened is that locusts proliferated, destroyed China's crops, there was famine, hunger,

02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:11.120
[Amit Varma]: starvation, you know, 45 million people died in the three years following that. And this is what

02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:16.320
[Amit Varma]: they call the Great Leap Forward. And it also sort of leads me to the irony, which also perhaps,

02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:20.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, has a contemporary Indian resonance. It leads me to the irony that Mao was actually

02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:26.000
[Amit Varma]: incredibly damn good at one thing, which was counterinsurgency warfare. There's a great book

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.560
[Amit Varma]: by David Galula called Counterinsurgency Warfare, which takes a lot of insights from Mao and indeed

02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Mao's insights on that subject, both as a theorist and a practitioner, is something that Indians

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:40.960
[Amit Varma]: could have learned from while, you know, dealing with Kashmir or dealing with all the other

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:46.560
[Amit Varma]: troubles we have in other parts of India with Maoist revolutionaries, as it were. And the

02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:50.400
[Amit Varma]: irony here is that here is a man who was so remarkable at one thing, which in fact got him

02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:55.440
[Amit Varma]: to power, but so inept at the other thing, which was governance, you know, no knowledge of economics,

02:23:55.440 --> 02:24:01.280
[Amit Varma]: a completely wrong, damaging vision of what the state can do. And, you know, and I look at India,

02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:04.960
[Amit Varma]: and I look at, for example, the BJP election machine, and this is, of course, my personal

02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:09.440
[Amit Varma]: bias, I should point out to my listeners that Manoj does not necessarily agree with me. But

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:15.680
[Amit Varma]: the way I see it, the BJP election machinery is remarkable, but at governance, they completely

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.320
[Amit Varma]: suck. So you know, you would hope that if Modi and Shah got some of that competence, which they

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:24.720
[Amit Varma]: have in winning elections, to actually running the country, we could have been transformed.

02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.960
[Amit Varma]: And of course, we are being transformed, but perhaps in the wrong direction. But that aside

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:35.280
[Amit Varma]: apart, before we get to the meat and bones of your book, per se, and look deeper at Xi's regime, and

02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:41.200
[Amit Varma]: how things have changed during that time, a couple of broader questions. One is, give me a sense of

02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:45.920
[Amit Varma]: what the Chinese state is really like, because in terms of narrative, they'll talk a lot about

02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:51.920
[Amit Varma]: communism and socialism and blah, blah, blah. But, you know, in practice, anything but in practice,

02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:57.760
[Amit Varma]: it is this weird kind of capitalism, which is, you know, dictated by the state on top,

02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.200
[Amit Varma]: where the statism remains, the state is one overwhelming presence, as you found out during

02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.320
[Amit Varma]: your days in CCTV, its shadows are everywhere. But the economy is something completely different. So

02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:14.640
[Amit Varma]: tell me a little bit about what that kind of philosophy is like. The other question sort of

02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.400
[Amit Varma]: is tell me a little bit about the evolution of the party. Because one of the things that

02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:23.920
[Amit Varma]: strikes me from our past conversations, and from reading this book, is the importance of narrative

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:28.800
[Amit Varma]: to them. And earlier, you referred to, you know, the Indian misconception that there is no politics

02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:34.560
[Amit Varma]: in China. And that is actually a reasonable misconception to have, because they're just one

02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:38.800
[Amit Varma]: party and they rule everything. You know, there's no democracy, there are no elections, why do

02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:45.200
[Amit Varma]: narratives matter, elections kaha hai? And yet you see a similar kind of effort put into building

02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:51.520
[Amit Varma]: narratives, you know, as you would see in any vibrant democracy in the world, and India at

02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:56.960
[Amit Varma]: least is an electoral democracy, if not quite a democracy in a in the larger republican sense,

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:02.960
[Amit Varma]: as we would like in its fullest sense. But so tell me a little bit about one, what is the state

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:08.400
[Amit Varma]: really? It is clearly not a communist country. And you know, thank God for the Chinese that they're

02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:14.640
[Amit Varma]: not. And two, what's the deal with the party? You know, like, how does one rise within the party?

02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:20.960
[Amit Varma]: Is there any kind of scope for dissent? Or was it scope for dissent, which is now no more there?

02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of these two kind of puzzling things.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.320
[Guest]: Okay, so from the point of view of what the structure is like, if you think of it, it's,

02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:34.080
[Guest]: there are two different structures, right? So politically, there is a Leninist party structure,

02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:41.200
[Guest]: which is hierarchical, top down, which prevails, the party is distinct from the state, of course.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.760
[Guest]: And this is an important distinction, because Deng Xiaoping, when he made when he began his

02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:51.280
[Guest]: reforms, he basically wanted to take the party, not out of the state, but he wanted to reduce

02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:55.440
[Guest]: the party's influence in the state. And he said, the party's job is politics and ideology,

02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:01.120
[Guest]: and the state's job is actually delivering goods and things like that. And he tried to make that

02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:06.640
[Guest]: distinction, which, you know, Xi Jinping has reversed in some ways, because he's had the

02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:12.640
[Guest]: party cannibalizing state institutions. When you make that distinction, you create space for

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:17.680
[Guest]: efficiency, you create space for outcomes, which are much more better, and which are driven by

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:23.440
[Guest]: beyond more than political calculations. So the party continues in a Leninist sort of structure,

02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.960
[Guest]: which is top down, you've got the Politburo Standing Committee, which is the heart of power,

02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.920
[Guest]: seat of power. Xi Jinping is the General Secretary, who is the one person who now commands

02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:39.120
[Guest]: most of the power. The idea of the Politburo Standing Committee was that the General Secretary

02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:44.720
[Guest]: sort of first amongst equals, today, that's not necessarily the case anymore. And the idea was

02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:49.360
[Guest]: that the Premier, who would, you know, would be number two in the party's, you know, the General

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:53.920
[Guest]: Secretary is number one, the number two in the party's standing, Politburo Standing Committee

02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:58.800
[Guest]: becomes the Premier, and runs the State Council, which is essentially the government. And that was

02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:02.880
[Guest]: a sort of hierarchy that, you know, the General Secretary is responsible for foreign policy,

02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:09.360
[Guest]: of course, but also politics domestically, and the party's management and whatever, has most

02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:15.440
[Guest]: authority, is the top dog. But the Premier is taking care of the economy predominantly. Under

02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:20.800
[Guest]: Xi Jinping, he's sort of taken far more power in his own hands, through mechanisms called

02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:27.200
[Guest]: central leading groups to begin with. And once he sort of captured policymaking through these groups,

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.480
[Guest]: he's then sort of converted most of these groups into state commissions. So he also captures the

02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:37.600
[Guest]: state machinery, or at least operationally, how the state machinery functions. So that's

02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:41.360
[Guest]: essentially the structure of the party. It goes from, at the central level, you've got the

02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:47.600
[Guest]: Politburo Standing Committee, which then represents the larger Politburo. The Politburo is a smaller

02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:53.040
[Guest]: component of the Central Committee. And then you go downwards accordingly. These are the key

02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:56.560
[Guest]: institutions, the Central Committee is supposed to be the most powerful, but wielding power is done

02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:02.480
[Guest]: by the Politburo Standing Committee. Then you've got state institutions, which is the Parliament,

02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:07.920
[Guest]: which is the National People's Congress, which meets every year. Laws are obviously passed through

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:13.040
[Guest]: the Parliament. There are delegates to the NPC, which come from different fields, you know, and

02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:17.920
[Guest]: their election process happens from the grassroots level. The NPC system is such that you've got the

02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:21.920
[Guest]: National People's Congress, you've got Provincial People's Congresses, and then you have People's

02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:27.280
[Guest]: Congresses at lower levels after that of governance. And people get nominated and, you know,

02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:32.640
[Guest]: you get elected and you come up eventually. Now, how that process functions is not transparent.

02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:36.480
[Guest]: So it's not a case of, you know, you run for elections and you win. At the village level,

02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:40.000
[Guest]: at some level, there are elections, there are some sort of experiments with elections,

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:44.240
[Guest]: which are a little bit more public and transparent. But by and large, this process is not

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:49.360
[Guest]: necessarily very transparent. So likewise, in the party system, you've got a mirroring of the state

02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:53.520
[Guest]: system, right? So there are party congresses, there are party committees at provincial level

02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:57.840
[Guest]: and at lower levels. And again, there is a process of nomination and election and selection that goes

02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:04.480
[Guest]: on, which is not necessarily entirely transparent. So at the top, what happens and so Xi Jinping

02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:12.480
[Guest]: assumed was declared the heir apparent in 2007. When that took place, how he became the heir

02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:17.920
[Guest]: apparent is obviously not public knowledge. We don't know if there was a vote, and he won majority

02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:24.000
[Guest]: of the votes. We don't know. What we do know is that and I don't think that happened. Just to be

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:27.280
[Guest]: clear, I was just making a point over there. I think what really happened is that what really

02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:32.800
[Guest]: happens is that there's tremendous factional jostling within the party. How do these factions

02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:39.200
[Guest]: comprise? How do they come together? Some of these factions may be based on networks of patronage

02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:44.000
[Guest]: from the point of view of economically, which sectors you belong to. Some of them may be with

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.160
[Guest]: regard to the regions that you have worked in or you've grown up in and the ties that you've

02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:55.360
[Guest]: cultivated there. Some of these may be linked to your education and where you've come from.

02:30:55.360 --> 02:31:00.560
[Guest]: From family to education to region, all of that plays a role in building your personal networks,

02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:05.440
[Guest]: which then sort of play a role in factional politics. Also, from a policy position point

02:31:05.440 --> 02:31:10.320
[Guest]: of view, the Communist Youth League usually tends to have a certain view. So therefore,

02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:14.800
[Guest]: there is a Youth League faction. The current premier, Li Keqiang, is believed to be a part

02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:17.440
[Guest]: of the Youth League faction because he was obviously a member of the Youth League in the

02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:23.840
[Guest]: present. Xi Jinping's predecessor, Hu Jintao, was again also a Youth League product.

02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:30.640
[Guest]: Xi Jinping, on the other hand, is somebody who spent most of his life in Zhejiang province,

02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:39.280
[Guest]: in Fujian province and come and serve in the Northeast, in Shaanxi. And the relationships

02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:43.360
[Guest]: that he's cultivated there, along with the time that he spent studying at Tsinghua University,

02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:49.200
[Guest]: you will see a lot of the people who subsequently got promoted after Xi Jinping has assumed power

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:54.000
[Guest]: have links to some of these. So you can see what's playing a role in factional politics.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:58.640
[Guest]: So there's a lot of give and take that happens in that context. That's how essentially power

02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:04.320
[Guest]: works at that highest level in China. Now, all of this is very opaque. So a lot of this is sort

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:08.880
[Guest]: of theorizing and looking at some of the things, again, some of the work done by political analysts

02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:14.240
[Guest]: who in that brief period where China was much more open, had access to people, had access to

02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:17.920
[Guest]: documents, had access to things, who've been able to piece together things. And you know, of course,

02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:22.160
[Guest]: also people who've exited the party who've sort of left memoirs and things like that. So you've

02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:27.360
[Guest]: got some information, but there's obviously, it's not like it's a system that is so clear that we

02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:32.560
[Guest]: know, you know, how processes work. But that's essentially how power works, how the state is

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:39.360
[Guest]: structured. In terms of this argument of communist, capitalist, I mean, the party structure is Leninist,

02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:43.760
[Guest]: and it is decided that we will stick to that structure that works for us. In terms of the

02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:49.520
[Guest]: economy, the approaches, so the approach from the 1990s till sort of very recently,

02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:56.480
[Guest]: was of liberalization, but not necessarily entirely sort of market liberalization. It was

02:32:56.480 --> 02:33:01.920
[Guest]: about careful opening up of different sectors, you know, to the outside world, easing of controls,

02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:07.360
[Guest]: but at the same time, the other component of reform was improving governance efficiency. So

02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:11.920
[Guest]: I might not want to liberalize something, but I just want to make it much, I just want to make

02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:16.400
[Guest]: government services much more efficient. So a lot of Chinese reform, when the party talks about

02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:21.280
[Guest]: reform, is not about marketization. It's about improving governance efficiency. It's about

02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:26.160
[Guest]: cracking down on corruption. It's about making sure that the person at the end of the state who's

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:31.360
[Guest]: receiving that final state functionary, whether it is a marriage bureau, going to the marriage

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:35.280
[Guest]: bureau for a license, whether it's the police, whether it's you know, something else, you know,

02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:41.280
[Guest]: for rental, taxation, whatever, efficiency, transparency is increased. Because if you do

02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:46.400
[Guest]: that, you will get better performance legitimacy in terms of what you're doing. So the approach

02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:51.920
[Guest]: to the economy and to government functioning is in that sense that you want to increase efficiency.

02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:57.280
[Guest]: And again, like I said, Deng Xiaoping's idea was get rich. So whatever you did to get rich,

02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:01.840
[Guest]: to maximize profit was worth it. Under Xi Jinping, this is changing. This is changing because like

02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:06.640
[Guest]: I said, you know, there was these three phases, standing up, getting rich, growing strong.

02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:13.520
[Guest]: What we are seeing, what growing strong means, it may not necessarily mean that you need to

02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:17.680
[Guest]: get rich. Because it's, you know, and that's how you're seeing in terms, when you see the

02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:22.320
[Guest]: crackdown on technology sector in China today, what you're seeing is that being strong means

02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:28.400
[Guest]: that the state should also, or the party more than the state, has certain objectives with regard to

02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:34.400
[Guest]: national power. You've gotten rich, you've created capacity as a private entity, whether it's Alibaba,

02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:40.720
[Guest]: Tencent, whoever, your capacity must now service our needs for power. And this is how we define

02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:47.760
[Guest]: what we mean by cultivating power. If that means sacrificing efficiency, if that means sacrificing

02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:53.200
[Guest]: profit, if that means sacrificing your entrepreneurial zeal, so be it. And if you don't do it, we make

02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:59.280
[Guest]: you do it, which was not the case, five, seven, eight years ago. So that's a change that's happening

02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:05.840
[Guest]: with regard to the economy also. So if one wants to call that a Leninist sort of control on the

02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:11.760
[Guest]: economy, maybe you can, but I mean, it's difficult to sort of attach these labels, but it's no longer

02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:19.040
[Guest]: as freedom oriented, economic freedom oriented as it was maybe say 10 years ago. So that change is

02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:26.000
[Guest]: happening. That's how I would sort of look at the structure. No, just thinking aloud, it strikes me

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.560
[Amit Varma]: that most of the time being strong, getting rich, they should go together. Like, you know, your

02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:35.520
[Amit Varma]: colleague, Nathan says that the best foreign policy is economic growth, you know, a rising GDP,

02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:41.440
[Amit Varma]: which is, of course, true. I think the distinction here is that I think if China got rich, it would

02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:47.120
[Amit Varma]: be stronger. But it's a party getting stronger, which is kind of working at cross purposes. So

02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:51.440
[Amit Varma]: here is a party in the state kind of working at cross purposes. The other question that I asked,

02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:56.080
[Amit Varma]: which I'm still a little confused about is, your book details beautifully how there are two

02:35:56.080 --> 02:36:01.360
[Amit Varma]: directions in which narrative is being pushed. One is the outside world, and the other is within

02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:06.880
[Amit Varma]: China itself. And you've also, you know, been using the phrase under Deng, the thing was that

02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:12.160
[Amit Varma]: there was a separation, and the party would just do politics domestically. But what is politics in

02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:17.200
[Amit Varma]: a one party system? Why do they need an internal narrative when they don't need to win elections?

02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:23.120
[Amit Varma]: Or is there a sense that their hold on power may not be something that they can take so strongly

02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:27.520
[Amit Varma]: for granted? Did Tiananmen, for example, or whatever happened afterwards, kind of shake

02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:31.680
[Amit Varma]: them up a little bit? So what's the deal with that? Why do they even want an internal narrative

02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:35.200
[Amit Varma]: if they've already kind of, if they are in power, and they're going to stay there?

02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:38.080
[Guest]: I'll ask that. But let me just sort of add to the point that you spoke about, you know,

02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:42.640
[Guest]: the party wanting to be strong. So the way I look at it is this, right? I mean, if you look at the

02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:48.320
[Guest]: West right now, or even India today, there is a struggle going on between big technology and

02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:52.160
[Guest]: governments, whether it's in the US, whether it's in India right now. And the struggle is

02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:56.240
[Guest]: essentially about who wields power. The argument is that big tech has become far too powerful to

02:36:56.240 --> 02:37:00.640
[Guest]: dictate. And it's not just about dictate, but it's also about an organizational ability,

02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:04.400
[Guest]: the ability to challenge the political clout of a unit. The party does not want that to happen.

02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:09.200
[Guest]: So that's one part of its motivation in terms of business background that's taking place.

02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:14.960
[Guest]: The other part is that profit when you see profit, you know, if I was a firm that's developing,

02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:20.240
[Guest]: that's working on artificial intelligence, intelligence technology. Now, I know that

02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:26.080
[Guest]: spending my time and money on doing core fundamental research, I will spend 10 years,

02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:30.240
[Guest]: maybe I will achieve a breakthrough, and maybe I can license that or whatever, and you know,

02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:36.640
[Guest]: make money off that. But I'm not really getting rich easily. But if there is core fundamental

02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:41.760
[Guest]: research that's been done, I can use that and I can create a product whereby which when Amit

02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:46.800
[Guest]: walks into the room, the air conditioner recognizes his face, and automatically switches to 23 degree

02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:52.160
[Guest]: temperature. I sell stuff, I make money. But from the strategic point of view of the state,

02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:58.080
[Guest]: it's useless. From for an enterprise, it's really great, you know, you're making money and whatever.

02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:01.600
[Guest]: And from a state's point of view, it's like, okay, great, you're giving people a better life,

02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:05.280
[Guest]: but and you're contributing much more to the taxes because of your sales and revenue, whatever.

02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:10.160
[Guest]: But it's useless in the grand scheme of things. What Xi Jinping is saying is that, look,

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:14.960
[Guest]: I don't want you to just do that. I want you to direct all these wonderful resources that

02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:19.200
[Guest]: you've gathered and captured because of all the policies that we created that you can generate

02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:24.480
[Guest]: all this wealth into strategic domains. And the market is not doing it for me.

02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:29.040
[Guest]: So I'm going to force you to do it. Because I feel that this is going to be critical for my

02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:34.400
[Guest]: political power in terms of my competition with the West, but also at home, given I can cut you

02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:39.040
[Guest]: down to size because you know, you guys can become too big for your shoes. So I think that's

02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:44.160
[Guest]: one dynamic that's at play was that's shaping this. The other point in terms of why is it that

02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:50.560
[Guest]: a narrative matters to them? Look, I mean, there is tremendous politics within the Communist Party.

02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:55.840
[Guest]: When Xi Jinping rose to power, or when he was about to assume the position of the General Secretary,

02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:01.520
[Guest]: just that year, earlier that year, you had this case of the leader of Chongqing, Bo Xilai,

02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:07.360
[Guest]: you know, this really incredible series of events with regard to his wife, British expat and

02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:11.920
[Guest]: everything. And Bo Xilai eventually gets taken down on corruption and all these other charges

02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:16.560
[Guest]: and is now spending his life in prison. But Bo Xilai at one point of time was seen as a serious

02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:23.360
[Guest]: rival to Xi Jinping. Of course, Xi Jinping had won the stakes in 2007, so much before 2012,

02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:30.800
[Guest]: which is when he took charge. But Bo Xilai was sort of leading this populist, somewhat neo-Maoist

02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:35.440
[Guest]: model of, you know, governance. And again, something that we need to realize that in the

02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:39.760
[Guest]: Chinese system, the central government or the central leadership has tremendous authority,

02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:47.360
[Guest]: but so do the provinces and cities. And the fear that the party has is that leaders at these levels

02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:51.920
[Guest]: can cultivate fiefdoms, which can then lead to challenges within the party. And that happens a

02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:56.000
[Guest]: lot. And the Bo Xilai case is one example of this, where there was a fiefdom that was being

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:02.480
[Guest]: cultivated. There was also a case of an ideological confrontation with regard to what was accepted in

02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:06.560
[Guest]: the party with regard to where economic policy should go. You know, economic policy was going

02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:11.760
[Guest]: in the direction of quote-unquote reform and opening up, which was that you will have greater

02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:16.240
[Guest]: marketization, you will have greater liberalization, you will open up to the world and all of that.

02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:21.440
[Guest]: Whereas there is a strong current in society also, which is against this. So there's a strong sort

02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:26.560
[Guest]: of left-leaning current in society, which for ideological reasons may not like this sort of

02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:32.160
[Guest]: opening up. But there is also other currents which talk about, well, all these big state-owned

02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:36.320
[Guest]: enterprises and foreign companies and everything else. I mean, even if you remove the foreign

02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:40.560
[Guest]: component of it, but just big Chinese state-owned enterprises, you've polluted our waters, you've

02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:45.840
[Guest]: polluted our air, you've polluted our soil, and people push back, there is land grabs that happen

02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:51.920
[Guest]: and people push back. So that's the kind of politics that's happening in society. And leaders

02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:56.000
[Guest]: at different level will tap into that politics. Because at the end of the day, you do want to be

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.320
[Guest]: legitimate in the eyes of the people. Because if you're not legitimate, there will be revolts.

02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:05.760
[Guest]: So the narrative setting also partly happens for these reasons, where you're trying to sort of

02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:10.240
[Guest]: take together these different currents in society. You're trying to placate some,

02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:15.040
[Guest]: trying to move with some, you're trying to then frame policies to address some of these concerns.

02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.640
[Guest]: At the same time, the politics is taking place, because there are different pushes and pulls and

02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:23.360
[Guest]: political motivations at different levels of leadership in the party. So therefore,

02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:28.880
[Guest]: there is tremendous politics. And the narrative is required because you want to emphasize reasons

02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:35.200
[Guest]: for the party's legitimacy. Now, what's happened is that over the years, the narrative used to be

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:42.480
[Guest]: about being rich, providing opportunities, opening up, China becoming much more, China changing quite

02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:46.880
[Guest]: rapidly, and so on and so forth. Today, what's happened under Xi Jinping is that the narrative

02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:55.520
[Guest]: has shifted from that positive opportunity-based narrative to two broad things. One is a

02:41:55.520 --> 02:42:01.360
[Guest]: nationalistic narrative, which is comprising of things like, look, our system works, and our

02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:07.280
[Guest]: system is excellent, and our system delivers for us. So have faith in that system. The other is,

02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:12.080
[Guest]: look, these foreigners are envious of our system, because it works and look at theirs,

02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:17.280
[Guest]: that's collapsing. And the COVID case study, which is part of the book, essentially talks about that,

02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:21.600
[Guest]: that the Western system has failed to deliver. And the third part of that particular narrative

02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:26.240
[Guest]: of nationalism is about, we have been wronged historically, and today we are reclaiming our

02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:30.000
[Guest]: place. And those are the three narratives that you're telling society, which is very different

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:34.880
[Guest]: from the narrative of opportunity that you were giving out in the 1990s, 2000s, which was about

02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:38.560
[Guest]: China being this place of prosperity. The other sort of meta narrative that's there, apart from

02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:43.360
[Guest]: the nationalist narrative, is one about livelihood. And this Xi Jinping has done really, really well.

02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:47.920
[Guest]: He understood after that particular, after particularly what was happening with Bo Xilai

02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:52.480
[Guest]: and the new Maoist movement, he understood the left pushes and pulls that were taking place.

02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:58.320
[Guest]: And he's wary of that, right? He's wary of that particular strand of left movement,

02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:02.400
[Guest]: growing powerful. And why I say that is because over the last five, six years,

02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:08.320
[Guest]: you would have seen, and even today, you will read reports about neo-Maoist agitators,

02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:13.200
[Guest]: protesters, students being detained ahead of the party centenary. And that's because you're not

02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:17.680
[Guest]: comfortable with that strand of thought, because that challenges your fundamental economic policy

02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:22.480
[Guest]: of trying to keep China open as a trading nation. But at the same time, he's saying,

02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:27.840
[Guest]: look, there are genuine concerns that these guys are raising. Pollution is one, financial risk is

02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:32.640
[Guest]: one. You don't want contagion in banks, it hurts people's livelihood, apart from whatever systemic

02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:37.040
[Guest]: impact it has, which is tremendous. But the challenge will be, what happens when there's

02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:42.960
[Guest]: a run on banks? It impacts political stability. What happens when pollution becomes that much of

02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:49.600
[Guest]: an issue that people revolt? What happens when people's health is a huge issue and we don't

02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:55.280
[Guest]: address it? And we don't provide when medicines are incredibly expensive and people can't access

02:43:55.280 --> 02:44:00.240
[Guest]: doctors. Where does all this boast of our performance go away? So he's trying to therefore

02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:06.800
[Guest]: address livelihood issues. And therefore, in 2017, he sort of changed, in very Marxist terms,

02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:11.920
[Guest]: what is the principal contradiction of society? And that contradiction, according to him, is

02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:17.360
[Guest]: unbalanced and unequal growth today, and the desire for a better life. So he's oriented his

02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:22.480
[Guest]: policy towards trying to also address livelihood issues while trying to maintain some degree of

02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:26.640
[Guest]: growth. And I think that just tells you why narrative matters, because legitimacy matters

02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:32.000
[Guest]: to the party. And for the party, while power does flow, as Mao said, through the barrel of the gun,

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:37.920
[Guest]: and you want to keep control of the PLA, you also want legitimacy through performance. And you want

02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:43.200
[Guest]: legitimacy through history, because that's where your legitimacy will sustain. For the Communist

02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:47.360
[Guest]: Party, again, very different from say, places like India or the US or the West, or democratic

02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:53.280
[Guest]: countries, where the government will go, but the system sustains. Here at the party goes,

02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:58.320
[Guest]: the system collapse. So for the party, that is existential. So therefore, you need this narrative.

02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating. And in this whole Wuhan narrative, also everything that has happened,

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:09.840
[Amit Varma]: the most noticeable thing is how the Chinese Communist Party, in a sense, focuses on narrative

02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:14.240
[Amit Varma]: as much as governance, if not more than governance, I mean, also governance, but narrative

02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:20.640
[Amit Varma]: is such an incredibly important part. And it flows out of how she has sort of redefined this

02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:25.040
[Amit Varma]: narrative, like you quote, in one of the many frameworks you present, you quote Deborah Stone

02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:30.320
[Amit Varma]: from her book Policy Paradox, where she talks about her policy stories are like fairy tales,

02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:35.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, they'll use literary and rhetorical devices, they'll have good guys and bad guys,

02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:41.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, even if the bad guy is a virus, and so on and so forth, which also kind of speaks to,

02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:45.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, the German theorist Karl Schmitt's theory of how in politics, you always need an

02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:50.000
[Amit Varma]: enemy, there always has to be an other, you know, which could be a virus, which could be

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.880
[Amit Varma]: anyone who's anti national, for any reason, you can have subcategories within that. And that,

02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:00.000
[Amit Varma]: of course, is as much an Indian reference as a Chinese one. Now, in your last episode with me,

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:07.360
[Amit Varma]: you also spoke about discourse power, which is something that she has sort of developed,

02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:12.160
[Amit Varma]: which is a narrative different from his predecessors, and which also has a certain

02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:17.680
[Amit Varma]: edge to it. So tell me a little bit about that and how that manifests itself during this post

02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:24.000
[Guest]: Wuhan time. Right. So I think if you look at the idea of discourse power, it's not something which

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.720
[Guest]: is unique or new from a Chinese point of view. But it's something that's interesting to be studied

02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:35.440
[Guest]: because, and I'll sort of frame this firstly in the context of if an individual is given a choice

02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:41.600
[Guest]: that you can stay in X or Y kind of society today, most of us and if there is a proposition that is

02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:48.160
[Guest]: being brought by different countries, most of us would err on the side today of what can loosely

02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:53.360
[Guest]: be called, you know, that Washington consensus, you know, the American compact of free markets,

02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:58.000
[Guest]: liberal economies, political representation, and things like that, political participation,

02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:02.800
[Guest]: you know, you know, prosperity, not just economically, but also politically is in

02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:06.720
[Guest]: from a lively point of view, all of that. Now, the Chinese are essentially looking at that,

02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:13.280
[Guest]: and they're saying, we have developed a lot of hard power, but the narrative that we are

02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:17.280
[Guest]: offering to the world, you know, the narrative that the Americans are offering to the world,

02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:21.360
[Guest]: or they have offered to the world, and based on that, they've also shaped institutions.

02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:25.600
[Guest]: So for instance, the narrative on human rights, we have a when when you use the word human rights,

02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:31.760
[Guest]: we have a certain conceptualization in our head about limiting the state's ability to coerce and

02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:37.680
[Guest]: use force about individual liberty, individual dignity, and all of that. Now, the Chinese are

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:43.280
[Guest]: saying, look, that can be fundamentally problematic to us, because that doesn't sit well with the

02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:47.600
[Guest]: party's governance model. And it doesn't necessarily even fit well with in some of

02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:54.560
[Guest]: their conceptualization with how the party feels society, social values are in China,

02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:59.120
[Guest]: and maybe in other parts of the world also. And we see this conflict on human rights with India

02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:03.840
[Guest]: and the West also. So they're saying, look, there is a reason why there is legitimacy to that

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:08.240
[Guest]: argument that they are saying, you know, that the Americans have made, it's backed up by their hard

02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:12.080
[Guest]: power, you know, it is after World War Two, that they had the hard power, and they had the ability

02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:16.240
[Guest]: that they could create these systems and whatever. But also, instinctively, over time, there is a

02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:21.520
[Guest]: certain legitimacy to that argument that they have given, we need to challenge that legitimacy.

02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:28.960
[Guest]: Because we have a proposition too. And to be able to make that proposition viable for the world,

02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:35.600
[Guest]: not necessarily to proselytize, not necessarily to sort of do missionary work, but to be able to

02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:40.640
[Guest]: create space for ourselves to exist without pressure from the West, we need to make our

02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:44.880
[Guest]: proposition viable. Now, that's essentially where you're cultivating discourse power,

02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:48.720
[Guest]: where you're talking about yourself and your system, you know, and you're creating a certain

02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:56.000
[Guest]: degree of legitimacy. If you look at the discourse on human rights today, the Chinese have made some

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:01.040
[Guest]: inroads, the fact that even say the Human Rights Council in the UN has sort of diminished in

02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:06.320
[Guest]: authority increasingly, and we read this report, or Saudi Arabia elected chairperson, whatever,

02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:11.280
[Guest]: from the Chinese point of view, they started to think about how do we make this argument

02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:17.120
[Guest]: internationally? Firstly, what is the philosophical argument that we will make? What are the tools

02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:22.080
[Guest]: that we need to make this argument? And how do we then go about making this? So at a philosophical

02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:28.240
[Guest]: level, the view was, if we are saying that we are a different system, and our system has equal

02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:33.760
[Guest]: legitimacy, what is our system? How is it different? You know, and you need to make this argument,

02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:38.240
[Guest]: not just for the outside world, but also for your own people. And in the book, I document how

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.720
[Guest]: even before Xi Jinping, when Hu Jintao was leaving power, he talks about something called

02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:50.080
[Guest]: core socialist values. And there are these 12 different values which come out and Xi Jinping

02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:55.360
[Guest]: sort of takes that and he says, yes, we need to use core socialist values. So the first sort of

02:49:55.360 --> 02:50:01.440
[Guest]: process is to create your own system and give it some lifeblood. How do you do that? You do that

02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:05.840
[Guest]: firstly, with how your society is organized, how the economy is organized. And that I like I've

02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:10.960
[Guest]: said, that's changing, right? The parties assume a greater role, the idea that entrepreneurs must

02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:16.160
[Guest]: be patriotic, that being a key component of it. Now, in India, we don't make that argument that

02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.800
[Guest]: entrepreneurs must be patriotic. Although some sections of society may make that argument,

02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:25.520
[Guest]: but we don't systematically. In the US, we don't make that argument. The Chinese are saying that's

02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:31.200
[Guest]: our system. Likewise, when you're using these core socialist values, these socialist values are

02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:39.360
[Guest]: sort of categorized based on national social individual. So where you categorize a certain

02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:47.680
[Guest]: value impinges on how say the law will approach an issue. So if freedom is an individual value,

02:50:47.680 --> 02:50:54.080
[Guest]: but at a social level, it's not a value. So great, you can be free at your home. But at social level,

02:50:54.640 --> 02:51:00.560
[Guest]: the law will not treat your freedom as more important than social benefit. Whereas in India,

02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:06.880
[Guest]: we will see if we make the case that, you know, my freedom to express myself is much more important.

02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:11.280
[Guest]: And we see this push and pull in India every day, right? My freedom to have, you know, a

02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:16.240
[Guest]: noisy environment is much more important than somebody's freedom to dance outside or whatever,

02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:21.120
[Guest]: or to play music and have a party, you know, and that push and pull of individual freedom

02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:25.840
[Guest]: versus social obligation. In China, they're saying that under the under these core socialist values,

02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:31.200
[Guest]: with this example of freedom and social freedom being an individual value, at a social level,

02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:39.840
[Guest]: freedom is not significant. So if the majority is benefiting, it's okay for your freedom to be,

02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:45.520
[Guest]: you know, to go away, it's fine with us. And that then bleeds into legislation. And there's

02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:51.680
[Guest]: a paper that I cite in the book by Delia Lane and Susan Travis. They do a phenomenal job of

02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:54.960
[Guest]: documenting how Xi Jinping has gone about doing this, which is where you're constructing your

02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:59.280
[Guest]: own system. And you're saying, okay, now these are the values of our system. Now you take that

02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:05.120
[Guest]: proposition to say, to your society, firstly, make them sort of buy it. And under that, I think Xi

02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:10.400
[Guest]: Jinping, again, takes from Hu Jintao, Hu Jintao spoke about three confidences that we must have

02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:15.120
[Guest]: confidence in the socialist theory, system and path. And Xi Jinping says, we must also have

02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:20.640
[Guest]: confidence in our culture. So he then sort of draws from Chinese culture and history,

02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:26.240
[Guest]: again, shaping legislation and shaping the environment, governance environment.

02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:30.720
[Guest]: And again, patriotic entrepreneurs is one part of it. So when he quotes patriotic entrepreneurs,

02:52:30.720 --> 02:52:34.240
[Guest]: he talks about the Qing dynasty and some entrepreneur at that point of time who did

02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:37.920
[Guest]: this and who did that and whatever. So he's setting benchmarks for how businesses should

02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:45.200
[Guest]: also approach. The next part is you cultivate your tools to propagate these ideas. So in your

02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:48.880
[Guest]: society, you're implementing them, you're selling them through your media, you're selling them

02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:52.640
[Guest]: through social media, you're selling them through other means, through your governance models,

02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:58.960
[Guest]: and so on and so forth. Internationally, you're seeing that look, we have no media credibility.

02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:05.440
[Guest]: You know, I mean, if I'm going to tell you, you get your news unbiased from CCTV or from Xinhua

02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:09.840
[Guest]: from People's Daily, you're not going to do that you're going to get unbiased news as unbiased as

02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:14.240
[Guest]: it can be from maybe the British Broadcasting Corporation from CNN from other places,

02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:19.680
[Guest]: whatever. And the credibility that an AP, AFP, BBC, whatever enjoys is far greater than any

02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:23.360
[Guest]: what a Chinese agency would enjoy. And the narrative that these agencies set is very

02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:30.160
[Guest]: different, right? So Xi Jinping will be strong man, hardline, you know, dictatorial, whatever.

02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:37.120
[Guest]: But you will not hear Emmanuel Macron be defined as radical, strong man, whatever. So there are

02:53:37.120 --> 02:53:40.160
[Guest]: certain narratives that media organizations are setting. And the Chinese thing, look, we want to

02:53:40.160 --> 02:53:45.360
[Guest]: compete with that. Because we feel there is a competition that's going on for people's minds,

02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:49.840
[Guest]: and we can compete in that space. So they cultivate these tools with regard to

02:53:50.640 --> 02:53:55.120
[Guest]: how do you make your media narrative much more attractive. Conventionally, communist narratives

02:53:55.120 --> 02:54:00.080
[Guest]: have been really dry, boring, go through reams and reams of nothing to find one useful thing,

02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:04.480
[Guest]: because they are very polemical. So you end up, they say, no, we need to change. So you try to

02:54:04.480 --> 02:54:09.680
[Guest]: cultivate new media tools. You're trying to invest in media abroad, under the sort of belt and road,

02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:13.520
[Guest]: they've done a tremendous amount in terms of investing in media abroad. You're trying to

02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:18.240
[Guest]: provide Chinese media coverage of China to be able to do that. So you're using all different

02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:24.720
[Guest]: tools to cultivate that power. Another key component of this is to try and have a greater

02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:29.680
[Guest]: say in international organizations, whether it's the UN, whether it's the WTO, whatever.

02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:34.080
[Guest]: Basically, you're making the argument saying, particularly in say, the WTO or the IMF,

02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:38.160
[Guest]: you're saying, we are a bigger player, we need bigger, we need a bigger say here, you know,

02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:42.480
[Guest]: we are footing in far bigger amount of the bill. At the same time, you're setting up alternate

02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:46.720
[Guest]: institutions like the AIIB, you're empowering an existing institution like the Shanghai

02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:52.560
[Guest]: Cooperation Organization. So you're doing all these things to be able to have far greater presence,

02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:57.840
[Guest]: far greater influence, far greater say, because you know, today, you're in a competition with the

02:54:57.840 --> 02:55:04.000
[Guest]: West, but also the same time, your interests have expanded, you are no longer limited to your

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:08.560
[Guest]: territory or just your periphery. Today, China is a huge player in Latin America, in Africa,

02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:14.400
[Guest]: in South Asia, in Europe. And if your interests are expanded, you need to influence ideas and

02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:19.120
[Guest]: thoughts over there. And they saw that very early on as something that's happening. So firstly,

02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:24.720
[Guest]: from a defensive point of view, to the sense of anxiety that existed with regard to

02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:30.160
[Guest]: color revolutions, economic problems, and all of that, and parties legitimacy, to secondly,

02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:37.360
[Guest]: selling the idea of why your system works and is good for the Chinese people to the Chinese people.

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:42.000
[Guest]: And thirdly, to have this sort of competitive dynamic with the West, which again, supports

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:47.520
[Guest]: your domestic narrative, you know, because if you can go back and say, look, these 70 countries are

02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:52.160
[Guest]: supporting us on Xinjiang, whereas the US has 15 countries are supporting them. Clearly, we are

02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:57.040
[Guest]: right to make those sorts of cases. They've sort of systematically gone about cultivating sources

02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:03.680
[Amit Varma]: of strength to do that. It is all very fascinating. And I found that bit very interesting reading

02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:09.120
[Amit Varma]: about the 12 core socialist values as it were, and how there are all these nice sounding things

02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:13.920
[Amit Varma]: like freedom, equality, justice, democracy, rule of law, but you look a little closer,

02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:18.320
[Amit Varma]: and they're not really there in practice, that individual freedom is subservient to the good of

02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:23.360
[Amit Varma]: society. So therefore, for all practical purposes, you can just use the good of society as an excuse

02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:28.960
[Amit Varma]: and crush individual freedom, which is, of course, a communist way. Anyway, I was also struck by one

02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:35.680
[Amit Varma]: of the core elements of the narrative here, which is this suspicion of Western values. You know,

02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:42.640
[Amit Varma]: you speak about how in 2013, she delivered a speech to new members of the CCP Central Committee,

02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:46.880
[Amit Varma]: which, you know, led to something called document number nine, where he speaks about seven false

02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:51.760
[Amit Varma]: ideological trends, position and activities. And I'll quote you, you're right quote,

02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:56.320
[Amit Varma]: these included the structure systems and processes of Western constitutional democracy,

02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:01.040
[Amit Varma]: the nurturing of a civil society premised on individual rights, and a Western conception of

02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:05.840
[Amit Varma]: values, such as freedom, democracy and human rights being regarded as universal, with the

02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:11.040
[Amit Varma]: aim to supplant the core values of socialism, stop code. And this is also noise that I've heard in

02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:17.520
[Amit Varma]: India from both the BJP and a member of the Aam Aadmi Party once, you know, replied to one of my

02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:22.160
[Amit Varma]: tweets somewhere talking about how these are all Western values, and they don't apply to us and

02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:28.400
[Amit Varma]: all of that. I forget the exact context, but you hear similar kinds of talk. And in fact, the whole

02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:33.600
[Amit Varma]: narrative thrust of Xi, especially as you've described in the book, post the beginning of

02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:39.200
[Amit Varma]: the pandemic feels very similar to what is the case here, like, number one, you diss Western

02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:44.640
[Amit Varma]: values, you diss the sort of elite liberals who bring those values here. Number two, you talk

02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:50.160
[Amit Varma]: about nationalism and how we will fight this together. And you give folksy wisdom, like

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:55.200
[Amit Varma]: recently our Prime Minister spoke about, you know, how COVID was such a problem, but we coped because

02:57:55.200 --> 02:58:00.800
[Amit Varma]: we had yoga. So there seem to be all these similarities. And what I'm also kind of struck

02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:06.000
[Amit Varma]: by, which is a really amusing drama is that what happens at the local level in Wuhan is that there

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:10.960
[Amit Varma]: are these whistleblowers, there are these eight doctors and whatever who talk about what's going

02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:15.040
[Amit Varma]: on, one of them takes a picture of an ambulance, which has eight bodies, which has a bunch of

02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:20.640
[Amit Varma]: bodies piled up in it. And immediately they're all sort of taken into custody, they are reprimanded,

02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:26.800
[Amit Varma]: they get into trouble, and all of that happens. And then after a month or so after a few weeks,

02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:31.040
[Amit Varma]: the central government kind of steps in, and it says, No, these are common people. These guys

02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:35.840
[Amit Varma]: are our heroes. And the main whistleblower doctor among them, you know, happened to die.

02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:40.480
[Amit Varma]: And these guys then build a narrative where they're like, No, these are our heroes. We are

02:58:40.480 --> 02:58:45.120
[Amit Varma]: all fighting this together. We all have to bang thalis. Okay, he didn't say bang thalis, that's

02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:50.800
[Amit Varma]: from a neighboring country. But we all have to fight this together, our doctors, our medical

02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:56.240
[Amit Varma]: workers, blah, blah, blah. So it's almost this folksy thing of we will fight this enemy together.

02:58:56.240 --> 02:59:01.280
[Amit Varma]: What I also found amusing was that she just disappears for the first few weeks. As you

02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:05.600
[Amit Varma]: pointed out that this was rare, the media would constantly report on his activities, what he's

02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:10.400
[Amit Varma]: doing, who he's dating, okay, perhaps not that, but the speeches he gives and all of that. And he

02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:15.760
[Amit Varma]: just disappears for a while, till the crisis blows over. And then he comes into the scene.

02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:20.560
[Amit Varma]: And then he says that, Oh, look, you know, we fought it together, you the common people and

02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:24.960
[Amit Varma]: me or loving leader. And that's sort of the whole narrative, which is interestingly,

02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:30.320
[Amit Varma]: what's happening here as well. In fact, brief digression, you know, I was going to write a

02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:35.120
[Amit Varma]: newsletter post, I should probably do it before this episode comes out on what Narendra Modi and

02:59:35.120 --> 02:59:41.200
[Amit Varma]: homeopathy have in common. Can you guess? Apart from the obvious one of not not being effective

02:59:41.200 --> 02:59:45.280
[Amit Varma]: or whatever. No, it's it's actually regression to the mean, right. So a lot of people think

02:59:45.280 --> 02:59:49.600
[Amit Varma]: homeopathy works not just because of the placebo effect, but because a lot of with a lot of

02:59:49.600 --> 02:59:53.760
[Amit Varma]: diseases, especially things like the common cold, there's a regression to the mean, it gets better

02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:58.480
[Amit Varma]: on its own. But if at the peak of your discomfort, you take the medicine and then you get better on

02:59:58.480 --> 03:00:04.400
[Amit Varma]: your own, you will ascribe causation to the medicine. So similarly, what our Prime Minister

03:00:04.400 --> 03:00:09.120
[Amit Varma]: has done is he has now landed up and taken credit for having fought the second wave successfully,

03:00:09.120 --> 03:00:13.440
[Amit Varma]: when the point is all waves regress to the mean, right? In the worst case scenario,

03:00:13.440 --> 03:00:18.000
[Amit Varma]: the second wave would have regressed to the mean with everybody dying, but whatever all waves

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:23.040
[Amit Varma]: regress to the mean. So you know, to then say causation and then say that, hey, you know,

03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:28.240
[Amit Varma]: we solved it, and it was my resolve and blah, blah, blah, seems a little dodgy to me. And that

03:00:28.240 --> 03:00:32.160
[Amit Varma]: seems to be exactly what she kind of did. And it strikes me that the local government and by the

03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:36.640
[Amit Varma]: way, the party people there were all sacked and made the scapegoats and all that. And it seems

03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:40.560
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, when the thing happened, they didn't know what the hell to do. So they were

03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:46.480
[Amit Varma]: like, let's just stop the bad news from going out. And then she decides to take over narrative

03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:52.480
[Amit Varma]: control. So is this an accurate summation of all the elements that go into building this kind of

03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:57.760
[Amit Varma]: narrative where there is this nationalistic pride, there is a suspicion of Western values,

03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:02.640
[Amit Varma]: which come from outside, especially inconvenient Western values like freedom, and so on, you know,

03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:06.960
[Guest]: what would you add to that? So I would say that, look,

03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:11.840
[Guest]: there is obviously deep suspicion, I think, because partly because the party also feels that,

03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:17.120
[Guest]: you know, fundamentally, those values, if they shape society, they will sort of limit the party's

03:01:17.120 --> 03:01:21.120
[Guest]: level of control over society. And I think that's something that's unacceptable. And that's been a

03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:26.240
[Guest]: red line from, you know, even Deng Xiaoping's time before Tiananmen Square. And in fact, that

03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:30.240
[Guest]: crackdown on Tiananmen Square was the place where the party was basically saying, look,

03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:36.480
[Guest]: the primacy of the party is non-negotiable, the rest of it we can talk about. And I think

03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:41.520
[Guest]: even today, you will see that. Under Xi Jinping, I think partly you can see that, and I document

03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:45.680
[Guest]: this in the book, right, that there is tremendous change that's taking place in 2008-2009.

03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:51.280
[Guest]: Internal protests in Xinjiang, Tibet, the unwieldy nature of the party, frustration with

03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:58.400
[Guest]: corruption, unmooring of society in some way, because, you know, these families with one child,

03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:03.200
[Guest]: children growing up, some having tremendous wealth, totally unmoored socially, you're seeing

03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:07.920
[Guest]: these strange sort of, you know, rich brat crimes sort of things that are taking place.

03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:11.680
[Guest]: You're seeing a lot of corruption, you're seeing a lot of frustration with corruption,

03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:15.600
[Guest]: and you're seeing essentially, and that's why at the same time you see, and people have

03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:20.560
[Guest]: documented, Ian Johnson has documented this, that society, therefore, is also looking at

03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:25.200
[Guest]: looking at more for religion, because you need something where you feel more to society,

03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:30.160
[Guest]: you know. And I think that what Xi Jinping, when he comes to power, he sees a party which is

03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:35.440
[Guest]: lacking discipline, which is struggling, and Hu Jintao in his speech just before he leaves power,

03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:40.400
[Guest]: says that corruption is a real, real critical issue for the party that needs to be addressed.

03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:44.080
[Guest]: And when Xi Jinping comes to power, he basically starts to gradually

03:02:44.080 --> 03:02:50.320
[Guest]: streamline everything from his point of view. If you increase control, you maintain stability.

03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:56.320
[Guest]: And that's what we've seen over the last seven, eight years of his power, you know, his reign so

03:02:56.320 --> 03:03:01.040
[Guest]: far. It's also accompanied with obviously a cult of personality that he's built, which, you know,

03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:04.880
[Guest]: I mean, you look at it cynically, and you can say, of course, this is one man putting himself

03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:10.160
[Guest]: above everything else. You look at it from his point of view, he can make the argument that look,

03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:14.960
[Guest]: I needed to gain control, because you need to whip local governments in shape so that they

03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:19.760
[Guest]: can actually deliver on priorities. Like in China, and unlike, say, the West,

03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:24.960
[Guest]: if you do a public polling of, you know, support for government, what you will see is that there's

03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:29.040
[Guest]: lots of dissatisfaction at local government levels, tremendous satisfaction at central

03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:33.760
[Guest]: government level, which is the other way around in, say, the US, where there's lots of satisfaction

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:39.280
[Guest]: at the local government level, and dissatisfaction at the federal level. But this sort of informs

03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:43.360
[Guest]: also how the central government operates, where it says that we need to get these guys at the

03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:49.040
[Guest]: local level to adhere to things, adhere to priorities. Now, one of the frameworks that I

03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:52.720
[Guest]: quote in the book, which is sort of, you know, fragmented authoritarianism, where

03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:58.160
[Guest]: the idea that information, systemically, you don't want to report bad news to your bosses.

03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:02.720
[Guest]: Because I am, if I am a carder, and my boss is still, if I'm a local official, and my boss

03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:06.960
[Guest]: at the sort of higher level, whether the provincial level or the central level is telling me

03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:12.880
[Guest]: GDP growth is a priority. Employment stability is a priority. And you need to maintain.

03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:20.480
[Guest]: I will do whatever I can to maintain that. Even if it means creating pointless infrastructure,

03:04:20.480 --> 03:04:25.360
[Guest]: because it reflects good on GDP. And that's what people end up doing. And if there is negative

03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:29.280
[Guest]: information, I will try and keep it as low as possible. Because look, I know in a few years,

03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:35.200
[Guest]: I'm moving away from here. So I'll leave that for the next guy to deal with. So there are systemic

03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:39.200
[Guest]: sort of hurdles in terms of how information flows from bottom to the top. There are also

03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:43.760
[Guest]: hurdles of information flowing across different domains, because a provincial governor and a

03:04:43.760 --> 03:04:48.480
[Guest]: provincial party secretary are sort of equals, but the party secretary is a much more important

03:04:48.480 --> 03:04:52.800
[Guest]: position. And across different government departments, there will be silos of information

03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:56.240
[Guest]: flows and all that. And this happens in China, just like it happens in most other places,

03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:00.160
[Guest]: by interdepartmental coordination can be difficult. Now, from the central leadership point

03:05:00.160 --> 03:05:05.360
[Guest]: of view, it says, I need to whip all this in shape. And part of Xi Jinping's sort of campaign

03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:11.200
[Guest]: has been to try and reshape incentives, push out people that he finds problematic politically,

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:15.680
[Guest]: and also from his economic agenda point of view, to try and get people in the right places.

03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:21.040
[Guest]: Also try and address some of these systemic issues of information flows. The fact that

03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:26.160
[Guest]: he's been unsuccessful to address at least the information flow issue is evident with what

03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:31.840
[Guest]: happened in Wuhan. Because the information did not come clearly in time, or at least whatever

03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:36.240
[Guest]: documentation that we have, it did not come fairly in time. Now, even here, I think the Communist

03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:40.480
[Guest]: Party's narrative, like you pointed out, Xi Jinping vanished for a brief period. Yet, if you

03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:45.600
[Guest]: see later on in February, they put out this statement saying, oh, he held this extraordinary

03:05:45.600 --> 03:05:51.760
[Guest]: meeting on January 7. And he had taken control of things from that day onward. Well, if he did take

03:05:51.760 --> 03:05:57.520
[Guest]: control of things, then why are you cribbing about information flow? Clearly, you knew, and you waited

03:05:57.520 --> 03:06:03.200
[Guest]: for 13-14 days to act. There's another bit of reportage that I cite in the book where on 14th

03:06:03.200 --> 03:06:09.760
[Guest]: of January, there is a meeting between, I think, central health officials and local officials,

03:06:09.760 --> 03:06:15.520
[Guest]: and they talk about what's going on. So clearly, the central authorities knew before January 20th,

03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:20.320
[Guest]: 21st, 22nd, which is when they sort of go and eventually impose a lockdown on Wuhan.

03:06:20.320 --> 03:06:24.400
[Guest]: And on, I think, 17th or 18th January, there's a central team that lands in Wuhan,

03:06:24.960 --> 03:06:30.960
[Guest]: and it spends a day assessing what's happening. And the next day, it recommends a lockdown,

03:06:30.960 --> 03:06:37.440
[Guest]: essentially. It says this is a serious problem. So the narrative was a little bit sketchy from

03:06:37.440 --> 03:06:43.760
[Guest]: the Chinese side. Did Xi Jinping know on January 7th? If he knew on January 7th, then the failure

03:06:43.760 --> 03:06:49.920
[Guest]: from the 7th to the 23rd is also on him. And it is during that time that you see these officials

03:06:49.920 --> 03:06:56.160
[Guest]: in Wuhan holding these grand New Year banquets. So the failure is also on him. But if he did not

03:06:56.160 --> 03:07:00.960
[Guest]: know, why would you put out this statement in February saying that he knew? So that, to me,

03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:06.400
[Guest]: seemed like a bit of a post-fact correction of, look, because you felt comfortable in probably

03:07:06.400 --> 03:07:10.800
[Guest]: what you were doing at a certain point of time, you sort of reoriented things and saying, look,

03:07:10.800 --> 03:07:16.080
[Guest]: we knew and we were in central government control. So I think that the narrative itself is,

03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:21.520
[Guest]: they're on weak sort of ground when they make that claim. But yeah, I mean, initially, Xi Jinping is,

03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:26.320
[Guest]: you know, after imposing the lockdown in the first meeting that he has on January 25th,

03:07:26.320 --> 03:07:31.440
[Guest]: if I remember correctly, with the Politburo, he sort of for a few days, for a week or 10 days,

03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:36.240
[Guest]: sort of vanishes from the People's Daily front pages, which never really happens. I mean,

03:07:36.240 --> 03:07:40.480
[Guest]: there are occasions, yes, you don't see him for a while, for whatever reason. But at least you'll

03:07:40.480 --> 03:07:43.920
[Guest]: see reports or something about him. But you suddenly see him going away, particularly at

03:07:43.920 --> 03:07:49.200
[Guest]: this moment, when there is a crisis. And then he reemerges, you know, with a diplomatic meeting,

03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:54.160
[Guest]: and then with another. And then you subsequently have this February 13th or 14th is when you have

03:07:54.160 --> 03:07:59.760
[Guest]: this report about him having chaired a meeting on January 7th and all of that. You do feel that

03:07:59.760 --> 03:08:03.760
[Guest]: there's a bit of rewriting of history that's already started at that early stage also.

03:08:04.320 --> 03:08:08.320
[Guest]: And that continues, of course, throughout the process. I mean, with that said,

03:08:08.320 --> 03:08:14.960
[Guest]: I mean, to give the devil his due, what the Communist Party did in terms of mobilizing

03:08:14.960 --> 03:08:21.120
[Guest]: resources to be able to contain what was happening in Wuhan, in hindsight, today,

03:08:21.120 --> 03:08:24.080
[Guest]: when we look at it, and even at that point of time, I mean, at that point, obviously,

03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:29.440
[Guest]: we didn't know how this was going to pan out. But when I look at it in hindsight, and the model

03:08:29.440 --> 03:08:35.200
[Guest]: that they devised to be able to not just deal with the problems in Wuhan, but subsequently outbreaks

03:08:35.200 --> 03:08:41.440
[Guest]: in the Northeast, in Beijing, or even this week, that we are talking in Guangdong, they have

03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:48.160
[Guest]: managed to create a structure where they know what to do. They have managed to give very clear

03:08:48.160 --> 03:08:52.560
[Guest]: incentives to local officials. So a lot of local officials, not just in Wuhan,

03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:59.360
[Guest]: have been subsequently sacked and faced sort of harsh penalties for failing to contain outbreaks.

03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:04.720
[Guest]: You know, whether these are people who are in charge of prisons where there have been outbreaks,

03:09:04.720 --> 03:09:10.000
[Guest]: whether these are sort of in different cities, there have been costs for local officials,

03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:15.440
[Guest]: which, you know, when I look at India, and again, I've not studied what's happened in India in that

03:09:15.440 --> 03:09:21.200
[Guest]: much detail at all, I've just lived it, I've not studied it. But I think that we've not seen those

03:09:21.200 --> 03:09:25.520
[Guest]: costs. And there are different, the system is very different, it's difficult to impose the

03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:30.400
[Guest]: nature of costs the Communist Party can, but that sort of shapes local incentives also to be able to

03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:34.240
[Guest]: do that. And at the same time, I think there have been quite a few times that publicly the Communist

03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:38.400
[Guest]: Party has said, don't falsify data. Now, you only say that, because you know, they're going to

03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:42.720
[Guest]: falsify. So that is a systemic issue, which continues. So I think, from a narrative point

03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:46.160
[Guest]: of view, I think there is a tremendous rewriting of history that's taken place. And I've tried to

03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:50.400
[Guest]: document that some of these statements that came out. But at the same time, what you see is that

03:09:50.960 --> 03:09:55.040
[Guest]: there is a tremendous amount of success that was achieved, as much as one may want to sort of

03:09:55.040 --> 03:10:00.400
[Guest]: discard that when we can't, you know, it came with lots of costs, it came with social costs,

03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:05.840
[Guest]: it came with cost to privacy, it came with cost to all of that. And again, that's a broader issue,

03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:09.520
[Guest]: which has affected different countries also, you know, whether it's social cost, privacy,

03:10:09.520 --> 03:10:14.320
[Guest]: like human costs, and all of that. But they've managed to limit that cost. And I think that

03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:19.360
[Guest]: is an important thing to take away. And that, to me, is there, is where they derive their source

03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:26.240
[Guest]: of confidence today. Because this detail of, you know, a rewriting of history from February 14 to

03:10:26.240 --> 03:10:31.840
[Guest]: January 7, this does matter, did matter at that point of time. But the fact that they have been

03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:37.840
[Guest]: successful in containing it, I don't think this anymore matters to people in China. It's a glitch

03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:42.960
[Guest]: in the thing, it's, they understand it, but it would be a case of look, but look at us and look

03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:47.840
[Guest]: at where the rest of the world is. I think that sort of then matters much more. In fact, that is

03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:51.760
[Amit Varma]: a sharp contrast between China and India, like, you know, that they didn't just do the narrative,

03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:56.640
[Amit Varma]: they also got some of the governance right, like at one point, you write about Beijing, quote,

03:10:56.640 --> 03:11:01.840
[Amit Varma]: by 24 June, official data showed that around 3.2 million people in the city had been tested.

03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:06.160
[Amit Varma]: It's important to note that these steps were adopted while the city had a total caseload

03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:12.160
[Amit Varma]: of just 256 infections between 11 June and 24 June. By early next month, the outbreak had been

03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:17.840
[Amit Varma]: effectively contained with the city reporting no new cases of infection as of 7 July. So again,

03:11:17.840 --> 03:11:22.480
[Amit Varma]: mind blowing success. And imagine if, you know, we had shown the same kind of dedication here and

03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:27.200
[Amit Varma]: say vaccinating people after vaccines were available. Now, a few sort of asides. One

03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:31.520
[Amit Varma]: aside, of course, is that what was he doing on January 7? Why don't we know this problem could

03:11:31.520 --> 03:11:36.960
[Amit Varma]: have been solved only if there was CCTV footage? Where was the CCTV footage? I'm sorry for the bad

03:11:36.960 --> 03:11:42.480
[Amit Varma]: pun, I had to get one out of the way. A couple of other pointers. One is you spoke about how

03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:47.760
[Amit Varma]: at the local level, because GDP is a metric, they are incentivized to make pointless infrastructure.

03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:52.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, I'd done an episode on GDP with the economist Rajeshwari Sengupta, link it from the

03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:59.200
[Amit Varma]: show notes. And our main peeve about the way GDP is measured is that government spending is included,

03:11:59.200 --> 03:12:04.960
[Amit Varma]: which means that you can just dig a ditch, fill it up, dig a ditch, fill it up, iterate endlessly,

03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:08.640
[Amit Varma]: and your GDP is growing, growing, growing, though nothing productive is being done.

03:12:08.640 --> 03:12:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, there's a huge opportunity cost to all this digging of ditches. So GDP is just

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:20.640
[Amit Varma]: a really easy metric to game as indeed any metric is once it becomes a target. The other sort of

03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:26.000
[Amit Varma]: resonance I found with India is that in populist rhetoric, there is a lot of identification with

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:30.240
[Amit Varma]: the cause of corruption. And you know, even in India around that time, in fact, the India

03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:34.800
[Amit Varma]: against corruption movement started. And the reason is logical because people feel it,

03:12:34.800 --> 03:12:40.400
[Amit Varma]: their everyday interface with the government involves corruption. So it's very easy to sort

03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:46.480
[Amit Varma]: of get them riled up on that basis. But the problem is that we often miss the core problem

03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:50.400
[Amit Varma]: of corruption. Like when India against corruption happened, I wrote a column saying Anna Hazare

03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:55.360
[Amit Varma]: missed the point entirely. Because the core reason that corruption exists is that the state has too

03:12:55.360 --> 03:13:00.720
[Amit Varma]: much power and discretion, right? The more you reduce power from areas where it should not have

03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:04.640
[Amit Varma]: power and discretion, the less corruption there will be. And instead, what these people were

03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:08.560
[Amit Varma]: proposing is that you have another committee called a Lokpal which sits on top of this and

03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:13.680
[Amit Varma]: you have another layer of government as if that will ever solve anything. You know, you never judge

03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:18.480
[Amit Varma]: a policy by its intentions, you do it by its outcome. But I can see why, you know, that would

03:13:18.480 --> 03:13:23.200
[Amit Varma]: have taken off in China. And it's pretty convenient for Xi Jinping, that he can at one level sit at

03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:28.960
[Amit Varma]: the center and spread the narrative or whatever the whole narrative of him being a benevolent

03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:33.920
[Amit Varma]: leader or the Garibi Hatao narrative. You know, there was a version of that as well,

03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:38.000
[Amit Varma]: while all the blame goes to the local government, because they are the direct interface with the

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:41.920
[Amit Varma]: people. And I wonder if there's a version of that happening in India, where no matter what happens,

03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:47.200
[Amit Varma]: there's a certain bunch of people who will not blame the Prime Minister or the central government

03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:51.440
[Amit Varma]: for it, you know, they'll either be completely apathetic and behave as if it is fate, or they

03:13:51.440 --> 03:13:57.280
[Amit Varma]: will find other excuses to wish it away. Now, in your second chapter, you also pointed out

03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:04.000
[Amit Varma]: an interesting thing about how the modes of messaging of the Chinese Communist Party changed,

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:09.040
[Amit Varma]: where you write, quote, While the indigestible stuff of stodgy propaganda, scouring through

03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:13.840
[Amit Varma]: which Pierre Rickmans once said was akin to swallowing sawdust by the bucketful, survives in

03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:18.880
[Amit Varma]: parts, there has been a significant evolution in terms of style and substance. Amidst the mountains

03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:24.160
[Amit Varma]: of cliches, flaccid speeches, hollow slogans and fanciful statistics exists today's slick graphics,

03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:30.160
[Amit Varma]: vivid storytelling, and online interactivity that seeks to enhance party-state responsiveness

03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:35.440
[Amit Varma]: to public demands, opinion and criticism, stop quote. And as you pointed out, propaganda has

03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:39.200
[Amit Varma]: always been a big part of the Communist Party, right, you know, the propaganda department

03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:45.200
[Amit Varma]: existed from the 1920s, and so on. But it was all this stodgy language the way you know, even in

03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:49.760
[Amit Varma]: India, the government press releases are written. Now, it seems to me that where we went in India,

03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:54.960
[Amit Varma]: as far as you know, official ways of controlling the narrative are concerned, is that the usual

03:14:54.960 --> 03:14:58.960
[Amit Varma]: government propaganda continued with the stodgy obfuscatory language, which doesn't really help

03:14:58.960 --> 03:15:06.080
[Amit Varma]: them, supported by an IT wing, which, you know, on social media, adopted extremely crude methods,

03:15:06.640 --> 03:15:12.320
[Amit Varma]: sometimes effective methods, but extremely crude methods of, you know, spreading false stories to

03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:17.680
[Amit Varma]: begin with, but also just abusing critics and blah, blah, blah, all of that. While it seems

03:15:17.680 --> 03:15:23.120
[Amit Varma]: that the Chinese move beyond that to something far more sophisticated, which comes from controlling

03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:28.640
[Amit Varma]: the media, which comes from, as you pointed out, you know, having some cutting edge storytelling,

03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:33.760
[Amit Varma]: that's also happening. And also, what you describe as quote, authoritarian participatory

03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:40.560
[Amit Varma]: persuasion 2.0, a term coined by Maria Repnikova and Fan Keqing, which is basically defined as

03:15:40.560 --> 03:15:45.360
[Amit Varma]: quote, the targets of propaganda are made into active collaborators in the process of recreating

03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:50.720
[Amit Varma]: pro party discourses online, stop quote. And I remember I once was chatting with Pratik Sinha

03:15:50.720 --> 03:15:56.320
[Amit Varma]: of Alt News. And this was before I did my episode with him a couple of years before that, I think

03:15:56.320 --> 03:16:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Nitin and I were chatting with him at this meet in Bangalore. And he mentioned a very interesting

03:16:01.200 --> 03:16:06.720
[Amit Varma]: story, he said that he was, there was this bit of fake news, which was fake news about some

03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:11.920
[Amit Varma]: particular person, I forget the details. So he, you know, did all the forensic work that he does

03:16:11.920 --> 03:16:16.960
[Amit Varma]: that Alt News is so incredibly good at. And they figured out that, you know, where it's coming from

03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:21.440
[Amit Varma]: and they publish the story with that guy's name and all that. And a little while later, he gets a

03:16:21.440 --> 03:16:26.960
[Amit Varma]: WhatsApp message or message from wherever, from that guy, who says, Bhaiya, can I talk to you?

03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:32.400
[Amit Varma]: So he says, okay, and he finds out this kid is some teenage kid. He has nothing to do with ITCEL,

03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:37.920
[Amit Varma]: nothing to do with any of that. He started this sort of news outlet, where he would make up

03:16:37.920 --> 03:16:43.360
[Amit Varma]: stories. And then it was natural selection, he would see that what gets hits, what doesn't get

03:16:43.360 --> 03:16:51.520
[Amit Varma]: hits. And what he found is that all the rabid Hindutva stuff got hits. And, you know, other stuff

03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:57.840
[Amit Varma]: won't get hits. And therefore, that's where the market is. And the point there being that the

03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:04.880
[Amit Varma]: ITCEL needs to do this kind of fake news, only to a certain extent. But once you kickstart something,

03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:09.520
[Amit Varma]: it takes some momentum of its own, like indeed, in the Sushant Singh Rajput conspiracy theories,

03:17:09.520 --> 03:17:14.000
[Amit Varma]: which are floating all over the place, which are insane. I mean, the earlier ones were that

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:18.720
[Amit Varma]: he invented 4G. So Akshay Kumar got him bumped off over the game. And then there was one that

03:17:18.720 --> 03:17:23.040
[Amit Varma]: he created the COVID vaccine. And so they got him bumped off because the government wanted COVID to

03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:28.000
[Amit Varma]: continue. And the version of that is that he created it for Bharat Biotech. But the most

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:33.440
[Amit Varma]: bizarre recent version, which I'll link that thread from the show notes, if it is still there,

03:17:33.440 --> 03:17:38.240
[Amit Varma]: is that he's still alive. Apparently, there is some quantum physics thing by which a person can

03:17:38.240 --> 03:17:43.440
[Amit Varma]: be split into two. So he split himself into two. So he could go into hiding to create the COVID

03:17:43.440 --> 03:17:48.400
[Amit Varma]: vaccine, and his duplicate got killed. And therefore, I think Yogi Adityanath is now

03:17:48.400 --> 03:17:53.120
[Amit Varma]: looking for him for some reason, some really incredibly bizarre thing. But I don't even know

03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:59.600
[Amit Varma]: why we went into this digression, authoritarian participatory persuasion 2.0. Now, the question

03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:03.840
[Amit Varma]: that kind of comes up, and these are really two questions, because I've rambled a bit.

03:18:03.840 --> 03:18:09.040
[Amit Varma]: One question is, tell me about this use of new media and how they will come to censorship later

03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:14.880
[Amit Varma]: censorship is how do you stop unwanted messages going out? But this is how do you propagate good

03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:19.600
[Amit Varma]: messages and get them going out? And how do you use the media for that? And the Chinese seem

03:18:19.600 --> 03:18:24.560
[Amit Varma]: fairly advanced in that. So tell me a bit about that. And the other supplementary very quick

03:18:24.560 --> 03:18:30.960
[Amit Varma]: question is that do you think that this sort of narrative that Xi Jinping has come up with,

03:18:30.960 --> 03:18:35.680
[Amit Varma]: which is essentially a populist narrative, right, nationalism, hatred of the outsider,

03:18:35.680 --> 03:18:41.760
[Amit Varma]: blah, blah, blah, it's a standard populist trope. Do you think that this populist trope is popular,

03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:47.200
[Amit Varma]: because it touches certain triggers in common people, and therefore, these are the narratives

03:18:47.200 --> 03:18:52.400
[Amit Varma]: that work? So in a sense that this behavior is not coming from the supply end of the market,

03:18:52.400 --> 03:18:58.560
[Guest]: but the demand end of the market? No, I don't. I mean, I think that it's a bit of both, right?

03:18:58.560 --> 03:19:03.520
[Guest]: That there is a demand that's being created. You know, there is a demand that's being nurtured.

03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:08.640
[Guest]: So that is one thing. And if you look at what Xi Jinping has done, and he's quite,

03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:14.000
[Guest]: somebody who's quite big on narrative setting and the role of the media, and not just the media,

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:18.240
[Guest]: I mean, he also talks about artists, you know, painters, sculptors, whoever else,

03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:24.320
[Guest]: even people, architects, the idea that you need to be doing things that they

03:19:24.320 --> 03:19:29.120
[Guest]: would sort of support the socialist idea and the socialist vision, and would support the party.

03:19:29.120 --> 03:19:33.520
[Guest]: And he wants sort of patriotic art and everything in that sense. With regard to the media, I think

03:19:33.520 --> 03:19:38.240
[Guest]: very early on, as soon as he took charge, he sort of spoke about reshaping the media in terms of

03:19:38.240 --> 03:19:42.720
[Guest]: telling China's stories well. You know, there's a certain story that we want to tell the outside

03:19:42.720 --> 03:19:47.600
[Guest]: world and to our own people, and we need to tell them well. One of the aspects of that is tell

03:19:47.600 --> 03:19:54.800
[Guest]: stories which have sort of a universal human appeal, or, you know, make what is our propaganda

03:19:54.800 --> 03:19:59.600
[Guest]: into much more, you know, widely, which has a greater appeal because it attaches to certain

03:19:59.600 --> 03:20:04.960
[Guest]: human values, rather than just saying that, you know, the party said this, the party did that.

03:20:04.960 --> 03:20:09.680
[Guest]: Now that stodgy propaganda still exists. And at one point in time, you spoke about

03:20:09.680 --> 03:20:14.480
[Guest]: Indian government press releases. Honestly, there is no comparison between Indian government press

03:20:14.480 --> 03:20:18.640
[Guest]: releases and Chinese government propaganda. Indian government, I mean, by the measure of,

03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:22.560
[Guest]: you know, Chinese government propaganda, Indian government press releases are

03:20:22.560 --> 03:20:30.480
[Guest]: very clear, very direct, honestly. If you read any government plan or reportage around a Chinese

03:20:30.480 --> 03:20:37.760
[Guest]: government plan, the first 30%, you'd be reading essentially repeated statements about, you know,

03:20:37.760 --> 03:20:44.560
[Guest]: the party, the ideology, Xi Jinping says this, you know, and, and that can, you know, be mind numbing.

03:20:44.560 --> 03:20:50.240
[Guest]: Now, what they have done along with this is that over the years, they've invested in sort of new

03:20:50.240 --> 03:20:56.880
[Guest]: media capabilities, they've invested in far more, they've sort of invested in capabilities to tell

03:20:56.880 --> 03:21:02.400
[Guest]: stories better in terms of the visual appeal in terms of the narrative. And at the end of

03:21:02.400 --> 03:21:07.840
[Guest]: particularly this, this episode in Wuhan, in late February, in fact, Wuhan was not even unlocked,

03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:13.520
[Guest]: they came up with a book, which is also published in English. And that was, you know, sold on

03:21:13.520 --> 03:21:18.160
[Guest]: Amazon. So I bought a copy on Amazon, I read through the book in English. And I quote some

03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:22.240
[Guest]: stories from the book. And one of the stories that I quote is about this one truck driver who's

03:21:22.240 --> 03:21:27.280
[Guest]: supposed to go. And if you read through the story, what you get a sense, I mean, to me, when I was

03:21:27.280 --> 03:21:32.480
[Guest]: reading the story, while I was reading that book, the character in my head was Salman Khan, you

03:21:32.480 --> 03:21:38.000
[Guest]: know, he's driving around, you know, on the truck. And I, to me, that was the case of, you know,

03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:42.400
[Guest]: that's how you're telling the story of, you know, somebody delivering a component to build a

03:21:42.400 --> 03:21:48.160
[Guest]: hospital in Wuhan, for COVID care, you know, and things like that. And throughout that, see,

03:21:48.160 --> 03:21:53.840
[Guest]: that entire book, you have these stories about, you know, people caring for a stranger, somebody's

03:21:53.840 --> 03:21:58.880
[Guest]: dedication to their job, somebody's sort of, you know, in this case, going into danger, but in

03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:03.200
[Guest]: another case, sort of just carrying out their routine job of making sure that things are

03:22:03.200 --> 03:22:08.560
[Guest]: cleaned, some lady somewhere in some other city crying, because she can't get in touch with her

03:22:08.560 --> 03:22:12.720
[Guest]: parents. And she manages to somehow get in touch with a restaurant and tells the restaurant to

03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:17.200
[Guest]: deliver food, and they deliver food. And the guy also tells her, don't worry, my sister,

03:22:17.200 --> 03:22:21.200
[Guest]: your parents are fine, and whatever, and I will take care. Now, those sorts of things have

03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:26.400
[Guest]: universal appeal. And they're doing two things. They're doing exactly what Repnikova is writing

03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:30.800
[Guest]: about, you know, and I'm a huge fan of her work. What she's writing about is essentially,

03:22:30.800 --> 03:22:35.520
[Guest]: that you've created a space where people who are reading this, people are telling these stories,

03:22:35.520 --> 03:22:42.720
[Guest]: people who are part of all of this, will look at it and say, yes, this was a shared tragedy,

03:22:42.720 --> 03:22:46.880
[Guest]: and we all were in it together and all our strength it took to come out of it. So it takes

03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:52.640
[Guest]: focus away from the government. At the same time, it's also telling the story of in these individual

03:22:52.640 --> 03:22:59.360
[Guest]: stories of heroism or whatever. There's also the hand of the government and the party all around.

03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:04.000
[Guest]: Because a lot of the times in these sort of stories, what you'll find is that, that fellow

03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:10.400
[Guest]: who was doing this heroic deed was a party carder. It's very subtle there. Or it was that fireman who

03:23:10.400 --> 03:23:15.040
[Guest]: did this or you know, and I mean, when we look at India or anywhere else in the world, this narrative

03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:19.440
[Guest]: got, you know, in India, you saw this somewhere, right? Criticism got conflated with how can you

03:23:19.440 --> 03:23:25.280
[Guest]: criticize our Corona warriors, that sort of logic. And that conflation is also happening over there.

03:23:25.280 --> 03:23:29.520
[Guest]: At the same time, the way the story is told, the idea is to appeal to your heartstrings so that

03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:34.960
[Guest]: you feel and if you feel empathy, you can sort of really say, you know, you don't sort of go

03:23:34.960 --> 03:23:39.440
[Guest]: and criticize as much. So that's one thing. Domestically, the idea is you build that sort

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:43.520
[Guest]: of sense of community and empathy, that we were all in this together, it was unprecedented,

03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:49.120
[Guest]: whatever. In terms of visually, if any, if anybody, if any of the listeners would want to go,

03:23:49.120 --> 03:23:53.280
[Guest]: you can go to YouTube, and you can see some of the documentaries that CCTV, CGTN,

03:23:53.280 --> 03:23:57.920
[Guest]: and CCTV put together with regard to Wuhan. They are absolutely cutting edge.

03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:06.320
[Guest]: From those wonderful drone shots of a silent city, to sort of the close ups of doctors, to sort of

03:24:06.320 --> 03:24:13.200
[Guest]: how the camera moves and cuts. It's not a bland telling a story, it will move you, whatever you

03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:18.640
[Guest]: may end up believing or not believing, however critical you may be about the Chinese. The

03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:26.240
[Guest]: humanizing of the system, the people and all of that, it softens the edge of political division

03:24:27.120 --> 03:24:32.720
[Guest]: at home and abroad. And I think that's part of what the narrative is like, what the approach is,

03:24:32.720 --> 03:24:37.440
[Guest]: you know, you want to tell China's stories well in that way. The other part of it is to also say

03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:41.760
[Guest]: how the system delivered, you know, through the people, you're also talking about how the system

03:24:41.760 --> 03:24:45.600
[Guest]: operated and how it functioned well and how it delivered, which again, is useful for legitimacy

03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:51.520
[Guest]: abroad and legitimacy at home. And I think that's sort of where this entire, and if you saw this

03:24:51.520 --> 03:24:57.280
[Guest]: about 10-12 years ago, it was not this well, you know, I mean, again, it's looking at how

03:24:58.080 --> 03:25:04.320
[Guest]: changed graphics and changed storytelling style can make a story much more effective and appealing

03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:08.400
[Guest]: to somebody. You look at just how movies have evolved over the last 15 years to today.

03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:12.640
[Guest]: And there's a huge difference in how Chinese, just, if you look at India, you'll see the

03:25:12.640 --> 03:25:16.640
[Guest]: difference. If you look at China, you'll see the difference. What's important is that Chinese state

03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:25.360
[Guest]: media led by the party has invested in that. It's invested in not just creating these narratives,

03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:30.480
[Guest]: but also creating, you know, new media tools. One example that I give in the book later on,

03:25:30.480 --> 03:25:35.600
[Guest]: one of the chapters is about this graphic with regard to racism in America that the people

03:25:35.600 --> 03:25:40.160
[Guest]: daily put out. It's stuff like that. They created a, you know, again, this is not journalism,

03:25:40.160 --> 03:25:46.080
[Guest]: but you created a video with sort of gamified version of Mike Pompeo having to cross different

03:25:46.080 --> 03:25:51.360
[Guest]: levels. And Mike Pompeo talks about the Chinese Communist Party failing. And it's like wrong

03:25:51.360 --> 03:25:56.960
[Guest]: answer. He talks about the virus leaking from a lab or being a bio warfare weapon, whatever,

03:25:56.960 --> 03:26:02.000
[Guest]: and wrong answer and three wrongs and you're out. It's like a video game that you've created

03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:06.160
[Guest]: as a video, because you know that that is the kind of stuff that will get more traction on

03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:13.680
[Guest]: social media. Then some stodgy old guy sitting in a black suit with gray hair saying, we don't agree

03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:18.960
[Guest]: with this. These hegemonic Americans are wrong and whatever. So you're looking at what works

03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:24.240
[Guest]: and you're trying to use that. And that's part of this, you know, so firstly, you're using the

03:26:24.240 --> 03:26:29.200
[Guest]: community and their stories to be able to further your narrative. At the same time, you're developing

03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:34.640
[Guest]: these new cutting edge tools relying on technology using moviemaking tools and everything to try and

03:26:34.640 --> 03:26:39.600
[Guest]: tell your stories in a form of in a fashion that will appeal emotionally to people which sort of

03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:44.160
[Guest]: takes off the edge of a lot of the criticism. And I think that's really smart strategy.

03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:51.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, the graphic you mentioned about Black Lives Matter is also struck out. I'll read that

03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:56.480
[Amit Varma]: sentence out because I found the image quite amusing. Quote, the party's flagship paper also

03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:01.680
[Amit Varma]: put out a controversial graphic titled Disguise of Human Rights, depicting a police officer breaking

03:27:01.680 --> 03:27:05.920
[Amit Varma]: through the robes of the Statue of Liberty, towering over a bloodstained White House,

03:27:05.920 --> 03:27:10.720
[Amit Varma]: crushing what appears to be the neck of an African American man, stop quote, basically packing

03:27:10.720 --> 03:27:16.880
[Amit Varma]: everything together. This seems to be as crude a graphic as say, you know, all those photoshopped

03:27:16.880 --> 03:27:23.600
[Amit Varma]: images of Nehru partying with various women and all of that. But but yeah, I get your point about

03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:30.800
[Amit Varma]: the increasing sophistication of a lot of this propaganda from these modern day Lenny Reifenstahl

03:27:30.800 --> 03:27:36.400
[Amit Varma]: as it were. And by the way, the truck driver whose role you want Salman Khan to play his name

03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:42.720
[Amit Varma]: is Sun Yang. So it's almost similar like Salman and Sun Yang. Now, you know, this is one aspect,

03:27:42.720 --> 03:27:46.640
[Amit Varma]: you have a message, you want to get it out. Another aspect is there is a message out there,

03:27:46.640 --> 03:27:52.160
[Amit Varma]: you want to stop it. Now, as you've described that social media was actually very vibrant

03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:57.040
[Amit Varma]: in exposing what was happening in Wuhan, exposing where government response was wrong,

03:27:57.040 --> 03:28:01.280
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. And initially, it was just allowed to be vibrant, and all this was allowed

03:28:01.280 --> 03:28:07.120
[Amit Varma]: to play out. And then the party kind of cracked down hard, and there was a hard censorship. And

03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:10.560
[Amit Varma]: some of it reminded me of, you know, what's happening in Uttar Pradesh, where also you're

03:28:10.560 --> 03:28:16.880
[Amit Varma]: not allowed to complain about oxygen cylinders not being there. Or, you know, if you tweet a video of,

03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:21.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, a police officer taking away your cylinder to give it to a well connected guy,

03:28:21.840 --> 03:28:25.920
[Amit Varma]: when you know, and there was a case like that where someone's relative was ill, he went way

03:28:25.920 --> 03:28:30.160
[Amit Varma]: out of his way, we spent a big chunk of his savings, got oxygen for the relative, and then

03:28:30.160 --> 03:28:35.280
[Amit Varma]: a cop comes and takes it over because, you know, for somebody else. And the person who tweeted that

03:28:35.280 --> 03:28:40.640
[Amit Varma]: I think had a case filed on him or something insane shit like that happening in UP and China.

03:28:40.640 --> 03:28:46.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this sort of censorship, like your chapter on that is very

03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:51.680
[Amit Varma]: evocatively titled, imposing amnesia, which is a lovely title. So tell me a little bit about how

03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:57.840
[Amit Varma]: they went about doing this. And as you crack down on people's freedom of expression, you have to

03:28:57.840 --> 03:29:01.600
[Amit Varma]: control the narrative about that as well. So how was all of this playing out?

03:29:02.240 --> 03:29:05.680
[Guest]: Right. So I think this is something that the Communist Party has a tremendous amount of

03:29:05.680 --> 03:29:11.120
[Guest]: experience in doing, you know, if you go back to sort of Bill Clinton, saying that, you know,

03:29:11.120 --> 03:29:15.360
[Guest]: let's see the nail jello to the wall, when the internet was sort of evolving and social media

03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:20.080
[Guest]: was evolving, they clearly figured out an algorithm to nail jello to the wall. And this

03:29:20.080 --> 03:29:26.080
[Guest]: was an example of that. Now, towards the beginning of what was happening again, I mean, we don't know

03:29:26.080 --> 03:29:33.120
[Guest]: exactly why there was freedom of expression for the first week or 10 days or so. And, you know,

03:29:33.120 --> 03:29:36.240
[Guest]: but we do know that there were directives that came out at a certain point of time, which a

03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:42.160
[Guest]: document has to and then the crackdown sort of begins. But initially, there is freedom. Now,

03:29:43.200 --> 03:29:48.640
[Guest]: there are different ways of looking at this. One is that, look, it was Chinese New Year,

03:29:48.640 --> 03:29:54.080
[Guest]: the censors were on a break, they were chilling, who knows. The other way to look at this is also

03:29:54.080 --> 03:30:01.760
[Guest]: the fact that it's useful to have people went because particularly if you're having if you

03:30:01.760 --> 03:30:07.600
[Guest]: have this dynamic, where the central leadership does not know what's going on in a region,

03:30:08.240 --> 03:30:12.800
[Guest]: particularly as you've imposed this lockdown or whatever, this is a great feedback mechanism also.

03:30:13.920 --> 03:30:18.240
[Guest]: And Maria Repnikova again talks about this in her work, where she talks about using this as

03:30:18.240 --> 03:30:22.160
[Guest]: feedback to be able to do certain things that you might want to do, particularly when you're trying

03:30:22.160 --> 03:30:27.600
[Guest]: to push and pull with the center and local leadership continues. There's a wonderful old

03:30:27.600 --> 03:30:32.720
[Guest]: saying in China that the emperor is far away and the mountains are high and so forth. So, you know,

03:30:32.720 --> 03:30:36.960
[Guest]: it's, you know, local stuff, local guys can get away with a lot of things. And therefore this,

03:30:36.960 --> 03:30:41.920
[Guest]: I think the Chinese Communist Party central leadership over the decades has used social

03:30:41.920 --> 03:30:47.280
[Guest]: media as a feedback mechanism with regard to its policy priorities with regard to keeping a check

03:30:47.280 --> 03:30:53.040
[Guest]: on local leadership. And I think my hunch is that this is what was going on in those early days,

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:57.760
[Guest]: where they were trying to do this, while also providing a wall for people to vent,

03:30:58.320 --> 03:31:03.440
[Guest]: because people needed to vent, you couldn't just let that be. But as you sort of came to grips

03:31:03.440 --> 03:31:08.480
[Guest]: with things, or as you felt that the challenge is going to be much more problematic, you sort

03:31:08.480 --> 03:31:12.880
[Guest]: of start to crack down, either which way, and I don't know which way it went, whether they felt

03:31:12.880 --> 03:31:16.240
[Guest]: more comfortable or whether they felt more uncomfortable. And that is why they cracked

03:31:16.240 --> 03:31:21.520
[Guest]: down. But at a certain point in early February, they start to sort of shut down. And that happens.

03:31:21.520 --> 03:31:26.880
[Guest]: Now, in that duration, what we see is that, and this is again, a credit to a lot of the Chinese

03:31:26.880 --> 03:31:31.840
[Guest]: journalists, when we're talking about my time in China, I was talking about how the pressures that

03:31:31.840 --> 03:31:37.600
[Guest]: some of those people working over there are really, really incredible. And I have a lot of regard for

03:31:37.600 --> 03:31:43.840
[Guest]: that. And when you what you see in those few weeks, when things are open, you see the kind

03:31:43.840 --> 03:31:49.840
[Guest]: of reports which today, particularly after the second wave in India, I think a lot of us can

03:31:49.840 --> 03:31:54.800
[Guest]: empathize much more with, you know, the fact that there is there is no hospital facility,

03:31:54.800 --> 03:31:59.840
[Guest]: the fact that there is a lockdown, how do you go to the hospital, the fact that and a lot of those

03:31:59.840 --> 03:32:03.920
[Guest]: reports, which are saved by some of these, some of the sort of journalists and researchers,

03:32:03.920 --> 03:32:08.000
[Guest]: which who documented them and then save them as the censors, eventually started wiping the system

03:32:08.000 --> 03:32:13.040
[Guest]: clean. Again, it's a really risky job that they've done to do that, to be able to save all of this.

03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:18.480
[Guest]: And it's a service to people like the world that they've actually saved some of these documentation.

03:32:18.480 --> 03:32:24.880
[Guest]: But if you read through those stories, you will see the kind of chaos in the system that existed,

03:32:24.880 --> 03:32:31.920
[Guest]: which I mean, when second wave started in India, to me, that is what it looked like, not so much

03:32:31.920 --> 03:32:36.880
[Guest]: the first wave in India, because capacity was a problem, but it wasn't that bad or that dire,

03:32:36.880 --> 03:32:41.840
[Guest]: at least in our cities. Today, what we saw in the second wave, to me is very reminiscent of when I

03:32:41.840 --> 03:32:46.160
[Guest]: read those stories from Wuhan, that's exactly what was playing out over there. And I think that's the

03:32:46.160 --> 03:32:51.760
[Guest]: first thing that the censors eventually started cleaning that stuff up. To me, it's highly likely

03:32:51.760 --> 03:32:56.400
[Guest]: that the government felt that it has started to understand what needs to be done. What we saw was

03:32:56.400 --> 03:32:59.920
[Guest]: that they were shifting the narrative towards a positive domain where they were showing us the

03:32:59.920 --> 03:33:05.360
[Guest]: two hospitals being built, there was live streaming of the entire process of the hospital being built.

03:33:05.360 --> 03:33:10.080
[Guest]: And that was a sort of showcase of Chinese engineering prowess. While at the same time,

03:33:10.080 --> 03:33:16.640
[Guest]: you were starting to sort of clean up some of the dissent, anger, frustration that existed,

03:33:16.640 --> 03:33:21.360
[Guest]: and the reports of misgovernance, systemic failures, and all of that, after a certain

03:33:21.360 --> 03:33:26.560
[Guest]: period of time, because you felt probably that you were now in control. And as that remained,

03:33:26.560 --> 03:33:30.400
[Guest]: it would challenge the party's narrative going forward, that had managed to control

03:33:30.400 --> 03:33:36.640
[Guest]: things effectively. So I think that sort of went hand in hand. Therefore, anybody who sort of ended

03:33:36.640 --> 03:33:41.600
[Guest]: up going and challenging the narrative that the party then wanted to build, whether it was citizen

03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:46.240
[Guest]: journalists, whether it was lawyers, whether it was whoever, they were all picked up. They were

03:33:46.240 --> 03:33:54.320
[Guest]: all then charged with this infuriating crime of spreading rumors. And again, such an amorphous

03:33:54.320 --> 03:33:59.120
[Guest]: sort of nebulous concept that anything you can be charged under that sort of logic.

03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:04.640
[Guest]: And they were all picked up under that, while the people who were originally charged, like you

03:34:04.640 --> 03:34:09.920
[Guest]: identified, those eight doctors, they were then exonerated. At a certain point of time, I think

03:34:09.920 --> 03:34:16.640
[Guest]: there was genuine worry, particularly when Dr. Li Wenliang, who became the icon for the criticism

03:34:16.640 --> 03:34:21.440
[Guest]: and for the punishment that he dealt with, then eventually passed away in early February.

03:34:21.440 --> 03:34:25.280
[Guest]: For that brief moment, you could see that the system was really struggling to deal with the

03:34:25.280 --> 03:34:30.800
[Guest]: narrative online, because there were so many tributes, people were bypassing censorship.

03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:34.960
[Guest]: And again, there's a cat and mouse game that goes on in China, which a lot of the people online are

03:34:34.960 --> 03:34:40.640
[Guest]: quite familiar with. And some of the examples that I document about how they've saved some stories,

03:34:40.640 --> 03:34:45.120
[Guest]: how they've said stories using emoticons, using different language and things like that,

03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:48.720
[Guest]: or saving sort of narratives to PDF so that they last for posterity.

03:34:48.720 --> 03:34:53.440
[Guest]: And I think from the Chinese government's point of view, the case was that after they gained a

03:34:53.440 --> 03:34:57.440
[Guest]: certain degree of control, and this was my best case assumption as to what they did,

03:34:57.440 --> 03:35:04.880
[Guest]: their approach was, can we make sure that a certain degree of space for venting may remain,

03:35:04.880 --> 03:35:10.080
[Guest]: but it has to be within prescribed limits. But at no point, the narrative of the government's

03:35:10.080 --> 03:35:15.840
[Guest]: control, efficiency, and ability to respond to this sustained. So you may criticize local

03:35:15.840 --> 03:35:20.720
[Guest]: officials, you may criticize all of that, but you don't necessarily criticize the central

03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:24.960
[Guest]: leadership. Now, the one sort of thing, and I sort of see a parallel between what you were

03:35:24.960 --> 03:35:31.520
[Guest]: talking about India, that little boy that you were talking about, you can't really ride the

03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:37.360
[Guest]: tiger and eventually just expect to get off without it being challenging. So what we've seen is that

03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:43.760
[Guest]: the narrative of nationalism eventually starts to gather its own sort of pace and steam.

03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:48.880
[Guest]: So in the book, I talk about Fang Fang and her writings. And I even mentioned that at a certain

03:35:48.880 --> 03:35:53.760
[Guest]: point of time, she is not challenging the central government. She at a certain point of time

03:35:53.760 --> 03:35:58.240
[Guest]: actually says that, oh, now that these guys have gotten in charge, things might be better off.

03:35:58.240 --> 03:36:01.760
[Guest]: In that she actually supports the narrative that the local government sort of failed,

03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:05.120
[Guest]: and the central government is better off and whatever, or at least that belief that they

03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:11.120
[Guest]: will take care of things better. Yet there is tremendous nationalistic pushback against her.

03:36:11.120 --> 03:36:14.960
[Guest]: And Chinese media struggles with that. Global Times, which is this nationalist

03:36:14.960 --> 03:36:18.800
[Guest]: tabloid struggles with that at some level, and eventually gives in to the nationalistic

03:36:18.800 --> 03:36:24.320
[Guest]: sentiment. And today, if I just take a go away from the book just today, in the last month,

03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:28.800
[Guest]: what we have, month, month and a half, what we have seen is that the nationalistic narrative

03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:34.560
[Guest]: on social media in China has become so strong that even its most nationalistic papers are sort

03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:40.240
[Guest]: of struggling to contain it. And an example is of, about a month ago, there was a controversy about a

03:36:40.240 --> 03:36:46.000
[Guest]: communist party-linked affiliated social media account, Weibo account, publishing a very crude

03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:52.240
[Guest]: graphic showing funeral pyres in India, and showing the building of the Hoshen Shan Hospital

03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:57.840
[Guest]: in China. No, sorry, not the hospital. That was about showing the Chinese rocket launch and talking

03:36:57.840 --> 03:37:04.800
[Guest]: about how progress and whatever in India and China. And another one was about fire in India,

03:37:04.800 --> 03:37:12.000
[Guest]: fire in China, Hoshen Shan, sort of fire mountain hospital. So the idea is that that was a post put

03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:19.600
[Guest]: out by a party unit, party unit Weibo account. It was eventually taken down. Yet a lot of people

03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:23.040
[Guest]: supported that. A lot of people obviously criticized it also and called it crude,

03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:28.880
[Guest]: crass, whatever in Chinese. But there was a nationalistic strand which supported that idea,

03:37:28.880 --> 03:37:33.200
[Guest]: some even fairly prominent people. And there's an argument that goes on between Fudan University

03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:38.560
[Guest]: Professor Shen Yi and Global Times' editor Hu Shijin, where Hu Shijin is saying, we shouldn't

03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:42.960
[Guest]: be doing this. Through official accounts, we shouldn't be doing this. And Global Times

03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:50.480
[Guest]: reporters on Twitter were critical of such posts. And they were getting eaten up by the nationalist

03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:56.640
[Guest]: sort of brigade in China. So, you know, these things can gather momentum of their own and,

03:37:56.640 --> 03:38:00.560
[Guest]: you know, for anybody, whether it's in India, whether it's in China, you need to be careful.

03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:06.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, even in India, you have these, you know, civil wars

03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:10.800
[Amit Varma]: within Hindutva. You know, if you just Google trads versus raitas, for example, you'll come

03:38:10.800 --> 03:38:14.960
[Amit Varma]: across them. And there are people who are saying that Modi has led the Hindus down, he's not

03:38:15.760 --> 03:38:21.280
[Amit Varma]: sufficiently nationalistic for them. And this is always what happens. I think what social media

03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:26.240
[Amit Varma]: also exacerbates is, it drives people to the extremes, because everybody is, you know,

03:38:26.240 --> 03:38:31.360
[Amit Varma]: posturing their own purity, attacking other people for not being pure enough. And ultimately,

03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:36.640
[Amit Varma]: the fringes win until the whole thing cannot hold. And this happens, by the way, both on the

03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:41.600
[Amit Varma]: left and the right. It's not just the right. Now, a couple of interesting things I'll refer back to.

03:38:42.240 --> 03:38:46.560
[Amit Varma]: One, speaking of Stephen Young, the doctor who died, you have this, this very interesting

03:38:46.560 --> 03:38:51.120
[Amit Varma]: narrative where he dies, the news that he's died is reported, then it's immediately taken offline,

03:38:51.120 --> 03:38:54.560
[Amit Varma]: as if the government is trying to figure out that, you know, how do we deal with this,

03:38:54.560 --> 03:38:58.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, in terms of story arc and all of that. And there's this great line you have in your book,

03:38:58.720 --> 03:39:03.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote, Al Jazeera cited an unidentified source from Wuhan Central Hospital saying that

03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:08.800
[Amit Varma]: Lee's condition was critical. And he stopped the heartbeat earlier tonight already. But he was put

03:39:08.800 --> 03:39:14.640
[Amit Varma]: on intubation and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, just out of pressure from the

03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:19.120
[Amit Varma]: leaders. Stop quote. So basically, the guy is dead. But then the leaders say no, no, keep him

03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:23.280
[Amit Varma]: alive. And they put him on ventilator and all that basically put the body on ventilator and all that,

03:39:23.280 --> 03:39:29.600
[Amit Varma]: which is crazy. What you've also pointed out is that all these pieces, which were taken down,

03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:33.760
[Amit Varma]: were censored, and so on. People have made different positories of them. There's an

03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:40.160
[Amit Varma]: ENCOV memory repository. There's Terminus 2049, which is a GitHub repository. I think you pointed

03:39:40.160 --> 03:39:44.160
[Amit Varma]: out how the creator of that got into a little bit of trouble. And I really enjoyed what you

03:39:44.160 --> 03:39:50.800
[Amit Varma]: reproduced of Fang Fang's diary entries, and which are now available as a book, which I've just picked

03:39:50.800 --> 03:39:54.320
[Amit Varma]: up, but haven't yet read. It's a book in English. I mean, which is why I picked it up, the English

03:39:54.320 --> 03:40:01.680
[Amit Varma]: version is out. Now, Fang Fang was a writer who between Jan 25 and March 24, wrote a quarantine

03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:07.040
[Amit Varma]: diary. And some of it is beautiful writing like this excerpt that you reproduced, quote,

03:40:07.040 --> 03:40:12.080
[Amit Varma]: the city isn't the purgatory that a lot of people seem to be imagining it to be. It is instead,

03:40:12.080 --> 03:40:17.360
[Amit Varma]: a rather quiet and beautiful, almost majestic city. But all that changes the second someone

03:40:17.360 --> 03:40:23.200
[Amit Varma]: in your family falls ill. Immediately everything is thrown into chaos. Stop quote. And later on,

03:40:23.200 --> 03:40:27.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, again, I'm finding an India connection here in terms of who she reminds me of,

03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:33.120
[Amit Varma]: you quote Hemant Adlaka writing about her quote, in a series of articles, commentaries and blogs,

03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:38.240
[Amit Varma]: on average five to six write ups a day, mainly carried by a few Maoist leaning websites and

03:40:38.240 --> 03:40:43.760
[Amit Varma]: blogs. Wuhan diary, which is a diary has not only been dismissed as trash and nothing but a pack of

03:40:43.760 --> 03:40:49.600
[Amit Varma]: lies. Fang Fang herself too has been targeted as dishonest, writer of petty bourgeois character,

03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:54.160
[Amit Varma]: and only cares for cheap publicity, stop quote. And I instantly thought of the kind of criticism

03:40:54.160 --> 03:40:59.440
[Amit Varma]: that Barkha Dutt did during her superb journalism, where people accused her of preying on the dead,

03:40:59.440 --> 03:41:03.600
[Amit Varma]: because she was showing images of the funeral pyres and all that, except that, you know,

03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:08.000
[Amit Varma]: they called her anti national, but I guess the Chinese version of that is petty bourgeois.

03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:14.160
[Amit Varma]: So again, has such resonance. Now tell me also about like, this is an internal narrative,

03:41:14.160 --> 03:41:18.400
[Amit Varma]: this is what they're doing inside. You've also written about what they try to do to control

03:41:18.400 --> 03:41:24.800
[Amit Varma]: the narrative outside, including set up these 1000s of fake Twitter accounts, and you know,

03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:28.400
[Amit Varma]: spend a lot of money on Facebook promotions. And I think Twitter banned a whole bunch of

03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:33.600
[Amit Varma]: accounts set up by the Chinese for the propaganda and all of that, which shows that at least there,

03:41:33.600 --> 03:41:37.680
[Amit Varma]: they hadn't at that time reached a certain level of sophistication where that would,

03:41:38.400 --> 03:41:43.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, not happen. So tell me a little bit about their attempts at controlling the narrative

03:41:43.440 --> 03:41:48.480
[Guest]: outside. Yeah, I think that attempts at sort of shaping the narrative outside is essentially been

03:41:48.480 --> 03:41:54.640
[Guest]: about how the world perceives what the party did in Wuhan, and subsequently. So by the end of

03:41:54.640 --> 03:42:00.000
[Guest]: February, the Communist Party is fairly comfortable with what's happening in Wuhan, and they seem to

03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:05.120
[Guest]: have a grip on it. They've also incentivized tremendous production capacity with regard to

03:42:05.120 --> 03:42:09.840
[Guest]: masks and the rest of it. And by sort of, you know, end of February, I think Wang Yi, the foreign

03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:14.400
[Guest]: minister has a conversation with his Iranian counterpart and his Italian counterpart. And he's

03:42:14.400 --> 03:42:18.960
[Guest]: already talking about, look, don't worry, we support you, because we've got this capacity.

03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:24.320
[Guest]: And by March, you see them starting to export a tremendous amount, you know, beginning to sort of

03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:29.120
[Guest]: export these things. So how the narrative sort of starts to shift is that they start to initially

03:42:29.120 --> 03:42:34.160
[Guest]: when sort of outbreak happens, there's a focus on, of course, how sudden this is how nobody knew

03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:39.680
[Guest]: how this is unprecedented and the rest of it, and how they've done a good job at actually

03:42:39.680 --> 03:42:44.320
[Guest]: controlling it. Along with that, there's a sort of emphasis on how they've been transparent about

03:42:44.320 --> 03:42:48.560
[Guest]: it from day one, which I think is a fight that they are fighting even today with the Americans

03:42:48.560 --> 03:42:54.160
[Guest]: and others about the level of transparency. The third narrative was with regard to look,

03:42:54.800 --> 03:42:59.680
[Guest]: you should be thankful to us that we've sacrificed the city and a province and much more to be able

03:42:59.680 --> 03:43:05.200
[Guest]: to contain this threat within our borders. So instead of criticizing us for delayed action,

03:43:05.200 --> 03:43:10.160
[Guest]: you should be thankful to us that you know, we've sacrificed ourselves to save the rest of you lot.

03:43:10.160 --> 03:43:15.040
[Guest]: And of course, subsequently, it comes down to look, it's our manufacturing capacity,

03:43:15.040 --> 03:43:19.440
[Guest]: it's our organizational capacity, it's all of that, that's now helping you lot.

03:43:19.440 --> 03:43:25.200
[Guest]: So don't politicize this virus. It's an enemy of mankind, whatever. Now to push all of this. Now,

03:43:25.200 --> 03:43:28.320
[Guest]: this is a good bit of the narrative that I've spoken about. There's an ugly bit about the

03:43:28.320 --> 03:43:32.960
[Guest]: narrative also. To push all of this along with the ugly bit they sort of created, there was

03:43:32.960 --> 03:43:38.640
[Guest]: obviously an organic movement of how the media acted. And then you've got bots and, you know,

03:43:38.640 --> 03:43:43.680
[Guest]: creations, which are, you know, accounts, which are sort of amplifying this narrative on social

03:43:43.680 --> 03:43:48.720
[Guest]: media. And the objective is to basically, like I said, try and create an environment in the West,

03:43:48.720 --> 03:43:53.840
[Guest]: which is not the rest of the world, which looks at China with, which looks at China with empathy

03:43:53.840 --> 03:43:59.520
[Guest]: and in some degrees respect, you know, or the party with empathy and respect. And subsequently,

03:43:59.520 --> 03:44:06.000
[Guest]: I think even they even talk about awe, because, look, we managed to contain it, whereas the mighty

03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:09.760
[Guest]: Americans and the rest of these other countries have sort of struggled and whatever. And I think

03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:15.520
[Guest]: that's part of the entire process. They've used obviously media, social media, official sort of

03:44:15.520 --> 03:44:20.880
[Guest]: statements, engagements with world leaders, as they started delivering products to other parts

03:44:20.880 --> 03:44:26.000
[Guest]: of the world. There was a lot of fanfare with which these products were delivered. And some

03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:30.080
[Guest]: of this is obviously leaders in different parts of the world seeing their incentives, for example,

03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:35.440
[Guest]: in Serbia. But in other cases, it also rubbed people the wrong way, because they tried to push

03:44:35.440 --> 03:44:40.400
[Guest]: their narrative to the detriment of, say, the European Union's cohesion, which I document in

03:44:40.400 --> 03:44:46.080
[Guest]: the book also. But to me, a lot of this was done essentially to shape a positive external narrative,

03:44:46.080 --> 03:44:51.840
[Guest]: but also to shape a domestic narrative about, look, this is how good we were, this is how strong the

03:44:51.840 --> 03:44:57.600
[Guest]: party was. It not just contained things. Firstly, what it did was unprecedented, we had to do it.

03:44:57.600 --> 03:45:02.160
[Guest]: Secondly, it's effective, we've managed to contain it. Thirdly, look at the rest of the world,

03:45:02.160 --> 03:45:06.320
[Guest]: they are now dependent on us, we are doing these things for them. So don't sort of criticize us.

03:45:06.320 --> 03:45:12.000
[Guest]: So it sort of works both ways. Externally, this sort of push of narrative also hurt them eventually

03:45:12.000 --> 03:45:16.160
[Guest]: in the long run, which is what I document in the book. The sort of ugly part of the narrative was

03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:20.640
[Guest]: when this controversy around the origins of the virus sort of become more prominent,

03:45:20.640 --> 03:45:24.720
[Guest]: where the Chinese engage in tremendous amount of disinformation themselves. The American

03:45:24.720 --> 03:45:29.280
[Guest]: administration doesn't sort of hold up well, of course. I mean, Pompeo and Trump don't hold up

03:45:29.280 --> 03:45:34.080
[Guest]: well. And I document this, they sort of flip flop quite a bit with regard to saying that we have

03:45:34.080 --> 03:45:38.160
[Guest]: evidence, okay, we don't have evidence. At a certain point, even the Office of Director of

03:45:38.160 --> 03:45:45.440
[Guest]: National Intelligence of the US expressly says that this virus is not manmade. So I think some

03:45:45.440 --> 03:45:51.440
[Guest]: of that gets lost in all the controversy that we've seen even today, but last year, in terms of

03:45:51.440 --> 03:45:56.480
[Guest]: what the Chinese wanted to achieve with this narrative, and they get even more aggressive

03:45:56.480 --> 03:46:03.760
[Guest]: as this happens. Part of it, again, is for domestic interest to quell doubts domestically.

03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:09.600
[Guest]: And so the sort of suspicion that this could be sort of American biological warfare and those

03:46:09.600 --> 03:46:14.400
[Guest]: sorts of things, so that you sort of divert attention. At the same time, it's also

03:46:14.400 --> 03:46:19.520
[Guest]: internationally to try and push back. And the Chinese tend to get, the Chinese diplomats get

03:46:19.520 --> 03:46:23.840
[Guest]: very aggressive with this, which becomes, you know, the phrase wolf warrior diplomacy sort of

03:46:23.840 --> 03:46:29.200
[Guest]: comes into play in all of this. The one more component of this, and this was seen in early

03:46:29.200 --> 03:46:34.400
[Guest]: days, particularly, and I guess even today, there's a strand of this that exists. But early

03:46:34.400 --> 03:46:39.920
[Guest]: days, it was much more prominent, was that any criticism of the Communist Party, or of China's

03:46:39.920 --> 03:46:48.160
[Guest]: handling of this outbreak, they conflated that along with legitimate concerns of racism in other

03:46:48.160 --> 03:46:52.560
[Guest]: parts of the world. So obviously, lots of Asian Americans, people of Chinese descent, there was

03:46:52.560 --> 03:46:57.680
[Guest]: lots of racism, which I again document in the book, which is a failing of those countries where

03:46:57.680 --> 03:47:02.800
[Guest]: this is happening. But what the Communist Party does is that it picks up those strands, and it

03:47:02.800 --> 03:47:07.520
[Guest]: sort of conflates that with China's sort of the Communist Party's actions with regard to the

03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:14.080
[Guest]: pandemic. And under the guise of that criticism, it starts to talk about any criticism of the

03:47:14.080 --> 03:47:19.520
[Guest]: Communist Party is seen as you know, the criticism of as soon as racist attack, and that conflation

03:47:20.160 --> 03:47:24.960
[Guest]: is problematic. But they do that deliberately, with the idea that, you know, to sort of stem

03:47:24.960 --> 03:47:30.480
[Guest]: critical voices. And that, to me, was again, something that, particularly in the West,

03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:34.640
[Guest]: it's important for people to realize when, you know, when racism in the West sort of

03:47:35.200 --> 03:47:40.960
[Guest]: rears its ugly head, it empowers this discourse from the Communist Party of China.

03:47:41.520 --> 03:47:47.040
[Guest]: At the same time, Chinese diplomats, and some of them, they sort of cross all levels of

03:47:47.040 --> 03:47:54.480
[Guest]: diplomatic decency. I mean, the Chinese embassy in France is particularly virulent. And at one

03:47:54.480 --> 03:48:00.400
[Guest]: point of time, it is even accusing people of, you know, deliberately letting people die in hospitals.

03:48:00.400 --> 03:48:05.840
[Guest]: And then of course, you sort of climb back, you know, but you're basically saying to your people

03:48:05.840 --> 03:48:12.160
[Guest]: by being this aggressive, that our system has worked, we are better off, we are much more

03:48:12.160 --> 03:48:19.040
[Guest]: humane. And we are much more efficient. And look at the West, it's so messy. Look at this

03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:24.000
[Guest]: space, which talk about democracy, they are inefficient, they are unable to contain things.

03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:29.040
[Guest]: And that sort of should tell you to have much more confidence in the party. And that's at the

03:48:29.040 --> 03:48:33.520
[Guest]: heart of the narrative of what they want to achieve. The problem is that in trying to achieve

03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:38.320
[Guest]: that, and in overcompensating to try to achieve that, you start to alienate people around the

03:48:38.320 --> 03:48:43.600
[Guest]: world. And that's where you sort of see this linkage between foreign policy and domestic

03:48:43.600 --> 03:48:49.360
[Guest]: policy, where the boundaries are very porous, and narrative sort of spills over on both ends.

03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:52.640
[Guest]: And I think that to me is probably one of the most fascinating things about what's happened

03:48:52.640 --> 03:48:57.360
[Guest]: in the last year. Because a lot of us when we look at Chinese foreign policy, and this wolf

03:48:57.360 --> 03:49:02.560
[Guest]: warrior diplomacy, the argument is, why is it that suddenly they are doing this? Because when

03:49:02.560 --> 03:49:07.120
[Guest]: you still step back and look at it from a strategic perspective, you will see that it's

03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:12.400
[Guest]: self-defeating. But what we don't take into account is how the system is structured to

03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:19.120
[Guest]: incentivize some of this behavior, and also the sense of threat and the sense of opportunity

03:49:19.120 --> 03:49:23.840
[Guest]: that fuels this behavior at an individual level. Because if I'm being more aggressive,

03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:29.280
[Guest]: I'm satisfying my bosses also. But also at a level of narrative in society at home,

03:49:29.280 --> 03:49:33.680
[Guest]: to try and breed confidence about your own system, and to breed this sense of conflict.

03:49:33.680 --> 03:49:38.640
[Guest]: Because that sense of conflict and nationalism also sustains you at home and your legitimacy

03:49:38.640 --> 03:49:42.880
[Guest]: at home. And I think that to me, that was sort of fascinating meta point of what happened in

03:49:42.880 --> 03:49:48.080
[Amit Varma]: the last year. So I've taken a lot of your time, it's, you know, we've been chatting for four

03:49:48.080 --> 03:49:52.640
[Amit Varma]: hours. And the thing is, we talk for four hours. And I, you know, in my case, the fan is off,

03:49:52.640 --> 03:49:56.320
[Amit Varma]: the AC is off and all of that. But listeners are listening for two hours, because they're

03:49:56.320 --> 03:50:00.720
[Amit Varma]: listening at double speed, which seems to me to be a little bit more unfair, I'm putting in

03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:04.400
[Amit Varma]: substantially more work. But more than that, you are putting in substantially more work,

03:50:04.400 --> 03:50:08.880
[Amit Varma]: because you're not talking at double speed, you're talking at normal speed. So I'll direct everyone

03:50:08.880 --> 03:50:12.800
[Amit Varma]: to head on over to your book and read your book, because we've barely touched the surface I have,

03:50:12.800 --> 03:50:16.720
[Amit Varma]: like you won't believe how much notes I have. I mean, it could be a small short book in itself.

03:50:16.720 --> 03:50:21.920
[Amit Varma]: And yet, we just kind of touched on little bits of it, the entire book is enlightening and worth

03:50:21.920 --> 03:50:27.760
[Amit Varma]: reading. But a couple of questions before we go. And the first one is, you know, in this narrative,

03:50:27.760 --> 03:50:33.360
[Amit Varma]: it's just a really fascinating story. Because what one gets out of it is that China is trying to

03:50:33.360 --> 03:50:38.080
[Amit Varma]: assert itself and make its place in the world. Obviously, it, you know, right from 2010, when

03:50:38.080 --> 03:50:42.880
[Amit Varma]: it overtook Japan and became the second largest economy in the world is wanted to assert itself

03:50:42.880 --> 03:50:48.560
[Amit Varma]: as a superpower, which can be up there with the US and present an alternative view of thinking.

03:50:48.560 --> 03:50:53.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, some of the thinking that the Chinese have behind this is crude, and some is sophisticated,

03:50:53.680 --> 03:50:58.720
[Amit Varma]: some of their methods are crude, and some are sophisticated. Some of the responses to them are

03:50:58.720 --> 03:51:03.920
[Amit Varma]: crude, such as from Donald Trump last year, and some are a little more sophisticated. And what

03:51:03.920 --> 03:51:09.520
[Amit Varma]: also happens is that, like you pointed out, every message, every diktat that sort of goes out from

03:51:09.520 --> 03:51:15.840
[Amit Varma]: the top will get amplified in extreme and crude ways. So for example, if the premier says that,

03:51:15.840 --> 03:51:19.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, we need to take a nationalistic line on this, everybody will go overboard and take a

03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:25.120
[Amit Varma]: hyper nationalistic line to please the boss. And that's where things kind of go out of whack.

03:51:25.120 --> 03:51:30.480
[Amit Varma]: Now, your last chapter is called A New Contest. And it talks about the possibility of this new

03:51:30.480 --> 03:51:34.800
[Amit Varma]: kind of Cold War beginning. And especially things have kind of become worse in the last couple of

03:51:34.800 --> 03:51:40.320
[Amit Varma]: years with all this talk of de-globalization and international trade taking a hit and all of that.

03:51:40.320 --> 03:51:43.920
[Amit Varma]: You pointed out at the start of this episode that what has happened over the last year,

03:51:43.920 --> 03:51:50.400
[Amit Varma]: what has happened since the outbreak in Wuhan, is something that could affect the next 5-10 years,

03:51:50.400 --> 03:51:56.800
[Amit Varma]: if not more, or what happens in geopolitics. So tell me why that is? Tell me what are your,

03:51:56.800 --> 03:52:01.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, what's the best case scenario? What's the worst case scenario? What should we be wary

03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:07.200
[Amit Varma]: of looking forward into the next 10 years? Because on the one hand, you know, I don't think it's a

03:52:07.200 --> 03:52:12.560
[Amit Varma]: bad thing for the world if China gets richer. And I mean, ultimately, it's social interactions are

03:52:12.560 --> 03:52:16.880
[Amit Varma]: a win-win game. It's a positive something. But at the same time, you see certain amounts of

03:52:16.880 --> 03:52:21.040
[Amit Varma]: belligerence, some of it in the narrative, some of it in what is happening in our neighborhood.

03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:26.560
[Amit Varma]: India has been having border problems recently. So what did you mean when you said that this will

03:52:26.560 --> 03:52:31.760
[Guest]: affect the next 10 years or so? Right. So broad question, right? I mean,

03:52:31.760 --> 03:52:37.760
[Guest]: firstly, whether it's sort of from China's point of view, to me, a lot of the conversation in the

03:52:37.760 --> 03:52:44.000
[Guest]: last six, eight months, particularly, one year also has been about how China's geopolitical

03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:50.160
[Guest]: space is becoming far more difficult, right? That, you know, oh, the West, we now have the Quad,

03:52:50.720 --> 03:52:56.720
[Guest]: and we have, you know, Biden is trying to bring the US and Europe together, and so on and so forth.

03:52:56.720 --> 03:53:02.080
[Guest]: And this is China's diplomatic failure, that some of this is happening. And I subscribe to that to

03:53:02.080 --> 03:53:05.680
[Guest]: some degree that yes, and I sort of make that argument in the book also in the last chapter,

03:53:05.680 --> 03:53:11.840
[Guest]: where the idea of galvanizing Western opinion about China's rise and the threat that China's

03:53:11.840 --> 03:53:17.520
[Guest]: rise poses is partly a failure of China's own policy. It wouldn't have happened on its own,

03:53:17.520 --> 03:53:22.000
[Guest]: I do think that it would have, but maybe not at this speed and with this ferocity.

03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:25.920
[Guest]: But the speed and ferocity is also partly to do with China's own policy,

03:53:25.920 --> 03:53:31.920
[Guest]: or the Communist Party's own policy. In terms of, let me first take the issue of de-globalization.

03:53:33.120 --> 03:53:38.160
[Guest]: What's happened, and not just about the last year, but actually for the last few years,

03:53:38.160 --> 03:53:44.880
[Guest]: in particular, that sort of underlying angst in the West with regard to the fruits of globalization

03:53:44.880 --> 03:53:50.400
[Guest]: being unevenly distributed, and middle class in the West struggling, or at least relatively

03:53:50.400 --> 03:53:55.120
[Guest]: struggling compared to say, folks in India, and that sort of their inability to deal with that,

03:53:55.120 --> 03:53:58.800
[Guest]: and the challenge of sort of new technology taking jobs in that revolution sort of

03:53:59.360 --> 03:54:06.000
[Guest]: requiring you to adapt your economies. All of that sort of came together with, you know,

03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:10.240
[Guest]: under Trump, particularly even before Trump's election, where he sort of identifies China as

03:54:10.240 --> 03:54:14.720
[Guest]: a fundamental problem for a lot of this. Now, the problem in Western economies is far deeper than

03:54:14.720 --> 03:54:20.480
[Guest]: China. But China became the sort of the guy that you picked on. And in some cases, fairly,

03:54:20.480 --> 03:54:25.680
[Guest]: you know, the idea that the Chinese state subsidies distort the market, the idea that,

03:54:25.680 --> 03:54:30.080
[Guest]: you know, also things like data and technology, the state does not provide a level playing field,

03:54:30.080 --> 03:54:35.040
[Guest]: all of that is fair game. And this is something that the West has been talking to the Chinese

03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:40.080
[Guest]: about for over two decades now, about reforming some of this stuff. And it's not going to be

03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:44.080
[Guest]: reformed, because that's how the system functions. It can't be reformed. If it gets reformed,

03:54:44.080 --> 03:54:48.720
[Guest]: the system completely changes. So I think some of that acknowledgement came through in the West

03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:52.880
[Guest]: also, you know, the idea that, oh, we got China wrong, and so on and so forth. And that started

03:54:52.880 --> 03:54:57.600
[Guest]: this change over the last four or five years. China's policies accelerated that change. Today,

03:54:57.600 --> 03:55:00.960
[Guest]: we're at the point where particularly the pandemic, you know, when Trump launched his trade

03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:05.440
[Guest]: war, people were still arguing about how, you know, it's self-defeating, it's problematic,

03:55:05.440 --> 03:55:09.440
[Guest]: and trade is not a zero-sum game, it benefits everybody and the rest of it. And all of that is

03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:15.280
[Guest]: true. But it's started to move a conversation towards, well, okay, what are critical sectors?

03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:20.640
[Guest]: Should we have dependencies in critical sectors? So even if I may still be okay with buying,

03:55:21.280 --> 03:55:28.960
[Guest]: you know, my laptop table, which is China made, or my curtains, or my shoes, or my bags,

03:55:28.960 --> 03:55:35.520
[Guest]: or whatever, but am I okay buying, even my mobile phone is okay, but am I okay buying my

03:55:36.240 --> 03:55:43.840
[Guest]: core 5G network from Chinese vendors? Am I okay being completely reliant on my pharmaceutical

03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:49.520
[Guest]: APIs coming from China? So some of those conversations about threats to supply chains

03:55:49.520 --> 03:55:54.400
[Guest]: were about what are critical sectors, and should we have some degree of self-reliance,

03:55:54.400 --> 03:56:00.080
[Guest]: or at least if not self-reliance, circles of trust within which we can work? And why is a circle of

03:56:00.080 --> 03:56:05.920
[Guest]: trust important is because, well, the Chinese, if we have political issues with them, can leverage

03:56:05.920 --> 03:56:12.000
[Guest]: these to coerce us. So how do we reduce their coercibility, or their power to coerce us in this

03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:18.720
[Guest]: way? Now, all of this thinking is very different from the Bretton Woods Institution system,

03:56:19.360 --> 03:56:23.120
[Guest]: you know, which talked about free trade and the rest of it, right? The idea that you should have

03:56:23.120 --> 03:56:28.320
[Guest]: comparative, focus on comparative advantage, that sort of classic, classical idea. And I think that

03:56:28.320 --> 03:56:32.160
[Guest]: sort of change is what we can expect going forward. And I think we're still in a state of flux,

03:56:32.160 --> 03:56:36.640
[Guest]: right? So despite all this talk about de-globalization, and this talk about

03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:41.120
[Guest]: cutting off from critical technologies, or at least creating resilience in all of this,

03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:44.960
[Guest]: what, and I document this in the book through surveys from the American Chambers of Commerce,

03:56:44.960 --> 03:56:48.880
[Guest]: from the European Chambers of Commerce, from China's trade with ASEAN, and China's global

03:56:48.880 --> 03:56:54.080
[Guest]: GDP contribution, that it remains a critical, indispensable economic partner for the world.

03:56:54.080 --> 03:56:58.080
[Guest]: In fact, China's contribution to global GDP will increase over the next five years. So it's going

03:56:58.080 --> 03:57:02.640
[Guest]: to play a bigger role. And if you see what European companies or American companies in

03:57:02.640 --> 03:57:07.280
[Guest]: China are saying, they're not saying we're exiting, you know, they are still saying we're

03:57:07.280 --> 03:57:11.200
[Guest]: investing even more. In fact, just last week, you had another European Chamber of Commerce survey

03:57:11.200 --> 03:57:15.680
[Guest]: come out, in which the number of companies saying that they are looking to possibly relocate came

03:57:15.680 --> 03:57:22.720
[Guest]: down from 11% in 2020, to 9%, which is the lowest on record. So it's not like that de-globalization

03:57:22.720 --> 03:57:27.200
[Guest]: is leading companies run out of China, because China offers fundamental economic advantages,

03:57:27.200 --> 03:57:31.680
[Guest]: supply chain connectivity to the region and to the world. But what's happened is that there is a

03:57:31.680 --> 03:57:37.520
[Guest]: trend to start to see how we can unravel some of these chains, particularly on critical sectors,

03:57:37.520 --> 03:57:42.640
[Guest]: so that we can reduce coercibility. And that's something that's going to, that's a long term

03:57:42.640 --> 03:57:47.920
[Guest]: phenomenon. So today, if India wants to reduce its pharmaceutical API dependence from China,

03:57:47.920 --> 03:57:54.000
[Guest]: which is at about 75-80% of APIs we get from China, it is going to take us some time to build

03:57:54.000 --> 03:57:59.600
[Guest]: that capacity, or to have that capacity be built in some other country where manufacturing is not

03:57:59.600 --> 03:58:05.280
[Guest]: such a huge issue, but that we trust to be able to do some of these things. And I think these

03:58:05.280 --> 03:58:08.320
[Guest]: are conversations which are still going on. And I think in the last chapter, I also talked about

03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:15.200
[Guest]: how while there is a broad agreement that we need to do this, how do we do this? What are

03:58:15.200 --> 03:58:21.040
[Guest]: the incentives of an India and America, Britain, France, when we come to this table? What is the

03:58:21.040 --> 03:58:26.400
[Guest]: kind of give that you need to have? So on manufacturing of products, there may be different

03:58:26.400 --> 03:58:30.480
[Guest]: issues, but say on things like regulations with regard to technology, or data governance,

03:58:31.440 --> 03:58:37.520
[Guest]: our internal legislation is still not in place. So if we are going to talk about data security

03:58:37.520 --> 03:58:44.080
[Guest]: and circles of trust, we need to first realize what is our system going to be like? That will

03:58:44.080 --> 03:58:49.600
[Guest]: then create the room for how do we negotiate with the West? And what do we give? Because we also want

03:58:49.600 --> 03:58:54.080
[Guest]: data sovereignty, whatever that means. And I think some of those conversations are going to shape the

03:58:54.080 --> 03:58:58.800
[Guest]: next 5, 10, 15 years. At the same time, if you look at what the Chinese are saying, they are

03:58:58.800 --> 03:59:04.320
[Guest]: saying, look, we are confident in our system, we are confident in our economic might, and we are

03:59:04.320 --> 03:59:09.680
[Guest]: here to stay, we are not going anywhere. And one of the examples that we've seen in this year,

03:59:09.680 --> 03:59:15.520
[Guest]: during the second wave in India, is that the Chinese emphasized how much of the health supplies

03:59:15.520 --> 03:59:20.640
[Guest]: that we were getting, whether it was oxygenators, whether it was masks, or the rest of it, was coming

03:59:20.640 --> 03:59:26.480
[Guest]: from China. They offered us aid also, but we seem to refuse that aid. But they were very keen to say

03:59:26.480 --> 03:59:30.880
[Guest]: that, look, we are central to global supply chain. So you talk of decoupling and all of that, and you

03:59:30.880 --> 03:59:35.520
[Guest]: know, you may ban some apps, you may do that and all that. But you can't decouple from us. Now,

03:59:35.520 --> 03:59:40.240
[Guest]: the challenge for India and the rest of the world is to how do you decouple to the point where you

03:59:40.240 --> 03:59:44.880
[Guest]: can create resilience, and you can create some degree of sense of security. And I think that's

03:59:44.880 --> 03:59:50.320
[Guest]: the sort of push and pull that we will see playing out, rather than a Cold War of the conventional

03:59:50.320 --> 03:59:55.040
[Guest]: kind, because you can't have a conventional Cold War, given China's indispensability to the global

03:59:55.040 --> 04:00:00.000
[Guest]: economic system. To me, the biggest failure of Xi Jinping is the fact that we have come to the

04:00:00.000 --> 04:00:04.400
[Guest]: point where we are saying that we want to do this. And now we're discussing modalities of how to do

04:00:04.400 --> 04:00:09.200
[Guest]: this. Philosophically, we've accepted this. And states have accepted this. And the policies that

04:00:09.200 --> 04:00:13.440
[Guest]: you've seen, like I said, I finished writing the book in late November. But what you've seen so

04:00:13.440 --> 04:00:18.480
[Guest]: far, the fact that you had the first leaders summit of the Quad in March, the fact that you've

04:00:18.480 --> 04:00:23.200
[Guest]: had a NATO summit, which refers to China as a threat, the fact that you've had a G7 summit,

04:00:23.200 --> 04:00:29.600
[Guest]: which mentions China in a statement, all tells you of shifts that are taking place in the world.

04:00:29.600 --> 04:00:35.040
[Guest]: The fact that at the G7 summit, India was an invitee, again, tells you that there is a shift

04:00:35.040 --> 04:00:40.400
[Guest]: that's taking place. That shift will take time. But the fact that this has happened is what's

04:00:40.400 --> 04:00:45.280
[Guest]: important from a failure of Chinese policy point of view. For Xi Jinping, what he's saying is that

04:00:45.280 --> 04:00:51.040
[Guest]: I see this happening, and I, what's that term in poker or gambling, and I raise you more. He's

04:00:51.040 --> 04:00:56.720
[Guest]: saying, look, you want to decouple, I've started decoupling. In April 2020, Xi Jinping gave a

04:00:56.720 --> 04:01:00.960
[Guest]: speech where he said, we need to focus on technological self-reliance. There are these

04:01:01.520 --> 04:01:06.640
[Guest]: bottleneck technologies, which people use to coerce us. We need to cultivate our strength in

04:01:06.640 --> 04:01:14.480
[Guest]: that. At the same time, we need to create a system in which our vulnerability on the outside world

04:01:14.480 --> 04:01:20.480
[Guest]: reduces while their vulnerability on us increases, particularly with regard to these technologies.

04:01:20.480 --> 04:01:24.400
[Guest]: And he wants his system to work in that direction. And that's why partly, you know,

04:01:24.400 --> 04:01:29.200
[Guest]: reorienting the economy and technology giants and so on and so forth. So he's very, very clear that

04:01:29.200 --> 04:01:35.360
[Guest]: I need to do this, and my window to do this is also not that large anymore. So some bit of his

04:01:35.360 --> 04:01:41.360
[Guest]: foreign policy is to maintain that window, at least for as long as he can, but also to accelerate

04:01:41.360 --> 04:01:46.640
[Guest]: doing the kind of things that he needs to do to be able to expand China's stake in the world

04:01:46.640 --> 04:01:53.360
[Guest]: and dependencies on China, so that China can't be coerced. Because if you look at it from his

04:01:53.360 --> 04:01:59.760
[Guest]: point of view, Donald Trump coerced China. And that was among his worst fears. So for him,

04:01:59.760 --> 04:02:04.800
[Guest]: he's trying to sort of push back on all of that. In the broad sense, he still sees the world as a

04:02:04.800 --> 04:02:08.560
[Guest]: place for opportunities from his point of view, that there is still a window for strategic

04:02:08.560 --> 04:02:13.440
[Guest]: opportunity. Although, as he himself says, there are unprecedented challenges that he's facing.

04:02:13.440 --> 04:02:16.880
[Guest]: And I think that's the dynamic that you will see play out. That's what I mean, when I say for the

04:02:16.880 --> 04:02:22.560
[Amit Varma]: next 5-10 years, this is what's going to shape the world. I think to begin with, what we should do

04:02:22.560 --> 04:02:27.680
[Amit Varma]: is just as we banned TikTok, we should unban TikTok, we should ban Gobi Manchurian and Sri

04:02:27.680 --> 04:02:32.800
[Amit Varma]: Sri Ravi Shankar should rename himself Shi Shi Ravi Shankar as a tribute that might help. I'm

04:02:32.800 --> 04:02:38.320
[Amit Varma]: so sorry for that. But I had to, you know, this is a deep, deep subject. And obviously, one way that

04:02:38.320 --> 04:02:42.320
[Amit Varma]: my listeners can learn about it is, of course, to buy a book, which I recommend they do instantly.

04:02:42.320 --> 04:02:47.840
[Amit Varma]: But they can also sign up for your course on China. So I'll ask you to give details about

04:02:47.840 --> 04:02:52.880
[Amit Varma]: the course, how can they sign up for it, where can they get more info, and also a traditional

04:02:52.880 --> 04:02:56.560
[Amit Varma]: ending to the show. For people who want to know more about China, why don't you recommend

04:02:57.200 --> 04:03:00.960
[Amit Varma]: some books which you think are a must read and hold lots of insight?

04:03:02.080 --> 04:03:07.680
[Guest]: Right. So, so on the course, it happens once a year, we've still not decided when we're going

04:03:07.680 --> 04:03:10.880
[Guest]: to do it this year. But yeah, just stay tuned to the Sakshi Shilla website, we'll be putting it up

04:03:10.880 --> 04:03:15.680
[Guest]: over there. In terms of books, I mean, look, it depends on where you're starting from. But

04:03:15.680 --> 04:03:20.000
[Guest]: if you want to get a nice, and this is a season for China books, given that the party's anniversary

04:03:20.000 --> 04:03:24.960
[Guest]: is taking place. But if you want a good place to start on understanding how the system works,

04:03:24.960 --> 04:03:29.520
[Guest]: and what happens, one of my favorite books is Wealth and Power. Really, really good. It gives

04:03:29.520 --> 04:03:35.120
[Guest]: you a broad history through people, through individuals and their stories. And I think

04:03:35.120 --> 04:03:39.360
[Guest]: that's really helpful. If you're really interested in the media side of things, I think Maria

04:03:39.360 --> 04:03:44.960
[Guest]: Ratnikova's book is Media and Politics in China. I think that is really, really good. You can pick

04:03:44.960 --> 04:03:49.360
[Guest]: that up. Although that's very academic. So you know, it might not be everybody's cup of tea.

04:03:50.320 --> 04:03:54.800
[Guest]: Again, somebody who's sort of beginning, there's an interesting book called China Questions,

04:03:54.800 --> 04:04:00.400
[Guest]: which again, deals with a lot of issues in a very simple manner, which allows you and it's

04:04:00.400 --> 04:04:05.360
[Guest]: extremely accessible. So for people who are new to the subject, you can pick that up. A lot of

04:04:05.360 --> 04:04:10.880
[Guest]: India China related books also that are available. Again, if you want a good introductory book,

04:04:10.880 --> 04:04:16.640
[Guest]: pick up Anand Krishnan's new book, which came out earlier this year. Really well articulated

04:04:16.640 --> 04:04:21.120
[Guest]: understanding of the Chinese system, the dynamic with India, and so I'd recommend that. But again,

04:04:21.120 --> 04:04:26.160
[Guest]: there are so many. I'm assuming that people are picking up books which are sort of at a

04:04:26.160 --> 04:04:29.280
[Guest]: starting level, entry level, where you're trying to get a grasp of the subject,

04:04:30.000 --> 04:04:34.560
[Guest]: and which are accessible as opposed to deeply academic. So from an India China point of view,

04:04:34.560 --> 04:04:38.480
[Guest]: I'd recommend picking up Anand's book. From a Chinese history point of view,

04:04:38.480 --> 04:04:41.280
[Guest]: do pick up Wealth and Power. I think it's one of the best books that you'll have.

04:04:41.280 --> 04:04:44.480
[Guest]: There are also lots of new books right now. I think there's a new book that's coming out in

04:04:44.480 --> 04:04:49.760
[Guest]: the next week, which I am really looking forward to reading. It's called From Rebel to Ruler,

04:04:49.760 --> 04:04:53.760
[Guest]: it's the story of the Communist Party. So I'm waiting to look forward to read that.

04:04:53.760 --> 04:04:57.920
[Guest]: Three recent books that have come out, Ambassador Shivshankar Menon's book

04:04:57.920 --> 04:05:03.360
[Guest]: on India and Asian geopolitics, Ambassador Vijay Gokhale's book on the Tiananmen Square incident.

04:05:03.360 --> 04:05:07.920
[Guest]: I think that's a must read for anybody who wants to understand how do you approach this

04:05:07.920 --> 04:05:12.400
[Guest]: approach studying Chinese politics, because he does it beautifully. And of course,

04:05:12.400 --> 04:05:17.120
[Guest]: Avtar Singh Bhasin's book on India, China and Tibet, really great work on archival research

04:05:17.120 --> 04:05:20.400
[Guest]: for just people to understand, given what's happening in Ladakh today,

04:05:20.400 --> 04:05:24.160
[Guest]: for you to understand the roots of some of these challenges that we face today.

04:05:24.800 --> 04:05:29.600
[Guest]: These are all great books. And of course, do also pick up my book. It'll give you a

04:05:29.600 --> 04:05:35.760
[Guest]: broad-based perspective about what's happened in the last year, but also the trends over the

04:05:35.760 --> 04:05:39.760
[Guest]: last few decades. And you know, that led us to what's happened in the last year,

04:05:39.760 --> 04:05:44.320
[Amit Varma]: and what that means going forward. Manoj, this was such a fun conversation.

04:05:44.320 --> 04:06:11.280
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you, Amit. This was my pleasure.

04:06:14.320 --> 04:06:15.840
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for listening.

04:06:44.320 --> 04:06:44.820
[Unknown]: Thank you.
