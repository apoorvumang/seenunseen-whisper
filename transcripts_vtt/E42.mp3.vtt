00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:49.520
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, today's episode is about behavioral economics.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.120
[Amit Varma]: Richard Taylor, one of the pioneers of this field, won the Nobel Prize for Economics recently

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.000
[Amit Varma]: and honestly he might as well have won the Nobel Prize for understanding human nature.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.640
[Amit Varma]: I keep telling friends that while the term sounds geeky, behavioral economics is, simply

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.520
[Amit Varma]: put, the study of human nature.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.560
[Amit Varma]: To celebrate Taylor's Nobel Prize, and in fact the whole field of behavioral economics,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.240
[Amit Varma]: I asked Nidhi Gupta to join me on this show.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.920
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi is the head of postgraduate programs at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.840
[Amit Varma]: and is a graduate of the London School of Economics and Political Science.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.000
[Amit Varma]: One of her main research interests is behavioral economics.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.200
[Amit Varma]: I caught up with her a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.400
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi, welcome to the show.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.400
[Guest]: It's a pleasure to be here, Amit.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.160
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi, we are both pretty much fellow behavioral economics geeks in the sense that, you know,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
[Amit Varma]: we've studied the subject and are both fans of Richard Taylor who won the Nobel Prize

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.160
[Guest]: recently.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.160
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.160
[Guest]: Yes.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.640
[Guest]: And I'm very excited that, you know, finally behavioral economics is getting its due and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640
[Amit Varma]: it's being recognized.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.200
[Amit Varma]: And of course, Daniel Kahneman won it so many years back as well.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.200
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I often think that the term behavioral economics makes it sound more niche

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.840
[Amit Varma]: and specialized than it should be, that what it really is, is the study of human nature.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.880
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, if you want to sort of understand the unseen effects of many things, understanding

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.360
[Amit Varma]: human nature is the key to that.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, behavioral economics is the key to that.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560
[Guest]: Right.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.920
[Guest]: In fact, you know, economics is finally about the incentives that people respond to or how

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.880
[Guest]: they use the scarce resources.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.800
[Guest]: And if you're talking about people, you can't take the psychology of people away from it.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.320
[Guest]: That's what behavioral economics does, right?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.280
[Guest]: It brings that psychology back into the hard science that economics is kind of touted to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280
[Amit Varma]: be.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.800
[Amit Varma]: And you actually teach behavioral economics in the Takshashila courses.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.800
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, what I'd like to sort of do today is let's talk about some specific fundas

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.800
[Amit Varma]: of behavioral economics and which have come from behavioral economics.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Our first example, in fact, being a term coined by Thaler himself.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.720
[Amit Varma]: And then illustrate that with what is happening in the world around us, both in politics and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720
[Guest]: otherwise.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.720
[Guest]: Perfect.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.120
[Guest]: So I like to think of behavioral economics, I kind of separate heuristics and biases.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.520
[Guest]: So heuristics are basically shortcuts that people use to make decisions.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.080
[Guest]: And heuristics kind of lead to biases.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.120
[Guest]: So what I'd like to talk today is biases, you know, we won't touch upon heuristics.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.560
[Guest]: So the first one that I'd like to start with is something known as endowment effect, which

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.960
[Guest]: basically says that you value the things that you own much more than somebody else does.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.680
[Guest]: In fact, so much so that the moment you start owning something, the value that you ascribe

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.600
[Guest]: to it becomes higher than what you did just before.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.400
[Guest]: And this kind of plays out really well if you think of how when a government is in opposition,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.520
[Guest]: how they are always critical of the policies that the government in power is coming out

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.560
[Guest]: with or the policies that they have.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.440
[Guest]: But when they themselves come to power, they take a lot of these policies and continue

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.440
[Guest]: with them.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.920
[Guest]: In fact, you see now a lot of, I think more around 19 policies of the UPA have been taken

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.320
[Guest]: by BJP and renamed.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.000
[Guest]: And now they are suddenly, you know, they've become these very nice policies that are going

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.360
[Guest]: to change India and that are going to bring about prosperity.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.440
[Guest]: So whether you look at the Jan Dhan scheme, you know, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.520
[Guest]: there was a UPA scheme, which was called Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account, or you look

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.200
[Guest]: at Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, you know, the flagship scheme.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.800
[Guest]: There was the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan or a total sanitation campaign that the UPA had.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.600
[Guest]: There isn't a lot of change in what these policies, the details of the policies, but

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.760
[Guest]: it's just that now, because the government, it's the BJP's policies or the NDA's policies,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.320
[Guest]: they suddenly, you know, are the right, they have all the right elements to it.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.120
[Guest]: Or you look at Indira Awas Yojana, which was UPA scheme.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.880
[Guest]: And now it's called, I think, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.320
[Guest]: And it's funny that when you even go to Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana's website, actually some

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.280
[Guest]: of the documents, if you open them, they actually still refer back to Indira Awas Yojana.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.480
[Guest]: So it's funny that, you know, they say, oh, Indira Awas Yojana was all crap and you know,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.240
[Guest]: how it would not meet the goals, while you yourselves are incorporating most of the things

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.240
[Amit Varma]: of that policy.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240
[Amit Varma]: It's just a different name.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.120
[Amit Varma]: And you'd argue that this is not just a question of political convenience, but that humans

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.720
[Amit Varma]: are actually wired to value something more when they own it than they would if they did

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720
[Guest]: not own it.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.920
[Guest]: I mean, you could find a lot of individual examples that, you know, for example, if you're

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.880
[Guest]: in a secondhand market, right, you want to sell your car, you would almost always think

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.280
[Guest]: that your car, you know, should fetch you higher than what anybody else is willing to

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.280
[Guest]: pay for it.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280
[Amit Varma]: That's a classic example.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280
[Amit Varma]: And I was a professional poker player for a few years.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.560
[Amit Varma]: And I always use poker to give, to illustrate examples of behavioral economics.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.800
[Amit Varma]: And the classic example of this in poker is that if someone tells me about a hand that

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.480
[Amit Varma]: he's playing and asks for my advice, at some point, I'll be able to say, hey, no, man,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.480
[Amit Varma]: you should fold it.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.480
[Amit Varma]: It's not classy.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.480
[Amit Varma]: We do keep playing.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.560
[Amit Varma]: But if I'm myself in the same situation, you'd continue playing instinctively, I want to

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.560
[Amit Varma]: continue playing.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.160
[Amit Varma]: I have to fight that impulse because now that it is my hand, I value it more somehow magically

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.600
[Amit Varma]: and can't think objectively about it.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600
[Guest]: Right.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.680
[Guest]: So this is one example that we can think of.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.080
[Guest]: This is one of the biases.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.280
[Guest]: The other one that I like to talk about is the sunk cost fallacy.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.520
[Guest]: So traditionally, economics would tell you that if you put in your time, effort or money

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:47.600
[Guest]: in a particular, you know, endeavor, you should stop continuing further if you don't see benefits

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.440
[Guest]: coming off it.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.460
[Guest]: But as humans, if we've invested time, effort and money in a particular thing, we actually

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.280
[Guest]: keep adding on to it.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.680
[Guest]: And you know, there is this fallacy that now that I have put in some effort and money,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.960
[Guest]: let me just, you know, continue and see what comes of it.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.520
[Guest]: For example, if I've bought a movie ticket and then I hear a lot of people saying, oh,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.520
[Guest]: the movie was crap.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.120
[Guest]: But now that I've bought the ticket, let me just go and, you know, watch the movie anyways.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's a fallacy because the time you're spending is also worth something and you're

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.240
[Amit Varma]: wasting that time.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And you should just think of the price of the ticket as a sunk cost.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.400
[Guest]: And in fact, it's not just individuals.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400
[Guest]: Right.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.600
[Guest]: It actually plays out at a public policy or the government level.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.240
[Guest]: Now we all know that Air India, you know, it was known for a long time that it's not

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.680
[Guest]: making profits.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.000
[Guest]: It does not even provide the quality of service that's expected of an international airline.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.240
[Guest]: But look at how long it survived.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.360
[Guest]: Look at how much money went into keeping Air India and Indian Airlines alike, even though

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.320
[Guest]: we got so many budget airlines and really good quality international airlines, you know,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320
[Guest]: in the market.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.840
[Guest]: Why has the government not done away with Air India?

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.320
[Guest]: It's only now, you know, in the last two years that we are talking about privatization of

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:11.200
[Guest]: Air India or, you know, doing a mix of like a PPP or actually just doing away with it.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.320
[Amit Varma]: It's only now that we are actually doing this.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.320
[Amit Varma]: I'm skeptical to me.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.320
[Amit Varma]: It's just talk.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.320
[Guest]: It's just, yeah.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.320
[Guest]: We are yet to see what happens.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.760
[Guest]: Or for example, think of bailouts for public sector banks, right?

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.800
[Guest]: Now that any public sector unit, now that you've put in money, you know, you, you kind

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.080
[Guest]: of think, oh, let me just put in a little more and see, maybe it will get better.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.840
[Guest]: While the rational, you should think that, well, that money is gone, that effort is gone.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:45.680
[Guest]: Why put in more resources and why unnecessarily, you know, enhance the costs, the overall costs?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.440
[Guest]: Would we continue the recapitalization of banks is not something that, you know, is

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.000
[Guest]: very old, maybe three, four days ago is when we heard of recapitalization again of public

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
[Amit Varma]: sector.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
[Guest]: And it's going to happen again and again.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
[Guest]: And it's going to happen again and again.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.840
[Amit Varma]: I can think of various examples of this from everyday life.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the standard poker example is that you continue in a pot when you should fold

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.920
[Amit Varma]: because you're, you're thinking, oh, I've already put in money, it will get wasted.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.280
[Amit Varma]: Even though the rational decision at that moment in time, the plus EV decision is to

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.400
[Amit Varma]: fold.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And there are trivial examples in real life.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.280
[Amit Varma]: Like I may pack a tiffin from home, but then my colleagues say, hey, let's go to that nice

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.560
[Amit Varma]: Japanese restaurant and I really want to, but I'm saying, no, I made a sandwich in the

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.400
[Amit Varma]: morning and it's in my tiffin and it'll get, you know, and that's, again, you should treat

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400
[Guest]: that sandwich as a sunk cost.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.560
[Guest]: I love how you've understood all of behavioral economics with poker in mind.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.560
[Amit Varma]: I just love it.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.120
[Amit Varma]: With poker in mind and it actually, and fallacies like this is serious real life implications.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.560
[Amit Varma]: Like I think a lot of bad marriages, for example, continue long past the point where they should

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.280
[Amit Varma]: because of the sunk cost fallacy, because of some battered woman saying, I've already

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.640
[Amit Varma]: spent 20 years with this guy, how can I walk out now?

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.640
[Guest]: Maybe it will get better.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.160
[Amit Varma]: Maybe if I put in more, sure.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.480
[Guest]: And you can rationalize all that.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.680
[Guest]: You know what Taylor mentions is that a lot of people in the US thought that we should

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.560
[Guest]: get out of Vietnam war, but it continued and that he at least says that, you know, that's

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.080
[Amit Varma]: an example of sunk cost fallacy.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.840
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, these little fallacies would seem like, you know, fancy phrases in

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.360
[Amit Varma]: textbooks actually have real world humanitarian consequences and affect millions of people.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360
[Amit Varma]: What's your next example?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:24.680
[Guest]: So the next example I would like to talk about is called present bias in easy terms and hyperbolic

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.960
[Guest]: discounting in very technical terms.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.400
[Guest]: But that is something that all of us can relate to on individual level, which is I value the

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.700
[Guest]: now much higher than I value the future.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.200
[Guest]: So I want a smaller, sooner reward than a larger later reward.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:49.640
[Guest]: I would rather have the pizza now than think about, Oh, in the next five years I will have

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.160
[Guest]: put on weight and I will have to exercise, or I would rather break my new year resolution

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.800
[Guest]: now than worry about how I will feel bad about it sometime later.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800
[Guest]: Right.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.640
[Guest]: And we all do it all the time, procrastination, laziness, overeating, indulging.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.640
[Amit Varma]: We do it all the time.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.520
[Guest]: I feel like you're describing me or myself and even not saving enough.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.520
[Guest]: For example,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:18.960
[Guest]: I'm not saving enough and at individual level, you know, you can tackle these things by committing

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960
[Guest]: to certain things.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.640
[Guest]: So you say that, okay, I will enroll myself in this marathon.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.400
[Guest]: And only if I have run so much, am I going to indulge in a big dessert?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400
[Guest]: Right.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.080
[Guest]: A lot of people do that.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.680
[Guest]: But where I see this playing out in public policy, look at how the governments in the

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.640
[Guest]: US, for example, have the 401k savings or in India where we have the employee provident

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.640
[Guest]: fund schemes.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.360
[Guest]: It is a welfare scheme, of course, but somehow the governments have understood that if we

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.640
[Guest]: don't kind of force people or make people commit to their own future savings, they would

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.840
[Guest]: not do it.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.560
[Guest]: So what they essentially do it, they say that, no, you must save this much.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.840
[Guest]: And they also have your employer put in, you know, an equivalent amount.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.360
[Guest]: And when you retire, you have this big fund, you know, there for you.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.040
[Guest]: And this is especially relevant for people who don't earn really well.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:20.200
[Guest]: So, you know, the EPF is mandatory for people, for companies with more than 20 people, I

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200
[Guest]: think.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.680
[Guest]: And for people who earn, whose wages are below 21,000.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.240
[Guest]: So maybe not for, you know, people who work in big private companies.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.480
[Guest]: It's not mandatory, although even these companies register for it.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.800
[Guest]: But think of somebody who earns 15,000, 16,000, for them building up this sum is really important.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.680
[Guest]: And they might not do it because there are always priorities, competing priorities in

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.960
[Guest]: the here and now that you want to take care of.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.240
[Guest]: So like, like they say, right, eat, drink and be merry for, you may die tomorrow, but

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.160
[Guest]: you actually do not die tomorrow and you continue to live for a long time.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.200
[Guest]: And it's better for you to save, save up for that.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.040
[Amit Varma]: And if you can take a slight tangent, this brings me to one of the criticisms many people

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.880
[Amit Varma]: have of Thaler per se, not the field, which is of the term that I think he coined called

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.280
[Amit Varma]: libertarian paternalism, and which the book nudges about, which he co-wrote with Cass

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.640
[Amit Varma]: Sunstein is almost that the government has a duty to nudge people in these directions

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.360
[Amit Varma]: to mitigate the effects of their biases.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.160
[Amit Varma]: And you know, my typical instinctive criticism to that is that while it is one thing to understand

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.080
[Amit Varma]: human nature, it is another to then coerce people in different ways, which, you know,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.760
[Amit Varma]: the EPF being compulsory for firms of over a certain size is an example of that.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.640
[Amit Varma]: It is another to coerce people and take that agency away from them.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.240
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like saying, Hey, you're too stupid to make your own decisions.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.480
[Guest]: That's the big criticism of the whole field of behavioral economics.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.560
[Guest]: In fact, if you think of a libertarian paternalism is an oxymoron, right?

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.240
[Amit Varma]: You can't have libertarian and paternalism in the same, you can't speak of them in the

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.480
[Guest]: same breath.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:00.240
[Guest]: But that's what Taylor and Sunstein, at least how they feel it is that we do not take choices

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.240
[Guest]: away from people.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.240
[Guest]: When we are thinking of behavioral interventions, they always are free to choose what they want.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.760
[Guest]: It's just nudging them in a particular direction.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:14.640
[Guest]: And, and of course there are critiques and critiques of critics and it never ends.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, yeah.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.520
[Amit Varma]: I just feel that if a guy is earning 15,000 a month and he's saying, no, I don't want

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.920
[Amit Varma]: to give any of this away to a fund for when I'm 60, I need the money now, that choice

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.520
[Amit Varma]: should really be up to him.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Even if he recognized that this biosexist.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.000
[Guest]: Well, you also can then think of if these people haven't saved enough, then it's up

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.600
[Guest]: to the government to then provide for them.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.600
[Guest]: Right.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.040
[Guest]: We also say that, Hey, well, the government should provide healthcare, but if the government

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.200
[Guest]: says, well, you should pay for your health insurance so that when you are sick, you know,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.440
[Guest]: we will be able to fund.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.440
[Guest]: But that's the example that at least NHS in the UK, you know, they, they say that the

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.960
[Guest]: burden of healthcare is increasingly becoming larger.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.840
[Guest]: And if the people don't save up for their health or save up for their life insurance,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.600
[Guest]: it is for the government to then spend money.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.680
[Guest]: We also criticize the government then that, Oh, you know, where is the money for it?

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.640
[Guest]: So I agree with you that, you know, it shouldn't be coerced upon people.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:13.640
[Guest]: It should rather be voluntary profit and fund, but, and I'm not one for EPF, but that there

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.920
[Guest]: is a mechanism that is provided as a public policy that, you know, there are these commitment

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.520
[Guest]: devices that are provided by the government itself, and you can then draw this pension.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.360
[Guest]: That I think is an example that we can look at.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.720
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, I would certainly say that wherever one stands on this issue and one can agree

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.320
[Amit Varma]: to disagree, it's an unfair criticism of behavioral economics because behavioral economics, the

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.480
[Amit Varma]: way I see it is descriptive.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.480
[Amit Varma]: It's not prescriptive.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.880
[Amit Varma]: A lot of these specific prescriptions from which, you know, coercion comes or agency

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.240
[Amit Varma]: is taken away from individuals is comes from individual economists, but the field itself

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.080
[Guest]: is just describing what human nature is, right?

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.800
[Guest]: And that's what it tries to do with that.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.000
[Guest]: This is how humans behave.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.860
[Guest]: Look, you know, we tried to do this, but this is what happened in reality.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.720
[Guest]: And it just tries to describe the behavior and then maybe draw insights from it and then

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.880
[Guest]: say, next time they are behaving this way, maybe we could, you know, and then that argument

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.760
[Amit Varma]: can happen, but at least it's an informed argument.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.960
[Guest]: For example, this whole thing of default options, right, where, and I like to give the example

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:23.560
[Guest]: of this give it up scheme where the LPG scheme, you know, our prime minister went about saying

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.200
[Guest]: everybody now is enrolled in the subsidy and now give it up.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.720
[Guest]: I wanted to say that, you know, I mean, my prescription for it would have been that let

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.200
[Guest]: nobody be subscribed to it, say that you are entitled to it as a citizen, you are entitled

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.680
[Guest]: to it, but your default position is that you're opted out and let only those people who really

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.640
[Guest]: need it, you know, opt in and make the opt in really easy, make it really easy for people

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.240
[Guest]: to get this subsidy.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.800
[Guest]: And again, how you give subsidy remains the same, but now a lot of people are not giving

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.480
[Guest]: it up just because that's the default position.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.160
[Amit Varma]: I'm just lazy to go to some place and you know, do something.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.840
[Amit Varma]: Inertia, inertia is the most powerful force in human life.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.520
[Amit Varma]: That's what present bias is all about.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.400
[Amit Varma]: But though I would also, my, my instinctive reaction there is that if you make it an opt

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.480
[Amit Varma]: in thing, then you inevitably create rent seeking.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.240
[Amit Varma]: It's easy to say in theory that it should be easy to opt in, but you'll create rent

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.120
[Amit Varma]: seeking and you'll, you know, everything else that follows with it.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120
[Amit Varma]: That's true as well.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.320
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to the next example.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.320
[Guest]: All right.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.000
[Guest]: So the next example I like to talk about is about social norms.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.800
[Guest]: And there are a lot of things in behavioral economics that revolve around this.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:35.880
[Guest]: So, you know, there are things called herd behavior, confirmation bias, or social desirability

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:42.640
[Guest]: bias, which all essentially talk about how human behavior is set in a social context,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.640
[Guest]: right?

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:49.280
[Guest]: You are influenced by the society, by the people around you and the decisions you take

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.320
[Guest]: or the preferences you have are not just your preference.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.680
[Guest]: Maybe they are your preferences, but yet they're almost always influenced by the people around

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.860
[Guest]: you.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:07.880
[Guest]: So what, how you behave is set in a social context and that people want to behave how

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.280
[Guest]: their friends behave.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.400
[Guest]: So you see, you know, echo chambers forming on social media.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:20.640
[Guest]: That is, I want to talk like my friend, so I will, you know, adopt that line of opinion.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:27.480
[Guest]: And it is a similar set of people who get, you know, who get caught in these echo chambers

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:33.480
[Guest]: or look at confirmation bias where I have a certain viewpoint and I'm always looking

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.640
[Guest]: at or reading something with this thing of, Oh, this, this is an alignment with what I

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.640
[Guest]: was thinking.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.640
[Amit Varma]: Didn't I say so?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, you're always trying to, you value the information, which confirms your bias,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.240
[Guest]: but you ignore everything else.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.760
[Guest]: And that's just human behavior, right?

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:57.120
[Guest]: I mean, you would do that, but what this results in is something known as private truths and

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.960
[Guest]: public lies and you would know of it, you know.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.120
[Guest]: So what we do is in private, we might hold certain preferences, but because of the social

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.640
[Guest]: norms, because of this social pressure that we have in public, we might state our preferences

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.960
[Guest]: very differently, right?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.840
[Guest]: So for example, Timur, Quran and economists talked about preference falsification that

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.640
[Guest]: in public, we tend to falsify our preferences.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:28.160
[Guest]: Now look at how after the new dispensation, the BJP has come to power, we suddenly have

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:35.520
[Guest]: this surge in, you know, anti-Muslim riots or the Hindutva bigotry that we see suddenly,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.200
[Guest]: you know, there is just so much of it, whether it's Pelukan or it's Akhlaq.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.200
[Guest]: Why was this not happening for the last 60 years?

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.120
[Guest]: Because maybe the social context was such that this was taboo and maybe people wanted

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.800
[Guest]: to talk about these things, but they were not doing because of the social context.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.600
[Guest]: And maybe the context right now has changed that, you know, some people have, they are

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.400
[Guest]: the norm entrepreneurs and they've set this norm.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.360
[Guest]: They took that extra chance and said, well, we can talk about this.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:10.400
[Guest]: And suddenly this whole bunch of people find that they can now express their hidden preferences.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:17.120
[Amit Varma]: I'd written a column about this a couple of years ago when the whole Trump wave was happening.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.600
[Amit Varma]: And I think to a large extent, social media empowering as it is, and I think it's a net

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.800
[Amit Varma]: positive good, enormously so.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:29.120
[Amit Varma]: But social media has enabled this in the sense that a lot of the phrase I use is closet bigots.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.320
[Amit Varma]: There'd be a lot of people who are closet bigots, but they don't express their bigotry

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.400
[Amit Varma]: because it seems impolite or unacceptable around them to do so.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.480
[Amit Varma]: But suddenly through social media, they realized that there are actually a lot of people who

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480
[Guest]: think like that.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480
[Guest]: They can come out.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480
[Guest]: There are a lot of them.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.480
[Amit Varma]: And, and they feel empowered to come out and express their bigotry.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.520
[Amit Varma]: And as more, and as they start doing that, it becomes a cascade.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.440
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Timur Karan called this a preference cascade.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, first, I think the example he gave was of the Soviet Union where everybody assumed

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.920
[Amit Varma]: that all the individuals were for the Soviet state, but once people began to express otherwise,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920
[Unknown]: it kind of cascaded.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.120
[Guest]: And the downfall of the Soviet Union actually seems very sudden, but had been building up

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120
[Guest]: over decades.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.000
[Guest]: But social revolutions seem very sudden, but they're always building up because there are

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.720
[Guest]: these individual preferences that are hidden.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.400
[Guest]: And then suddenly some people and which Cass Sunstein, you know, calls them norm entrepreneurs,

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.880
[Guest]: that these norm entrepreneurs take the chance and you know, they say, okay, we'll speak

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.880
[Guest]: the opposite.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.520
[Amit Varma]: And then suddenly they find a bandwagon.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.960
[Guest]: And social media enables and magnifies this.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960
[Guest]: You've seen that happening.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960
[Guest]: Right.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960
[Amit Varma]: The polarization that social media.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.480
[Amit Varma]: You've seen this with the Trump and the alt-right in the US, you've seen this with Modi.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.720
[Guest]: The white supremacist rallies, the increasing number of rallies that we see.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.360
[Guest]: So that's what I, and the interesting thing is, we don't even know if these are the real

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.080
[Guest]: preferences now or other people again, falsifying their preferences, you know, in their heart

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:02.520
[Guest]: of hearts, it's actually something else, but because of this new context, the social context

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.480
[Guest]: or the new language that people are speaking, they start to speak this.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.240
[Guest]: They start to confirm to, you know, what is the current context.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.720
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is that when we talk of preference falsification, it's not

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.000
[Amit Varma]: just falsification for the sake of others.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.620
[Amit Varma]: You're also lying to yourself very often.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.480
[Amit Varma]: And for example, you know, a classic example of how even these preferences, which seem

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.720
[Amit Varma]: to now be truly expressed, might actually be falsified as you're saying, is that if

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.240
[Amit Varma]: you sort of conflate criticism of the government with being anti-national and, you know, bring

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.760
[Amit Varma]: nationalism and Modi together in the same sentence, then people are afraid to, for example,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.240
[Amit Varma]: during demonetization, it was framed in such a way as we are attacking black money.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.280
[Amit Varma]: And if you speak up against it, you're speaking against the nation.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And you would have had people expressing support for demonetization, even though if they really

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.120
[Guest]: thought about it, they might not feel that way.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.360
[Guest]: And even though right now, I mean, I'd like to think that, you know, if suddenly the dispensation

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.200
[Guest]: actually came out and said, Oh yes, this was a mistake.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.200
[Guest]: It's never going to happen.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.880
[Guest]: But let's assume, let's, you know, think that it happens.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.320
[Guest]: I'm sure a lot of those people who were, you know, singing songs about how demonetization

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:17.120
[Guest]: is going to, you know, clean all the black money will actually then start again saying

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.460
[Guest]: the same thing that the government says that, Oh yes, it was a mistake.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.560
[Guest]: So it's, it's just about keeping in tune with the current, you know,

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.880
[Amit Varma]: And not just that, another bias, a hindsight bias would kick in and they'd imagine that,

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.880
[Guest]: Hey, we thought it was crap all along.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.480
[Guest]: Yeah, I didn't, I said, I was right when I said that.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.480
[Guest]: And it happens all the time.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.240
[Guest]: I mean, let's not blame others.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.040
[Amit Varma]: You and I would do it as well.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, everybody would do it.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we are not standing on a pedestal and saying, Oh, you humans are like that.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040
[Amit Varma]: We are also like this.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040
[Amit Varma]: We suffer from it.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.140
[Amit Varma]: But what's important about behavioral economics is that it then helps you understand these

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:56.800
[Amit Varma]: biases within yourself and within the context you operate and the policies that you have,

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, what your government does and the quality of that self-reflection can help you

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:08.280
[Amit Varma]: either live a happier life or be more aware of your unending unhappiness.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to the next example.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.440
[Guest]: So the next example I'd like to talk about is, it's called peak end rule.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:24.080
[Guest]: What that necessarily says is that the sum total of how a person remembers an experience

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.400
[Guest]: is defined by how they felt at the peak of it.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.800
[Guest]: And at the end of it, people tend to ignore the rest.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.640
[Guest]: So if I were to ask you, Hey, Amit, how was the Bangalore lit fest?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.960
[Guest]: You would possibly remember the highlight of it.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:44.120
[Guest]: And the, you know, if you attended the last few sessions, you would forget the rest.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:50.360
[Guest]: And the example, a rather controversial one that, you know, I'd give you is that think

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.680
[Guest]: of Indira Gandhi's rule.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.440
[Guest]: If you'd ask most people, you know, how was her rule?

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.520
[Guest]: They would talk of emergency, which defined the peak of her rule.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.680
[Guest]: And they would talk of, you know, how she was assassinated.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.320
[Guest]: So her becoming a martyr.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.600
[Guest]: And that's how we think of as her rule.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.560
[Amit Varma]: Whereas there was a lot more to it, by the way, she ruled for a long time, right?

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.800
[Guest]: And I'm not taking sides of whether she was good or not.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.520
[Amit Varma]: So they'd remember the peak of it and think of her as an authoritarian despot.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.600
[Amit Varma]: And they'd remember the end of it.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.920
[Amit Varma]: And they'd think of her as a martyr who died for the nation.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.080
[Amit Varma]: And both of those may have an element of truth, though I think the former has far more truth.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.040
[Guest]: I would agree actually.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.040
[Guest]: But that's also how, I mean, so we tend to forget that there would have been other elements

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040
[Guest]: of it.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.600
[Guest]: And most of it actually in her case was not that great, but that's how we remember most

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.600
[Amit Varma]: of the things.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.400
[Amit Varma]: And that's how we look back on our own lives.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.920
[Amit Varma]: And which is why, you know, memory is selective.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.200
[Amit Varma]: What we remember is not really what happened.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.320
[Guest]: So we are fabricating a lot of things in between.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.880
[Guest]: What we actually remember is the peak and the end most of the times.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.000
[Guest]: The rest of it is, we are just filling it up, right?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
[Guest]: We are fabricating it.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.480
[Amit Varma]: So, and we've reached the end of the podcast.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.400
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, I will ask my listeners to reflect on what you remember of this podcast.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.880
[Amit Varma]: Chances are it will be the peak and the end.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.360
