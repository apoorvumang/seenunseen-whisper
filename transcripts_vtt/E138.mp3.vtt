00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:38.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, kindly forgive my hyperbolic entry into the episode

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.960
[Amit Varma]: and for getting your hopes up. I'm not sure even dreamers can save us to be honest. Too

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.920
[Amit Varma]: much of my commentary on the show in recent times has been all gloom and doom. But what

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.840
[Amit Varma]: to do that is indeed the state of our nation and our economy and our governance today.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.360
[Amit Varma]: So I thought I'd do an episode where I get some of the sharpest thinkers I've had on

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.800
[Amit Varma]: the show to get together and propose what I term dream reforms. I have three guests

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.360
[Amit Varma]: on the show today, a record, and each of us will propose three dream reforms that we'd

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.160
[Amit Varma]: really love to see. And so will I. So that's a total of 12 dream reforms, each of them

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.200
[Amit Varma]: proposed by one of us but discussed by all of us. My guests today are Vivek Kaul, Shruti

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.840
[Amit Varma]: Rajagopalan and Rajeshwari Sengupta. I take their names in this order, because I am grouping

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.880
[Amit Varma]: them by the frequency of their appearances on the scene and the unseen. Vivek has appeared

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.560
[Amit Varma]: on a whopping 16 episodes of the show. And I'm beginning to think that he and I should

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.360
[Amit Varma]: just get a, not get a room but a separate show of our own so others get a chance on

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.040
[Amit Varma]: this one. Watch this space. Shruti meanwhile has appeared on 11 episodes of the scene and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.720
[Amit Varma]: the unseen and was delighted to get an invite in this episode so she could catch up with

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.960
[Amit Varma]: Vivek till she realized he was also on it. Tough luck Shruti. Rajeshwari has appeared

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.280
[Amit Varma]: just once on the show. But Sachin Tendulkar had played just one test match at the time

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.680
[Amit Varma]: of his second test match and we all know what happened next. Before I begin my ludicrously

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.400
[Amit Varma]: exciting episode with these remarkable peoples, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.600
[Amit Varma]: Did you know that Parsis in Mumbai, instead of being left at the Tower of Silence after

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.440
[Amit Varma]: they died, are now cremated? And why? Because a cow fell sick in the early 1990s? Did you

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.080
[Amit Varma]: know that the smog in Delhi is caused by something that farmers in Punjab do and that there's

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.600
[Amit Varma]: no way to stop them? Did you know that there wasn't one gas tragedy in Bhopal but three?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.560
[Amit Varma]: One of them was seen but two were unseen? Did you know that many well-intentioned government

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.760
[Amit Varma]: policies hurt the people they're supposed to help? Why was demonetization a bad idea?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.360
[Amit Varma]: How should GST have been implemented? Why are all our politicians so corrupt when not

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.240
[Amit Varma]: all of them are bad people? I'm Amit Verma and in my weekly podcast, The Seen and the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.840
[Amit Varma]: Unseen, I take a shot at answering all these questions and many more. I aim to go beyond

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.480
[Amit Varma]: the scene and show you the unseen effects of public policy and private action. I speak

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.720
[Amit Varma]: to experts in economics, political philosophy, cognitive neuroscience and constitutional

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.480
[Amit Varma]: law so that the insights can blow not only my mind but also yours. The Seen and the Unseen

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.600
[Amit Varma]: releases every Monday. So do check out the archives and follow the show at seenunseen.in.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.360
[Amit Varma]: You can also subscribe to The Seen and the Unseen on whatever podcast app you happen

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360
[Amit Varma]: to prefer.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, Vivek, Rajeshwari, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800
[Guest 1]: Hi Amit.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800
[Guest 3]: Hi Amit.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800
[Guest 3]: Hi Amit, glad to be here.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so let's let's kind of get straight down to business. I mean, we are just playing

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.200
[Amit Varma]: this by ear. All of us have like three reforms, which we have decided not to share with each

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.600
[Amit Varma]: other in advance. So I have no idea what these people are going to come up with. And there

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.940
[Amit Varma]: is a grave danger that they might talk about my reform before I do. The order will be going

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.520
[Amit Varma]: in is Shruti first, followed by Vivek, followed by Rajeshwari, followed by me. And I sound

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.800
[Amit Varma]: too much like a schoolteacher at this point. And the thing is, I'm one of them. I mean,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.320
[Guest 3]: there are two other teachers on the show. Shruti, why don't we do ladies first?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.520
[Amit Varma]: Please not. So ladies first hi toh kar rahe the.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520
[Amit Varma]: Haan to ladies first.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.920
[Amit Varma]: No ladies as in, I think he means Shruti first and then me. Let's just go by this order.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.720
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so Shruti, most of my shows with you have happened on Skype. How do you feel you

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.200
[Amit Varma]: are here in person in the studio?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.760
[Guest 1]: I'm hoping that someone buys me lunch. That's the only reason I'm in the studio.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.320
[Amit Varma]: Oh my god, that's that's the advantage of Skype recordings. You don't have to buy lunch

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320
[Amit Varma]: for your guests.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.320
[Guest 1]: No, it's a pleasure to be here. And so much for catching up with Vivek. But it's okay,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.720
[Amit Varma]: we'll find another time.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Let's get straight to our reforms. What's your first reform, Shruti?

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.280
[Guest 1]: This is no surprise. I think the biggest thing going on is the jobs crisis. It's very strongly

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.960
[Guest 1]: linked to the economic downturn. And it's going to become more acute because of the

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.400
[Guest 1]: slowdown that the economy is experiencing. So I think the very first thing that we need

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.400
[Guest 1]: to do is address the fact that we have too many people entering the job market and not

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.120
[Guest 1]: enough jobs to go around. And this seems to be true pretty much at every level. So just

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.080
[Guest 1]: in broad terms, the country is incredibly young, right? 50% of the country is below

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:29.120
[Guest 1]: 25 or thereabouts. And all these people are young, fresh out of school or college or whatever

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.440
[Guest 1]: their skill level is, they're all looking for jobs. The numbers were about 12 to 13

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.240
[Guest 1]: million people looking for jobs, plus another 6 million odd attempting to leave agriculture.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.440
[Guest 1]: And you know, so it was estimated about 20 million jobs a year. Now, because we failed

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.600
[Guest 1]: to create 20 million jobs in the last five or six years, there's a further backlog, right?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600
[Guest 1]: Because just because they didn't get a job the first year, they might be underemployed

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.920
[Guest 1]: or sort of looking for employment. But those people are also sort of looking for a job.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.760
[Guest 1]: So the numbers, we don't have clear numbers on how many people are looking for a job each

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.720
[Guest 1]: year, but it's about 20 million plus is a conservative estimate entering the workforce

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.440
[Guest 1]: every year. And we are creating nowhere close to those number of jobs, right? And a big

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:26.920
[Guest 1]: part of this is because the regulatory system doesn't allow easy hiring and easy firing.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.340
[Guest 1]: So the easier it is to fire someone, the easier it is to hire someone, right? So that's the

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:39.160
[Guest 1]: biggest problem caused by the Indian sort of wage regulatory structure. Added to this

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.160
[Guest 1]: is other things like you have inspection systems. So they really clamp down on industries, mostly

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.520
[Guest 1]: manufacturing, where if you don't follow the labor laws, there's a host of labor inspectors

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.680
[Guest 1]: who are just sort of, you know, capturing the rents coming out of this regulatory system.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.560
[Guest 1]: So they're incredibly corrupt. They make it very difficult for small firms to function.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.460
[Guest 1]: In response, the government decided to pass quite recently, maybe a couple of weeks ago,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:14.520
[Guest 1]: the wage code for 2019. All that the code does, to my knowledge, is compiles four previous

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.440
[Guest 1]: acts, the Payment of Wages Act, the Minimum Wages Act, the Payment of Bonus Act, and Equal

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:25.560
[Guest 1]: Renumeration Act, right? So they've just sort of done what they do best. They've given it

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.320
[Guest 1]: a new name. They haven't made any real reform in making it cheaper. They've actually made

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.880
[Guest 1]: it harder. They've brought in about 500 million people in India under the ambit of the code

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.920
[Guest 1]: bill. And it comes with a penalty, including domestic work. And there's a penalty for not

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.720
[Guest 1]: paying minimum wage, which is well above market wage. Like the minimum wage seems to have

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.000
[Guest 1]: no relevance in reality to what's actually going on in the market. And there is a huge

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
[Guest 1]: penalty, both fines and criminal penalty, for not paying minimum wage. And there is

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.080
[Guest 1]: no enforcement mechanism. I don't know if that's good or bad. That's probably good.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.360
[Guest 1]: Because that way more people can be hired. But it also because of pernicious enforcement

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.760
[Guest 1]: and arbitrary enforcement, you know, it would be harder for manufacturing units hoping to

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.720
[Guest 1]: hire more people below minimum wage or something to actually go and do it. So this is the mess

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:26.160
[Guest 1]: we're in. So what this probably requires is sort of scrapping the existing labor laws,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:33.200
[Guest 1]: and just really simplifying it, right? And the next is getting rid of the labor inspection

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.480
[Guest 1]: system. Whatever is a problem should be solved contractually, like any other contract, right?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.760
[Guest 1]: This labor inspection system, which is sort of like the government holding a danda above

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:51.320
[Guest 1]: every employer's head, that is really what's causing the jobs crisis problem. So this,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.960
[Guest 1]: I mean, we can talk about this a little bit more, it's very hard to do this reform, because

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.240
[Guest 1]: of the unions. And there is obviously winners and losers in every reform, the unions will

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.200
[Guest 1]: lose and a very vast number of people in the informal economy and those who are unemployed

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.880
[Guest 1]: will gain. But the unions are well organized. And the people in the economy who are unemployed

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.600
[Guest 1]: and those who in the informal economy are not organized. And that makes it very difficult

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.360
[Guest 1]: to break this stronghold.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.680
[Amit Varma]: And also, is there a central law, state laws, that kind of thing?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.040
[Guest 1]: So there are state amendments. So there are a host of central laws, you know, like the

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.000
[Guest 1]: Industrial Disputes Act, and so on. And each state can amend those. So some of the amendments

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.320
[Guest 3]: are better than some of us, like some states do better than us.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.320
[Guest 3]: Basically, there are around 44 central government laws. And there are around 200 state government

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.760
[Guest 3]: laws. So basically, you know, a few years back, Amit Mitra, who now is the finance minister

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:54.040
[Guest 3]: of West Bengal, said that, at any point of time, you might be breaking some labor law

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.960
[Guest 3]: without even realizing it, because there's so many of them out there.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.840
[Guest 2]: So Shruti, I think that's an excellent point. But one question that I had is, and this is

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.480
[Guest 2]: just because I'm not very well aware of this particular field, which is that, even I hear

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.000
[Guest 2]: that even in the formal sector today, there's a lot of contractualization of labor that's

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.440
[Guest 2]: going on. And that actually took me by surprise, because I was thinking that contractualization

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.080
[Guest 2]: happens more in the informal sector. But I keep hearing for the last five years, this

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.000
[Guest 2]: has taken up massively in the formal sector. And I'm guessing this is obviously not optimal,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.960
[Guest 2]: because you're essentially working around the laws. And this also breeds insecurity,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.560
[Guest 2]: because these workers are not getting pension payments and other kinds of benefits. So would

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.600
[Guest 2]: you have any thoughts on this? And if I may also add, and this is a broader point is,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.480
[Guest 2]: I don't completely think that the jobs crisis is because of labor laws, because our labor

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.480
[Guest 2]: laws have been rigid and have been complicated and have been many and scattered for a very

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.320
[Guest 2]: long period of time. And the jobs crisis, essentially speaking, has been brewing over

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.600
[Guest 2]: the last few years. And it has actually broken out of the thing and everybody's talking about

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.800
[Guest 2]: it over the last few years. And that perhaps also has a lot to do, and as you rightly mentioned,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.560
[Guest 2]: with the economic slowdown, which is basically, there's a manufacturing sector crisis that

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.080
[Guest 2]: has been also brewing for a long time, there is a credit market crisis that's happening

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.800
[Guest 2]: for quite some time. And as a result, there is a demand slowdown that's happening, which

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.360
[Guest 2]: is perhaps leading to a situation where, because companies are not investing, they don't feel

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.960
[Guest 2]: the need to hire more workers. And because they are not hiring more workers, they're

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.960
[Guest 2]: not producing enough output. And that is having a vicious cycle effect. And a related point

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.680
[Guest 2]: being that not enough workers have the skills required. So there is a skilling gap and there

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.240
[Guest 2]: is a so I'm guessing what I'm trying to say is there are many other factors which have

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.840
[Guest 2]: probably aggravated the current jobs crisis. And of course, it is perhaps built on the

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.240
[Guest 1]: base of a rigid labor law.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.600
[Guest 1]: So I think I would just add one more thing. I mean, I agree with you, we've always had

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.040
[Guest 1]: bad labor laws. But what has made the effect worse and caused the glut is the demography,

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.320
[Guest 1]: right? So and that is just something, it happened by chance, right? You don't control, you can

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:11.520
[Guest 1]: control the regulatory system, it's much harder to control how the demographic dividend moves,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.440
[Guest 1]: right? And countries that have tried to control it, like China are in a total mess because

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.360
[Guest 1]: of it. So one part of the glut is, we've always had terrible laws, but we never had so many

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:27.160
[Guest 1]: people who were young and entering the workforce. So this is a bad combination of both. It's

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.160
[Guest 1]: definitely, you know, we've had a jobs crisis for the last seven years. The economic slowdown

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.040
[Guest 1]: is only maybe post demonetization, or maybe even last 18 months, you know, not immediately

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.000
[Guest 1]: post demonetization, but I wouldn't agree, but we can debate that later. Yeah. So the

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.240
[Guest 1]: last, you know, 12 to 18 months, you could start hearing warning bells and people started

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.080
[Guest 1]: saying, you know, things are not good, something's going on. And you know, you start getting

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:56.000
[Guest 1]: the different warning bells from different sectors, saying, okay, the GDP numbers don't

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.040
[Guest 1]: quite add up to what's going on with cement, right? Today, the news last week is, it doesn't

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.760
[Guest 1]: quite add up with what's going on with auto sales, right, or biscuit sales. So different

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.800
[Guest 1]: sectors have sort of sent the SOS signal at different points. But we've had a demand slowdown

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.080
[Guest 1]: for a while, right? And the demand slowdown definitely has an effect, you know, when people

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.880
[Guest 1]: don't, and it's not just the slowdown, it's the expectation, right? When people form an

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.720
[Guest 1]: expectation that demand is going to slow down further, they're even more nervous to hire

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.160
[Guest 1]: employees. And that's a very large part of this contractualization that you're talking

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.360
[Guest 1]: about, right? So one part of switching from long term labor contracts to this kind of,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.480
[Guest 1]: so you know, there are three versions of it. One is the very elite version, that is the

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.600
[Guest 1]: Amit and Vivek version, right? They want to work for themselves, they would rather work

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.880
[Guest 1]: on certain terms with different firms rather than have a single employer, and sort of clock

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:57.200
[Guest 1]: in. So that's a very first world sort of and that those numbers are very small. The second

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:04.960
[Guest 1]: group is where firms are trying to reduce the cost of labor, highly skilled labor to

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.680
[Guest 1]: avoid paying pensions and provident funds and all the other employee benefits, right?

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.100
[Guest 1]: So that you can see when there is economic distress, that's probably the first part that

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.280
[Guest 1]: gets cut, because you don't want to lose the skilled labor, which is already scarce in

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:23.000
[Guest 1]: India. And at the same time, there is some cost cutting that goes on. And then the third

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.960
[Guest 1]: part is this kind of contractualization caused by uncertainty. We don't know if things are

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.440
[Guest 1]: going to get worse, right? We just laid off six people, we don't know if we need to lay

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:39.760
[Guest 1]: off 10 more people. So let's just sort of, you know, rework because it is hard, you know,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.400
[Guest 1]: we think of firing workers as sort of stroke of a pen thing, right? But when you're inside

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.720
[Guest 1]: working within a firm, these are real people. It's difficult to fire and burn bridges, and

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.320
[Guest 1]: then it's hard to hire them back when things are going well. So these sorts of arrangements

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.600
[Guest 1]: are a product of we really want to hold on to skilled labor, and yet, we want to deal

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.760
[Guest 1]: with the uncertainty. So I think broadly, you're right, it's not just a labor law issue.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:12.480
[Guest 1]: But that really, you know, that's the scaffolding that stifles everything else, you know, nothing

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.760
[Guest 1]: can expand past that.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:20.960
[Guest 3]: So I mean, talking about contract workers. So you look at a company like Maruti, and

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.400
[Guest 3]: I mean, from what I remember, half of their workers are contract workers, and half of

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:31.040
[Guest 3]: the workers are employees. So on the same, you know, floor, assembly floor, you might

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.920
[Guest 3]: have a situation where there are two people doing exactly the same thing. But one guy

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.760
[Guest 3]: because he's employed, might end up making probably twice or, you know, two and a half

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.720
[Guest 3]: times the guy who's on contract. So that's, and if you remember, there was a lot of violence

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:51.120
[Guest 3]: in the Gurgaon belt, a few years back in an HR manager was burnt by the Maruti by not

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.280
[Guest 3]: not at Maruti, this was at one of these auto ancillaries. So that's one point. The second

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:04.240
[Guest 3]: point about, you know, I find this term demographic dividend very, very funny. A dividend, I know,

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.880
[Guest 3]: we are assuming that there is a dividend already, it may not be a dividend, it might be a disaster

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.680
[Guest 3]: as well, which is what it is turning out to be. The third point is, I mean, demographic

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.800
[Guest 3]: dividend at a very simple level is that our parents basically produced way too many kids,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:27.200
[Guest 3]: right? On 15th August, I think the Prime Minister when he made his Independence Day speech talked

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.300
[Guest 3]: about population and the need to control it. And you know, this is a huge misconception

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.960
[Guest 3]: that people have, that India's population continues to grow, which is not really true.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.000
[Amit Varma]: This is one of my reforms. If it's not one of your reforms, stop right now. No, what

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.280
[Guest 3]: I'm trying to say is that, you know, the replacement rate is 2.1, whereas India's fertility rate,

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.920
[Guest 3]: you know, which is the average number of children a woman has is 2.3. So once you take the infant

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.960
[Guest 3]: mortality rate in India's case, which is anyway very high into account, so we are more or

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.440
[Guest 3]: less at the replacement rate. And many states in India, I mean, if you look at states like

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:11.800
[Guest 3]: Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, are now not producing, you know, kids at the replacement

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.840
[Guest 3]: rate. So their population over a period of time will start to contract. Now, it's states

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.520
[Guest 3]: like Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, you know, the original Bimaru states, where

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:28.280
[Guest 3]: the rates continue to be high. Now, as the medical facilities improve, and as more women

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.360
[Guest 3]: get educated, I mean, this is bound to come down.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.200
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to your first reform.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:40.320
[Guest 3]: Okay, so I just wanted to sort of, before I get into the reform, I wanted to sort of

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.200
[Guest 3]: make a long, long disclaimer. So you know, what happens is when you and I, I mean, you

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.920
[Guest 3]: know, given that we are so active on the social media, one of the things that sort of gets

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:57.200
[Guest 3]: thrown off thrown at us all the time is, you know, problem, problem, solution. Now, the

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.800
[Guest 3]: first thing is, you know, how do you come up with a solution without identifying the

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:07.480
[Guest 3]: problem? I mean, that's as basic as it gets. But having said that, you know, this entire

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:13.720
[Guest 3]: Indian tendency to sort of, you know, solution, but I think comes from the fact that when

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:19.000
[Guest 3]: we, you know, write our exams, when we grow up, a lot of the, in fact, most of the questions

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.320
[Guest 3]: have a right answer or a wrong answer. Okay. And that's primarily because of our focus

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:30.040
[Guest 3]: on science and maths and so on. And we look down upon subjects like history and geography

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:36.520
[Guest 3]: where. So, you know, so because of that, what happens is, this solution thing is very, very

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.680
[Guest 3]: strong, and which is what we're doing here today. Now, one of the things that I realized

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:48.880
[Guest 3]: while writing my, you know, book, last book, India's Big Government was that over the years,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.960
[Guest 3]: the government of India has constituted lots of committees on lots of issues. And all those

00:19:53.960 --> 00:20:00.160
[Guest 3]: committees have come up with recommendations and solutions. Or another, you know, that

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:05.960
[Guest 3]: you have so many economists and experts working for the government. They also write regularly

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:13.120
[Guest 3]: in publications, I mean, which the government sort of brings out. Now, what has happened

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.800
[Guest 3]: is that, you know, if you to give you a very, very simple example, now look at the banking

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:23.160
[Guest 3]: crisis currently, if you were to sort of go back to 1991, there was a Narasimhan committee,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.560
[Guest 3]: the first Narasimhan committee, as they call it, I mean, all the solutions are there in

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.440
[Guest 3]: that report. And if you look at, you know, various social and economic problems that

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.640
[Guest 3]: we've had, and, and the committees that were constituted to tackle them, those reports

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.720
[Guest 3]: have all those solutions already. Okay, so it's not like the government does not know

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:48.040
[Guest 3]: what is to be done. All they need to do is if you have a problem, just pick out the last

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.080
[Guest 3]: report and go ahead and implement it. But obviously, you know, these solutions have

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.640
[Guest 3]: not been implemented. I mean, even when a committee's solutions, recommendations are

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.640
[Guest 3]: taken on, they're diluted to a large extent, and then they are pushed through. So the long

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.480
[Guest 3]: and the short of it is that the government knows what is to be done. And this is not

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.760
[Guest 3]: just the current government, or the central government, I mean, includes the state governments,

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.960
[Guest 3]: the governments at the municipal level, but they don't do it.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.880
[Amit Varma]: I think if all governments are dissolved in water, you'll have a very interesting solution.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:29.880
[Guest 3]: Bad joke. So my point is, you know, it's, it's like, so I mean, since you were talking

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.480
[Guest 3]: about the fact that, you know, to give references, so before I sort of, you know, early, you

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.560
[Guest 3]: know, even though I'm an atheist, I like listening to bhajans, particularly by this gentleman

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.800
[Guest 3]: called Hari Omsharan, because I sort of grew up, I mean, if you grew up anywhere in North

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.680
[Guest 3]: or East India, you know, his voice was very, very, sort of, you know, I mean, you used

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.400
[Guest 3]: to listen to it every morning, because that is all the temples would play. I mean, this

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.640
[Guest 3]: is before, no, so this is before Gulshan Kumar and T-Series took over the game, and the bhajans

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.000
[Guest 3]: basically became film tunes. So, yeah.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.080
[Guest 3]: And the film tunes also became jagrata tunes.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.240
[Guest 3]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, both of them. So, so, so basically, so this, this, the line from

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:18.320
[Guest 3]: this bhajan is ki, man maila aur tan ko dhoye. So, the economic, you know, inference here

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.240
[Guest 3]: is that, you know, you keep tackling the symptom without looking at the problem. So, in the

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.240
[Guest 3]: current situation,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.720
[Amit Varma]: Or it could also mean, man maila aur tan ko dhoye, could also mean that you're really

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.840
[Amit Varma]: a perv, but you're virtue signalling on Twitter.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.760
[Guest 3]: I don't know what that means. So, so, virtue signalling is like, I mean,

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:44.040
[Guest 3]: So, look at the current situation, you know, you talk to a corporate, you talk to an economist,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.440
[Guest 3]: and everyone's like, interest rates should be cut, interest rates should be cut. I mean,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.440
[Guest 3]: what will happen, you know, if the home loan is not at, you know, let's say, 8%, and it's

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.680
[Guest 3]: at seven and a half? I mean, how will that help in any way? So, this is like, you know,

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.800
[Guest 3]: you're just looking at the symptom that people are probably not borrowing. So, just cut interest

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.720
[Guest 3]: rates. But you are not looking at why is it that people are not borrowing. So, anyway,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:15.200
[Guest 3]: so that was the long disclaimer, ki kuch hona nahi hai, but still, since we are here, we

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.600
[Guest 3]: need to do our jobs properly. So, the first thing I sort of wanted to talk about is, and

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.880
[Guest 3]: this is something a little, it's not really an, you know, I wouldn't call it an economic

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.880
[Guest 3]: reform, but it's more of a reform in education. Now, what has happened over the years, over

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.120
[Guest 3]: the last 70 years is that even, you know, the government has essentially paid a lot

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.600
[Guest 3]: of attention on higher education. But the long and the short of it is that our primary

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.800
[Guest 3]: education system is basically pretty much screwed up. And it's been screwed up even

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.000
[Guest 3]: more after the right to education was put in place, which we have discussed in an episode.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.400
[Guest 3]: We have, yeah. So, one of the key clauses in right to education, I mean, if you read

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.840
[Guest 3]: the Bear Act, is that the teacher has to complete the syllabus. Okay. Now, because of this,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:06.040
[Guest 3]: what happens is that, you know, students who come to school at a young age and come from

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.300
[Guest 3]: a very reading deficient background tend to lose out because the teacher is essentially

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.640
[Guest 3]: interested in completing the syllabus. And because of that, he ends up, he or she ends

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.800
[Guest 3]: up concentrating only on the best students in the class who are picking up stuff. That's

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.960
[Guest 3]: the first part of the problem. The second part of the problem is that there are no exams

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.240
[Guest 3]: till class eight. So, irrespective of whether you are learning or not, you keep getting

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.960
[Guest 3]: promoted and you reach class eight. Now, what has happened is in 2018 and 2019, you know,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:38.320
[Guest 3]: the first batch of RTE students who started in, you know, lower KG or preparatory or whatever

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.960
[Guest 3]: you call it, in 2010, have now reached a stage where they have to write exams and they have

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.560
[Guest 3]: never written exams in their life. So, this is the new crisis which is brewing and the

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.640
[Guest 3]: parents don't know, even those who sort of, you know, belong to the well-off categories

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:59.520
[Guest 3]: as to what to do with this. I mean, if a student has never written exams. So, my thing is that

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.120
[Guest 3]: this is a problem that needs to be tackled seriously. And it's not about throwing more

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.560
[Guest 3]: money at, you know, as a lot of people keep saying, and that includes me, that the government

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.600
[Guest 3]: doesn't spend enough money on education. But you have to look at the situation a little

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.440
[Guest 3]: more creatively. So, one solution, because, you know, which is what we all love, is something

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:25.960
[Guest 3]: that, you know, Abhijit Banerjee, who's a famous economist at MIT, he shared with me

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:31.240
[Guest 3]: many years back, and he talked about how they had carried out a small experiment in Bihar,

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.040
[Guest 3]: in schools in Bihar, where they had hired teachers who were given contract teachers

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.680
[Guest 3]: who were trained for two weeks. And then these guys went and taught in all these schools.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:48.360
[Guest 3]: And they had a very clear motive, as in, they didn't have to complete the syllabus, what

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.080
[Guest 3]: they had to do is they had to ensure that if a student couldn't read, he had to be taught

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.480
[Guest 3]: to read. If he couldn't write, he had to be taught to write. And if he couldn't do basic

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:03.360
[Guest 3]: maths, plus minus, he had to be taught that. And when they sort of went back and, you know,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.080
[Guest 3]: you do a study, and you have a control group, and you know, you do all that. And when they

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.720
[Guest 3]: sort of measured it, they found that the method, at least in the experiment, really helped.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:19.120
[Guest 3]: So you have to look at the entire problem from a very, very lateral point of view.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.120
[Guest 1]: So,

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.680
[Guest 1]: I would just add a couple more things to Vivek. He's absolutely right. The RT is a total mess.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.760
[Guest 1]: It has a schedule at the back. Okay. And one of the things that the act says is, you know,

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.840
[Guest 1]: every school must have this list of things. And if you look at those things, all of them

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.900
[Guest 1]: are inputs. You know, so clearly these people, so Alex Tabarrok, and I have written some

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:49.440
[Guest 1]: work on what Lantridge calls isomorphic mimicry, right? So this is basically you go to Denmark

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.480
[Guest 1]: or something, you know, you go to the United States, you look around and you're like, what

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:59.160
[Guest 1]: does a good school look like? Oh, a good school has large, airy classrooms, chalo, large,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:05.720
[Guest 1]: airy classrooms, right? So a good school has such and such teacher to pupil ratio, right?

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:11.080
[Guest 1]: A good school has bathroom facilities, a good school has a separate kitchen area, a good

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.840
[Guest 1]: school has a playground, which is at least 40 meters by 20 meters. So they make a note

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.080
[Guest 1]: of all this, right? So when the government asked them, and this is where I disagree a

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:26.680
[Guest 1]: little bit with Vivek, I think there is some knowledge crisis also in the government. They,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.720
[Guest 1]: the things they know are not the right things to know, right? So they're like, we know what

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.620
[Guest 1]: a good school looks like. This is what a good school looks like. And if you fundamentally

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:42.520
[Guest 1]: think education should be mandated top down, then it's easier to mandate inputs than outcomes,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:49.360
[Guest 1]: right? Because outcomes mean you'll have to be tested. And then so it is not a coincidence

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.640
[Guest 1]: that these kids are not tested until eighth standard, right? We like to think they just

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.440
[Guest 1]: kind of forgot and said no child left behind. No child left behind is also an American and

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.440
[Guest 1]: foreign import.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.680
[Guest 1]: There are exams there. It's not like there are no exams.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.800
[Guest 1]: There are exams. So the fact that there are, it's completely devoid of any outcomes, you

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:14.200
[Guest 1]: know, you see that schedule, there's not one single outcome, right? Now, all these economists,

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.080
[Guest 1]: including some of these, you know, very fine, eminent MIT economists, and so on.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.720
[Guest 3]: She doesn't like Banerjee and Duflo, which is what she's saying.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.840
[Guest 1]: No, that's not true. I actually very, they've written a lovely book called Poor Economics.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:31.200
[Guest 1]: I strongly recommend it. But one of the things that has come out of the, of the halls of

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.920
[Guest 1]: MIT is this randomized control trial business, right? So these people now come and measure

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.200
[Guest 1]: and what is measurable is inputs, right?

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.920
[Guest 1]: So as Vivek pointed out, one of the things is the teacher needs to complete the syllabus.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.440
[Guest 1]: Another thing is that the teacher is a union employee, right? They get paid a lot of money,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.720
[Guest 1]: whether they show up or not. So what all these people found was all these schools are there,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.400
[Guest 1]: they have the correct size window, they have a bathroom, they have a kitchen, they have

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.520
[Guest 1]: a playground, but the teachers don't show up.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.800
[Guest 1]: So all there are like RCTs, one after the other, which are trying to figure out how

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.680
[Guest 1]: to reduce teacher absenteeism, right? And we've kind of forgotten the point. The point

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:19.360
[Guest 1]: of the schooling was not that the teacher shows up, it was that the students learn.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:25.160
[Guest 1]: We assume that the teacher showing up is instrumental to the student learning, right? But that was

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.960
[Guest 1]: not our end goal. So these people have really confused what the end goal is. They think

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:37.360
[Guest 1]: end goal is delivery of inputs by the state. The end goal is actually that students need

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.720
[Guest 1]: to know how to write their name by the time they're in second standard, and they need

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.160
[Guest 1]: to know how to do arithmetic by fifth standard, and they need to be able to take an exam.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.800
[Guest 1]: So I think there is much more wrong with the RT and Vivek was actually being very, very

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.000
[Guest 1]: generous and kind to the education bureaucrats.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.920
[Guest 2]: So I would completely agree with Shruti. First of all, I really like the point about isomorphic

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.880
[Guest 2]: mimicry because I think that applies not just in education, but in many other areas of so-called

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.200
[Guest 2]: public sector reforms that we just see somewhere, something very nice and shiny. And we think

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.680
[Guest 2]: if we transplant that to India, it will work like a miracle. And we do exactly that. And

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.200
[Guest 2]: we don't really, that's a hollow structure and we don't do anything inside. And I think

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.960
[Guest 2]: this input and outcome thing that Shruti mentioned, I would just put a little bit more structure

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:25.560
[Guest 2]: to it. So the way I look at it, it is basically input, output, outcome. So there are some

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.440
[Guest 2]: inputs that you're putting in to reform any particular sector of the economy or the state,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.720
[Guest 2]: then you need to measure what is the output. Let's say in this particular example, how

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.800
[Guest 2]: many students are graduating in a particular class, or how many boys versus girls. So these

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.760
[Guest 2]: are the tangible outputs that you can measure. And it is very important for any reform to

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:49.720
[Guest 2]: have this tangible output measure, not just looking at the input. And the final thing,

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.920
[Guest 2]: which is very important is the outcome, that not only are you graduating a certain number

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.400
[Guest 2]: of boys and girls, but what is it they're really learning. The learning is the outcome

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.040
[Guest 2]: and the output is the students going from one class to the other or leaving the school

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.280
[Guest 2]: or more students coming in. And the input would be the infrastructure, the teachers.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.560
[Guest 2]: Unless we design all our reforms in this kind of a structure, we'll just keep doing that

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.160
[Guest 2]: isomorphic mimicry and we'll keep building the inputs, but then there'll be absolutely

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.080
[Guest 2]: no evaluation of the output and the outcome, which is I think what ends up happening. And

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:26.520
[Guest 2]: I have one more point to what Vivek's disclaimer was. I think it's absolutely fine to have

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:32.240
[Guest 2]: committees and committee reports. And that's the way a lot of governments function. And

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.360
[Guest 2]: I think the problem that happens in the implementation of the committee recommendations is a vast

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.960
[Guest 2]: black box called political economy. I mean, economists will recommend whatever we want

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.440
[Guest 2]: to recommend. And like in the banking example that you gave, right? I mean, when 70% of

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.440
[Guest 2]: the banking sector is owned by the government, and the banks are regulated, it's not true

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:58.360
[Guest 3]: anymore. It is. No, it's not. It is. No, it's not. As of March 2019, 63% of loans in India

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.480
[Guest 3]: were given by public sector banks, and they had only 58% of the deposits. So even if I

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:08.000
[Guest 3]: take 60%, the majority of the banking sector is still owned by the government. But that

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.680
[Guest 3]: is changing. And in the next five years, you will have public sector banks. But till now,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.480
[Guest 2]: all the problems that have happened in the banking sector, look at the NPA, 90% of the

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.320
[Guest 2]: NPAs are in the public sector banks, not in the private banks, right? And if these banks

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.720
[Guest 2]: are owned by the government, and they're regulated by an agent of the government, it's like the

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.720
[Guest 2]: agent is regulating the principle, it's never going to work no matter what committees are

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.080
[Guest 2]: recommending. So I think committee recommendation is somewhere and the political economy of

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.080
[Guest 3]: the state is somewhere else.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.880
[Guest 3]: So it's like, you know, we talk about what are the structural factors, you know, this

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.680
[Guest 3]: is the new, you know, not a new jargon, but it's sort of come back.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.880
[Amit Varma]: It's new for you, you're learning. It's not new for me. There's something called a structural

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.880
[Unknown]: slowdown.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:56.240
[Unknown]: We're recording this, by the way, on August 23rd.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.640
[Guest 3]: It is not a cyclical slowdown.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.440
[Guest 3]: I have to write a column on this for Dainik Jagran after I'm out of here. So whether it's

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.480
[Guest 3]: a cyclical slowdown or a structural slowdown.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.720
[Guest 2]: What's the Hindi of structural slowdown?

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720
[Amit Varma]: That I'll figure out.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720
[Amit Varma]: Okay, these are digressions.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.760
[Guest 3]: Google Translate. No, so what I was saying was, so the biggest structural problem are

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.900
[Guest 3]: basically the politicians.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.720
[Guest 3]: So and what do you do about them?

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:22.240
[Guest 3]: So which is where all these committee reports get confined to the dustbins of history and

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.480
[Guest 3]: you know, then people like me dig it out to sort of read and make a living.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.120
[Guest 1]: You know, I agree with you, but I also disagree with you a little bit.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:39.080
[Guest 1]: We have this whole input, output, outcome business only in government, right?

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.400
[Guest 1]: So if government is in the business of making bread, like it used to own Modern Bakery,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400
[Guest 1]: not that long ago.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.240
[Guest 1]: In my living memory, it used to own Modern Bakery.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.360
[Guest 3]: Yeah, we've all grown up eating modern bread.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360
[Guest 1]: It's disgusting.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.960
[Guest 1]: It's like one step above cardboard, right?

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.120
[Guest 1]: So there is the input that goes into making bread.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.040
[Guest 1]: Then there is the output, how many slices of bread or how many kilos or how many loaves

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.780
[Guest 1]: of bread, so on and so forth.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.160
[Guest 1]: And then there's the outcome, which is vomit, okay?

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.640
[Guest 1]: So that's how we evaluate government made bread.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.300
[Guest 1]: How do we evaluate just bread, right?

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.420
[Guest 1]: We go to the market, we pick the bread we like, right?

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.700
[Guest 1]: You vote with your money.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:24.920
[Guest 1]: The more number of people think this is good quality bread at a particular price.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:32.600
[Guest 1]: So now when you're in the business of government controlling education, then we have to slice

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.280
[Guest 1]: and dice and then that system can be gamed, right?

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.120
[Guest 1]: Then we can make the outcome how many kids are graduating.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.360
[Guest 2]: So then the problem goes even more fundamental.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.360
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.400
[Guest 1]: Is it the government's business to be in education?

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.400
[Amit Varma]: Which is one of my reforms.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.560
[Amit Varma]: No, actually, that's not the appropriate question.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.120
[Guest 1]: I think the appropriate question is, is it the government's business to be in education

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.920
[Guest 1]: to the exclusion of everyone else?

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Okay, may I butt in here?

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.400
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.080
[Guest 1]: The government wants to eliminate competition.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.800
[Amit Varma]: I'll butt in here because this is one of my reforms and therefore I will ask you to wait

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.280
[Amit Varma]: a little bit and we will change the order and I will get this reform over with.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.520
[Amit Varma]: So my reform basically is that we allow schools for profit.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Now I want to set a little bit of context here.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.240
[Amit Varma]: What really happened in the 50s and 60s was that we had a mindset that private enterprise

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.240
[Amit Varma]: was bad.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.540
[Amit Varma]: Jawaharlal Nehru famously said to JRD Tata, do not speak to me of profit.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.720
[Amit Varma]: Profit is a dirty word, stop quote.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.240
[Amit Varma]: And as a result of that, there was a sense that there are some sectors of the economy

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.360
[Amit Varma]: which are too important to leave to the private sector.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.760
[Amit Varma]: The government has to do them.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.440
[Amit Varma]: And one of them, of course, was education.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.840
[Amit Varma]: And there were a lot of sectors which were part of this.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:46.200
[Amit Varma]: And what really happened with liberalization is that some of the sectors in which the government

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.640
[Amit Varma]: was controlling and there wasn't much private participation, were basically opened up.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:56.040
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you remember, back in the 80s, you know, you could only fly Air India

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.040
[Amit Varma]: or Indian Airlines, they were prohibitively expensive.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.600
[Amit Varma]: If you wanted a telephone, you had a five year waiting list, all of that, telecom got

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.680
[Amit Varma]: opened up, airlines got opened up.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.120
[Amit Varma]: And instantly, you know, we can see the difference all around us.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.040
[Amit Varma]: Today, a phone is accessible to anyone.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.020
[Amit Varma]: And far more people can afford to fly than was the case earlier.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:19.280
[Amit Varma]: The problem with education is that we haven't allowed schools for profit.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:25.700
[Amit Varma]: And what that does with not necessarily debarring them, but with a host of regulations like

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.960
[Amit Varma]: your playground has to be this size and blah, blah, blah, and it just becomes almost impossible

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.640
[Amit Varma]: to run a school for profit.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.800
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of private schools that exist do jugars with trusts and all of that.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And the result of that is that the amount of choice that is available for parents goes

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.280
[Amit Varma]: down massively.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.920
[Amit Varma]: And what you see across the country is people have this impression that private schools

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.000
[Amit Varma]: are just very expensive.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And they're only for the elites.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.280
[Amit Varma]: That's not at all true.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.560
[Amit Varma]: What you see across the country is you have budget private schools opening up in slums.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.920
[Amit Varma]: James Tully has written a book on this, I forget the name, and there have been studies

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.220
[Amit Varma]: by the Center for Civil Society.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:08.480
[Amit Varma]: And we know from Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, that you have situations where schools open

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:15.160
[Amit Varma]: up impromptu in the slums, and like, poor parents like domestic help and auto rickshaw

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.400
[Amit Varma]: drivers and so on, prefer to pay 100 bucks or 200 bucks a month to send their kid to

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.120
[Amit Varma]: that school rather than to a free government school.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, they're basically voting with their feet, which is as it should be, and which is how

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.160
[Amit Varma]: people choose bread, for example, by voting with their wallets.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.720
[Amit Varma]: And I am often mischaracterized for saying that the government should get out of education,

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.600
[Amit Varma]: what will happen there, which is not my case at all.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.520
[Amit Varma]: My case is simply that the government should do the same thing in education, which it did

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:47.160
[Amit Varma]: in airlines and telecom, you allow private players to participate without any conditions.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.120
[Amit Varma]: Nobody wants to open a budget private school in a slum in a room only with no playground,

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:57.000
[Amit Varma]: allow them to do so, don't harass them, let the market vote with their feet, see what

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.360
[Amit Varma]: happens and get rid of this mentality that profit is a dirty word because the only way

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.400
[Amit Varma]: anyone can profit is by fulfilling somebody else's need.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.360
[Amit Varma]: That is the only way to profit.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.720
[Amit Varma]: Profit is therefore the greatest form of philanthropy.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.200
[Amit Varma]: And I think this is like a fundamental mind shift that needs to happen, especially in

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.800
[Amit Varma]: education, where to add a point and to connect it to the jobs crisis.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.160
[Amit Varma]: There is a massive mismatch today between the kind of workers coming out into the field

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.040
[Amit Varma]: and the kind of skills that are needed.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.120
[Amit Varma]: People do PhDs and MPhils and they simply have no employable skills.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:37.560
[Amit Varma]: And where does such a demand supply mismatch happen, where there is no market at play?

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.440
[Amit Varma]: Allow the freaking market.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.960
[Guest 1]: I would add one more thing.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:47.520
[Guest 1]: I think there is no greater damning evidence that a system has completely failed when parents

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:54.200
[Guest 1]: from really poor families would spend close to half their income and spend four thousand

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.280
[Guest 1]: or five thousand rupees to send their children to a for-profit tiny school where you're sort

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.000
[Guest 1]: of, you know, stacked like sardines rather than go to the government school, which is

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.640
[Guest 1]: for free and which is nearby.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:14.240
[Guest 1]: And one very large part of not allowing for-profit schools is the optics will be terrible because

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.400
[Guest 1]: right now they can show the nice building with the airy windows and no teachers and

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.920
[Guest 1]: no students and then compare it to these terribly crowded, you know, they actually look quite

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.920
[Guest 1]: bad.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.920
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.320
[Guest 1]: I went to maths tuition in 10th standard or 11th standard in one of these rooms where

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.760
[Guest 1]: it was like a capacity for 30 people and 90 people were stacked.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.280
[Guest 1]: But the quality of the maths being taught to us was fantastic.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.160
[Guest 1]: It doesn't look good.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.940
[Guest 1]: So they produce these documents in court and say, look at these people commercializing.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.160
[Guest 1]: These children don't have room to breathe.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.640
[Guest 1]: There is no window in the room.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.720
[Guest 1]: They don't get bathroom breaks.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.720
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.240
[Guest 1]: So if you really genuinely allowed for-profit schools, those schools would be able to invest.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.140
[Guest 1]: See, right now, the schools are under tremendous uncertainty.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:03.440
[Guest 1]: You know, in Sangam Vihar in Delhi, they shut down like five, six hundred schools like this

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.440
[Guest 1]: every year.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.840
[Guest 1]: They have this little raid, they take their, you know, billboards down and then one year

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.840
[Guest 2]: later they back up.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.120
[Guest 2]: So I have a question here.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.880
[Guest 2]: Is that other than the government causing obstacles like this, right, like going to

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.520
[Guest 2]: the court and taking them down, etc.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:21.600
[Guest 2]: Legally speaking or from a regulatory perspective or institution wise, is there any bottleneck

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.880
[Guest 2]: or obstacle for the private sector to set up primary education?

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.160
[Guest 1]: So the licensing requirement.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.800
[Guest 1]: So first of all, this is state and municipal, right?

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:35.840
[Guest 1]: The licensing requirements to set up any school is just incredibly high.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.520
[Guest 1]: So even the best, you know, posh convent schools are breaking half a dozen rules at any given

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.680
[Guest 1]: point in time, because to open a new school, I think the number that I last read was 34

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.680
[Guest 1]: or 44.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.720
[Guest 1]: Like, you just need a ridiculous number of licenses.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.640
[Guest 1]: That's one kind of bottleneck.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.920
[Guest 1]: The other kind of bottleneck is, you know, a school is supposed to be a structure that

00:40:54.920 --> 00:41:00.480
[Guest 1]: lasts for a really long time, right, which means when you go to these old countries,

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:05.120
[Guest 1]: you know, these European countries and you see the school was set up in 1500 or 1400,

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.000
[Guest 1]: they set it up as if it was supposed to exist forever.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.920
[Guest 1]: Now if you're constantly under regulatory threat that someone's going to come and shut

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.680
[Guest 1]: down your shutter, you're not going to invest in windows, right?

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.120
[Guest 1]: You invest in the bare bones, which is benches, markers, the teacher and the students showing

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.120
[Guest 1]: up and that's it.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.880
[Guest 1]: You don't invest in anything else.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.360
[Guest 1]: So private schools also look terrible.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.680
[Guest 1]: Even the budget private schools look terrible, even though there's so much money in education

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.880
[Guest 1]: and people would like to invest, because it's so difficult to invest in education and get

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.880
[Guest 2]: a return on it.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.900
[Guest 2]: So essentially this reform, what I'm trying to understand is what are the tangible things

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.880
[Guest 2]: required to make this reform work.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.640
[Amit Varma]: And this would be amending a lot of laws and require regulatory licensing requirements.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.880
[Amit Varma]: I've actually had a great episode on this with Amit Chandra, who actually works in this

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.880
[Amit Varma]: specific field.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880
[Amit Varma]: It's an over one hour episode.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.880
[Amit Varma]: That's really good.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.680
[Amit Varma]: I recommend listeners check that out.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:03.640
[Amit Varma]: And also, I would just add that the larger point here is of agency and choice.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Parents are in the best position to make a decision about where the kids should go to

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
[Amit Varma]: school.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
[Amit Varma]: You are robbing them of choice.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.320
[Amit Varma]: No one is saying shut down the government schools, keep them going, but you're robbing

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.000
[Amit Varma]: them of choice by not allowing private providers.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.280
[Amit Varma]: Imagine if the same thing happened to bread, there would be so much outrage.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.440
[Amit Varma]: It happens in education, which is so much more important than bread and there is no

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.680
[Amit Varma]: outrage and Vivek.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680
[Guest 3]: Couple of points.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:29.040
[Guest 3]: So one is that, you know, because of all this, you know, we have an employment crisis.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.040
[Guest 3]: We also have an employability crisis.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:37.400
[Guest 3]: So even when companies put out, you know, posts for jobs, they don't get the right candidates.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.960
[Guest 3]: The second point I would like to make, and you know, this is education for profit.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.880
[Guest 3]: I mean, look at the fact that a lot of private equity money is now going into tutorials.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.640
[Guest 3]: I mean, if education for profit was allowed, and I mean, tutorial is nothing just, you

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.080
[Guest 3]: know, you're beating the system by you're starting a school, but you call it a tutorial.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.600
[Amit Varma]: You're filling a gap in the system.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.760
[Guest 3]: The question is, why is that gap there?

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.520
[Guest 3]: So the gaps there and someone's filling in that gap and he's getting private equity money.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.960
[Guest 3]: Now that private equity money could easily go to an a real education entrepreneur who's

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.300
[Guest 3]: setting up real schools and so on and so forth.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.720
[Guest 3]: So I mean, why should all the private equity money go to Swiggy and you know,

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:24.680
[Amit Varma]: I think we're spending so much time per reform that we, you know, maybe we should leave jobs

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.440
[Amit Varma]: and education behind us.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.920
[Guest 2]: Thank you so much.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.040
[Guest 2]: So actually, yeah, I will not talk about jobs and education, but I'll talk about something

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.300
[Guest 2]: that is related to government spending.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.760
[Guest 2]: So taking the cues from what Amit said about, you know, government should let the private

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.600
[Guest 2]: sector come in and all of that.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:47.120
[Guest 2]: So my reform is basically about fiscal discipline, which I think is an extremely important thing

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.860
[Guest 2]: for the government to follow.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:53.840
[Guest 2]: So whenever a government spends money, there are, let's say, three ways for the government

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840
[Guest 2]: to finance that expenditure.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.960
[Guest 2]: You can either tax the current generation, which is in a way the most fair way to do

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.800
[Guest 2]: because the current generation is also benefiting from the goodies that the government is giving.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.960
[Guest 2]: Or you tax the future generation, which is unfair because the future generation is not

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.140
[Guest 2]: benefiting from the government spending.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.040
[Guest 2]: The second way would be to borrow.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.880
[Guest 2]: And at some point, you will have to repay what you have borrowed.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.240
[Guest 2]: And the third is to basically print money and inflate your way out of it, which is a

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.580
[Guest 2]: big burden on the poor.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.800
[Guest 2]: So either which way, whenever the government ends up spending, the burden falls on the

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.540
[Guest 2]: taxpayer either today or tomorrow, one way or the other.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.040
[Guest 2]: And what the government typically ends up doing is, and this is not just the Indian

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.480
[Guest 2]: government, this is governments in general have a temptation to spend 100 rupees today

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.840
[Guest 2]: and tax only 90 rupees.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.120
[Guest 2]: This makes us feel very good because we are getting goodies worth of rupees 100, but we

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.840
[Guest 2]: are only bearing the burden of 90.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.520
[Guest 2]: But what ends up happening is that 10 rupees gets pushed out to the next generation.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.960
[Guest 2]: So we make our children pay more for what we are enjoying today.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.640
[Guest 2]: And this is basically the classic way that what is called fiscal deficit, right, keeps

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.440
[Guest 2]: on increasing and increasing.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.840
[Guest 2]: And that keeps on adding to the debt burden of the government.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.960
[Guest 2]: And that's a very serious problem.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:04.960
[Guest 2]: Because if governments give in to this temptation of spending and pushing the taxing in the

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.040
[Guest 2]: future generation, then this can go on forever.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.480
[Guest 2]: And generation after generation keeps paying for this.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.640
[Guest 2]: And we have recently seen in Europe, for example, what happens when there is a sovereign debt

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.440
[Guest 2]: crisis when governments default on their debt and so on so forth.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:23.640
[Guest 2]: Now coming to India, there is now given that we have Aadhaar and we have Jan Dhan accounts

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.360
[Guest 2]: and whatnot, there is not only a temptation for the government to spend, but there is

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.200
[Guest 2]: also a very easy way for the government to spend because all you have to do is essentially

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.200
[Guest 2]: just keep giving your transfers and direct benefits or what have you made to these bank

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.200
[Guest 2]: accounts.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:42.640
[Guest 2]: And what we have also seen is that the government has practically no interest to listen to whatever

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:48.080
[Guest 2]: our Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management Act, a long thing, FRBM Act stipulated because

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.600
[Guest 2]: that has become a farce and there is no real consequence for the government to violate

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.600
[Guest 2]: it.

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.200
[Guest 2]: And every year when the budget is presented, we spend a lot of time writing and discussing

00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.760
[Guest 2]: what is the actual fiscal deficit, what has been pushed out of the budget, so on so forth.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:06.160
[Guest 2]: So fiscal discipline, I think, is a big crisis in India and has been so for a while.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:11.960
[Guest 2]: So one reform that I can think of is, and it's a bit of a draconian thing, but I think

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:16.400
[Guest 2]: that's what is needed, is something what Germany did.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.360
[Guest 2]: In the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, when the temptation of the government to give

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:26.440
[Guest 2]: a fiscal stimulus was very high, and when Germany was in the acute shock of the financial

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:31.480
[Guest 2]: crisis, the German debt to GDP had reached 80 percent and they were only supposed to

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.980
[Guest 2]: be at 60 percent according to the Maastricht Treaty.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.880
[Guest 2]: So what the German constitution, what the German government did, which I think is remarkable,

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.800
[Guest 2]: they were decent enough to say that at the time when the temptation of the government

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.640
[Guest 2]: to run a high fiscal deficit is so big, we are going to tie the hands of the government.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:55.120
[Guest 2]: And so they enshrined in the German constitutional law something called a debt break, which stipulated

00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:02.600
[Guest 2]: that by 2016, the overall structural deficit of the government will be at a tight maximum

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.640
[Guest 2]: of 0.35 percent of GDP.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.160
[Guest 2]: Now, imagine you're starting at a point where the debt to GDP ratio is 83 percent.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.000
[Guest 2]: And technically, you're saying that in the next four or five years, you bring down the

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.400
[Guest 2]: structural deficit to 0.35 percent of GDP, which means your debt gradually goes down

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.160
[Guest 2]: to 60 percent from 83 percent at a time when Germany is in the throes of the financial

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.160
[Guest 2]: crisis.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:29.840
[Guest 2]: And all the states of Germany will bring down the deficit to zero by 2020.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.240
[Guest 2]: So this was a really, really tight fiscal discipline rule where Germany imposed a balanced

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.440
[Guest 2]: budget on itself.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:44.080
[Guest 2]: And the consequence of that was that over the next seven years, from 2012 to now, Germany

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.680
[Guest 2]: has run a budget surplus in each of the years.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:53.240
[Guest 2]: And last year, the German budget surplus was as high as 1.7 percent of GDP.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:58.040
[Guest 2]: And now the debt to GDP is actually at 60 percent, it's projected to be 50 percent.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:02.040
[Guest 2]: So it's a remarkable thing that they have done, and it's not that the German government

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.040
[Guest 2]: is not spending.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.320
[Guest 2]: What they have done is you are essentially financing your expenses just from your revenue

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.840
[Guest 2]: and you're shrinking your public debt, which is exactly what John Maynard Keynes would

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.680
[Guest 2]: recommend, which is exactly what any fiscal sound principle would recommend, that you

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.960
[Guest 2]: spend during bad times and you save during good times.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.640
[Guest 2]: And basically, if you save during good times, what it does is when the next bad time comes,

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.880
[Guest 2]: you have the credibility and the space to borrow.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:32.040
[Guest 2]: Otherwise, if you keep borrowing and spending, you are just in that perpetual fiscal deficit

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:35.280
[Guest 2]: mode where there is no credibility and nobody will want to lend you money if there is a

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.940
[Guest 2]: war, if there is a deep recession.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:42.160
[Guest 2]: The only exception the German debt break constitutional amendment has is natural disasters and deep

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.160
[Guest 2]: recession.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.080
[Guest 2]: Other than that, you have to stick to this rule.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.780
[Guest 2]: And I think that is something it's high time we introduce in India.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:53.360
[Guest 2]: And since constitutional amendment is not very difficult these days, we should enshrine

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.580
[Guest 2]: that in the constitution and make a meaningful change to say we are going to tie down the

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:02.560
[Guest 2]: hands of our government and that will force the government to prioritize its expenses.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:07.200
[Guest 2]: Instead of announcing 65 different schemes, which nobody is monitoring, you prioritize

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.600
[Guest 2]: that, OK, if these are the five schemes which are important, I'm going to do this and then

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.240
[Guest 2]: gradually shrink the size of the government.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.160
[Guest 2]: And as you said, let the private sector, let the market give them a chance and let them

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.160
[Guest 2]: work.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.320
[Guest 2]: Otherwise, we'll end up in a situation where the government is so intrusive in our lives

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.480
[Guest 2]: that it just keeps becoming a fatter and fatter cat.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.080
[Guest 2]: And who's financing it?

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.080
[Guest 3]: We.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:34.600
[Guest 3]: So, I mean, clearly, she doesn't believe in the modern monetary theory and which is a

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.600
[Guest 3]: huge thing these days.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:41.680
[Guest 3]: I mean, when the moment you talk about fiscal deficit on the social media, people will jump

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.720
[Guest 3]: on you, citing this new area of economics.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.240
[Guest 2]: Because everyone on social media is a trained economist, especially when I usually don't

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.000
[Guest 3]: believe in things which are huge things.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.600
[Guest 3]: And the second point, you know, in Germany's case, they were lucky to have had the hyperinflation

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.140
[Guest 3]: of 1923, because all that economic thinking goes back to that.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.640
[Guest 3]: And then they tend to do the right things.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.040
[Guest 3]: I mean, every other nation is not as lucky.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.120
[Guest 3]: The third point I wanted to make is and I mean, this is something, you know, we've had

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:16.080
[Guest 3]: long conversations on is the fact that the fiscal deficit of the central government,

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.600
[Guest 3]: you know, when we say is 3.4 or 3.3% of the GDP, I mean, that's one big sham.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:25.560
[Guest 3]: I mean, if you look at the total public sector borrowing requirement, as you know, the total

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:30.120
[Guest 3]: borrowing of the government is termed as it comes to clearly, you know, it comes to 8.5%,

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:39.040
[Guest 3]: 9% of the GDP in an era where our financial savings have come down dramatically.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.160
[Guest 3]: So I mean, one is that, you know, fiscal deficit is not represented correctly.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:47.600
[Guest 3]: And the other point, the more important point is that this is why interest rates are not

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.600
[Guest 3]: going to come down.

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.440
[Guest 3]: I mean, you can keep cutting the repo rate till kingdom come.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.080
[Guest 3]: But the banks ultimately have to compete with the government.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.200
[Guest 3]: So unless the government sort of cuts its expenditure, the interest rates are not going

00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.200
[Guest 2]: to come down.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:03.840
[Guest 2]: And one point to add to what Vivek said is, ironically enough, our government expenditure

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.280
[Guest 2]: is ballooned at a time when apparently our economy has been booming, you know, it doesn't

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:15.200
[Guest 2]: make any sense that if the GDP growth is showing that we are growing at 7.5, 8.2% in a quarter,

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.920
[Guest 2]: that is the time when your government expenditure fiscal deficit is not able to stick to their

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.120
[Guest 2]: FRBM target and you're going to 3.4, 3.5% of GDP.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.080
[Guest 2]: It doesn't make any economic sense whatsoever.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:29.360
[Guest 2]: Yeah, if you explain to me, fine, we are in a deep recession, you need to give some real

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.980
[Guest 2]: good stimulus to infrastructure projects to yank the economy out of it.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.200
[Guest 2]: And you're going to cut expenses on the schemes.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.200
[Guest 2]: That's a different thing.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.160
[Guest 2]: But we are doing schemes, we are doing apparently some infrastructure, we are doing everything,

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.680
[Guest 2]: because the government is doing all the spending, because all the other demand sources in the

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680
[Guest 2]: economy have gone to sleep.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:49.480
[Guest 2]: So we have no investment, no exports, no consumption, nobody's buying toothpaste or biscuits or

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.480
[Guest 2]: cars.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.800
[Guest 2]: But the government is the big giant elephant in the room who's spending, because the government

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.080
[Guest 2]: has access to some real secret source of money hidden away somewhere.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.280
[Guest 2]: Of course, that's not true, because we are all paying for that.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.720
[Guest 3]: You've got some really nice statues.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:07.360
[Guest 3]: So which is why the next point here is that when businesses now ask for a fiscal stimulus,

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.440
[Guest 3]: the point is, if you look at data over the last two years, the fiscal stimulus is already

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440
[Guest 3]: there in the system.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:17.080
[Guest 3]: And it's a huge one, because if you look at government, just the government expenditure,

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.600
[Guest 3]: it grew by 19% in 17-18 and 13% in 18-19.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:27.040
[Guest 3]: And it's the biggest growth in the last 10 years, I mean, if you leave out the part around

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.040
[Guest 3]: the financial crisis.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.560
[Guest 2]: So it's the nature of the fiscal stimulus, Vivek.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:39.760
[Guest 2]: So for example, if I give you the analogy, so in 1999-2002, we had another economic slowdown.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.920
[Guest 2]: We had a very big economic stagnation, we had a slowdown.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:46.160
[Guest 2]: And that was also the time when the government had given a fiscal stimulus.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.240
[Guest 2]: But that stimulus was in the form of, let's say, an NHEI investment, a golden quadrilateral,

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.320
[Guest 2]: like proper infrastructure investment.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:57.200
[Guest 2]: Now a fiscal stimulus takes the form of building toilets and houses and gases and I don't know

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.200
[Guest 2]: what, right.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.760
[Guest 2]: So there is also a nature of fiscal stimulus that is needed.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.360
[Guest 2]: But I think, yeah, the overarching thing is whatever the government does, there needs

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.240
[Guest 2]: to be a rule that ties down the hand of the government.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.600
[Guest 2]: And a rule that has real consequences, like if you're enshrined in the Constitution, it's

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.680
[Guest 2]: a real consequence of the change that you really have to amend it again.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:18.760
[Guest 2]: And all off balance sheet fine, if you're a BHAL, if an FCI, if an NHEI, too bad, you

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.240
[Guest 2]: also get clubbed into that because you have just been party to this whole thing as well.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:31.280
[Guest 3]: So the, I mean, sorry to butt in again, now, NHEI, not NHEI, sorry, FCI, in 2019-20, will

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:37.520
[Guest 3]: end up borrowing around 1,90,000 crore from the National Small Savings Fund.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.840
[Guest 3]: I mean, this is, we're getting into very, very dangerous territory now, because this

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:47.280
[Guest 3]: is, you know, the money that we invest in our public provident fund and all the post

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.640
[Guest 3]: office income schemes.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.720
[Guest 1]: So you know, I'll tell you what I agree on.

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:58.360
[Guest 1]: So I completely agree with you that, you know, our fiscal discipline, I mean, we don't have

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.080
[Guest 1]: any fiscal discipline.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.220
[Guest 1]: And there are parts of the fiscal discipline, which is depending on the kind of spending

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.360
[Guest 1]: can be better or worse, we've lost the plot there also.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.780
[Guest 1]: There's a great book on what you were talking about the whole, you know, taxing versus debt.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:16.320
[Guest 1]: So this whole nonsense of Ricardian equivalence, James Buchanan and Richard Wagner have a book

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:22.560
[Guest 1]: called Democracy in Deficit, which talks about the inherent problems of democratic politics,

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:28.480
[Guest 1]: which push it towards debt as opposed to taxation, basically, because when you're taxing people,

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.720
[Guest 1]: they also tend to be your voters.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:35.480
[Guest 1]: And when you raise money through debt, those voters are either not yet voting or not yet

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.600
[Guest 1]: born.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.960
[Guest 1]: So it is much easier to reduce taxes and increase debt, because those people are not yet voting,

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.960
[Guest 1]: right.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.560
[Guest 1]: So we shift the problem to the next generation.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:50.600
[Guest 1]: And because any government is sort of, you know, has no limit in that sense, right, so

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.400
[Guest 1]: it's going to be immortal.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:56.240
[Guest 1]: You can keep sort of rolling it on to the next generation and the next generation, the

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.360
[Guest 1]: music only stops when you have these demographic problems or crises or something like that.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.240
[Guest 1]: So it's a lovely book that I recommend for everyone.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:09.720
[Guest 1]: Now, coming to Germany versus India, you know, Germany could have done this even without

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.360
[Guest 1]: the constitutional constraint, because it's Germany.

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:19.440
[Guest 1]: One, they have excellent legislative discipline, right, they have very good separation of powers.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.520
[Guest 1]: They have a very tight feedback mechanism between the voters and taxpayers, who are

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:29.640
[Guest 1]: fairly rich individuals, like the tax base is really big, and the government, right.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:34.960
[Guest 1]: So all these three things included means that people do get upset in Germany, like regular

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.960
[Guest 1]: folks get upset if you're going too much into debt, because they know what the consequences

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.960
[Guest 1]: of that are.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.160
[Guest 1]: Now, that's not the case in India.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.600
[Guest 1]: So the temptation in India is let's constitutionalize it.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:52.740
[Guest 1]: Now I have studied all our 103 or whatever the number of constitutional amendments are.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:57.160
[Guest 1]: What we like to do is to push things to the constitutional stage, but it's ridiculously

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:05.060
[Guest 1]: easy to amend our constitution, right, a little bit harder than passing law, passing legislation.

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.560
[Guest 1]: It's really no constraint.

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.800
[Guest 1]: We change the constitution.

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.320
[Guest 1]: I keep buying new copies of the constitution in the last 15 years, because it keeps changing.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.600
[Amit Varma]: As the joke goes, it's a periodical, not a book.

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.600
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.000
[Guest 1]: So this is a problem.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:24.360
[Guest 1]: So now if you put this in to the constitution, like certain parts of the constitution, which

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:29.680
[Guest 1]: are just, you know, there's one of these provisions of reservations, which Ambedkar had initially

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.320
[Guest 1]: intended would eclipse after the first 10 years, you know, after 10 years, we won't

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.320
[Guest 1]: need reservation.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.560
[Guest 1]: That was the world Ambedkar had imagined for India.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.800
[Guest 1]: Every 10 years, it's extended.

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.400
[Guest 1]: It's a constitutional amendment.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.560
[Guest 1]: It is so procedural now, they just show up.

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.080
[Guest 1]: You know what the quorum requirement, you know, how many people need to say yes, they

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.680
[Guest 1]: just amend and move on.

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:54.200
[Guest 1]: I have a feeling that any kind of fiscal responsibility in the constitution will just become one of

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:58.440
[Guest 1]: those things, while they can still feel good about the fact that they constitutionalized

00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.440
[Guest 1]: it.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.480
[Guest 1]: So in some senses, it's, I think, even more dangerous.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.800
[Guest 1]: I think what is really important long run, right, I mean, since we're really looking

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:11.760
[Guest 1]: for reform and not band-aid, long run, what is really important is, one, we need to really

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.720
[Guest 1]: expand our tax base, right, our tax base is just not big enough.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.000
[Guest 1]: So our government both spends too much and too little, depending on which area of the

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.960
[Guest 1]: economy that you're talking about.

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:29.400
[Guest 1]: So and the larger the tax base, the more people will be upset if you increase taxes.

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:33.360
[Guest 1]: So that also acts as some kind of fiscal check or fiscal constraints, because the moment

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.120
[Guest 1]: you become a taxpayer, suddenly you start worrying about government spending and, you

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.640
[Guest 1]: know, fiscal responsibility and so on.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.680
[Guest 1]: So that's, you know, one thing.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:45.320
[Guest 1]: The second goes back to our education problem, which is, you know, I mean, forget fiscal

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:48.920
[Guest 1]: responsibility, we can't count in class 10.

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:55.080
[Guest 1]: So the idea that we are going to have an electorate in 20 years from today, or even three years

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:59.520
[Guest 1]: from today, who actually understand these things, you know, I mean, they don't need

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:04.280
[Guest 1]: to understand it at the sophistication you have as an economics professor who does this

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.280
[Guest 1]: for a living.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.560
[Guest 1]: But to just understand the basics of, oh, this is the arithmetic, right?

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:13.520
[Guest 1]: And the government can't defy the rules of basic arithmetic the same way we can't.

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.520
[Guest 1]: Right?

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.400
[Guest 1]: So where does this gap coming from?

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.980
[Guest 1]: That is just completely missing in these other people voting for them.

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:25.360
[Guest 1]: So in some sense, I mean, what, what is your fail safe when the constitutional constraint

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360
[Guest 1]: fails?

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.360
[Guest 1]: It's the people.

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.360
[Guest 1]: Right?

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.320
[Guest 1]: So maybe that fail safe is just missing, we've broken the constitutional fail safe.

00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.560
[Guest 2]: So we're screwed.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.760
[Guest 2]: So let me just respond to Shruti very quickly.

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:40.680
[Guest 2]: So the first point about the fact that, yeah, of course, it's very easy politically to spend

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.840
[Guest 2]: and of course, unpopular to tax, which is the case everywhere.

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.520
[Guest 2]: But it's also and since we're talking of dream reforms here, right?

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:52.320
[Guest 2]: It is imperative for the government to people also vote on the basis of what kind of public

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.520
[Guest 2]: goods they have access to, whether they have a road next to their house through which they

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.800
[Guest 2]: can go to the school, whether they have a school that they can they can learn to after

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.800
[Guest 2]: the school, do they actually have a job, do they have the train connection.

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.440
[Guest 2]: So people also vote on the basis of the public goods that they have access to, and not just

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.680
[Guest 2]: on the basis of whether they are taxing more or less, right.

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.520
[Guest 2]: And so if and given a fact in a situation where there are people who are accessing the

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.800
[Guest 2]: public goods, and that's critical to them and not really the ones who are paying taxes,

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.800
[Guest 2]: right.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:22.160
[Guest 2]: So if the government believes in this, that, okay, we have to basically win election on

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.920
[Guest 2]: the basis of the public goods that we are providing, and not on the basis of this fiscal

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.120
[Guest 2]: jugglery that we are doing, then it's not impossible.

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:35.080
[Guest 2]: And it's not required that the all the people of the country don't need to understand that

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.880
[Guest 2]: what the complicated fiscal math is.

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:41.400
[Guest 2]: And this is something that is strongly believe in, we are not running the government in Twitter,

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:46.960
[Guest 2]: we do not and should not continuously care about what all the people of the country want,

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.680
[Guest 2]: you know, I mean, all the people of the country will want something that may not be good for

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.200
[Guest 2]: the country, because they may not be aware of what is really good for the country.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.640
[Guest 2]: And that's perfectly fine.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:58.800
[Guest 2]: But if we tell them that we are giving you the services and the goods that you need,

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.480
[Guest 2]: and we are not taxing you, that is a very, it's a nice dream world to have.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.960
[Guest 2]: And as I said, you don't literacy and education, of course, it is very important, but because

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:13.200
[Guest 2]: we don't have it does not mean that we will reach a situation that as and when the population

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.960
[Guest 2]: is literate, like Germany, only then we can aspire to have a debt GDP ratio, which is

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.960
[Guest 2]: 60%.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.040
[Guest 2]: I don't think these two are should be connected.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.760
[Guest 2]: And, and the the last point I want to make is, yes, I agree that Indian Constitution

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.000
[Guest 2]: is the most amended one in the world.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.800
[Guest 2]: And it is very easy to amend it.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.000
[Guest 2]: But my point is that what I the German debt break, I was using as an example, that something

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.480
[Guest 2]: which is that tight something which is that enshrined in the law of the land, because

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.720
[Guest 2]: clearly, there's some kind of a willingness because we did pass the FRBM Act.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.000
[Guest 2]: And we do keep mentioning FRBM every year.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.040
[Guest 2]: So there is some awareness, vague consciousness that okay, we need to be on the fiscal path.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.880
[Guest 2]: But there is nothing which is of consequence, because in any country, it is difficult to

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.480
[Guest 2]: tie the hands of the government, because who will tie the hands of the government, the

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.960
[Guest 2]: government itself.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.600
[Guest 2]: So it is very difficult, it is very tricky to tie the hands of the government, because

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.520
[Guest 2]: the government itself will have to do it.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.240
[Guest 2]: Now, the reason I said constitutional amendment is because even if it is easy, but it's still

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.980
[Guest 2]: relatively harder than just violating an FRBM Act without any consequence.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:20.000
[Guest 2]: But my point is to dream and think of some kind of a structure which will really tie

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.360
[Guest 2]: the hands of the government so tight, that to violate it, there will be some consequence.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.400
[Guest 2]: Of course, you can argue that a government can do anything and there's no consequence,

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.040
[Guest 2]: of course, with that caveat.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.920
[Guest 2]: Because otherwise, as you said, we will end up in a situation where the government will

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.920
[Guest 2]: keep conning us for generation after generation.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:40.520
[Guest 2]: And we will never be able to move out of this state that the economy is in.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.480
[Guest 1]: I would say, you know, the German example is pertinent, because you have to understand

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.000
[Guest 1]: where the causation of the constraint comes from.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.680
[Guest 1]: It comes from the people.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.680
[Guest 1]: It doesn't come from the constitution.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.320
[Guest 1]: The constitution is the manifestation of what the people of Germany really care about, which

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.040
[Guest 1]: is, you know, tight fiscal discipline.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:06.400
[Guest 1]: As long as in majoritarian politics, where the majority gets to amend the constitution

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:13.080
[Guest 1]: and do it over and over again, if the people genuinely don't care about this, and since

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.840
[Guest 1]: we're talking about the dream reform, right, like, if we genuinely don't have people who

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.880
[Guest 1]: care about fiscal discipline, you're not going to get it.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.560
[Guest 2]: So I don't agree that people don't care about fiscal discipline, for example, people don't

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.560
[Guest 2]: think about fiscal discipline.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.240
[Guest 2]: Every time there is a budget, there are enough people, people are writing and thinking and

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.240
[Guest 1]: discussing.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240
[Guest 1]: Those are not the people I'm talking about.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.240
[Guest 2]: No, but that's what I'm saying.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.720
[Guest 2]: I think if we keep thinking that all the people of the country will have to care about a reform

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.960
[Amit Varma]: for that reform to happen.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.480
[Guest 1]: I think Rajeshwari's point is that elite shaped the discourse.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:46.360
[Guest 1]: I know the point, but that's why we have so much of the elite signaling, we passed FRBM

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.280
[Guest 1]: because we wanted to pretend to the rest of the world, we are open for business, right?

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.120
[Guest 2]: So Oh, India, we also passed FRBM because we did realize that having a fiscally profligate

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.480
[Guest 2]: government is not good for the economy.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.480
[Unknown]: I understand.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.280
[Guest 1]: But I'm saying, it's the means to other ends, which is, you know, we want more private investment

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.800
[Amit Varma]: in FDI and so on.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Part of the dream and dream reform, which she is mentioning, and I share the dream is

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.680
[Amit Varma]: that we have a constitution, which is which actually means something and as you and I

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.720
[Amit Varma]: would agree, it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't mean anything.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.200
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, the whole purpose of a constitution in the kind of republic that

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.120
[Amit Varma]: we dream of is a constitution that is a restraint on government and which ties the hands of

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120
[Amit Varma]: government as she correctly said.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120
[Guest 1]: It hasn't tied the hands of government.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120
[Unknown]: At all.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120
[Unknown]: But what is happening in Kashmir?

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120
[Unknown]: Since we are dreaming.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.320
[Unknown]: We passed a constitutional amendment by voice vote with the president signing this deal.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:42.360
[Amit Varma]: If you're going to talk about reforms, which are feasible in the current setup of the government,

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.640
[Guest 2]: then there is nothing called a dream reform.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:51.440
[Guest 3]: So because we are dreaming, let's let's have Vivek take the middle path.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.040
[Guest 3]: So see, one of the biggest problems in reforms in India, I mean, has been the fact that it's

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.240
[Guest 3]: always been reformed by stealth.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.640
[Guest 3]: No politician has ever bothered to sit and explain to the electorate, you know, this

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.860
[Guest 3]: is why we're doing this.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.200
[Guest 3]: This is why let's say we introduce a tax.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.760
[Guest 3]: So this is the reason we are introducing this tax or anything for that matter.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.560
[Guest 3]: I mean, let's say the government decides to shut down Air India.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560
[Guest 3]: Okay.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.360
[Guest 3]: So somebody is going to explain it to the people never happens.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.000
[Guest 3]: The only time I've seen, you know, a little bit of it happening was when Narendra Modi

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.360
[Guest 3]: tried to push in the Land Acquisition Act.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.440
[Guest 3]: He did one episode on Man Ki Baat.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:32.840
[Guest 3]: Uske baad, what happened was, you know, Rahul Gandhi made that sootboot ki sarkar jaib and

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840
[Guest 3]: we were done.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.280
[Guest 3]: We went back to where we were.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.480
[Guest 3]: So unless politicians take a lead here and start explaining things to people, and which

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.920
[Guest 3]: is very easy these days, you know, I mean, look at the kind of all, you know, fake news,

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.840
[Guest 3]: which keeps going around in the, you know, on the social media.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.040
[Guest 3]: I mean, there are multiple ways of reaching people these days, which are not there.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.160
[Guest 1]: So it has to start from the top.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.160
[Guest 1]: I mean, otherwise, it's not.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:03.800
[Guest 1]: I have one of my reforms caters to this point, but from the bottom, we'll come to it a little

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800
[Amit Varma]: later.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.880
[Amit Varma]: But I would add there that we can't rely on politicians, but we can rely on incentives,

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:15.400
[Amit Varma]: which gives me the slightly dismal hope that it is only a massive crisis, which absolutely

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.760
[Amit Varma]: forces change, which will help us in any way.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:25.160
[Guest 3]: Yes, but see, again, you know, the point there is that, you know, if the economy keeps getting

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.320
[Amit Varma]: reformed, only when there is a crisis, exactly, I agree with you, we'll never reach anywhere.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.160
[Amit Varma]: No, no, no, we have to stop this doom and gloom.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.920
[Amit Varma]: We need to take a break and come back sunshiny and cheerful.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.920
[Amit Varma]: Quick commercial break.

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.840
[Amit Varma]: This is that challenging part of the show where I come back from a break and I have

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.040
[Amit Varma]: to remember all my guest names.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.400
[Amit Varma]: I have with me Shruti Rajgopalan, Vivek Kaul, Rajeshwari Sengupta, in the order that we

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.320
[Amit Varma]: will go through our next reforms.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.120
[Amit Varma]: Reform number four, Shruti's reform number two, coming up now.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:06.100
[Guest 1]: Yeah, so my next big reform actually coincides well with the point that Rajeshwari made about

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.100
[Guest 1]: fiscal discipline.

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:10.120
[Guest 1]: Though that's not the only goal of this reform.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.320
[Guest 1]: So I wish India to be more fiscally federal, right?

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:19.320
[Guest 1]: So India, I mean, India's federal structure is very centripetal.

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:24.620
[Guest 1]: So I don't know, we are all different generations here, but my generation read civics books

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.060
[Guest 1]: that said India is a federal country with a unitary bias.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.480
[Guest 1]: Is that what yours also read?

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.480
[Amit Varma]: Something like that?

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.480
[Amit Varma]: I have to hold to remember civics.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:37.760
[Guest 1]: And no, I remember the sentence because I went around asking everyone what the hell

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.040
[Guest 1]: this means.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.280
[Guest 1]: And now I figured out what it means.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.440
[Guest 1]: It means India is not federal.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.560
[Guest 1]: And so, you know, one of the core reasons is there is an administrative federalism,

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.040
[Guest 1]: but there is no fiscal federalism.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.880
[Guest 1]: And what I mean by that is our taxes and spending are highly centralized, right?

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:58.880
[Guest 1]: Now less and less so in the last 25 years or so, we have this fine establishment called

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.640
[Guest 1]: the Finance Commission, where all our taxes, you know, think of it as sort of, you know,

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.880
[Guest 1]: you collect all the taxes in one basket, and then the finance, it would go to the Finance

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:12.760
[Guest 1]: Commission, not physically, but the idea of it, and they would make a split between how

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.560
[Guest 1]: much the center gets and how much the state gets.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.920
[Guest 1]: And there are a whole number of ways to figure this out.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.160
[Guest 1]: One was, you know, union government was really under central planning.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.320
[Guest 1]: That's one part.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.720
[Guest 1]: The other part was, you know, depending on how poor the state is, or how much development

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.660
[Guest 1]: it needs, or how much infrastructure needs to be built, get more money or less money.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.200
[Guest 1]: This is a giant rent-seeking exercise.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.240
[Guest 1]: There have been papers written on how, you know, this kind of fiscal control was used

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.280
[Guest 1]: to punish opposition governments.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.680
[Guest 1]: So if you're the same party in the state forming government as the center, you could, you know,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.680
[Guest 1]: tend to get more money, then I think Stuti Khemani at the World Bank has written on this.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.640
[Guest 1]: And you know, if you're an opposition party forming a government in a state, they deny

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.360
[Guest 1]: you the budget, and that's how they hold up.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:02.040
[Guest 1]: So one of the big, there are three reasons I want to see more fiscal federalism.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.280
[Guest 1]: The first is, we want more public goods.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.680
[Guest 1]: And what we mean by more public goods, most of the time, is we want the garbage outside

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.280
[Guest 1]: our house to be picked up.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.140
[Guest 1]: We want better roads, we, you know, we all managed to get here on time.

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:22.520
[Guest 1]: But I got here on time because I sort of accounted for 25-30 minute delay, which turned out to

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.480
[Guest 1]: be true, because it's pouring in Bombay, and you know, every road is dug up, and it's a

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.560
[Guest 1]: total mess.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.480
[Guest 1]: We would like to have better public infrastructure, right, we'd like airports to be better, trains

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.480
[Guest 1]: to be better.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.000
[Guest 1]: We would like public schooling to be better, which is, you know, one function is the reforms

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.180
[Guest 1]: we talked about, the other is expenditure.

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:45.360
[Guest 1]: So we would like to see a lot of spending at the local municipal level.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.000
[Guest 1]: And our municipal governments have no money.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
[Guest 3]: And the reason for that...

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
[Guest 3]: Except for BMC.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
[Guest 3]: Except for BMC.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.640
[Guest 1]: Yeah, which is a very rich, because they're building the metro, which is a very rich municipal

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.640
[Guest 1]: corporation.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:04.000
[Guest 1]: But overall, the centre devolves money to the states, and then the state has the option

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.200
[Guest 1]: of devolving money.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.040
[Guest 1]: So you know, like, there's a central finance commission, every state has its own finance

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.800
[Guest 1]: commission post the 73rd and 74th amendment.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.160
[Guest 1]: And depending on whether you're talking about the rural or the urban areas, the state is

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.380
[Guest 1]: supposed to devolve finances to local government.

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.200
[Guest 1]: That is not a condition.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200
[Guest 1]: It's not mandatory.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200
[Guest 1]: Right?

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.200
[Guest 1]: It's a choice.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.480
[Guest 1]: So what ends up happening is, the states are spending a lot of money.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.000
[Guest 1]: And the union governments are spending a lot of money.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.040
[Guest 1]: But they're spending it on all useless things, as Rajeshwari pointed out, right?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.480
[Guest 1]: They're not spending it on the things we care about.

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.840
[Guest 1]: So you can have government spending, which causes both stimulus, also builds infrastructure

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.160
[Guest 1]: and also delivers public goods to the people who need it the most.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.360
[Guest 1]: But the money never goes there.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:51.480
[Guest 1]: The money goes to satisfy special interests with these freebies that are highly targeted

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.920
[Guest 1]: to capture one vote bank or another, or you know, for uptakes like this whole toilet building

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.800
[Guest 1]: thing with just you know, I mean, then I've talked about it just drives us crazy.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:05.800
[Guest 1]: So one huge, you know, this is one reform, which can sort of kill a lot of birds with

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.320
[Guest 1]: one stone.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.660
[Guest 1]: One part of it is municipal governments will be more empowered.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.720
[Guest 1]: So I get this idea from all the condo associations that I see, you know, they collect this common

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:19.700
[Guest 1]: charges of fees that you see in Bombay and Delhi, and actually spend that money, right?

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:24.440
[Guest 1]: And when you go to these condo association meetings, people are really up in arms about

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.720
[Guest 1]: an increased charge or you know, you took money to build a you know, water filtration

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.840
[Guest 1]: plant and then never got built and there's all this.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.440
[Guest 1]: So there's a lot of local politics, which can be tied to fiscal feedback.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.360
[Guest 1]: And that's an opportunity we're missing right now.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.360
[Guest 1]: Right?

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.300
[Guest 1]: So the municipal corporator, no one knows his name.

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.860
[Guest 1]: That's one problem.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.640
[Guest 1]: So this will solve that problem.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.520
[Guest 1]: The second problem it will solve is, it will divide the functions of different levels of

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.160
[Guest 1]: government much better.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.200
[Guest 1]: Right?

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:59.280
[Guest 1]: So the union government is supposed to maintain law and order at the highest level, right?

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.000
[Guest 1]: Interstate highways, interstate river water, right, foreign trade, of course, safety and

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.800
[Guest 1]: security of the country, right?

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.520
[Guest 1]: That's all that kind of expenditure, or you know, large externalities, like pollution

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520
[Guest 1]: across states.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.640
[Guest 1]: That's really the job of the union government.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.760
[Guest 1]: Everything within the state, which is your, you know, local highway, all your public parks,

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.760
[Guest 1]: you know, which are going beyond municipal boundaries.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.440
[Guest 1]: That's the job of the state government and then, you know, lower level further municipal

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.440
[Guest 1]: government.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.440
[Guest 1]: And we just don't have that clean demarcation.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:36.040
[Guest 1]: But the moment you make a demarcation with money, the demarcation and goods will be a

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:40.440
[Guest 1]: little bit more, it won't be automatic, it won't happen overnight, but it will happen

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.440
[Guest 1]: over a period of time.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.440
[Guest 1]: Right?

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.840
[Guest 1]: And if you look at the state spending in a place like Maharashtra, disproportionate amount

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:50.880
[Guest 1]: goes to rural and farmers freebies, right?

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.140
[Guest 1]: Even though Maharashtra has been urbanizing at a very rapid pace, right?

01:13:55.140 --> 01:14:00.120
[Guest 1]: And that doesn't get reflected and the spending is at the state level.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:06.320
[Guest 1]: And Mumbai citizens are underrepresented in votes and overrepresented in revenue giving,

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320
[Guest 1]: but not in expenditure.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.680
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you and I had an episode on this on urban governance where we spoke about the

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.000
[Guest 1]: mismatch between power and accountability.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
[Guest 1]: So that's the second part, right?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.480
[Guest 1]: So first is we actually get public goods.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.920
[Guest 1]: The second solution is it actually demarcates what each level of government is supposed

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920
[Guest 1]: to do and can do.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:26.920
[Guest 1]: And the third part is tying the hands of government, which is what Rajeshwari was talking about.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:31.360
[Guest 1]: I think this is a bottom up way of tying the hands of government, right?

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:38.080
[Guest 1]: You allot different fiscal resources and therefore different levels of fiscal accountability.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.520
[Guest 1]: I would like to live in a world where the maximum spending is done by the municipal

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.080
[Guest 1]: government because that has the tightest feedback level, right, at that level.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.780
[Guest 1]: And also that's where we use the public resources the most.

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:54.080
[Guest 1]: You want a public library, you want a public park, you want poor children in your area

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:59.640
[Guest 1]: to have, you know, certain things despite their income level, which is, you know, access

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.160
[Guest 1]: to schools and access to water and access to vaccination.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.100
[Guest 1]: So that's what I would like to see.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.100
[Guest 1]: So that's the second part.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.120
[Guest 1]: Now, the fiscal responsibility, because of the tight feedback, you automatically, you

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.320
[Guest 1]: know, you first of all create a check between government.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.000
[Guest 1]: So there's a horizontal separation of powers, but there's also a vertical separation of

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.120
[Guest 1]: powers, right?

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.080
[Guest 1]: So this way, municipal government, state government and union government have to fight over the

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:27.360
[Guest 1]: size of the pie and how they split it, which is a really good check for each other.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.280
[Guest 1]: And the second is, this is a bottom up way of really tying the hands of the union government,

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.200
[Guest 1]: which is what is doing a bulk of the sharing of the spending.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.640
[Guest 1]: And that's why it is so mistargeted, right?

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.340
[Guest 1]: So you absolutely right, you know, both Rajeshwari and Vivek have said, we've been in some kind

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.400
[Guest 1]: of stimulus mode for the last two years.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.600
[Guest 1]: It's just it's not working like a stimulus, because it's all nonsense that we're spending

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.600
[Guest 1]: on.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:57.320
[Guest 1]: So you can also stimulate the economy, you can, you have different livers to pull, you

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.680
[Guest 1]: have more sophisticated livers to pull, though I don't believe in that kind of like hydraulic

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:02.680
[Guest 1]: Keynesianism.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.680
[Guest 1]: But even if you were of that school, you have more sophisticated livers to pull when you

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.600
[Guest 1]: can split fiscal levels.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.360
[Amit Varma]: And what also strikes me is that this would then change incentives.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:18.860
[Amit Varma]: Because the point is, if you know, local neighborhoods are so empowered and are doing so much spending,

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:23.000
[Amit Varma]: people can vote with their feet and go to where the governance is the best, which improves

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
[Guest 1]: everybody's incentives.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.880
[Guest 1]: Yeah, and voting with your feet is naturally much easier when the geographical distances

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.080
[Guest 1]: are small, right?

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.240
[Guest 1]: You can go from Khar to Juhu and Juhu to Andheri much more easily.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.480
[Guest 1]: Then you can go from Maharashtra to Gujarat, right?

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:38.280
[Guest 1]: Or from India to Pakistan, which is what people keep telling me I should be doing, right?

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:44.800
[Guest 1]: So this is one kind of voting with your feet, which is made lower cost, because voting with

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.320
[Guest 1]: your feet comes with a constraint, you have to uproot your whole life.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.320
[Guest 1]: So that's one part that makes the feedback mechanism tighter.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.920
[Guest 1]: The second part that makes the feedback mechanism tighter is your voters are your taxpayers.

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.560
[Guest 1]: So there is much, you know, even though first of all, all of us are not voting for Modi

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.160
[Guest 1]: ji, right, it's a representative system.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.760
[Guest 1]: The second is, all of us are not paying taxes, right?

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.160
[Guest 1]: So there is this really big problem of everyone who voted for Modi ji and everyone who is

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.040
[Guest 1]: paying taxes to Modi ji.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.680
[Guest 1]: And I say Modi ji because he's the one really, you know, in control, right?

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.440
[Guest 1]: That's not a slip of the tongue.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, please don't ask Shruti to go to Pakistan, people.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.960
[Guest 1]: No, you can ask me, I would love to visit.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:24.960
[Guest 1]: She'll go via Dubai.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, when people ask me to go to Pakistan…

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.520
[Guest 1]: Or via United States, which is where I live.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.840
[Amit Varma]: When people ask me to go to Pakistan, I say, been there, done that, I mean, which is true.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:33.840
[Guest 1]: I haven't been there.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.840
[Guest 1]: I'd love to go.

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.840
[Guest 1]: I have no problem.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.920
[Guest 1]: I just have a problem with people ordering me on what my travel plans should be.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.680
[Guest 2]: That is what I'm most offended by.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.520
[Guest 2]: So essentially, you're talking of a more decentralization kind of thing.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:49.960
[Guest 1]: No, I'm actually not talking about decentralization, I'm talking about genuine fiscal federalism.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.520
[Guest 1]: What we have right now is decentralization.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.960
[Guest 1]: And I'll tell you what I think the difference is.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:00.320
[Guest 1]: Decentralization is that the head decides what the hand will get, right?

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.640
[Guest 1]: I am the center, you are my sub-center and I'm going to…

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.880
[Guest 1]: Federalism requires that they own separate power centers, right?

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.400
[Guest 1]: What we have in India is a very large degree of decentralization without federalism, which

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.160
[Guest 1]: is, you know, I don't want to just pull Kashmir into everything, but a very large part of

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:22.080
[Guest 1]: the uproar that came from Tamil Nadu and the other states, actually very little uproar,

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.080
[Guest 1]: according to me, but you know, one part of the uproar was that, you know, we're all states

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.280
[Guest 1]: until we are union territories when we are, right?

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:34.600
[Guest 1]: Which is really true because we are all really agents of the union government, which is not

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.600
[Guest 1]: true.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.640
[Guest 1]: We're not the central government of India, we're a union of states, right?

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.640
[Guest 1]: So we're never…

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.320
[Guest 1]: If you look at the constitution, the central government is called the union government,

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.320
[Guest 1]: right?

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.160
[Guest 1]: It's the union of states, but it never set it up as such because you can't just administratively

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.800
[Guest 1]: make a union and not give them any revenue raising capacity.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:56.240
[Guest 1]: That's what makes a federal government, a federal government.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.800
[Guest 1]: So right now we are centripetal because we have three lists, but we have enough loopholes

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.200
[Guest 1]: in the constitution that the center can usurp any of the three lists completely, right?

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.560
[Guest 1]: And there's enough vagueness there.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.640
[Guest 1]: So that's one.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.120
[Guest 1]: That is not the case in genuinely federal countries like Switzerland or United States

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.120
[Guest 1]: and so on.

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.680
[Guest 1]: The second part of it is, of course, the fiscal map.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:23.760
[Guest 1]: The third part of it is, all the ancillary services we provide are highly centripetal,

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.760
[Guest 1]: right?

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.000
[Guest 1]: The union Supreme Court, which is the only Supreme Court we have, that determines what

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.960
[Guest 1]: every high court will do, right?

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.160
[Guest 1]: Every state high court.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.720
[Guest 1]: So now this comes down in culture.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.880
[Guest 1]: You know, there is a system by which, you know, your planning commission at the center,

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.800
[Guest 2]: every state planning commission is like…

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.640
[Guest 2]: Actually, this has very interesting implications for financing.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.640
[Guest 2]: For financing.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:51.000
[Guest 2]: For example, instead of a finance commission distributing across different states, etc.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.400
[Guest 2]: Something that I have thought about for quite some time is a very small thing like a municipal

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.400
[Guest 2]: bond.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.400
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.720
[Guest 2]: You know, I mean, it's like in Bombay or other municipalities, instead of waiting for some

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.400
[Guest 2]: funding to come, why can't we just issue municipal bonds?

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.400
[Guest 2]: Or tax it.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.400
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.400
[Guest 1]: Or tax it.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.440
[Guest 1]: People of Bombay are paying enough tax and are happy to spend it on resources instead

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.680
[Guest 2]: of, you know, going through potholes.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.000
[Guest 2]: So since we are dreaming, I'll just, Vivek, just give me two minutes.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.120
[Guest 2]: I'll just take off on a little bit of another tangent, but related.

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.640
[Guest 2]: Since we are dreaming is how about now we all know that the cities of India are really

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.640
[Guest 2]: struggling, right?

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.640
[Guest 2]: There's a water crisis.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.800
[Guest 2]: There's an infrastructure crisis in Bombay, in Madras, in Calcutta, wherever, right?

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:31.220
[Guest 2]: So how about converting the top 10 cities of India into states?

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.480
[Guest 2]: And just hear me out a little bit on this.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:37.840
[Guest 2]: The model that I have in mind is like a New York or a London, which have their own directly

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.840
[Guest 2]: elected mayors.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:44.080
[Guest 2]: And the mayors are like the CEOs of the New York government and the London City Council.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.000
[Guest 2]: And they're basically responsible for running the institution, the economic development,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
[Guest 2]: the infrastructure, everything in the cities.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
[Guest 2]: What is happening in our cities is, as Shruti pointed out, is, for example, in Bombay, right?

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.600
[Guest 2]: Bombay is generating a lot of tax revenue, so to speak.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.200
[Guest 2]: But how much of that is something that's really coming to the Bombay for Bombay's own development?

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:05.000
[Guest 2]: Now, I come from Calcutta, which was once called the Paris of India, East India, no

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.680
[Guest 2]: longer the case.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.800
[Guest 2]: Calcutta is held hostage by a lot of politics of the hinterland.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.400
[Guest 2]: The chief minister of Calcutta or chief minister of Bengal has to bother a lot about what's

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:17.640
[Guest 2]: happening in the rural state, because West Bengal is essentially a rural state.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.680
[Guest 2]: What's happening in the hinterland politics of the districts and villages.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:23.480
[Guest 2]: And much less attention gets actually paid to what the city needs.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:28.400
[Guest 2]: And as a result, the city is really struggling today in terms of jobs, infrastructure, institutions,

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.400
[Guest 2]: everything.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:33.560
[Guest 2]: So instead of that, since we have a familiar machinery of the state, why not convert the

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.040
[Guest 2]: top 10 cities into states so that they get the autonomy, they get autonomy of financing,

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.680
[Guest 2]: they get autonomy of economic development of those regions.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:45.840
[Guest 2]: But then you can have real good development pockets, instead of saying that there are

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.320
[Guest 2]: only two big cities in India, which is Bombay and Delhi.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.000
[Guest 1]: So this is just a thought that came up.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I would say, you know, I mean, the conversion of the administrative structure from a city

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.760
[Guest 1]: to a state or a state to a city with a mayor, that's easy enough.

01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.760
[Guest 2]: We have mayors already.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.080
[Guest 2]: See, mayor problem is in Indian political structure, the mayor will always be kept subservient

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.080
[Guest 2]: to the chief minister.

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:09.400
[Guest 2]: So the mayor will never be able to do things autonomously because the chief minister in

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.520
[Guest 2]: the political hierarchy will be the more powerful one.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.520
[Unknown]: But I think it's not a political hierarchy.

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.600
[Guest 1]: Instead, let's just convert them into states and make them each an autonomous unit.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600
[Guest 1]: No, I disagree.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:20.760
[Guest 1]: I don't think the problem is because of the mayor is lower than the chief minister.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:23.440
[Guest 1]: I think the mayor is lower than the chief minister because he doesn't control his own

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440
[Guest 1]: budget.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.440
[Guest 2]: So my point is, why even have this?

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.440
[Unknown]: He's a mayor, mayor.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.440
[Amit Varma]: He's a mayor, mayor.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.440
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.440
[Unknown]: So by the way, relatively okay joke.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.040
[Unknown]: You know, we like to compare New York and London.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.040
[Guest 2]: I'm not comparing.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.040
[Guest 2]: I'm not comparing.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.040
[Guest 2]: I'm saying that.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.560
[Guest 1]: But they're different in the sense that in New York, the mayor doesn't control his own

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.560
[Guest 1]: budget.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.560
[Guest 1]: He controls his own company.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.560
[Guest 1]: Right.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.560
[Guest 1]: Right.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.560
[Unknown]: London, it is set by the council of London.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.480
[Guest 2]: So I'm saying is instead of going into the complication of mayor, why, how about dreaming

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:53.280
[Guest 2]: that we convert the top 10 cities into states and have their own autonomous political financial

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280
[Guest 1]: unit?

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.280
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.280
[Guest 1]: I'm saying you're still beholden to the center.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.280
[Guest 1]: It's another kind of decentralization.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.280
[Amit Varma]: I think she's saying in addition to what you are saying.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:07.960
[Guest 1]: No, even then I'm saying that is just changing the outfit a little bit and changing the boundaries

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.000
[Guest 1]: a little bit.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.720
[Guest 1]: I don't even care what they're called.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720
[Unknown]: Right.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.560
[Guest 2]: As long as they're not agents of the union.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.480
[Guest 2]: In a dream world where we have the fiscal federalism, in that world, how about we convert

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.480
[Guest 2]: the citizens?

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.480
[Guest 1]: I think it'll happen automatically.

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.840
[Guest 1]: I don't think we'll have to convert them.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.880
[Guest 1]: I think the mayor of Bombay will be the most important person in Maharashtra that day.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:30.120
[Guest 2]: I'm not so sure because the finances may work out, but I'm not sure how the politics will

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120
[Guest 2]: work out.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120
[Guest 3]: I think Vivek had a point.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.120
[Guest 3]: Vivek had a point.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.120
[Guest 3]: No, no.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.680
[Guest 3]: I mean, basically what we need is 10 Arvind Kejriwals.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.680
[Amit Varma]: Please don't say that.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:40.360
[Guest 3]: We need one less than we have, frankly.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:44.440
[Guest 3]: What I was basically saying is that, I mean, if you if you look at the structure of all

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.440
[Guest 3]: government in India, I mean, it's like a funnel.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.600
[Guest 3]: So we're very broad at the top.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:54.720
[Guest 3]: And then as we go down, we become extremely narrow.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.600
[Guest 3]: So and why is that the case?

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.280
[Guest 3]: And why is it difficult to change?

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:02.880
[Guest 3]: Now, take a look at I mean, so this is something I've thought about for a while.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:07.580
[Guest 3]: And the example that I like to give is take a look at the ministry or the minister of

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:08.580
[Guest 3]: civil aviation.

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:09.580
[Guest 3]: Okay.

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:25.480
[Guest 3]: Now, if you take Air India out from him, so in the same way, I mean, you know, a lot of

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:30.680
[Guest 3]: ministries, if you take the PSUs away from them, I mean, they're gone.

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:35.960
[Guest 3]: I mean, Ministry of Coal, you take Coal India, let's say you don't privatize, let's say you

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:41.000
[Guest 3]: sell all the shares and I mean, then what does the Shruti's dog is named Coal, they'll

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.520
[Amit Varma]: nationalize Shruti's dog, maybe, maybe so.

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:48.840
[Guest 2]: Amit is just all guns blazing today, like, no holds barred.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.840
[Guest 3]: So this is not a joke.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:51.840
[Guest 3]: This is legit.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.160
[Amit Varma]: My dog, she has, she has a dog name, but what Amit said about that, I'm sorry, I should

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160
[Amit Varma]: really stop.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.160
[Guest 3]: I'm behaving like Cyrus.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160
[Guest 3]: Please continue.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:21.600
[Guest 3]: I mean, obviously you used to write for Cyrus, so that has to come out in 1998, continue,

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:22.600
[Amit Varma]: continue.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.600
[Amit Varma]: Can we cut all of this?

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:25.600
[Amit Varma]: No, we are not.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.600
[Amit Varma]: This is a fun part.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.600
[Guest 3]: For those of you who don't know, Amit also coined the, you know, the word Bakra, MTV

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Bakra.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.080
[Unknown]: I didn't coin the word Bakra, but yes, I was responsible for naming the show, I was responsible

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.080
[Unknown]: for naming the show.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.680
[Guest 3]: I have been on a Cyrus Says episode where we have discussed that, kindly let us go back

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.920
[Guest 3]: to dream reforms instead of nightmare past.

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:52.520
[Guest 3]: What I was trying to say is that, so the big government won't go precisely because you

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:57.760
[Guest 3]: have people at the top who have incentives to ensure that it continues.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.680
[Guest 3]: So unless that changes, so everything, you know, else is a dream.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.760
[Amit Varma]: Sure, but I mean, everything we're discussing in this episode, if we bring the political

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.520
[Guest 3]: economy into it, it's a khattam.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:07.520
[Guest 3]: I understand that.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.000
[Guest 3]: But now I think we should also have a disclaimer.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:18.240
[Guest 3]: I mean, while we should dream, but dreaming with disclaimers is always a better idea.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:24.560
[Guest 3]: Otherwise you get into a dream sequence, you know, which is not dreaming with disclaimers.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.560
[Amit Varma]: It's very Indian thing.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.560
[Amit Varma]: So horrendous.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:33.480
[Guest 3]: Now it is time for your second dream reform is over, kindly give us something.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.160
[Guest 3]: So I think, you know, I mean, the second thing I want to talk about was basically tax reforms.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.120
[Guest 3]: And, you know, because we've talked about increasing the tax base.

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:48.860
[Guest 3]: So people talk about the fact that, you know, India doesn't pay enough tax because enough

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.560
[Guest 3]: Indians don't make enough money, which is true at many levels.

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:58.480
[Guest 3]: But what is also true is that our tax filing system is so bloody complicated, that it drives

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.760
[Guest 3]: away people from being honest.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.840
[Amit Varma]: What I should briefly point out at just this point is that you're talking really about

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:08.320
[Guest 3]: income tax, because everybody basically pays income tax, and I'm talking about the goods

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.320
[Guest 3]: and services tax.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Sure, but you're right that not everybody pays those, but everybody pays tax, every

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Indian is a taxpayer, because anything you buy, you buy soap, you buy soap, you pay tax.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.800
[Guest 3]: Which is true.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.800
[Guest 3]: But what I'm trying to say is...

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.520
[Amit Varma]: For our listeners, I wanted to clarify that you're speaking about this particular category

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:27.080
[Guest 3]: when you said tax, lest this becomes a gotcha moment on Twitter.

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.400
[Guest 3]: I mean, someone will, some smart alec will come, everybody pays tax.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so...

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.400
[Unknown]: They'll come anyway.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:41.000
[Guest 3]: So, what I was saying is, if you look at something as simple as our tax return forms, every year

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.160
[Guest 3]: there are changes in it.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160
[Guest 3]: Why?

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:48.600
[Guest 3]: I mean, why can't a tax return form be a stable sort of thing, which this chartered accountant

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.240
[Guest 3]: doesn't have to figure out every year, what has changed this year?

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:59.360
[Guest 3]: Or take into account the fact that we have some six, seven, eight types of capital gains.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:05.280
[Guest 3]: So there is one capital gain for stocks and equity mutual funds, one for debt mutual funds,

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.680
[Guest 3]: one for real estate, one for gold.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:08.680
[Guest 3]: Why?

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:13.480
[Guest 3]: I mean, you know, you have to have one, you know, capital gain is capital gain, and you

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.480
[Guest 3]: tax it like that.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.920
[Guest 3]: I mean, in some cases you have indexation, in some cases you have no indexation.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:23.560
[Guest 3]: So the point is that you have to have a stable tax system.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:29.360
[Guest 3]: Now, look at something like GST, you know, every time the GST council meets, there is

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.360
[Guest 3]: some change.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.280
[Guest 3]: So there are changes which are happening at the central level, there are changes which

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:38.080
[Guest 3]: are happening at the state level, which is why, you know, if you look at the annual return

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:44.920
[Guest 3]: for 2017-18 of GST, only 20% of people have filed it till date.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:49.080
[Guest 3]: So I think you need to have a stable tax system.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.120
[Guest 3]: And in case of GST, what has happened is, they've obviously launched it without thinking

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.120
[Guest 3]: it through.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.200
[Guest 3]: So they have to keep changing it.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.960
[Guest 3]: Now, you know, you can't keep changing it every week or every, you know, every time

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.480
[Guest 3]: the GST council meets.

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:06.920
[Guest 3]: So better thing to do right now would be to sit down and figure out what is wrong, and

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:13.200
[Guest 3]: then make major changes at a single go, instead of meeting every time and tweaking this and

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.860
[Guest 3]: tweaking that and making, you know, things difficult for everyone.

01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:23.200
[Guest 3]: So like, if you if you sort of, you know, pick up the what is called as the HSN book,

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:28.920
[Guest 3]: which is, you know, the codes for the economic activity you carry out, if you are in the

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.240
[Guest 3]: goods part, and then there is something for the services part as well.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.880
[Guest 3]: Now, it's a huge thick thing.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.880
[Guest 3]: I mean, why?

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:37.880
[Guest 1]: It's about 16,000 entries.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.560
[Guest 3]: Why are you why are you complicating these things?

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:47.160
[Guest 3]: I mean, you know, you can have, let's say two rates and just, you know, 12% for goods

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.920
[Guest 3]: and 15% for services and get done, get along, you know, get on with it.

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:57.040
[Guest 3]: But then, you know, you'll have the argument on the fact that how can, you know, something

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.520
[Guest 3]: that everyone is using and Mercedes be taxed at the same rate.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:06.000
[Guest 3]: But boss, Mercedes, if it comes to 1 crore, then 15% tax will come to 15 lakhs.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.560
[Guest 3]: This is something that, you know, people don't get, but then they don't want, they're not

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:16.000
[Guest 3]: happy with 15 lakhs, they want 43 lakhs, because they want to tax it at 42% or 43% or whatever.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.280
[Guest 3]: So as long so, you know, this is something that will sort of also help, I mean, along

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:29.500
[Guest 3]: with being a structural reform, it will also have an immediate impact on economic activity.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:34.240
[Guest 2]: So I want to add to what Vivek said that I completely agree that simplifying tax administration

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:36.720
[Guest 2]: is something that we have been discussing for a very long time.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.780
[Guest 2]: And it's one of those things that we all know needs to be done, but never really gets done.

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:44.880
[Guest 2]: And we actually end up complicating more and more with this new GST fiasco.

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.640
[Guest 2]: The other thing that I think is also very important to understand is if you want to

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:53.360
[Guest 2]: avoid tax evasion, and if you want to expand the tax base, it's very important to keep

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.080
[Guest 2]: the tax rates low.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:31:00.440
[Guest 2]: I think we just don't get that math at all, because our tax revenue is the multiplied

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:03.160
[Guest 2]: product of tax base and tax rate.

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.200
[Guest 2]: Now, if you want to increase the base, you have to lower the rate, otherwise, if you

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.680
[Guest 2]: keep the tax system at a very high rate, the probability of tax evasion goes up that much

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.680
[Guest 2]: more.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:17.840
[Guest 2]: And then in order to justify the high rate, you also give a lot of exemptions.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.480
[Guest 2]: And then the exemptions increase the leakages from the system even more.

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.680
[Guest 2]: And then in the end, you're sitting with a really complicated system that you cannot

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:28.200
[Guest 2]: monitor because you don't have enough employees in your tax administration.

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.360
[Guest 2]: So it's a total mess at the end of the day.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:36.480
[Guest 2]: So two easy and finite things to do is one is ease tax administration by doing the logistical

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:42.400
[Guest 2]: reforms of filing ease and all of that, and lower the taxes, be direct tax, indirect tax.

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:45.080
[Guest 2]: Our corporate income tax is one of the highest in the world.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:49.720
[Guest 2]: It doesn't have to be so in a country when we want to encourage investment and make in

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.040
[Guest 2]: India and all of that.

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:54.840
[Guest 2]: So lower the tax rate and make the tax administration easy.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.800
[Guest 2]: You will expand the tax base.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:01.680
[Guest 2]: And with that expanded tax base, again, coming back to the point of anti-fiscal discipline,

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:05.720
[Guest 2]: if you then have a tax base, which is expanded, then you remain within the means of the tax

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.120
[Guest 2]: revenue and you spend.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:11.800
[Guest 2]: But all of these things are stuff that again, we have talked about, but for whatever reason

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.520
[Guest 2]: and political economy, etc, there is a lot of inertia to do this.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:21.520
[Guest 3]: I mean, look at what Nirmala Sitharaman did in her first budget, introduced, basically

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:27.080
[Guest 3]: increased the surcharges and now there are tax slabs at 39 percent and 42.74 percent.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:32.480
[Guest 3]: Now, the point is, OK, you know, you're looking at, you know, increasing the tax revenue and

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.480
[Guest 3]: so on.

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:37.400
[Guest 3]: But for these people at these levels, so people who earn two to five crore or five crore or

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:42.760
[Guest 3]: more, and it's very easy to leave the country and go live somewhere else.

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:46.560
[Guest 3]: I mean, they go to you can easily go to Dubai properties as expensive as it is in Mumbai.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.840
[Guest 2]: And for businesses to basically invest elsewhere, a foreign direct investment outside of India

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.280
[Guest 2]: is actually increasing every year.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:55.640
[Amit Varma]: In fact, this is a point Vivek, you made in our budget episode, which earned you the nickname

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:57.800
[Guest 3]: the Shah Rukh Khan of economics.

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.600
[Guest 1]: You were the Govinda of podcasting.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.600
[Guest 1]: One more thing.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.480
[Guest 1]: I think none of this is a surprise.

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:07.120
[Guest 1]: So a couple of things on this GST classification problem.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:11.400
[Guest 1]: First up, I do want to point out, it's extremely regressive and anti poor.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:15.720
[Guest 1]: You know, I mean, Palaji has been in the news because they've just laid off 10,000 employees

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.160
[Guest 1]: and biscuit sales are down.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:21.400
[Guest 1]: Palaji's GST rate, I believe is 18% on biscuits, is that accurate?

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:26.400
[Guest 1]: I mean, if Vivek doesn't know, but it's high, it's double digits and it's high.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.440
[Guest 1]: The GST on gold is 3%.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:34.040
[Guest 1]: And right and the GST on diamonds is 0.25.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:38.440
[Guest 1]: And if you go back and check the timing of reducing the GST on gold and diamond, it was

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:42.160
[Guest 1]: done for some handicrafts, cottage industry reason.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:46.360
[Guest 1]: But it was just after demonetization and just before the Gujarat election, or just around

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360
[Guest 3]: that time.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.360
[Guest 3]: I'll interrupt you.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.360
[Guest 3]: GST on biscuits is 18%.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.360
[Guest 1]: 18%.

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.360
[Guest 1]: Right.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.760
[Guest 1]: So Palaji, which is the poor man's food, they have a five rupee biscuit packet, they have

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:59.560
[Guest 1]: a 12 rupee biscuit packet that is taxed at 18% GST.

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:05.280
[Guest 1]: So this whole bullshit about, oh, the Mercedes guy, you know, is going to only end up paying

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.800
[Guest 1]: 6% or 8%.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:13.280
[Guest 1]: The guy who's homeless, you know, begging outside a temple is paying 18% GST on Palaji.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.520
[Guest 3]: No, but there is a logic to it.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.840
[Guest 3]: So we don't want people to have maida and sugar.

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.720
[Guest 3]: Maida is slow poison, sugar is poison.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:27.400
[Guest 2]: As I think, I mean, I know, but we want people to have a lot of gold.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.280
[Guest 3]: We want people to have the freedom to have poison.

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:34.960
[Guest 3]: We should have bhoonja chana, which is, yeah, savings to buy gold.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:40.360
[Guest 1]: I know, I'm not so much of an economics nerd that I don't get the joke.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.280
[Guest 1]: But just as a side note, this kind of paternalism nudging people to better food choices through

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.320
[Guest 3]: taxation is a really bad idea.

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.320
[Guest 3]: They wouldn't do it.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.320
[Guest 2]: I mean, they're not doing that.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.320
[Guest 1]: I know.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.320
[Guest 2]: The whole idea of a good GST was to have a single rate for all goods and services.

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.320
[Unknown]: No, no, I understand.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.760
[Guest 1]: But I'm saying we have gone so far away.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.760
[Guest 1]: I understand.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.760
[Guest 1]: But I'm not.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760
[Guest 1]: I think this is not a knowledge problem.

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.080
[Guest 1]: I think it's an incentive problem.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.080
[Guest 1]: Of course.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.840
[Guest 1]: If you have a proliferation of rates, you can control special interests.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.840
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.840
[Guest 2]: I mean, of course.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.520
[Guest 3]: Again, the political economy, the difference between what economists suggest and what politicians

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.520
[Guest 3]: suggest.

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.600
[Guest 3]: I'll give you an example here.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:21.560
[Guest 3]: In 2009, I think P. Chidambaram was the finance minister back then, we came up with the Direct

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.560
[Guest 3]: Taxes Code.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.560
[Guest 3]: Okay.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.440
[Guest 3]: Now, it was a very small code, which sort of was supposed to replace the Income Tax

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.760
[Guest 3]: Act.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.760
[Guest 3]: And along with the code, they had an 80-page explainer.

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.760
[Guest 3]: Okay.

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.080
[Guest 3]: Imagine the Income Tax Act of India being explained in just 80 pages.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.840
[Guest 3]: And I remember reading it over two to three hours and then writing a piece around it.

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:45.800
[Guest 3]: So I read it in three hours also, obviously, it was scuttled, because if that had come

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:52.440
[Guest 3]: through, you know, all the CAs would have gone out of job, and the IRS people would

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:57.080
[Guest 3]: have gone out of job, I mean, they wouldn't have gone out of job, but then the rent seeking

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.720
[Guest 3]: would have stopped.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:06.640
[Guest 3]: And so the moment, you know, P. Chidambaram was moved to Home Ministry, and our man, Pranab

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.440
[Guest 3]: Mukherjee took over, I mean, it just got...

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:15.160
[Guest 3]: Now we have a new Direct Taxes Code, which I mean, the news about it came up, which Vivek

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160
[Guest 1]: cannot read in three hours.

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.160
[Amit Varma]: No, I haven't.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:22.400
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode with Pooja Mehra on what the Chidambaram to Pranab Mukherjee shift

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.400
[Unknown]: did.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.160
[Amit Varma]: And that was a great episode.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.440
[Amit Varma]: And Pooja, unfortunately, is in Delhi, otherwise, we would have invited her to the studio for

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.440
[Guest 1]: this.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:30.440
[Guest 1]: And it's a lovely book.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.440
[Guest 1]: Please read Pooja Mehra's book.

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:32.760
[Amit Varma]: Please read Pooja Mehra's Lost Decade.

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And I should also point out that both Vivek and Shruti have done episodes with me on

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.600
[Guest 1]: GST.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.600
[Guest 1]: Very fine episodes.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.600
[Amit Varma]: Very fine episodes.

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.600
[Amit Varma]: Magnificent.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.600
[Amit Varma]: And the last one of them was with Shruti.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:47.760
[Amit Varma]: And if I remember correctly, it was called the Bad and Complex Tax, which sums it up

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:50.480
[Guest 3]: and kind of sums up what you're saying about your...

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:51.480
[Guest 3]: Simplify it.

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:52.480
[Guest 3]: That's your reading.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.480
[Guest 3]: PCT.

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.480
[Guest 3]: I mean, I pay GST every month.

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:55.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm in a bad state.

01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm in a bad state too.

01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm just keeping track of...

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.480
[Amit Varma]: Dude, I give invoices, pay GST, but I don't get the money.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.480
[Amit Varma]: GST is coming out of my pocket.

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.480
[Amit Varma]: So we are basically financing the government, right?

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, because there is a... it's bad working capital management at the moment.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.240
[Amit Varma]: It's like the great Sharad Joshi ji said, negative subsidy.

01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:17.240
[Unknown]: And how many times...

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.080
[Guest 1]: There's a great Sharad Joshi biography that has come out, I believe.

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.080
[Guest 2]: I'm going to go look for it.

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.120
[Guest 2]: How many times have you faced situations where the guy says that, madam, if you pay in cash,

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.120
[Guest 2]: then there won't be any GST.

01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.560
[Unknown]: Oh, by the way, this is not just...

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.920
[Guest 2]: Nobody is even caring about doing the billing and the receipts and everything.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.920
[Guest 3]: It's like it's easier for them.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:32.920
[Unknown]: No, no, no.

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:37.160
[Unknown]: I have discovered entire supply chains that are working in cash.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:40.800
[Guest 1]: So my tailor in Delhi, you can do everything by the book.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.800
[Guest 1]: But you know, GST has that whole supply chain backward linkage issue, right?

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:49.040
[Guest 1]: So she has a set of books for GST clients.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.280
[Guest 3]: She has a set of books for non-GST clients.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.280
[Guest 3]: This is a very old thing.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280
[Guest 3]: It has always been in India.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.280
[Unknown]: You know, corporates have...

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.600
[Guest 3]: I mean, forget your tailor.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.800
[Guest 2]: Corporates have always had books for income taxwala and their own book.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.200
[Guest 2]: So there is a reason why post-demonetization, cash utilization has come back to exactly

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.200
[Unknown]: the free levels.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.200
[Unknown]: Absolutely.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.200
[Guest 2]: Because nobody cares about these things anymore.

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.200
[Unknown]: Because you've figured out ways to do jugaar again.

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:10.560
[Guest 1]: No, but it tells you something when my tailor is doing it.

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.560
[Guest 1]: It doesn't...

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.400
[Guest 1]: I mean, I'm not surprised that the corporates are sophisticated enough, but the GST is such

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.400
[Guest 1]: a huge burden.

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:17.400
[Guest 1]: Of course.

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.800
[Unknown]: She's hurting them more.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.800
[Guest 1]: She's running a tailor shop no larger than this room in her own home.

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:25.800
[Guest 3]: You still have tailors in India?

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:29.480
[Amit Varma]: Yaar, tu matlab bahut hi elite ka elite hai.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.760
[Amit Varma]: Just now you will realize, Shruti, when we were discussing GST rates, he did not know

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.160
[Amit Varma]: GST rate for biscuit, but he knew GST rate for diamond and gold.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.800
[Guest 3]: Vivek Kaur, you have been exposed.

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:44.000
[Guest 3]: Yeah, you're supposed to know.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.560
[Guest 3]: But I knew the GST rate for Mercedes also.

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.560
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.720
[Amit Varma]: Diamond gold pe kyu rukh rahe ho yaar?

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.120
[Amit Varma]: Uske upar jao toda.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.440
[Guest 3]: It depends on how many diamonds you buy.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.440
[Guest 3]: I don't believe.

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.320
[Guest 1]: Podcasters and journalists ki shaan hi alag hai.

01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:58.320
[Amit Varma]: Shaan hi alag hai.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.320
[Amit Varma]: Let's abhi agle reform pe move karte hain.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.880
[Guest 2]: Rajeshwari ji ka turn hai.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.760
[Amit Varma]: Rajeshwari ji, bachayiye humein is banter se.

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:09.760
[Guest 2]: I'm not even going to attempt to break into Hindi because then I'll be truly exposed.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.000
[Guest 2]: So the next reform that I'm going to talk about is going to take us quite far away from

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.280
[Guest 2]: fiscal worries, etc.

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.160
[Guest 2]: It's actually about immigration.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:27.600
[Guest 2]: And it's something that I'm very closely and very sincerely believe in, which is, so there's

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.960
[Guest 2]: a very fantastic book that has come out recently by Tony Joseph called Early Indians.

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.640
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode with him as well.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.640
[Guest 2]: Fantastic.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.560
[Guest 2]: I have not heard that and I will definitely.

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:44.640
[Guest 2]: So it's a compelling read where Tony Joseph uses recent pathbreaking DNA research to essentially

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:51.320
[Guest 2]: trace the history of Indians and essentially the truth that comes out of the book to summarize

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:56.080
[Guest 2]: in a sentence is who we are and where we have come from.

01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:02.000
[Guest 2]: And the truth is that we are all immigrants and we have all come from somewhere else.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.120
[Guest 2]: And of course, he talks about the waves of migration, so on and so forth.

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.760
[Guest 2]: So now, the reason I started with that is basically to say that there is nothing called

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.760
[Guest 2]: a pure Indian.

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.720
[Guest 2]: There's nothing called an indigenous Indian, right?

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.280
[Guest 2]: We are all from somewhere else.

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:21.840
[Guest 2]: And in that spirit and in a world where there is so much of intolerance now and border closing

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:28.720
[Guest 2]: obsessions and whatnot, I think that we should we should be a country again in the dream

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:35.400
[Guest 2]: world where we open up our gates and borders and doors, whatever you have, to whoever wants

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.120
[Guest 2]: to come and live in India.

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.480
[Guest 2]: Now, if that doesn't agree with your moral fiber, for whatever reason, then the next

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:45.440
[Guest 2]: layer I would say is open up the borders to those who are desperate and helpless, which

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.360
[Guest 2]: would be the refugees.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:51.000
[Guest 2]: If that too doesn't agree with the moral fiber, for again, whatever reason, the third layer

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.720
[Guest 2]: that I would settle down in my dream world is open up your gates to those who are skilled.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:03.080
[Guest 2]: For example, whoever has an undergraduate degree from a decent university in the world,

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:06.960
[Guest 2]: give them immediately a work visa and let them work in India and after 10 years, naturalize

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.640
[Guest 2]: them and give them Indian citizenship or encourage students from all over the world to come and

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.720
[Guest 2]: study in Indian colleges and universities.

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:17.840
[Guest 2]: And don't stop at giving them a college degree, offer them jobs, offer them citizenship.

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.480
[Guest 2]: I think India should aspire to be a country where people want the Indian citizenship.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.800
[Guest 2]: And that should be the level that we should dream about instead of saying that we are

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:29.880
[Guest 2]: going to be this very insular country where we care about indigenous Indians.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:34.760
[Guest 2]: And I think we are going exactly the regressive way because immigrants are great because immigrants,

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.760
[Guest 2]: they bring knowledge, they bring capabilities, they integrate us with their countries.

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.640
[Guest 2]: They help knowledge sharing.

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:45.120
[Guest 2]: They are, research shows, they're low on crime because they are scared of getting deported.

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.240
[Guest 2]: So they basically work hard to stand on their own feet.

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:52.320
[Guest 2]: They don't have a political clout, so they don't ask for your welfare benefits.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:56.240
[Guest 2]: And there are countries which have been built by immigrants, as we all know.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:02.640
[Guest 2]: I mean, my favorite example is Steve Jobs, who was the child, illegitimate child of a

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:08.640
[Guest 2]: Syrian father who was a refugee, so to speak, in the U.S. and a Catholic mother of Swiss

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:10.160
[Guest 2]: German descent.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.720
[Guest 2]: And that would be impossible today because Syrian refugee would obviously be turned away.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.880
[Guest 2]: The other example, of course, is Barack Obama, who is the child of a Kenyan father and a

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.960
[Guest 2]: mother of, and let me remember this correctly, English, Swiss, German, Scottish, Irish and

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.120
[Guest 2]: Welsh ancestry.

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:32.680
[Guest 2]: And they got married at a time when Barack Obama's father was a student in Hawaii on

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:35.240
[Guest 2]: scholarship, a foreign student on scholarship.

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:37.440
[Guest 2]: So and there are, of course, many, many such examples, right?

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.680
[Guest 2]: So I think India, in my dream world, we should aspire to be that country where we are open

01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:46.360
[Guest 2]: to immigrants and we are naturalizing them into citizenship.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:50.040
[Guest 2]: We will not get the good brains of U.S. and Europe, perhaps, but we will get the good

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:53.600
[Guest 2]: brains of South Asian countries, of Middle Eastern countries, of African countries.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.800
[Guest 2]: And I think that is great, and that's what we should dream about.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:06.000
[Guest 3]: This reminds me of a Javed Akhtar song, Panchi Nadiya, Pawan Ke Jhoke, Koi Sarad Naon Hai

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
[Unknown]: Hoke.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Refugee songs.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.880
[Amit Varma]: This is very, this is not pre-planned at all.

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:11.880
[Unknown]: We did not know each other.

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.720
[Amit Varma]: Sing, Vivek is just this encyclopediac brain on this.

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.720
[Guest 1]: It's a lovely song.

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:18.720
[Guest 1]: The movie is terrible.

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:19.720
[Amit Varma]: I have to say this is a great reform.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:20.720
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you entirely.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.480
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode on immigration also.

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:23.640
[Guest 3]: I've had so many episodes.

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:27.040
[Guest 3]: But how do you explain then what will happen to India's demographic dividend?

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:29.760
[Guest 3]: Our people are not getting jobs and foreigners are not getting jobs.

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.240
[Guest 2]: That's obviously not the kind of thinking that I would subscribe to when I'm dreaming

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:36.600
[Guest 2]: of immigration because that's why I had three layers, right?

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:40.400
[Guest 2]: I said, okay, once you open up the gates to everybody, doesn't agree with the moral fiber,

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.940
[Guest 2]: open up gates to refugees, doesn't agree to moral fiber.

01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:46.480
[Guest 2]: If you're only allowing skilled people, I think the numbers will be too minuscule to

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.600
[Guest 2]: make a difference to a large demographic dividend, if anything.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.960
[Guest 2]: And if you're really worried about it, then the Indian state should think about or the

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:57.720
[Guest 2]: private sector, the markets that you are not going to worsen the demographic dividend problem

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.320
[Guest 2]: by letting people coming in who are probably more skilled.

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.480
[Guest 2]: The whole idea is why should we be restricted to our local skill pool?

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:06.480
[Guest 2]: We should be able to access the skill pool everywhere in the world.

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.800
[Guest 2]: And starting with my initial premise, there is nothing called Indians to begin with.

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:16.160
[Guest 2]: We should first have a change of mindset instead of having that kind of an insular mentality.

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:20.840
[Guest 1]: I would add to what you're saying, not just for the immigration purposes, but also add

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:24.160
[Guest 1]: tourism to it, because I think it's pertinent, right?

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:27.640
[Guest 1]: I mean, there is a certain kind of immigration, which just goes to another country and just

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:28.720
[Guest 1]: moves there.

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:33.560
[Guest 1]: But I think people are more likely to mingle and, you know, think about living in another

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.120
[Guest 1]: place or working in another place or sharing their skills.

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:41.960
[Guest 1]: And you know, sort of this kind of cultural exchange, intellectual exchange, if they can

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.920
[Guest 1]: visit more easily, they've simplified the process of getting an Indian visa.

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.880
[Guest 1]: But it's still a hassle, right?

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:54.560
[Guest 1]: I mean, we can just do, you know, unilateral, no visa required to come to India.

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.560
[Guest 2]: Absolutely.

01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:00.280
[Guest 2]: I mean, the tourist visa, but in the work visa, I was just reading up some of the rules.

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.580
[Guest 2]: I mean, the stipulation of the work visa is that the person applying for a visa needs

01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:08.400
[Guest 2]: to have an income of 25,000 US dollars a year.

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.240
[Guest 2]: And only then can you be given a work visa.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.160
[Guest 2]: That's almost about 20 lakhs a year.

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:14.280
[Guest 2]: Why do you have to have these stipulations to give a job?

01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.960
[Guest 2]: If somebody wants to be a secretary or whatever it is, right?

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.480
[Guest 2]: Any job that the person wants, give him or her that job.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.480
[Guest 2]: Why do you have this weird kind of a restriction?

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:23.040
[Guest 3]: And that too for five years, by the way.

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:31.680
[Guest 3]: So talking about tourism, a couple of years back, I went to Bali with my immediate family.

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:34.400
[Guest 3]: And so I remember this.

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:40.200
[Guest 3]: So when we were leaving Bombay, I sort of gave my passport to the Bureau of Immigration

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.720
[Guest 3]: and the guy said, where is the visa?

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.640
[Guest 3]: So I had to tell him that visa doesn't apply in Bali.

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.640
[Guest 3]: So then he said, no, but Veera, is visa on arrival?

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.640
[Guest 3]: I said, no, visa doesn't apply.

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.120
[Guest 3]: So he was very surprised that there is this place in Doha, you know, very close to where

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:55.720
[Guest 3]: we are, which doesn't require a visa.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:02.160
[Guest 3]: And the best part is you land, you know, in Bali and you just walk out, I mean, they take

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.920
[Guest 3]: a picture and you walk out of the airport.

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:09.680
[Guest 3]: And there are more requirements, I mean, there were more requirements for me to fill up when

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.600
[Guest 3]: I came back to India.

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.920
[Guest 3]: And the other thing I really can't understand is that, you know, when someone is leaving

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:21.280
[Guest 3]: the country, you don't have to have a Bureau of Immigration there and, you know, create

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.280
[Guest 3]: a...

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:27.120
[Guest 3]: I can understand that, you know, when someone's coming back, when someone's coming into the

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.200
[Guest 3]: country, there has to be, you know, I mean, a check.

01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.800
[Guest 3]: But when you're leaving the country, I mean, not my headache, right?

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:35.800
[Guest 1]: You know, my problem is not that they check it.

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:36.800
[Guest 1]: It's okay.

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.800
[Guest 1]: I mean, the stamp takes a minute.

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.880
[Guest 2]: The question is how cumbersome the process is and what is the reason for doing it?

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:46.640
[Guest 2]: And exactly the same for having foreign students coming in or foreign nationals coming in and

01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:49.160
[Guest 2]: being here and getting a job and getting nationalized into India.

01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:53.480
[Guest 2]: Why can't we dream of that world that it's possible there are people in South Asian countries

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:57.040
[Guest 2]: who would really give anything to come here and work and get a degree.

01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.880
[Guest 2]: And that's perfectly fine for us because we actually benefit from it.

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.680
[Guest 2]: So I'll give you a small number, which will show you how lopsided the thing is.

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:09.320
[Guest 2]: The total number of foreign students who are studying in other countries in 2017 was 5

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:10.320
[Guest 2]: million.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:15.280
[Guest 2]: In India, there are only about 48-49,000 foreign students, which is less than 1% of the number.

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:19.840
[Guest 2]: As opposed to that, Indian students studying abroad are about 3 lakh.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:22.760
[Guest 2]: So it's massive because that's about close to 6%.

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:26.800
[Guest 1]: And that tells you something about our education system also.

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:31.540
[Guest 2]: We are very, very fine with our students going to other countries and, you know, making a

01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:32.540
[Guest 2]: name for themselves.

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:35.660
[Guest 2]: I mean, there is an Indian in the US who's standing for some local election, we'll just

01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:38.640
[Guest 2]: beat our chest and say, Oh, look, there's an Indian connection who's standing for some

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.400
[Guest 2]: US election, etc.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.800
[Guest 2]: But when it comes to them coming here, we have all these long pages of restrictions

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.400
[Guest 2]: and no, you cannot do this, you cannot do that.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.400
[Guest 2]: But why?

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.960
[Guest 2]: I mean, why can't we just open up and say, fine, come here, get a degree, get a job and

01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.020
[Guest 2]: become Indian, get an Indian citizenship.

01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:56.200
[Guest 2]: So I absolutely don't understand why we haven't done it.

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.520
[Guest 3]: And I think that's something that we should definitely do.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.520
[Guest 3]: I think I'll have to rephrase what I said in the sense that, you know, when you're leaving

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.000
[Guest 3]: the country in this day and age with Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, yes, I mean, I guess

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.200
[Guest 3]: we have to be careful.

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:09.200
[Guest 1]: Let's move on now.

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.240
[Guest 1]: And Pranay Roy apparently also is on that list, because he was stopped at the airport

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:14.240
[Guest 1]: the other day.

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.240
[Amit Varma]: There you go.

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:18.320
[Guest 3]: No, but these guys are not on the list, which is why they left.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.320
[Guest 1]: No, they were on the list.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.920
[Guest 1]: We knew when they were leaving, so we could look the other way.

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:23.840
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on now to reform number eight.

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's my turn again.

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:26.240
[Amit Varma]: And this is a pet reform.

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:30.160
[Amit Varma]: And it's actually a reform I feel really, really strongly about.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:33.520
[Amit Varma]: And the reform very simply is abolish family planning.

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:40.360
[Amit Varma]: I think population control is one of the absolute worst ideas of modern India.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:43.760
[Amit Varma]: And this is at two levels.

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:47.640
[Amit Varma]: It's at what I would say a consequential level and a deontological level.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Let me explain both.

01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:55.360
[Amit Varma]: One, there is this kind of zero sum thinking where, started, of course, famously by Malthus

01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:01.400
[Amit Varma]: and now called Malthusian, where the sense is that there are only so many natural resources,

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.440
[Amit Varma]: we are going to run out of them if there are too many people.

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we have to do population control.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And what this completely ignores, and this has been proven completely false over the

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.040
[Amit Varma]: centuries, but the myth still persists.

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.880
[Amit Varma]: And what this completely ignores is that human beings are, in the words of the economist

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:21.960
[Amit Varma]: Julian Simon, the ultimate resource.

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:27.880
[Amit Varma]: And what typically happens is that the more the population density anywhere, the greater

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.880
[Amit Varma]: the prosperity that you're likely to see.

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.880
[Amit Varma]: You see this at the level of countries where you have countries like Bahrain and Monaco,

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.780
[Amit Varma]: which have far greater population density than say Bangladesh or India.

01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:43.360
[Amit Varma]: You see this within any country, where the most prosperous parts of a country are those

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:47.960
[Amit Varma]: parts with the greatest population density, which is why cities are the richest parts

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:52.680
[Amit Varma]: of any country and the history of humankind is a history of urbanization.

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:58.400
[Amit Varma]: People move from less populated areas to more populated areas because you get the chance

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:05.320
[Amit Varma]: to be part of larger economic networks with all the benefits of specialization and division

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:12.080
[Amit Varma]: of labor that entails and also because people are, you know, to quote Simon again, the ultimate

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:13.080
[Amit Varma]: resource.

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:22.440
[Amit Varma]: So with our ingenuity, we get over any possible shortfall of natural resources that happens.

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:27.800
[Amit Varma]: And this also kind of plays to the point that Rajeshwari made about immigration, where people

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.320
[Amit Varma]: might well ask that why should you let people in on a work visa when, as we discussed earlier

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:35.120
[Amit Varma]: in this episode, there is such a massive jobs crisis.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.480
[Amit Varma]: And my sense is no, the thing is that the more people there are, the better we will

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:40.480
[Amit Varma]: do.

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:44.400
[Amit Varma]: One of the problems that we currently have, which seems to be because of too many people

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:47.360
[Amit Varma]: are problems of bad governance.

01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:52.040
[Amit Varma]: Many of the reforms that we've suggested play exactly to that bad governance, bad incentives,

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:53.440
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth.

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:59.760
[Amit Varma]: If people were a problem, people would not be moving from rural areas to cities.

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:04.360
[Amit Varma]: And we would not be constantly logically, rationally urbanizing.

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.480
[Amit Varma]: In fact, if you're listening this and you live in a city, you've actually, you know,

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:12.160
[Amit Varma]: in a sense voted with your feet or by being where you are.

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:16.840
[Amit Varma]: My second more important point, and this makes me really angry, the moral point, the deontological

01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:22.240
[Amit Varma]: point is that our bodies do not belong to the state.

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:26.320
[Amit Varma]: We are all individuals, the job of the state should be to protect our bodies, not to tell

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.560
[Amit Varma]: us how many children we may or may not have.

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:32.680
[Amit Varma]: I, of course, have chosen, we have chosen not to have any, but that's a different matter.

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:37.560
[Amit Varma]: That choice is something that should be made by all individuals.

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:39.240
[Amit Varma]: And to me, it is shock.

01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:45.440
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not just, you know, I'm not just outraged by the kind of coercive family planning and

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:50.000
[Amit Varma]: the Nazbandis carried out by that monster Sanjay Gandhi during the emergency and his

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:53.760
[Amit Varma]: equally monstrous mother, the kind of policies they put in place.

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.160
[Amit Varma]: Family planning still exists in India today.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:02.840
[Amit Varma]: The Ministry of Health still incentivizes local level workers to, you know, still today

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:06.200
[Amit Varma]: to carry out Nazbandis and to carry out sterilizations.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:12.640
[Amit Varma]: And the state is giving incentives to coerce people or to, you know, for people often to

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:17.680
[Amit Varma]: themselves going and it's always, again, the women who are at the receiving end of this.

01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Very rarely will you find that the man is actually going to a clinic and saying, chalo

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:23.040
[Amit Varma]: Nazbandi karwa do.

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.240
[Amit Varma]: It's the women with whom it's a problem.

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:29.120
[Amit Varma]: So these are the two problems I have, consequential and moral.

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:30.120
[Amit Varma]: I think Vivek raised this.

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.120
[Guest 1]: I have a frivolous point.

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:38.960
[Guest 1]: I think this comes from a more fundamental misunderstanding of the world we live in.

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:42.880
[Guest 1]: You know, economists would always tell you that resources are scarce, but resources are

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:43.880
[Guest 1]: scarce.

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:44.880
[Guest 1]: They're not fixed.

01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:45.880
[Guest 1]: Right.

01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:49.120
[Guest 1]: And the resources aren't fixed because of human ingenuity.

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:50.120
[Guest 1]: Right.

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.120
[Guest 1]: Now, look at a city like Bombay.

01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:56.440
[Guest 1]: You have a fixed piece of land in the sense that, you know, there's only so much land.

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:59.680
[Guest 1]: It's a peninsula and there's water surrounding it.

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:06.560
[Guest 1]: Right, because of human ingenuity on things like concrete, right, or elevators, elevators,

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:10.080
[Guest 1]: according to me, are the best mass transit system, right?

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:14.240
[Guest 1]: Because you can go up so many floors in a matter of seconds.

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:18.200
[Guest 1]: And so that didn't come because that resource existed.

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:21.120
[Guest 1]: Human beings had to make that resource, right?

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:26.840
[Guest 1]: And it existed only in a world where the size of the market was large enough to allow that

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:29.400
[Guest 1]: kind of division of labor and specialization.

01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:35.160
[Guest 1]: So what we need in the world is more people, more prosperous people, more productive people.

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:36.160
[Guest 1]: Right.

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:38.920
[Guest 1]: This idea that Bombay has fixed amount of land.

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:40.760
[Guest 1]: I hear this all the time in Bombay.

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.240
[Guest 1]: We have a fixed amount of land.

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.600
[Guest 1]: There's only so much road.

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:44.600
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.080
[Guest 1]: But our transit system is not the road alone.

01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:48.720
[Guest 2]: Our transit system is also the phone.

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:51.640
[Guest 2]: And actually, contrary to perception, India has a lot of land.

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.320
[Guest 1]: Land is not a problem.

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.640
[Guest 1]: No, but in Bombay, you'll see, right?

01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.080
[Amit Varma]: Like there's nowhere to expand.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.080
[Amit Varma]: Digression, digression.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:01.680
[Guest 1]: But it's not about the land alone.

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:04.280
[Guest 1]: I mean, there are only seven musical notes.

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:07.200
[Guest 1]: And yet we manage to produce more and more tunes.

01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:11.360
[Guest 1]: So the idea is there is human beings are the resource.

01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.360
[Guest 1]: Why?

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:14.480
[Guest 1]: Because their skill and productivity is the resource.

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.440
[Guest 1]: So the resources are finite as long as human beings and the ingenuity is finite, which

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.920
[Guest 1]: thankfully it is not.

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:21.920
[Unknown]: Right.

01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:28.400
[Guest 1]: So it comes from a planning control mindset that resources are fixed, right?

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.200
[Guest 1]: Because there is no incentive for those people to innovate on how you use those resources.

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:34.360
[Guest 1]: So this is a really big problem.

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:39.200
[Guest 1]: So if you look at like Paul Romer and all the new, you know, endogenous growth theory

01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:40.200
[Guest 1]: and so on and so forth.

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:43.720
[Guest 1]: Earlier, there was this idea that growth is a function of some lever you pull, right?

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:45.720
[Guest 1]: Some exogenous shock will happen.

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.600
[Guest 1]: You'll get this spurt of growth and that'll, you know, there'll be some spillover effect

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:50.640
[Guest 1]: and that's it.

01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:55.680
[Guest 1]: But what you talked about cities, cities are endogenous growth engines, right?

01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:01.680
[Guest 1]: There is growth because of something inherent that is happening when a lot of people mingle

01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:07.280
[Guest 1]: with each other in a small physical space or a small intellectual space.

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.560
[Guest 1]: So and as you pointed out, most of us choose to live in dense places because that's where

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.140
[Guest 1]: the opportunities are.

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:15.400
[Guest 1]: So this is, you know, part of the problem.

01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:19.500
[Guest 1]: The other part of the problem is we are very poor on service delivery.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:24.840
[Guest 1]: So the metaphor for the Indian citizen when it comes to life is standing in line, right?

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.960
[Guest 1]: That is really the life of the common man.

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.320
[Guest 1]: So when you're standing in line, you blame everyone who's standing in front of you.

01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.580
[Guest 1]: That's really the problem.

01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:36.920
[Guest 1]: So this mindset comes for the state from one place, it manifests in the citizen from a

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:41.680
[Guest 1]: completely different place because we have just failed to provide the basic services

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.160
[Guest 1]: that you need, right?

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:47.040
[Guest 1]: The elevator was not provided by the state and the buses the state doesn't provide.

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.040
[Amit Varma]: So that's the problem.

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And to quickly add to that before we sort of go on is what also strikes me about population

01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:58.160
[Amit Varma]: is that anyone who complains about the population being a problem is basically saying other

01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:59.160
[Amit Varma]: people are the problem.

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.160
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, they are also part of the population.

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:06.600
[Amit Varma]: And if you ask any one individual, are you a net cost to society or a net benefit?

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:08.280
[Amit Varma]: Are you giving more than you're taking out?

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.060
[Amit Varma]: I think everybody would say that no, I should be the one.

01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:15.760
[Amit Varma]: But somehow, other people are the problem and they think other people are the problem

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:23.040
[Guest 1]: because of this constraint on public service delivery by the resources for which bad governance

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:24.040
[Guest 2]: is a problem.

01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.040
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.040
[Guest 2]: Bad governance is the problem.

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:29.240
[Guest 2]: And of course, I mean, the way I see it is it's it's an escapism by the government, right?

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:33.000
[Guest 2]: So the government is saying, oh, we have failed to do our job of providing public goods and

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
[Unknown]: services.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.480
[Guest 2]: And therefore, I'm going to just push the burden on you.

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.880
[Guest 2]: It's your responsibility to solve the problem by not having kids.

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.360
[Guest 2]: Now, one thing that I want to point out here is one country that tried this for a very

01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:47.440
[Guest 2]: long period of time was, of course, China and the negative consequences of that, the

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:52.280
[Guest 2]: side effect that happened was actually and I've seen that happen in the US with my friends

01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.280
[Guest 2]: is the Chinese.

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.800
[Guest 2]: They obviously they moved in large numbers to the US.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:59.960
[Guest 2]: And once in the US, they actually started having kids there.

01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:04.820
[Guest 2]: So I actually have friends who have so their parents had one kid in China and they have

01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:07.860
[Guest 2]: actually moved to the US to have another kid.

01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:10.080
[Guest 2]: And then they have taken the entire family back in the US.

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.880
[Guest 2]: And there is this brain drain that's happening from China because the Chinese government

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:14.240
[Guest 2]: has imposed this control.

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:18.440
[Guest 2]: So every time we bring a draconian measure like this, we should be very aware of the

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.360
[Guest 2]: consequence that it's going to happen because people are not going to be subservient and

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:25.760
[Guest 2]: say, oh, we are going to listen to it, people will find ways around it.

01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:28.880
[Guest 2]: And the ways around it are not going to be good for the economy in the society in the

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:29.880
[Guest 1]: long run.

01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:35.080
[Guest 1]: I want to add one more thing to this, Rukmini has just had a piece on how population control

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.400
[Unknown]: is tightly linked to female foeticide, right?

01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.760
[Guest 1]: So this is just, you know, since you're talking about these unintended and perverse consequences,

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:47.200
[Guest 1]: I don't agree with population control for any reason.

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:50.760
[Guest 1]: But one of the terrible consequences of that is gender selection prenatally.

01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:57.580
[Guest 2]: I mean, in terms of dense population, I mean, one example that I can think of is Hong Kong.

01:57:57.580 --> 01:58:00.440
[Guest 2]: It's one of it's the highest population density in the world.

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:03.760
[Guest 2]: And if you go to Hong Kong, do you feel that there are no public good services because

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.240
[Guest 2]: there are many people absolutely not go to Tokyo, there are people standing in lines

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:10.520
[Guest 2]: to get into the metro in Tokyo, but then are we going to say there's no public goods and

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:11.520
[Guest 2]: services?

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:12.520
[Guest 2]: Absolutely not.

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:16.040
[Guest 2]: So it's a sham that we create that because we are a densely populated country, therefore,

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.800
[Amit Varma]: we are poor, and therefore, we don't have public goods and services.

01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:18.800
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point.

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:21.120
[Guest 1]: It's a state blaming the society for its own failures.

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.120
[Guest 1]: Absolutely.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.120
[Amit Varma]: For existing.

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:27.720
[Guest 3]: So the first point I wanted to make was about land.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:33.440
[Guest 3]: So, you know, in Mumbai, the problem is obviously the low FSI and low FSI is where all the state

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:34.440
[Guest 3]: government politicians

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:52.360
[Guest 3]: I mean, I don't know if many people would know that the government of India also manufactures

01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360
[Guest 3]: condoms, right?

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, why?

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:55.360
[Amit Varma]: And sex toys.

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.360
[Amit Varma]: So, yeah, okay.

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.360
[Amit Varma]: No, it literally does.

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:02.640
[Amit Varma]: Obviously, you know, Pavan Srinath and I were just once sort of researching into this back

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:03.640
[Guest 1]: in the days of Pragat.

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:08.120
[Guest 1]: I don't know if I'm more aghast that they do it or you have this information.

01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:11.640
[Guest 3]: I have this information because I care about good governance.

01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:12.640
[Guest 3]: No.

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:16.600
[Guest 3]: So the funny point is, you know, people know that the government manufactures Nirodh, but

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:20.760
[Guest 3]: they don't know that the government also manufactures Mood condoms.

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:25.280
[Guest 3]: So which is, so every time you're using, you know, Mood condoms, you're basically using

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:30.780
[Guest 3]: a product manufactured by a company which belongs to the government of India.

01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:33.920
[Amit Varma]: This is like the same guy owning a sweet shop and a gym side by side.

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:39.560
[Guest 2]: When I listen to these things, I get the feeling that we are literally, literally dreaming

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:43.440
[Guest 2]: here because when we are in a country like this, where the government is doing everything

01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:48.200
[Guest 1]: possible and we're talking about markets and private enterprise.

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:51.440
[Guest 1]: Maybe the population is out of control because of the government condoms, I mean, everything

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:55.440
[Unknown]: else they produce is such poor quality.

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.440
[Unknown]: I would not.

01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:59.200
[Guest 1]: I mean, this is a PSA announcement from Vivek.

01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:02.400
[Unknown]: He's telling you the brands, so no, you don't use them.

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.520
[Guest 3]: Don't fly Air India and don't use Mood.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:06.680
[Guest 3]: No, I fly Air India all the time.

02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:09.040
[Guest 3]: Best seats, 25 kg luggage allowed.

02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:11.720
[Guest 3]: I get scolded by the air hostesses when I ask for something.

02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:17.560
[Guest 3]: And my best part is that at least I'm putting my tax money to some good use.

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:20.320
[Guest 3]: Because that is what is being used to rescue the airline.

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:22.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, they've asked for 2000 crores.

02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.440
[Amit Varma]: That's a sunk cost fallacy.

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:24.960
[Guest 3]: You're throwing good money after bad.

02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.680
[Guest 3]: We have done episodes on this for other shows not yet released.

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:31.920
[Guest 3]: No, but then see, if I have the choice, if the price between an Indigo and an Air India

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:32.920
[Guest 2]: is the same, why would I travel to Indigo?

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:35.920
[Guest 2]: Vivek is the guy who's enabling the fat cat government.

02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:39.240
[Amit Varma]: No, he's not, because they're not running on his ticket price.

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.560
[Guest 1]: They're running on our taxes.

02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:43.080
[Guest 1]: He is benefiting from our unintended largesse.

02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:47.600
[Guest 3]: He's being subsidized for his 25 kgs.

02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:52.520
[Guest 3]: I wanted to make a point about the unintended consequence of female petricide.

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:57.960
[Guest 3]: I mean, or for the fact that what the one child policy in China now, I mean, a lot of

02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:03.680
[Guest 3]: Chinese men are not finding brides because of or look at what has happened in Haryana,

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:09.120
[Guest 3]: which has had a very low, you know, male, female, female, male ratio, and they import

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:16.800
[Guest 3]: brides from I read a story in India today, at least two decades back, about how Haryanvi

02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:21.760
[Guest 3]: men are importing Malayali brides because Kerala has, you know, more women than men.

02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.640
[Guest 1]: First, they're sharing them and literally treating them like sex slaves.

02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:28.480
[Amit Varma]: So in a household, if there are three brothers, they will share a bride.

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:32.120
[Amit Varma]: Haryana was, by the way, mentioned in great detail in my fantastic episode with Namita

02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:33.120
[Amit Varma]: Bhandare.

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.880
[Guest 3]: If you guys heard this movie I saw many years back, I don't recall the name very, very disturbing

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:39.640
[Guest 3]: start Piyush Mishra.

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:44.000
[Guest 3]: It was about this village where they had run out of women.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.600
[Guest 3]: And one of the brother, it was a story of some seven brothers, I think, or six or and

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:54.160
[Guest 3]: one of the brothers went, you know, finally figures out that, you know, there's this woman

02:01:54.160 --> 02:02:02.840
[Guest 3]: who's available and, and she's ready to get married and he goes and turns out that, you

02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:05.440
[Guest 3]: know, she's not a woman, she's a man.

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.440
[Guest 3]: So.

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:07.440
[Amit Varma]: Interesting.

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:10.440
[Guest 3]: What was the name of the movie?

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.440
[Guest 3]: Matru Bhoomi.

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.440
[Guest 3]: Very, very disturbing.

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.440
[Guest 3]: Start Piyush Mishra.

02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.440
[Amit Varma]: That's how I remember it.

02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:17.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's now move on to our ninth reform.

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:21.280
[Guest 1]: And back to miss Shruti Rajagopalan.

02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:26.000
[Guest 1]: I would say, you know, I, I don't know if this is, I inadvertently ended up picking

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.560
[Guest 1]: up reforms that sort of benefit or affect the largest number possible.

02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:31.560
[Guest 1]: Right.

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:35.120
[Guest 1]: So, so that's where I was going with the, with the dreaming and the big thing.

02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:38.320
[Guest 1]: And I think the big one we need to solve is law and order.

02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.320
[Guest 1]: Right.

02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:41.280
[Guest 1]: And law and order has multiple parts to it.

02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:45.200
[Guest 1]: You know, we need a fixed prison system, we need to fix courts and things like that.

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:51.160
[Guest 1]: But I think at the very least, even before we improve quality and do police reform, judicial

02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:56.080
[Guest 1]: reform, I think one way to stimulate the economy with all this government spending is just

02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.640
[Guest 1]: triple the police force.

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:02.320
[Guest 1]: Just triple the number of courts, triple the number of judges, right?

02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:06.200
[Guest 1]: Triple our entire law enforcement structure.

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:11.240
[Guest 1]: Now I'm going to get trolled heavily for this because anytime I suggest adding to government,

02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:19.160
[Guest 1]: someone calls me and asks me to throw my non-existent libertarian card in the Ganges, which is dirty.

02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.760
[Amit Varma]: No, but I think libertarians like you and I kind of agree on one thing that what we

02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:28.480
[Amit Varma]: need is a small and strong government that does its limited job well, and not a large

02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:30.720
[Amit Varma]: and weak government as we have now.

02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:32.320
[Amit Varma]: And law and order falls within that.

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:33.320
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:38.200
[Guest 1]: So one is, no, but there are, you know, speaking of the unintended consequences, so what's

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:45.400
[Guest 1]: ended up happening in India is we keep passing laws as a substitute for enforcement, right?

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:48.520
[Guest 1]: So the number of rapes are on the rise, right?

02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:50.320
[Guest 1]: We don't know what to do about it.

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:52.600
[Guest 1]: There is some moral and public outrage.

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:58.560
[Guest 1]: So we pass a law that will, you know, change the juvenile rape to a normal rape law, or

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.480
[Guest 1]: we will change, you know, regular penalty to death penalty and so on and so forth.

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.920
[Guest 1]: But that's only one part, right?

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:07.360
[Guest 1]: Now making it death penalty doesn't mean it's being enforced more.

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:11.800
[Guest 1]: So the women are being raped as much or as little as they were before you pass this law,

02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:17.240
[Guest 1]: because no one, forget rape, you don't get called into question or even get a slap on

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:21.440
[Guest 1]: the wrist for anything, groping, molesting, leering.

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:25.800
[Guest 1]: Every woman I know has experienced someone, you know, flashing her and groping her and

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:26.800
[Guest 1]: so on.

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:28.240
[Guest 1]: And this is not just about women.

02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:29.880
[Guest 1]: It's about everyone, right?

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:35.560
[Guest 1]: So when you have very poor law enforcement, one of the consequences of that is there is

02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:38.480
[Guest 1]: selective enforcement, right?

02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.960
[Guest 1]: And the police must decide what is the most important case at hand.

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:49.020
[Guest 1]: Now when you can choose, you obviously, there is some politics involved in what are we choosing

02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:51.740
[Guest 1]: to enforce in society, right?

02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:56.840
[Guest 1]: So if you notice, it is always the disenfranchised who get harassed the most.

02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:59.720
[Guest 1]: So there used to be a section 377.

02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:03.440
[Guest 1]: It was never enforced, but it was used as, you know, the Matunga.

02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:06.400
[Amit Varma]: I wrote a column called the Matunga racket.

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:12.000
[Guest 1]: And this is basically, they're just harassing young same sex couples by threatening to out

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.680
[Guest 1]: them or take them to their parents or take their photographs and you know, so on so forth.

02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:20.120
[Guest 1]: The same thing happens when it comes to political issues, right?

02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:23.680
[Guest 1]: You selectively enforce what you're going to do.

02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:30.720
[Guest 1]: So the selective enforcement allows the government to use the police as a tool to punish any

02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:31.720
[Guest 1]: opponents.

02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:36.680
[Guest 1]: That's one very poor unintended consequence, or maybe an intended consequence of having

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:38.280
[Guest 1]: weak law enforcement.

02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:39.960
[Guest 1]: That's what you see in India.

02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:46.240
[Guest 1]: And now with this whole nationalist movement on the rise, people keep complaining that

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:51.240
[Guest 1]: you know, why are these people who are lynching going free and not getting, well, it's basically

02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:55.000
[Guest 1]: because our entire law enforcement system is completely broken.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:00.840
[Guest 1]: We have no chain of custody when it comes to evidence that requires people, it requires,

02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:04.760
[Guest 1]: it literally requires more hands on deck and manpower, right?

02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:07.200
[Guest 1]: Requires labs, it requires infrastructure.

02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:11.400
[Guest 1]: So one part of it is, of course, as a society, we're choosing to look the other way.

02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:17.320
[Guest 1]: But even if you have good people in a system that's broken, and is like just barely functioning,

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:20.360
[Guest 1]: you're going to get consequences like Bailu Khan, right?

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:24.880
[Guest 1]: So I think the big one we need to solve is law and order.

02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:29.400
[Guest 1]: And I think the first step towards solving that is just more hands on deck.

02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:34.720
[Guest 1]: I know some of the laws they will enforce are terrible, but we still just need more

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:35.720
[Guest 1]: law enforcement.

02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:41.160
[Guest 1]: We need more constables, more traffic police, you know, just the, we really need to increase

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:42.160
[Guest 2]: that number right now.

02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:45.360
[Guest 2]: So one question that I have there, Shruti, and you'll obviously know much more on this

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:49.400
[Guest 2]: than I do, which is that, isn't it the case and that there's research that shows that

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:53.800
[Guest 2]: just by increasing the number of courts and judges is really not going to solve the problem

02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:55.280
[Guest 2]: of the judiciary?

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:59.120
[Guest 2]: Because it's not that we have a problem of a broken judiciary, because we don't have

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:00.120
[Guest 2]: enough judges and courts.

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:01.120
[Guest 1]: No, we do.

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:02.120
[Guest 1]: The problem lies somewhere else.

02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:03.120
[Guest 1]: No, that is.

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:05.120
[Guest 1]: But that's a big part of the problem, right?

02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:10.240
[Guest 1]: Pendency rates are incredibly high and judicial workloads are very high for two reasons.

02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:13.200
[Guest 1]: One, we don't have enough judges and courts.

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:17.120
[Guest 1]: And two, the vacancies are staggering right now.

02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:18.120
[Amit Varma]: You know,

02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:19.120
[Amit Varma]: But can I add to a question?

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:22.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, just to add to a question, there seem to be two problems here.

02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:24.720
[Amit Varma]: One is state capacity, not enough cops.

02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:28.520
[Amit Varma]: And the other is wrong incentives for the state capacity that does exist, which is why

02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:32.720
[Amit Varma]: so many policemen are into rent seeking, for example, they will stand at signals and wait

02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:33.720
[Amit Varma]: to catch somebody.

02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:38.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, you can increase the state capacity, but the bad incentives are still in place.

02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:39.240
[Guest 1]: Yes.

02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:43.720
[Guest 1]: So I don't claim that just increasing the law enforcement will solve the entire criminal

02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:45.080
[Guest 1]: justice system.

02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:50.720
[Guest 1]: But I do think it helps to have more police on the streets or in the metro or at the train

02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:55.920
[Guest 1]: station to prevent basic things like right now, the system we've devolved into in India

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:59.160
[Guest 1]: is no one's even reporting a mugging.

02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:03.960
[Guest 1]: The only time you report a theft is because you need an FIR to get a new driver's license,

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:04.960
[Guest 1]: right?

02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:08.920
[Guest 1]: Or to, you know, give it to the credit card company to get out of fraud or something like

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:09.920
[Guest 1]: that.

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:15.880
[Guest 1]: So one of the consequences of just not having hands on deck is extreme underreporting.

02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:19.720
[Guest 1]: Because you have no one to report to and no one's willing to write the report.

02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:22.040
[Guest 1]: Or there's just no one present, right?

02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:24.560
[Guest 1]: Which means all your small offenses.

02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:29.560
[Guest 1]: And when I say small, I mean, minor in terms of both punishment and how society views them.

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:31.000
[Guest 1]: They just go underreported.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.600
[Guest 1]: So it looks like society doesn't have these problems, but the deadweight loss is somewhere

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:36.600
[Guest 1]: else.

02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:41.360
[Guest 1]: You know, people don't carry as much money as they would like to carry, right?

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:44.680
[Guest 1]: People don't carry gold when they travel across cities to go to a wedding or something like

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:46.680
[Guest 1]: that, because everyone's nervous, right?

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:49.680
[Guest 1]: You don't go out late at night, you don't go to watch a movie, you don't take a job

02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:52.060
[Guest 1]: that's going to require late hours.

02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.520
[Guest 1]: You don't go to a university that's too far, right?

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:57.680
[Guest 1]: So this is how it compounds.

02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:01.560
[Guest 1]: So will just having more police solve all problems?

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:02.560
[Guest 1]: No.

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:07.980
[Guest 1]: Will having more judges will go a much longer way in solving problems than more police.

02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:13.160
[Guest 1]: With police, there is also a fear that unless we fix the pernicious regulation, this could

02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:18.260
[Guest 1]: also manifest into an exercise where police has more control.

02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:25.360
[Guest 1]: But I think at this point, given how lawless our society is, I think this tradeoff, I think

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.360
[Amit Varma]: would be reasonable.

02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.480
[Amit Varma]: I guess what you're saying is more state capacity is necessary, but not sufficient.

02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:31.120
[Guest 1]: Yeah, it's absolutely necessary.

02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:34.160
[Guest 1]: And it could have some other unintended issues also.

02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:40.000
[Guest 1]: But I really think we need to go towards this because we are just living, you know, some

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.580
[Guest 1]: parts it's just anarchy the bad way, like, you know, the, it's just gundaraj going on

02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:47.760
[Guest 3]: in lots of towns and villages in India.

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:53.440
[Guest 3]: So, you know, one of the things I realized, so there is, I have a chapter on this in my

02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.280
[Guest 3]: India's big government book.

02:09:55.280 --> 02:10:03.800
[Guest 3]: So if you look at the pending cases, so one point is that what kind of cases are pending,

02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:04.800
[Guest 3]: okay.

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:09.920
[Guest 3]: And very, very interestingly, a lot of cases which are pending have to do with vehicle

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:10.920
[Guest 3]: chalans.

02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:11.920
[Guest 3]: Okay.

02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:15.820
[Guest 3]: Now that is not something that needs to go on and on and on.

02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:20.960
[Guest 3]: So all it needs is essentially a dedicated court, and you put in a few young guys, it's

02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:25.400
[Guest 3]: not like a complicated reading of the law that is required there, put in some recruit

02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:28.800
[Guest 3]: a few more young judges, put them there.

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:34.080
[Guest 3]: And then, you know, you can tackle this problem at a very fast pace, you can do it by post.

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.880
[Guest 3]: Also, the second thing that is, you know, this is something that Shailesh Gandhi had

02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:42.000
[Guest 3]: written a very interesting column on in the Times of India a few years back.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:46.080
[Guest 3]: And what he said was that it's not like the courts are not doing any work, they're disposing

02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:50.800
[Guest 3]: close to 2 crore cases a year, which is like a huge number.

02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:55.040
[Guest 3]: But what is happening is that the number of cases that sort of new cases that come on

02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.260
[Guest 3]: are more than that.

02:10:56.260 --> 02:11:01.740
[Guest 3]: So essentially, you know, if you sort of let's say, you know, I mean, I remember this offhand,

02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:04.220
[Guest 3]: so I may not be very sure of the numbers.

02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:10.280
[Guest 3]: So like India has, I think, the number of judges that the high court judges, the number

02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:13.400
[Guest 3]: of positions is around 1040 or something like that.

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:18.020
[Guest 3]: And the last time I checked, we had some 600 or something like that who were appointed

02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:19.160
[Guest 3]: to those posts.

02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:26.920
[Guest 3]: So the point is, even if we don't create extra posts, and we just appoint the number of,

02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:33.920
[Guest 3]: you know, the posts that are already there, that in itself will take care of a large part

02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:35.760
[Guest 3]: of the problem.

02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:41.840
[Guest 3]: And one frivolous point, basically, the police thing, you know, when you want to, the fact

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:44.560
[Guest 3]: that more police may not solve the problem.

02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:49.560
[Guest 3]: So there's this movie called China Gate many, many years back, which had, you know, the

02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:54.440
[Guest 3]: villain was played by this guy called Mukesh Tiwari, it was his first movie.

02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:58.640
[Guest 3]: And there's a line in the movie which said that ki hum se ladne ki taqat toh le aoge,

02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:01.360
[Guest 3]: par hamara kameena pan kahan se laoge.

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:07.560
[Amit Varma]: So you know, so you can, which completely goes against everything we say about incentives,

02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:12.800
[Amit Varma]: because level of kameena pan doesn't matter if incentives are right.

02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:15.280
[Guest 3]: So the new, so I'll tell you, it's really bad, by the way.

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:21.400
[Guest 3]: So basically, what happened was that, you know, and I mean, if you, you know, in Mumbai

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:25.600
[Guest 3]: now they've started to send traffic fines via SMS.

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:28.120
[Guest 3]: So you basically log on to an app and pay off.

02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:32.320
[Guest 3]: Now, what is happening is that, so you know, initially, when this happened, everyone was

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:36.360
[Guest 3]: like, okay, now these hawaldars won't be able to charge anything at all.

02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:40.400
[Guest 3]: But what has happened is that the bribes have, in fact, instead of going down, have gone

02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:41.400
[Guest 3]: up.

02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:42.400
[Guest 3]: Now, so basically…

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Because a hawaldar has less opportunity.

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:50.400
[Guest 3]: No, what is happening is, so when you get a fine, most people don't know that they've

02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:51.400
[Guest 3]: got a fine.

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.400
[Guest 3]: Okay.

02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:56.040
[Guest 3]: So let's say, during a random check, the hawaldar has his phone, he just has to sort,

02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:00.280
[Guest 3]: he has some sort of an app, which he points towards your number plate, and he immediately

02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:02.580
[Guest 3]: gets the fine outstanding.

02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:08.200
[Guest 3]: So let's say you've driven through the sea link a few times, and instead of driving at

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:13.600
[Guest 3]: less than 80 kilometers, you've driven at 95, and you have a fine outstanding of 4000

02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:14.600
[Guest 3]: bucks.

02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.320
[Guest 3]: So the first thing you'll do is that, you know, we need to confiscate your vehicle and

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:19.320
[Guest 3]: shut it down.

02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:23.880
[Guest 3]: And then you'll, he'll start at 500 bucks, and you know, you finally negotiate 200, 250,

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:25.240
[Guest 3]: and you go off.

02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:28.440
[Guest 3]: And earlier, these hawaldars, you could have paid them 50 bucks and…

02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:29.440
[Amit Varma]: You don't even drive a car.

02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:30.440
[Amit Varma]: How do you know this?

02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:31.440
[Amit Varma]: I drive a car.

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:33.720
[Guest 3]: Because I talk to all these cab, you know, cab guys that I…

02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:35.280
[Amit Varma]: The journalist who talks to the cabbie.

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.320
[Guest 3]: The best thing is, you should, you should now drive through the JJ flyover, okay?

02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:43.920
[Guest 3]: So the JJ flyover speed limit is now 30 kilometers an hour.

02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:48.240
[Guest 3]: So when you go there, and especially during the day when the traffic is not very heavy,

02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:50.880
[Guest 3]: you actually feel that everything is in slow motion.

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:56.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so once I was in fact on Worli sea link with our mutual friend Kumar, late at night,

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:58.160
[Amit Varma]: dropping him back home.

02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:00.840
[Amit Varma]: And there was a car going at the speed limit, right?

02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And we thought ki yeh kaun pagal hai, kya kar raha hai, speed limit pe chal raha hai.

02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:09.400
[Amit Varma]: So what I did was, as I passed him, I slowed down to go at his pace so we could look inside.

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:14.400
[Amit Varma]: And the driver was drinking a cup of coffee, he has a cup of coffee in his hand.

02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:20.560
[Guest 3]: So these days, if you are on the sea link, and you see any car going above 80, you would

02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:25.600
[Guest 3]: know that it is a non-Maharashtra or a non-Mumbai car, a number at least.

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:27.480
[Guest 3]: So because they don't know.

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:31.040
[Guest 3]: I go at whatever speed I want, I should check the app, I think.

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:33.160
[Guest 3]: You should, tumhara hoga hai.

02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:37.920
[Guest 3]: So one driver told me about his friend that, you know, his friend had a fine of some 22,000

02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:38.920
[Guest 3]: rupees.

02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:41.440
[Guest 1]: And so because people don't know, so I mean, this is the funny thing.

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:43.760
[Guest 1]: Have you guys ever been in a car with Amit?

02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:44.840
[Guest 1]: Yeah, why?

02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:47.960
[Guest 1]: He thinks traffic signals are a suggestion.

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.080
[Guest 1]: Well, it's, let us just say, he takes his libertarianism to this extreme.

02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:57.480
[Amit Varma]: Let me just say that Haidt spoke of emergent order and in a country with no rule of law,

02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:58.480
[Amit Varma]: sometimes you just follow the emergent order.

02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.480
[Unknown]: I have never been so terrified for my life.

02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:05.200
[Guest 3]: I'll give you some research in support of your point.

02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:09.560
[Guest 3]: So I think in some town in Holland, one of the Scandinavian countries, I mean, I'm not

02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:15.040
[Guest 3]: sure whether it was Holland, they decided that they'll do away with traffic lights.

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.680
[Guest 3]: And they did away with traffic lights.

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:19.520
[Guest 3]: And the accident rates, in fact, came down.

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.440
[Guest 3]: Because now, you know, everyone was driving even more carefully to ensure that they don't

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:24.440
[Guest 3]: that's interesting.

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:26.600
[Amit Varma]: But I have to say, I mean, I'm not that extreme.

02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:31.120
[Guest 3]: I do believe in traffic lights and for all my listeners is a great all your you know,

02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:33.240
[Guest 3]: the fact that you're libertarian.

02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:37.160
[Amit Varma]: So maybe for all my listeners is a great book called Traffic by Tom Vanderbilt.

02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:38.160
[Amit Varma]: Check that out.

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:43.320
[Amit Varma]: Lots of interesting insights such as the majority of accidents tend to happen when you're close

02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:44.720
[Amit Varma]: to home, which is very interesting.

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:45.720
[Amit Varma]: I didn't know that.

02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:49.160
[Amit Varma]: So you go on a long journey, but the accident probably won't happen throughout the journey.

02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:53.320
[Amit Varma]: But just when you're about to get home, possibly because you let your guard down, let's move

02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:54.320
[Guest 3]: on.

02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.840
[Amit Varma]: So when you don't know where you're going, so we do know where we are going.

02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:01.760
[Amit Varma]: We are now moving on to reform number 11.

02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:05.400
[Guest 1]: Okay, which is 1010 which is 1010 not 11.

02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:09.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the counting doesn't matter.

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:10.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:17.280
[Amit Varma]: Like you famously said, forget fiscal federalism, we can't count.

02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:19.200
[Amit Varma]: That's like the quote of the episode, right?

02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:20.200
[Guest 1]: It's nice.

02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:21.200
[Guest 1]: Absolutely.

02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:22.720
[Guest 3]: I'm sure Vivek will come up with something better.

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:26.400
[Guest 3]: No, I will come up with something better, but it will only be borrowed.

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.080
[Guest 3]: It won't be original.

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:31.600
[Guest 3]: And kindly give reason.

02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:37.480
[Guest 3]: So no, I mean, the final, the third thing I wanted to talk about is basically India's

02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:41.920
[Guest 3]: big government, on which I have, I wrote a 800 page tome.

02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:44.200
[Guest 1]: It's a very fine book.

02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:49.360
[Guest 3]: One of my friends called it very recently, you know, we were talking that, you know,

02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:53.440
[Guest 3]: I'm writing this new book and all that and he said, Kripya, is bar hati ka bacha nahi

02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:54.440
[Amit Varma]: likhiyega.

02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:57.200
[Amit Varma]: It's less of a book and more of a murder weapon.

02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:02.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if you eventually write crime fiction as friends like me persuade you to do so,

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:06.120
[Amit Varma]: your own book can feature as a murder weapon in the book.

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:08.880
[Guest 1]: The print in that book is really small.

02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:09.880
[Guest 1]: I have to point out.

02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:10.880
[Amit Varma]: It's small.

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:11.880
[Amit Varma]: But let us not intimidate readers.

02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:15.600
[Guest 1]: It's just a large book, but it's very well written.

02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:16.600
[Unknown]: It's a page turner.

02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:17.600
[Guest 3]: I strongly recommend.

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:22.600
[Guest 3]: It has some great, hilarious examples, which is why I'm the only one who's read it.

02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:31.720
[Guest 3]: What I'm trying to say is that the key theme in the book is that India has a big government,

02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:37.680
[Guest 3]: but not in terms of the number of people it employs, but in terms of what it hopes to

02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:38.680
[Guest 3]: achieve.

02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:42.760
[Guest 3]: I mean, or, you know, the technical term of, you know, for which is state capacity, as

02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:43.760
[Guest 3]: we say.

02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:48.360
[Guest 3]: So I think, you know, we need to sort of I mean, because we're talking about dream reforms

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:49.360
[Guest 3]: here.

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:53.640
[Guest 3]: So my dream is that the Indian government will get out of, you know, most of the things

02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:59.400
[Guest 3]: that it does and concentrate on five, six things, you know, defense, external affairs,

02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:07.400
[Guest 3]: agriculture, probably education, and so on and so forth, and health and not try to run

02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:12.320
[Guest 3]: Air India or Hindustan Photo Films for that matter.

02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:20.280
[Guest 3]: So manufacture sex toys, manufacture condoms, or, in fact, we even manufacture six-seaters.

02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:21.280
[Guest 3]: So there are seven-seaters.

02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:26.360
[Guest 3]: We have a company, we as taxpayers own a company called Hindustan Scooters Limited, which once

02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:30.600
[Guest 3]: upon a time used to produce the Vijay Super, and given that they don't produce the Vijay

02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:36.360
[Guest 3]: Super anymore, but what they produce is a seven-seater called Vikram.

02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:39.360
[Guest 3]: If you've, you know, ever traveled through this, you know, streets.

02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:42.360
[Guest 2]: See, the government is contradicting itself.

02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.600
[Guest 3]: On one hand, you're encouraging family planning, on the other hand, you're manufacturing seven-seaters.

02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:52.360
[Guest 3]: So yeah, so the government should sort of get out of all these things.

02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:56.800
[Guest 3]: I mean, like, you know, even before I came here, I was reading, you know, the news, in

02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:02.360
[Guest 3]: the newspaper today, there was this news about how Air India has asked, you know, the government

02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:04.360
[Guest 3]: again for money, you know, some 2,000 odd crores.

02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:08.360
[Guest 3]: Now, I mean, it's not, I mean, why should a government be running an airline?

02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:13.360
[Guest 3]: I mean, nowhere in the world does, at least not in the developed world, maybe in the developing

02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:14.720
[Guest 3]: world, they still do.

02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:16.640
[Guest 3]: So the government should not be running an airline.

02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:19.120
[Guest 3]: The government should not be making condoms.

02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:22.400
[Guest 3]: The government should not be making seven-seaters.

02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:27.680
[Guest 3]: The government should be, I mean, as far as banking is concerned, I think that, you know,

02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:31.880
[Guest 3]: if they want to be in banking, they should probably run five, six big banks, and then

02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:34.360
[Guest 3]: just sell off the, or just shut it down.

02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:38.480
[Guest 3]: I mean, you know, if a bank like Indian Overseas Bank shuts down, nothing is going to happen

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:40.520
[Guest 3]: to the state of the Indian economy.

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:45.760
[Guest 3]: I mean, or if you look at a bank like Bank of Maharashtra, I mean, it could possibly

02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:49.680
[Guest 3]: concentrate on the state of Maharashtra, where it has, you know, extensive presence.

02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:54.560
[Guest 3]: There's no point of, you know, Bank of Maharashtra opening a branch in Assam.

02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:57.360
[Guest 3]: It just doesn't make any sense.

02:19:57.360 --> 02:19:59.920
[Guest 3]: Or look at the Jammu and Kashmir Bank.

02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:06.260
[Guest 3]: By far the best example, Jammu and Kashmir Bank is not a, it's not a nationalized bank.

02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:11.480
[Guest 3]: It has branches in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, has access to, you know, a lot of

02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:14.560
[Guest 3]: deposits, and then, you know, it lends that money.

02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:18.960
[Guest 3]: So you need that kind of model, like Dena Bank, once upon a time, used to be pretty

02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:21.680
[Guest 3]: good at trade finance.

02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:25.600
[Guest 3]: So it could have specialized and continued to be in that space instead of being, you

02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:30.640
[Guest 3]: know, merged away with Bank of Baroda, so as to hide its bad loans rate, very, very

02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:32.920
[Guest 3]: high bad loans rate of 22%.

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:39.520
[Guest 3]: So all this merger-sharjah is basically, again, you know, it's essentially trying to hide

02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:44.040
[Guest 3]: the bad loans of the bad banks, and it's not going to help in any way.

02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:48.560
[Guest 3]: Like when is State Bank of India, I mean, by far the best example, before the merger

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:56.920
[Guest 3]: with its five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, had a bad loans rate of something

02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:59.920
[Guest 3]: around 7.2% or something.

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:06.040
[Guest 3]: And after the merger, the rate increased to 10%, because all these banks came up with

02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:07.120
[Guest 3]: their bad loans.

02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:12.400
[Guest 3]: So State Bank essentially cleaned up its book, and then had to start cleaning it all over

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:13.400
[Amit Varma]: again.

02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:14.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's still in the red.

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Since you were mentioning bad loans, a bad joke, which is that if there is a bank called

02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:22.720
[Guest 3]: Dena Bank, should there not be a collection agency called Vapas Lena Collection Agency

02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:23.720
[Guest 3]: anyway?

02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:25.400
[Amit Varma]: Lena Bank.

02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:26.400
[Guest 3]: Moving on.

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:27.400
[Guest 3]: Yeah.

02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:29.960
[Guest 3]: So I mean, I think, again, I mean, this is this is a dream thing.

02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:35.840
[Guest 3]: So the government should restrict its ambitions and, you know, get and but I said this will

02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:41.720
[Guest 3]: not be possible because, you know, every PSU reports to a government ministry and which

02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:44.520
[Guest 3]: is what gives them the importance that they have.

02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:48.080
[Guest 3]: I mean, so something like, if you take away Air India, you don't require the Ministry

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:49.080
[Guest 3]: of Civil Aviation.

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:52.720
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, that's what I was about to say that I think your instincts are all in the

02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:53.720
[Amit Varma]: right direction.

02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:54.720
[Amit Varma]: But they do not go far enough.

02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:58.480
[Amit Varma]: Like, you named more ministries than I would have as being justified.

02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:01.120
[Amit Varma]: And you said ki chhe saath bank toh rehne chahiye.

02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:05.680
[Guest 3]: No, in the sense, no, what I'm trying to say is that see, my, you know, over the years,

02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:12.520
[Guest 3]: what I've realized is that there is, there is there is economics, which is right, which

02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:13.520
[Guest 3]: is the right thing to do.

02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:18.400
[Guest 3]: And then there are then there is economics, which is saleable, feasible, yeah, but we're

02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:19.400
[Guest 3]: dreaming now, you know, talking.

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:23.320
[Guest 3]: So no, so I'm saying the good thing to do is to get out of everything.

02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:27.760
[Guest 3]: But then if that's not possible, let's say you want to meet your social targets, and

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:30.240
[Guest 3]: you want people to open Jan Dhan accounts.

02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:34.360
[Guest 3]: And by the way, talking about Jan Dhan accounts, there are some 36 crore Jan Dhan accounts

02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:37.160
[Guest 3]: now, and India has 25 crore households.

02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:41.120
[Guest 3]: So we have opened enough Jan Dhan accounts.

02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:45.120
[Guest 3]: So you know, on an average, it's more than one per family, which is good enough.

02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:49.040
[Guest 2]: So I have a point, which is sort of again, echoing what Amit said is, you know, since

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:52.760
[Guest 2]: we're in the dream world, if you if you allow the government to be in one field, the government

02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:56.760
[Guest 2]: will not balance itself and say, we'll just open five banks and not open 25.

02:22:56.760 --> 02:23:00.400
[Guest 2]: The government will basically want to go all out and grab all the power in that field and

02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:02.720
[Guest 2]: say, okay, we are basically the Mahibab in this field.

02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:06.440
[Guest 2]: So I think in that sense, it's a little bit of a black and white that if you really want

02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:10.520
[Guest 2]: to shrink the size of the government, the government should be restricted to the five

02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:15.800
[Guest 2]: or four basic functions of, of defense and law and order and etc, etc, and not be in

02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:20.760
[Guest 2]: at all in banking, in hotels, opening tiffin canteens in Tamil Nadu, or whatever it is

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:24.640
[Guest 2]: they're doing nothing at all just define four basic functions that the government should

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:25.640
[Guest 2]: do.

02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:29.180
[Guest 2]: And that also addresses all the other our previous points about fiscal responsibility

02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:32.560
[Guest 2]: and doing education opening up to the private sector and all of this.

02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:36.440
[Guest 2]: So I think the overarching thing is, I think we should agree that if you want to shrink

02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:40.000
[Guest 2]: the size of the government, let's be serious and really shrink it to just four functions

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
[Guest 3]: and nothing else.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.160
[Guest 3]: And the good part is, you know, there's another part to it that a lot of these PSUs are sitting

02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.220
[Guest 3]: on a whole lot of land.

02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:52.400
[Guest 3]: And a lot of this land is bang in the middle of because when these PSUs were established,

02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:57.600
[Guest 3]: they were established outside the cities, but now, you know, the cities have grown around.

02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:03.320
[Guest 3]: What is just government land, most of it right?

02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:08.360
[Guest 3]: I grew up in this city called Ranchi and Ranchi has a lot of PSUs, but the biggest of them

02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:13.160
[Guest 3]: all is the Heavy Engineering Corporation, which is located in this place called Dhruva

02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:16.600
[Guest 3]: on the outskirts, or at least used to be on the outskirts, not anymore.

02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:21.640
[Guest 3]: Now, the amount of land that company has is mind boggling, because there is a factory,

02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:25.360
[Guest 3]: you know, which they manufacture things at one end, and then there's just, you know,

02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:30.960
[Guest 3]: land everywhere, whereas the city of Ranchi has no land because the Tribal Act is in place.

02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:35.280
[Guest 3]: So you have, you know, atrocious real estate prices.

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:40.120
[Guest 3]: But one part of the city has land, which is virtually free lying there, nothing's being

02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:41.120
[Guest 3]: done.

02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:42.600
[Guest 3]: And that's, that's been the case for years now.

02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:43.600
[Guest 2]: So,

02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:48.560
[Guest 2]: But you know, one example of that land point is the difficulties of liquidating this land,

02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:52.840
[Guest 2]: so to speak, or then using it for private purposes, even if you let's say sell Air India.

02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:57.160
[Guest 2]: So in Air India, specifically, I know this, that when the contracts were written to have

02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:00.760
[Guest 2]: Air India big buildings, like we have in South Bombay, we have in Calcutta, we have in every

02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:05.880
[Guest 2]: city, in fact, the contract actually specified that, okay, this land, whatever is being given

02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:10.360
[Guest 2]: to Air India for constructing this Air India specific building, and it belongs to the government

02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:11.360
[Guest 2]: of India.

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:16.240
[Guest 2]: And it can be sold to whoever subject to blah, blah, blah terms and conditions for exclusively

02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:19.000
[Guest 2]: for other airline users.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:23.040
[Guest 2]: Now the problem with that in today's world is today's airlines don't need buildings,

02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:26.920
[Guest 2]: you know, you don't need this large 20 storied offices to set up an airline's office.

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:30.960
[Guest 2]: So now that Air India building, which is in South Bombay, it's completely useless, because

02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:34.880
[Guest 2]: you can't really sell it, liquidate it for any value, because it can only be used for

02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:38.880
[Guest 2]: another airline purpose, unless you change that entire contract and law, which is again,

02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:39.880
[Guest 3]: very difficult.

02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:43.840
[Guest 3]: So the other problem with this is that a lot of land was given by the state governments

02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:44.840
[Guest 3]: to the central government.

02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:48.360
[Guest 3]: So I think these this land, even if you can't sell it, it should go back to the state government,

02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:49.960
[Guest 3]: let the state government decide what they want to do.

02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:54.840
[Guest 3]: So like, which is precisely I think, something which is playing out with the Hindustan Photo

02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:59.240
[Guest 3]: Films, which I think they finally managed to close down, or it is in the process, I'm

02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:00.320
[Guest 3]: not sure.

02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:03.640
[Guest 3]: So that land was given to the central government by the state government.

02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:10.680
[Guest 3]: Now, Hindustan Photo Films is in Ooty, Ooty is a very good, you know, it's it's, you know,

02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:12.840
[Guest 3]: people, it's a tourist destination, a lot of people go there.

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:15.880
[Guest 3]: So there's so many things that can actually be done with that land.

02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:18.720
[Guest 3]: I mean, so let the state government decide what they want to do with it instead of the

02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:20.280
[Guest 3]: central government sitting on it.

02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:25.120
[Guest 1]: I would actually go back to the point on the banks thing, right, the bank nationalization,

02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:28.560
[Guest 1]: and we really should be should not be in the business of banking.

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:32.580
[Guest 1]: And I agree, it's not about the number of banks, it's about credit control, right?

02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:36.920
[Guest 1]: So one of the reasons that government likes to own so many banks, and how come government

02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:41.000
[Guest 1]: banks have so many bad loans on the books, is because there's a whole political economy

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.200
[Guest 1]: aspect to it, right?

02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:45.560
[Guest 1]: Politicians need campaign finance, right?

02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:48.920
[Guest 1]: Campaign finance is given to them by these builders and all these industrialists, and

02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:49.920
[Guest 1]: so on so forth.

02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:52.840
[Guest 1]: This is the case of politicians who are not putting up their own money.

02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:57.520
[Guest 1]: And in lieu of that, they say that, you know, they will get loans on favorable terms and

02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.800
[Guest 1]: so on so forth.

02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:04.800
[Guest 1]: So there is, it's not a coincidence that so many bad loans were approved for Vijay Mallya

02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:07.420
[Guest 1]: or for Lalit Modi and these guys, right?

02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:09.360
[Guest 1]: This is not an accident.

02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:10.360
[Guest 3]: There is a reason...

02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:11.960
[Guest 1]: Nirav Modi, you mean, not Lalit.

02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:13.800
[Guest 1]: Sorry, Nirav Modi, exactly.

02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:15.320
[Guest 1]: Well, that's another problem.

02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:16.600
[Guest 1]: But yeah, Nirav Modi.

02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:22.840
[Guest 1]: So there is an issue repeatedly, and this is really not, like, none of these are just

02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:24.640
[Guest 1]: mistakes that the bank made.

02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:28.600
[Guest 1]: You always, when you talk to the, you know, lower management in the banks, they're like,

02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:30.760
[Guest 1]: haan, upar se order aaya tha, haan, upar se file aaya tha, right?

02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:33.320
[Guest 1]: So that's one problem.

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:37.440
[Guest 1]: The other part of the problem is you want to control voters.

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:45.040
[Guest 1]: You cannot offer loan waivers unless you nationalize credit by nationalizing banks.

02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:51.040
[Guest 1]: And we are an economy running on loan waivers for the last, like, what, 40 plus years, right?

02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:53.160
[Guest 1]: Post Indira Gandhi, 50 years.

02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:57.720
[Guest 1]: So there is, I mean, we're never going to see this day because there's a reason they

02:27:57.720 --> 02:27:59.560
[Guest 3]: like to hold on to the control.

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.760
[Guest 3]: Loan waivers first started in 1989.

02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:05.400
[Guest 3]: Devi Lal was the first one to write off, waive off a loan.

02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:08.640
[Guest 3]: Usse pehle loan mela hota tha, wherein they used to give you the money.

02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:09.640
[Guest 3]: Give you free loans.

02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:10.640
[Guest 3]: Okay.

02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:11.640
[Guest 1]: They used to give you the money.

02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:12.640
[Unknown]: Yeah.

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:16.520
[Guest 1]: So you started the loan mela, which you would default and then, you know, which got absorbed

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:17.800
[Guest 1]: and then you have the loan waivers.

02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:23.240
[Guest 1]: So now this is a really big problem in the sense that this is how you're buying off voters

02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:27.080
[Guest 1]: who are in agricultural distress and, you know, you want to target specific sectors

02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:28.080
[Guest 1]: of the economy.

02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:32.480
[Guest 1]: So I think I'm here with Rajeshwari that you, I don't think they should own a single bank.

02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:34.720
[Guest 1]: You know, it's not the proliferation of banks.

02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:37.400
[Guest 1]: It's the, it's the bad incentives.

02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:41.520
[Guest 1]: And it just so happens that, you know, there is a distribution and some of the banks are

02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:46.960
[Guest 1]: slightly better than some of the banks are worse run or like more easy to manipulate,

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:49.840
[Guest 1]: but they really should not be in the business of banking.

02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:52.080
[Guest 1]: And you know, there's NBFCs also, you guys have talked about it.

02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:57.280
[Amit Varma]: I think there's business of, we've had episodes on NBFCs, NPAs, farm loan waivers, all of

02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:58.280
[Guest 2]: this.

02:28:58.280 --> 02:28:59.280
[Unknown]: Exactly.

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:00.280
[Unknown]: All of this.

02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:03.640
[Guest 2]: So this is basically just listen to all the podcasts in Amit Verma's In an Unseen and

02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:06.080
[Guest 2]: then we'll have a list of dream reforms just by itself.

02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:07.080
[Guest 1]: That's it.

02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:08.080
[Guest 1]: By itself.

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:09.080
[Guest 1]: No, we've already done that.

02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.320
[Guest 3]: This is the summary, you don't have to spend so much time.

02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:13.320
[Amit Varma]: No, no.

02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:14.320
[Amit Varma]: I had to discuss the first 100 episodes.

02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:17.760
[Amit Varma]: This is like saying that don't read Vivek's book, India's Big Government, sab toh bolta

02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:18.760
[Unknown]: hai yahan pe.

02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:19.760
[Unknown]: It's like saying that it's very rude.

02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:20.760
[Amit Varma]: No, no, everyone should read it.

02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:23.680
[Amit Varma]: It's very easy to read and not as big as it looks.

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:24.840
[Amit Varma]: I plugged it.

02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:25.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:29.440
[Amit Varma]: So we have to move on now to Rajeshwari because she has to leave soon.

02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:32.360
[Amit Varma]: So we will ask her to get her last thing over with.

02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:36.280
[Amit Varma]: But before that, I'll quickly share an anecdote, if I may, about Devi Lal, since he was mentioned.

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:40.360
[Amit Varma]: You guys remember this video news magazine that used to come in the early nineties called

02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:41.600
[Amit Varma]: News Track.

02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:46.560
[Amit Varma]: There was once an interview of Devi Lal when he was a deputy prime minister and his son

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:49.640
[Amit Varma]: Om Prakash Chautala was chief minister of Haryana.

02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:53.640
[Amit Varma]: So Devi Lal was asked and the camera angle was he's basically lying in a dhoti and a

02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:56.960
[Amit Varma]: banyan on this charpai kind of thing.

02:29:56.960 --> 02:29:59.620
[Amit Varma]: And the camera angle is from his, he's wearing keds.

02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:00.620
[Amit Varma]: So it's his keds.

02:30:00.620 --> 02:30:04.120
[Amit Varma]: So massive keds, small Devi Lal face in the background.

02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:09.960
[Amit Varma]: And the question is, so Devi Lal ji, aapne apne bete ko CM kyu banaya?

02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:15.960
[Amit Varma]: And Devi Lal said, toh kya Bhajan Lal ke chhore ko banao?

02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:20.080
[Amit Varma]: Which basically says everything you need to know about politics today.

02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:24.760
[Amit Varma]: Now let's Rajeshwari, you have 25 minutes left with us.

02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:28.720
[Guest 2]: So kindly elucidate on your final dream reform.

02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:36.240
[Guest 2]: Devi Lal and Bhajan Lal or whatever, that's like such an optimistic tone for dream reform.

02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:39.120
[Amit Varma]: But this is the greatest answer I have ever heard in my life.

02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Toh kya Bhajan Lal ke chhore ko banao?

02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:43.280
[Amit Varma]: Who can argue with that?

02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:44.640
[Guest 2]: Kindly continue.

02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:45.640
[Guest 2]: Okay.

02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:52.720
[Guest 2]: So my next and last reform is actually very, very narrow in scope and very specific.

02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:57.560
[Guest 2]: But in a way it is tied to my first point about fiscal discipline.

02:30:57.560 --> 02:31:00.200
[Guest 2]: And this is about, this is related to banking.

02:31:00.200 --> 02:31:03.160
[Guest 2]: So I'm moving to the financial sector.

02:31:03.160 --> 02:31:08.120
[Guest 2]: So now in India, what happens is banks and other financial institutions like insurance

02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:12.760
[Guest 2]: funds and pension funds have to hold large amounts of government securities through what

02:31:12.760 --> 02:31:14.880
[Guest 2]: we call statutory liquidity ratio.

02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:16.720
[Guest 2]: That's the technical term.

02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:22.440
[Guest 2]: And essentially this boils down to financial repression, because this is the captive market

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:24.420
[Guest 2]: that the government has access to.

02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:28.400
[Guest 2]: And the government bonds are basically something that have to be bought by the banks and the

02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:29.560
[Guest 2]: insurance companies.

02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:33.880
[Guest 2]: And through that, the government keeps on maintaining a fiscal deficit and whatever

02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:34.880
[Guest 2]: it is.

02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:35.880
[Guest 2]: It makes it much easier.

02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:41.440
[Guest 2]: And the sort of the lie that the policymakers also tell us, including the Reserve Bank of

02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:44.240
[Guest 2]: India, is that this is not financial repression.

02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:46.040
[Guest 2]: This is prudential regulation.

02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:48.800
[Guest 2]: This is required for the safety of the banks.

02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:54.560
[Guest 2]: And the banks need to hold on to safe assets, because that's just how the prudential regulation

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:55.560
[Guest 2]: works.

02:31:55.560 --> 02:32:01.280
[Guest 2]: Now, what my reform is about is, I want to bust that myth, because this is not a safety

02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:06.440
[Guest 2]: asset, because the Indian government bonds are not the safe assets.

02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:10.800
[Guest 2]: Because if you look at Indian government credit rating internationally, it is borderline investment

02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:13.560
[Guest 2]: grade and one step away from speculative grade.

02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:18.420
[Guest 2]: So if we really want our banks to be safe and our financial institutions to be safe,

02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:24.880
[Guest 2]: it is policy adventurism to tell them to hold government securities, Indian government securities.

02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:31.160
[Guest 2]: And instead, if you really want them to hold liquid assets, they should be holding minimum

02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:36.160
[Guest 2]: double A rated or more triple A rated assets of foreign governments, like international

02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:40.800
[Guest 2]: assets, which have much higher rating, much higher credit rating and are actually safe

02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:44.380
[Guest 2]: and liquid, because Indian government securities are not even liquid.

02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:47.440
[Guest 2]: And there are also the additional risk that every time the interest rate goes up, the

02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:49.000
[Guest 2]: banks are actually incurring losses.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.480
[Guest 2]: So it cuts them multiple ways.

02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:55.960
[Guest 2]: So instead of that, you reduce, and of course, if you are tying the hands of the government

02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:59.520
[Guest 2]: in the fiscal discipline, which was my first point, you don't need to do this financial

02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:05.400
[Guest 2]: repression of SLR, you cut down the SLR significantly, and for the safety purpose, the bank should

02:33:05.400 --> 02:33:10.000
[Guest 2]: actually be holding foreign government assets, which are triple A rated.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:14.740
[Guest 2]: And the reason I thought about this is also in the last 10 years, what has been happening

02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:19.720
[Guest 2]: in Europe has been an eye opener, because of the sovereign debt crisis, the banking

02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:23.960
[Guest 2]: sector in European countries has been really struggling, because the banks of Italy and

02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:27.680
[Guest 2]: Greece were actually holding their own domestic government bonds.

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:31.600
[Guest 2]: And when the governments defaulted, when the governments went on the brink of a default,

02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:34.000
[Guest 2]: these banks basically took a massive hit.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.720
[Guest 2]: And this in economics is what we call home buyers.

02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:41.520
[Guest 2]: And home buyers can really be very costly, because you are not diversifying your portfolio,

02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:43.400
[Guest 2]: you're putting all your eggs in one basket.

02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:47.040
[Guest 2]: And in India, as I said, it goes one step further, because it's financial repression,

02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:50.560
[Guest 2]: because to that extent, banks are also not able to lend to the rest of the economy.

02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:55.520
[Guest 2]: So you kill many birds with this one stone, if you say that, okay, banks will hold liquid

02:33:55.520 --> 02:34:00.760
[Guest 2]: assets of foreign governments, which are triple A rated, and you reduce that SLR so that banks

02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:04.080
[Guest 2]: have that much more money to lend out to the rest of the economy.

02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:07.920
[Guest 2]: And you also take away that captive bond market from the government, which the government

02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:10.960
[Guest 2]: very nicely and comfortably falls back on.

02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:13.440
[Guest 2]: So that would be my third and last reform.

02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:19.480
[Guest 3]: So I'd like to add a couple of points to what Rajeshwari said, I mean, I agree with her

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:20.480
[Guest 3]: completely.

02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:25.680
[Guest 3]: And so the first thing here is that, you know, it's not like the RBI hasn't done anything

02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:26.680
[Guest 3]: about it.

02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:32.240
[Guest 3]: The SLR has been reduced from, you know, from what I remember from almost 38% to now it's

02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:34.200
[Guest 3]: at 18.75.

02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:40.800
[Guest 3]: But the bank's investment in government securities has not come down in a similar way.

02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:47.880
[Guest 3]: So if you I mean, the last that I checked, a couple of months back, almost 27-28% of

02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:53.240
[Guest 3]: the total liabilities that the banks have, were invested in government bonds, even though

02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:58.960
[Guest 3]: you know, the number should have been around 19, 19 and a half percent.

02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:03.040
[Guest 3]: So banks also like to do some lazy banking, wherein, you know, you just put in some money

02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:06.160
[Guest 3]: there and our arms interest are high.

02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:08.220
[Guest 3]: So that's, that's one point.

02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:15.160
[Guest 3]: The second point is, you know, as far as the government is concerned, I mean, it obviously

02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:18.840
[Guest 3]: is a very, very easy way for it to raise money.

02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:23.400
[Guest 3]: And given that it is compulsory for banks to buy these bonds, the yield that the government

02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:29.240
[Guest 3]: ends up paying on these bonds is extremely low, because, you know, if you start to factor

02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:34.720
[Guest 3]: in, you know, typically how, you know, thumb rule to price a bond is, you know, you take

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:41.240
[Guest 3]: inflation and you take some risk premium, and you add it and you come at a basic rate.

02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:47.200
[Guest 3]: So if you do that, I mean, then the bond yields would not be as low as they are, okay.

02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:52.880
[Guest 3]: So obviously, you know, the bond yields would go up, interest rates would go up.

02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:55.600
[Guest 3]: So there is a flip side to it as well.

02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:00.240
[Guest 3]: But what will happen over a period of time is that because there is, you know, the access

02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:06.200
[Guest 3]: to this easy money goes away, the chances of the government being more fiscally prudent

02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:09.760
[Guest 3]: and fiscally disciplined will go up as well.

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:15.000
[Guest 2]: And also, Vivek, there is a conflict of interest inherent, which is happening in open eyes

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.640
[Guest 2]: and nobody points out is that the Reserve Bank of India is responsible for controlling

02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:23.920
[Unknown]: inflation, which is setting the interest rate, and also borrowing money from the government,

02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:27.400
[Guest 2]: because the Reserve Bank of India is the public debt manager on behalf of the government.

02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:30.600
[Guest 3]: So obviously, they try to take… and they're also the regulator for the banks.

02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:31.600
[Guest 3]: That's the third point.

02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:33.200
[Guest 2]: So they're also regulating the banks.

02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:37.360
[Guest 2]: But once you take this away, then the conflict of interest goes away, then you no longer

02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:41.200
[Guest 2]: need to manage the bonds of the government on behalf of the banks that you're regulating.

02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.720
[Guest 2]: And you can go back to doing your inflation controlling thing, which you're supposed

02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:44.720
[Guest 3]: to do.

02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:50.640
[Guest 3]: So, you know, talking about the public debt thing, I think the government did try to come

02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:52.160
[Guest 2]: up with a separate public debt office.

02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:55.680
[Guest 2]: But it got completely squashed by the Reserve Bank of India, because of course, the Reserve

02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:58.080
[Guest 3]: Bank of India doesn't want to let go of its territory.

02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:03.280
[Guest 3]: You work for an institution which owns Reserve Bank of India, sorry, which is owned by Reserve

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:04.280
[Guest 2]: Bank of India.

02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:06.280
[Guest 3]: These views are entirely my own.

02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:07.280
[Guest 3]: Be personal.

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:08.280
[Guest 3]: Please make that disclaimer.

02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:09.280
[Guest 1]: That's my disclaimer.

02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:12.120
[Guest 1]: Which is what I wanted to tell you.

02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:15.440
[Guest 1]: But this, you know, this is more general than just the RBI, right?

02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:19.640
[Guest 1]: We have a lot of cases, like recently, they did this for the National Housing Bank in

02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:21.680
[Guest 1]: the last budget, they just resolved it.

02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:27.320
[Guest 1]: It used to be the lender to housing finance companies and also their regulator, right?

02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:30.640
[Guest 1]: And that's a dual function is a huge conflict of interest.

02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:32.040
[Guest 1]: And the same thing with the RBI.

02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:37.400
[Guest 1]: So India does this quite frequently, it comes from this attitude of like socialist control,

02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:40.680
[Guest 1]: that I'm going to be your parent, and I'm going to give you the carrot when you want

02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:43.840
[Guest 1]: and give you the stick when you want, as if I'm a perfect benevolent,

02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:47.080
[Guest 3]: I'd say more than socialist control.

02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:52.560
[Guest 2]: These are also, you know, institutions of the Raj which have held on.

02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:56.920
[Guest 2]: And also the other, the broader point that I'm trying to make is, you know, we fall into

02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.760
[Guest 2]: this trap of thinking that Indian government securities are safe assets.

02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:03.920
[Guest 2]: You know, I mean, theoretically, your own government assets are safe.

02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:06.440
[Guest 2]: But in practice, Indian government assets are not safe.

02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:10.180
[Guest 2]: And that's something that we really need to understand, that if you want our banks and

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:14.040
[Guest 2]: financial institutions to be safe, you should not be holding GCECs.

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:18.760
[Guest 2]: You should be holding US government bonds, or UK government bonds, or diversified.

02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:21.320
[Guest 2]: You don't put all your eggs in one basket.

02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:24.720
[Guest 2]: And of course, the point is currency risk, then you hedge your currency risk.

02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:29.200
[Guest 2]: Because it's now we really have to open our mindset to the thing that financial markets

02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:33.120
[Guest 2]: have to be really liberalized, not liberalized in the sense that Indians mean it.

02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:36.600
[Guest 2]: But basically have your currency hedging options and banks will hedge the currency risk, give

02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:41.440
[Guest 2]: them the option of diversifying their portfolio into multiple assets, instead of taking them

02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:44.960
[Guest 2]: into this colonial kind of a past where you only hold government securities.

02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:50.160
[Guest 1]: I had a question for both of you on the SLR, right, which is, you know, didn't go down.

02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:54.160
[Guest 1]: I mean, even though the SLR went down, there was a lot of lazy banking.

02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:58.800
[Guest 1]: Do you think it's because of uncertainty, that there's so much uncertainty in the markets

02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:01.600
[Guest 1]: and the economy is clearly going towards a downturn?

02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:05.960
[Guest 2]: No, this is this is an old trend.

02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:10.400
[Guest 2]: It's almost like a culture, you know, the banking culture today is that you hold a lot

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:12.640
[Guest 2]: of government securities because you want to be safe.

02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.480
[Guest 2]: It's the safety thing is a safety thing that has been sold to us for years.

02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:22.440
[Guest 3]: What happens is, so let's say if yields go up, and, you know, they have to sort of mark

02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:24.400
[Guest 3]: down bond prices and face losses.

02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:28.360
[Guest 3]: So then you know, RBI will come in and then they'll tell them okay, in this quarter, we'll

02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:30.160
[Guest 3]: give you that leeway and all that rubbish happens.

02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:33.400
[Guest 2]: There's a lot of nexus between the government, the RBI and the banks, right?

02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:35.720
[Guest 2]: It works very comfortably for the banks.

02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:39.840
[Guest 2]: And also because they have not opened up their own vision to this possibility that you can

02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:44.080
[Guest 2]: diversify your portfolio holding foreign assets, because what foreign asset is a very dirty

02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:45.080
[Guest 2]: word again, right?

02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:48.800
[Guest 3]: No, but see, I mean, you know, I mean, I appreciate what she's saying, but ultimately, you know,

02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:50.320
[Guest 3]: all governments are Ponzi schemes.

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:55.440
[Guest 3]: So as long as you keep running a fiscal deficit, another quote of the episode, it's so funny,

02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:59.280
[Guest 1]: if you keep running a fiscal deficit and keep going into debt, we really shouldn't have

02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:03.240
[Guest 1]: a population control policy because we need children to be, which is what I said, the

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:04.240
[Unknown]: government is contradicting itself.

02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:10.440
[Guest 1]: No, because the music will stop when the children stop.

02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:14.360
[Guest 2]: This point is related to my first reform that if you're going to tie the hands of the government,

02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:17.280
[Guest 2]: another way of doing it is take away their captive markets, which through which they're

02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:20.400
[Guest 2]: very easily financing the deficit, which is hurting the economy.

02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:25.400
[Guest 2]: Because imagine banks are holding, let's say 20-25% of GCEX, 40% goes into priority sector

02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:30.120
[Guest 2]: lending, how much is really available to get into the small, medium enterprises and industries,

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:31.120
[Guest 2]: nothing.

02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:35.040
[Guest 2]: So how do you do this job crisis solving when there is no money coming for investment?

02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:41.800
[Guest 3]: Which is also why the, you know, the priority sector, you know, also keeps getting redefined.

02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:42.800
[Guest 1]: Exactly.

02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:43.800
[Unknown]: Exactly.

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:46.760
[Guest 1]: I have never understood this priority sector business.

02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:48.760
[Guest 3]: It's again a nationalization, socialization.

02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:51.120
[Guest 3]: It started in 1969.

02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:56.640
[Guest 3]: And first what they did was, the RBI for four, five years, I think in 73 or 74, they used

02:40:56.640 --> 02:40:59.040
[Guest 3]: to just give broad directions.

02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:02.800
[Guest 3]: Then they set up a number which said 33% has to go.

02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:07.640
[Guest 3]: And then over a period of time, they included like housing loans are now, you know, up to

02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:09.760
[Guest 3]: a certain size, not all.

02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:15.640
[Guest 3]: And that size, I think is 45 lakhs, which is a huge number, get included in priority

02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:16.640
[Guest 3]: sector lending.

02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:18.640
[Guest 2]: Now, housing loan, if it's priority sector lending, then…

02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:23.400
[Guest 2]: Because you know, the dichotomy is we dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy, but we

02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:27.240
[Guest 2]: in every which way we behave that we are a really poor country, so which needs to be

02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:29.040
[Guest 2]: handheld and shown the way.

02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:32.280
[Guest 1]: Another thing, I don't understand the goal of being a $5 trillion economy.

02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:33.280
[Unknown]: I think that's a separate podcast altogether.

02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:36.000
[Amit Varma]: No, so what happens to Optic's fancy number?

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.040
[Amit Varma]: It's not even a good fancy number, because it means…

02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:39.680
[Amit Varma]: 5 trillion is a damn good number.

02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:40.680
[Guest 1]: I like it.

02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:42.680
[Guest 2]: Well, in real terms, no one knows what that means.

02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:43.680
[Guest 2]: Exactly, but it's better than 5.2 trillion.

02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:47.120
[Guest 2]: But I don't even understand what's the fuss about it, the rate at which we are fudging

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:48.120
[Guest 2]: numbers.

02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:49.120
[Guest 2]: We can show next month that we've become a $5 trillion economy.

02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:50.120
[Unknown]: It's just a question of perception.

02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:51.120
[Unknown]: Or you could print a lot of money.

02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:52.120
[Unknown]: Or just say that we have become a $5 trillion economy, who's checking?

02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.120
[Unknown]: Yeah.

02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:57.440
[Unknown]: So, GDP per capita is the best it's going to have.

02:41:57.440 --> 02:41:58.440
[Unknown]: Reality versus narrative.

02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:01.560
[Unknown]: I had a great episode on GDP with Rajeshwari by the way.

02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:02.560
[Guest 3]: I did hear that.

02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:03.560
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:04.560
[Guest 2]: Everyone should listen to it.

02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:05.560
[Guest 3]: So, that was my third…

02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:06.560
[Guest 3]: You wrote about that GDP deflator thing, right?

02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:07.560
[Guest 3]: If I remember correctly.

02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:08.560
[Guest 2]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:12.560
[Guest 2]: This is the first time I thought someone's actually explained ki kya ho raha hai.

02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:18.880
[Guest 2]: Since 2015, I wrote an article where I said the actual GDP growth is not 7.1%, it's 5%.

02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:21.160
[Guest 2]: And that had become viral at that point of time.

02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:24.880
[Guest 2]: But then, of course, now, Arvind Subramaniam has gone to the next level.

02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:29.920
[Guest 1]: You know, things are so bad that the stuff economists are saying is going viral.

02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:31.400
[Guest 1]: That's how badly they are fudging numbers.

02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:32.400
[Unknown]: Normally, no one would read someone.

02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:33.400
[Unknown]: And also, GDP is not something that would be in newspapers.

02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:34.400
[Unknown]: It is the most unsexy…

02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Very reliable sources have told me Arvind Subramaniam does not know the G of GDP, but

02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:45.120
[Guest 3]: we will not ask anyone to go on the record.

02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:48.160
[Guest 3]: The best thing is, you know, we're talking about things going viral.

02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:53.360
[Guest 3]: You know, the first forward I got after Chidambaram was arrested was, what is the first question

02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:55.720
[Guest 3]: that CBI asked Chidambaram?

02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:57.760
[Guest 3]: So the question was, what do we do about the economy?

02:42:57.760 --> 02:42:58.760
[Guest 3]: I mean, that tells you.

02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, listening to your conversation, the question also struck me that could Agent 007

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
[Amit Varma]: be described as a government bond?

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:15.160
[Amit Varma]: Never mind, let's move on to the final dream reform.

02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:18.280
[Amit Varma]: So we can all actually end together before she leaves, and we can take a group photograph

02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:24.120
[Guest 3]: because this is already the longest ever episode, so it's a historic moment.

02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:33.160
[Guest 3]: We have recorded an episode longer than the episode I recorded with Manu Pillay.

02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:34.880
[Amit Varma]: I have not beaten Manu Pillay.

02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:37.240
[Unknown]: He is a very wonderful historian.

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:41.160
[Guest 3]: Yes, I disapprove of this kind of language.

02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so my reform is basically a dual reform, and all of you would kind of agree with it.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And this again comes back to cities and urbanization.

02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:53.720
[Amit Varma]: Reform 3A, do away with rent control.

02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:55.720
[Amit Varma]: Reform 3B, reform FSI.

02:43:55.720 --> 02:44:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, to just quickly explain both of these, rent control, on which I had an episode with

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:07.400
[Amit Varma]: Shruti's co-writer and good friend Alex Tabarrok, is this ludicrous law, which has crippled

02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.320
[Amit Varma]: a lot of Mumbai, which is basically that at one point, government decided that rents are

02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:13.480
[Amit Varma]: getting too high, let us fix the rents.

02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:16.720
[Amit Varma]: So rents were fixed, which is why you go through Marine Drive and parts of South Bombay, you'll

02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:21.960
[Amit Varma]: find people are paying 300 rupees a month, 200 rupees a month for these large lavish

02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:22.960
[Amit Varma]: houses.

02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:23.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, what does this do?

02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:29.080
[Amit Varma]: What this does is that it reduces the incentives for the owners to look after their house.

02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:30.920
[Amit Varma]: In one sense, it's not their house anymore.

02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Their property has essentially been taken away from them.

02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:37.480
[Amit Varma]: The same way governments, for example, to go back to my old rant, take away our bodies

02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:42.960
[Amit Varma]: with something like family planning, assert their right over it.

02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:50.400
[Amit Varma]: And what this has meant is that, number one, that there are large stretches of cities,

02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:54.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, South Bombay just comes to mind very easily, where you have old dilapidated

02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:57.760
[Amit Varma]: buildings where no one has the incentive to look after them.

02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:00.640
[Amit Varma]: Number two, this reduces the housing supply.

02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:05.120
[Amit Varma]: And what it means is that because the housing supply is so restricted, and not what it should

02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:10.960
[Amit Varma]: be, that the rents and real estate prices are far more than they otherwise would be

02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:13.000
[Amit Varma]: simple supply and demand.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:19.080
[Amit Varma]: The second one is increasing FSI, FSI stands for floor space index, but what it basically

02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:23.360
[Amit Varma]: means is that there is a limit to how tall you can build your building.

02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:26.940
[Amit Varma]: Now, Bombay has an FSI of about one as far as I recall.

02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And there are countries in the world which have like, I think New York has 15, parts

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.400
[Amit Varma]: of Hong Kong have 25-30.

02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:36.120
[Amit Varma]: And again, I did an episode on this with Alex Tabarrok.

02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:42.200
[Amit Varma]: And Alex coined a beautiful phrase, which was in fact the title of that episode, which

02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:43.680
[Amit Varma]: is reclaim the sky.

02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:47.080
[Amit Varma]: He said that what we have done in Mumbai is we have tried to reclaim the sea and there

02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:48.360
[Amit Varma]: is a limit to that.

02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:50.640
[Amit Varma]: But we can reclaim the sky and there is no limit to that.

02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:55.880
[Amit Varma]: His argument is that FSI should be far, far more, let people build upwards.

02:45:55.880 --> 02:46:01.320
[Amit Varma]: And the typical objections which are made against increasing FSI is that our infrastructure

02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:05.760
[Amit Varma]: is already crumbling, public services already crumbling, they won't keep pace.

02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:11.040
[Amit Varma]: But the same objection has been used before FSI has been raised in other cities across

02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:13.440
[Amit Varma]: the world at different stages of development.

02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:18.980
[Amit Varma]: And what inevitably happens is that supply catches up with demand, and the infrastructure

02:46:18.980 --> 02:46:22.800
[Amit Varma]: and public services do well enough.

02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:27.800
[Amit Varma]: What this will really do is if you increase FSI, is because people will be building upwards

02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:33.040
[Amit Varma]: and building more, land prices will come down, rentals will come down, more people will be

02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:35.920
[Amit Varma]: able to move into the city at a lesser cost.

02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:41.760
[Amit Varma]: Again, all the benefits of population density, larger economic networks, and, you know, to

02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:47.920
[Amit Varma]: an extent less slums, and it's just, you know, it's a no brainer why we don't do it.

02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:50.240
[Guest 1]: And elevators can substitute for cars.

02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:53.600
[Amit Varma]: And elevators can, which is such a radical thought when you think about it.

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:56.600
[Guest 1]: Well, Tim Harford has written about this also.

02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:01.000
[Guest 1]: And he, you know, in his book on 50 great innovations, do you know, do you remember

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:02.000
[Guest 1]: the title of the book?

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.000
[Guest 1]: 50 great something of the 50 great innovations.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.320
[Guest 1]: Yeah, just look, just look for Tim Harford's book.

02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:11.600
[Guest 1]: I think there's a chapter on the elevator road, it's mentioned somewhere there.

02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:15.460
[Guest 1]: Elevators are a mass transit system when you reclaim the skies, and they reduce congestion

02:47:15.460 --> 02:47:17.000
[Guest 1]: on the roads.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:21.400
[Guest 1]: And they are environmentally friendly, because you can carpool, if elevators are actually

02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:23.240
[Guest 1]: a substitute for a car.

02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:26.160
[Guest 1]: And they are substitutes for metro and so many more things.

02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:29.320
[Guest 1]: And so it's also a very green idea.

02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:30.320
[Guest 3]: Yeah.

02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:36.040
[Guest 3]: So basically, again, frivolous point, but now, you know, if there was no FSI, and there

02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:40.800
[Guest 3]: was no rent control in the city of Bombay, Bombay as it used to be, we wouldn't have

02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:43.840
[Guest 3]: got two very beautiful songs from Gulzar.

02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:53.800
[Guest 3]: So, you know, ek akela shahar mein abu dana dhundta hai, do diwane shahar mein abu dana

02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:54.800
[Amit Varma]: dhundta hai.

02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:58.880
[Amit Varma]: First time I heard it, I heard it as sabudana and I'm like, okay, even I like that, you

02:47:58.880 --> 02:47:59.880
[Guest 3]: know, sabudana khichdi.

02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:02.880
[Guest 3]: It's a terrible name, you can do better than that.

02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:03.880
[Guest 3]: No, I really thought so.

02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:04.880
[Unknown]: You like sabudana khichdi?

02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:06.680
[Unknown]: I am a huge fan of sabudana khichdi.

02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:09.400
[Unknown]: It's not bird feed or whatever you call poha.

02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:11.080
[Unknown]: Look, I don't eat all vegetables.

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:15.200
[Unknown]: But I think that's a great connection that Vivek has made, let's please appreciate it.

02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:20.040
[Guest 3]: Sorry, I got distracted, the moment you said frivolous, I thought I should add to it.

02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:24.920
[Guest 3]: No, so what I basically said that, you know, if it wasn't for FSI and rent control, then

02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:26.600
[Guest 2]: we wouldn't have got two great Gulzar songs.

02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:30.840
[Guest 2]: And even that entire romanticism about coming to Bombay, looking for a place to stay, that

02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:31.840
[Guest 1]: would completely go.

02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:32.840
[Guest 2]: But what I should point out…

02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:35.200
[Guest 1]: I think we would have gotten two other great Gulzar songs.

02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:36.760
[Guest 1]: Which would be?

02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:37.760
[Guest 1]: I don't know.

02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:41.400
[Amit Varma]: Something about reclaiming the skies, maybe.

02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:42.400
[Amit Varma]: Opportunity, cost and all that.

02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:47.440
[Amit Varma]: But I have to point out that in the magazine I used to edit, Pragati, we had a section

02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:48.440
[Amit Varma]: called Houseful Economics.

02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:53.820
[Amit Varma]: And I used exactly those songs to make exactly this point on FSI and rent control.

02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:55.880
[Amit Varma]: So great minds think alike.

02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:58.920
[Amit Varma]: And we are done with our 12 reforms.

02:48:58.920 --> 02:48:59.920
[Amit Varma]: That was quick.

02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:00.920
[Amit Varma]: Great happiness has come.

02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:02.240
[Amit Varma]: Shruti is already checking her Twitter.

02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:03.640
[Guest 1]: Are you checking your Twitter, Shruti?

02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:05.160
[Guest 1]: I'm not checking my Twitter.

02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:08.720
[Guest 1]: I'm just telling people that I am no longer a prisoner here.

02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:11.800
[Amit Varma]: It is so good to have you here in person.

02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:13.960
[Guest 3]: And guys, thanks a lot for…

02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:14.960
[Guest 3]: Just one more point.

02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:20.120
[Guest 3]: In fact, there is another lesson in economics from the song Do Diwane Ish Chahar Mein.

02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:24.240
[Guest 3]: So there is a shot of Marine Drive, beautiful shot.

02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:28.880
[Guest 3]: And so if you remember your Marine Drive, you know, just before the Chowpatty starts

02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:33.240
[Guest 3]: or around where the Chowpatty is, there is this bridge, right?

02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:38.120
[Guest 3]: So there is a shot of that bridge and there is a shot of all these cars there.

02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:43.520
[Guest 3]: And the only thing you see, you know, are, you know, all these premier Padminis.

02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:47.720
[Guest 3]: And then there is this Mercedes, one Mercedes that you see there.

02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:53.840
[Guest 3]: So that again tells you, you know, how socialist or how government controlled our economy was

02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:59.480
[Guest 3]: where we had only two car models for almost 50 years, 45, 46 years after independence.

02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:03.840
[Guest 2]: I think what Vivek is trying to say is that if we start dreaming now at some point of

02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:08.280
[Amit Varma]: time, 40, 50 years later, we might land up where we want to be.

02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:11.760
[Amit Varma]: And ever since he has seen that, well, I mean, you know the GST of Mercedes, right?

02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:13.320
[Guest 3]: Do you know the GST of premier Padmini?

02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:14.320
[Guest 3]: No, you do not.

02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:15.320
[Guest 3]: Premier Padmini toh band ho gayi.

02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:16.320
[Amit Varma]: But we don't exist anymore.

02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:17.320
[Amit Varma]: Bachchi kaha?

02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:18.320
[Amit Varma]: Fiat, as you used to…

02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:19.320
[Amit Varma]: Premier Padmini kaun bulata hai?

02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:20.320
[Guest 3]: We used to also…

02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:21.320
[Guest 3]: Fiat, Fiat, Fiat.

02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:24.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Fiat gadi gaye hain.

02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:27.920
[Amit Varma]: We had one when I was a kid in the 80s.

02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:28.920
[Guest 3]: We had an ambassador.

02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:29.920
[Guest 2]: Sorry Vivek.

02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:32.920
[Guest 2]: In Calcutta roads, that was the only thing that could actually work.

02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:36.320
[Guest 3]: So then it was also a function of the fact that the ambassador was made…

02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:37.320
[Amit Varma]: In Bengal, yeah.

02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:41.760
[Amit Varma]: It is no surprise that in an episode titled Dream Reforms, we are dreaming of the past.

02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:44.000
[Amit Varma]: This shows what our country has come to, guys.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.080
