00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.960
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.960
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.440
[Amit Varma]: My subject for today is data journalism and the political economy.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Well, actually, I thought of doing a show just on data journalism.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.280
[Amit Varma]: And the first guest I thought of inviting is actually also an expert in the political

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.540
[Amit Varma]: economy with incredible insights on contemporary politics.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.960
[Amit Varma]: So it made sense to weave that into the show as well.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.840
[Amit Varma]: Roshan Kishore is data and political economy editor at the Hindustan Times.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.520
[Amit Varma]: And beyond this, he also used to be a student politician himself in JNU, an experience which

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.540
[Amit Varma]: as you will see, adds an added layer to his journalistic insights.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.360
[Amit Varma]: This conversation was recorded on July 30.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.440
[Amit Varma]: And before we cut to it, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.880
[Amit Varma]: This episode of the scene in the unseen is brought to you by Storytel.

[Amit Varma]: I actually use Storytel myself regularly, so as long as they sponsor the show, I'm going

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.360
[Amit Varma]: to recommend one book a week that I love.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.760
[Amit Varma]: The book I want to recommend today is a classic that if you haven't read already, listen to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.960
[Amit Varma]: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.080
[Amit Varma]: It's on Storytel.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.280
[Amit Varma]: And remember, you get a 30 day free trial only at Storytel.com slash IBM.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.880
[Amit Varma]: Roshan, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.880
[Amit Varma]: Roshan, I invited you, of course, because of your really interesting data journalism

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.520
[Amit Varma]: and your writing on politics and so on and so forth.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.400
[Amit Varma]: But after inviting you, I found out that when you were a student, you were also into politics

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.440
[Amit Varma]: yourself and all of that.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.640
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that, not just the political aspect of it, but you know,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.440
[Amit Varma]: what kind of person were you when you were young?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440
[Amit Varma]: What interested you?

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, where did you study?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
[Guest]: What did you study?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.000
[Guest]: Basically, I'm from Bihar and I, you know, which is the normal thing, at least it was

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.760
[Guest]: in our generation then that you had to qualify the IITG and all that.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.040
[Guest]: And I studied sciences for my plus two and I was really very bad at it.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.720
[Guest]: But luckily, I took economics as a subject because you had to take a fifth subject, computer

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.760
[Guest]: economics, and I thought I enjoyed it.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.800
[Guest]: So after I made a disaster of my plus two stint, I decided to come and pursue economics

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.560
[Guest]: in Delhi University.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.720
[Guest]: And even then, I'd never given a lot of thought to it.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.120
[Guest]: I think as things evolved, I also and more than that, my teachers, a couple of whom happened

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.520
[Guest]: to be from JNU, realized that, you know, looking at the qualitative economic picture was something,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.520
[Guest]: you know, I had an aptitude and encouraged me to take the JNU entrance exam.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.900
[Guest]: And no, I got through and no, as you know, the JNU economics course is radically different

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.640
[Guest]: compared to what the other premier institutions in this country like Delhi School or IGA do.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.440
[Guest]: I'm not saying that the former is good or the latter is bad, but it is a more heterodox

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440
[Guest]: sort of a thing.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.880
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about how it's different.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.520
[Guest]: The crux of it, I think is, you know, a lot of people say that, you know, it's no more

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.080
[Guest]: Marxian etc.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.120
[Guest]: But I think JNU, I don't know what it is now.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.640
[Guest]: But I think the basic focus was they somehow, you know, emphasize the Kaleski-Keynes framework

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.320
[Guest]: and classical political economy was sort of emphasized upon.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.840
[Guest]: So rather than, you know, you start running econometrics and regression equations, etc.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.440
[Guest]: from day one, and you essentially go the job market way because a lot of analysts, you

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.160
[Guest]: should remember that that was the boom period then before the crisis, you know, when I went

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.520
[Guest]: to university and corporate jobs were really, I mean, coming at a very fast pace.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.000
[Guest]: So rather than just do that, I mean, JNU does that also a lot of people from JNU have excelled

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.240
[Guest]: in those kinds of fields, it also allowed you to the opportunity to look at classical

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240
[Guest]: political economy.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.280
[Guest]: So we had courses like political economy of development, where you would see, you know,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.640
[Guest]: what kind of trajectory China take, the Korean-Japanese war, those sorts of things, the feudalism

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.640
[Guest]: capitalism debate.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.920
[Guest]: I'm not that I remember all of those today.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.920
[Guest]: But it allowed you to, I mean, try and look at the larger economic pictures, if I could

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.480
[Guest]: say and it also allowed me to sort of develop my own arguments, you know, we were not very

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.400
[Guest]: good at it when we were young students, but at least try and get the larger picture develop

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.560
[Guest]: arguments question basic assumptions behind arguments which are being made.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.360
[Guest]: A lot of comparative studies, you know, I joined my MA in economics in 2004.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.640
[Guest]: This was just a couple of years after the East Asian crisis had hit.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.840
[Guest]: And no three, four years before the larger global crisis hit.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.840
[Guest]: So those are very interesting times to be in the discipline, you know, even then there

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.320
[Guest]: was a lot of charm for the corporate world and you know, mainstream economic theory,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.060
[Guest]: but it was an interesting period.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.480
[Guest]: And I think, you know, because ours was a department which had very eminent left leaning

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.600
[Guest]: economists like Professor Prabhat Patnayak, Utsav Patnayak, Jyoti Ghosh.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.800
[Guest]: So they influenced a lot of our, to a very large degree, our worldview as well.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.200
[Guest]: And then, you know, because JNU is JNU, politics also happened.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.880
[Guest]: And you know, the economics department is always, it has historically been a stronghold

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.400
[Guest]: of the SFI, so to say, the left leaning students, people like Sitaram, etc. are alumni.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.640
[Guest]: So it was a mix of the two.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.000
[Guest]: So the academic and the political sort of came together.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.440
[Guest]: That's the ideological aspect of it.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.960
[Guest]: But I also believe, you know, that I've been out of my home after my class 10th.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.080
[Guest]: So plus two, I did in different city where there were no hostels.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.160
[Guest]: So basically at a very young age, I was, we were friends running a flat, a kitchen, etc.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.800
[Guest]: And life is very difficult when you do that.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.600
[Guest]: So JNU was the first time I actually went to a hostel and life in JNU is as convenient

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.520
[Guest]: as you can get for a student.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.020
[Guest]: Now that I look back at it, I also think that, you know, one can be critical that it does

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.200
[Guest]: not make you do enough hard work, unless you are sort of self driven and motivated, you

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.600
[Guest]: will get along easily in JNU, this is something I also did.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.160
[Guest]: But that also played an important part in shaping my worldview, because the left was

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.040
[Guest]: a strong force in the union there and the history of student struggles, etc. in JNU.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.040
[Guest]: Today, all of it is looked down upon, unfortunately.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.160
[Guest]: But that was the second, I think, but also an essential aspect of it.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.080
[Amit Varma]: And was there a moment during all this or a phase during all this where it struck you

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.080
[Amit Varma]: that economics is not just something in a book, it's not just a theoretical subject,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.680
[Amit Varma]: but it explains your world and it explains your world so viscerally that then it is a

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.640
[Amit Varma]: natural step for you to want to get involved in politics, for example, and you know, all

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.280
[Amit Varma]: of it becomes one congruous whole.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.880
[Guest]: That I believe has always been true.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.600
[Guest]: It's, it's, it's not for me to say, you know, for example, no great economic catastrophes,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.920
[Guest]: something like the Great Depression, I mean, I mean, it could not be arrested in time because

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.240
[Guest]: people believed in the Say's law, you know, that supply will create its own demand, and

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.480
[Guest]: therefore, there's no need to.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.640
[Guest]: Now, we know that Keynes had sort of, you know, pointed out those mistakes with the

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:19.560
[Guest]: basic theoretical framework earlier, but it took a Second World War, it took a, you know,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.000
[Guest]: Soviet camp to sort of put that extra pressure to start that corrective mechanism after you

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.880
[Guest]: know, the Second World War ended, the golden age of capitalism has been no aid, even if

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.760
[Guest]: we look at, you know, for example, today, there's a lot of discussion about why India

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.640
[Guest]: couldn't embark on that manufacturing success story like the Aryan Station countries, even

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.600
[Guest]: China later, now, a lot of development economics today, even mainstream economies, I think

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.560
[Guest]: the role of the fact that, you know, egalitarian land distribution was done even in these countries,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.840
[Guest]: you know, which after the Second World War went to the sort of the capitalist block,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.640
[Guest]: but you know, breaking up land monopoly played a crucial role in those things.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.280
[Guest]: So that way, definitely, if you look at the text, also, I think this ample evidence to

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.200
[Guest]: suggest that economics plays a role and politics plays a role in determining the economic trajectory

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.480
[Guest]: of societies, nations, etc.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.480
[Guest]: That's one.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.640
[Guest]: Now, let us come back to JNU again, now, JNU is a place where you pay even today, I think

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.860
[Guest]: a few hundred rupees in fees.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:26.520
[Guest]: So it actually allows you to, you know, pursue things which you like without, you know, feeling,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.720
[Guest]: I would say burdened by the fact that you probably have to get out of the university

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.560
[Guest]: and pay lakhs of rupees in student loans.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.040
[Guest]: So, you know, I do not exactly come from a very poor family, but you know, most middle

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.380
[Guest]: class Indians, you know, like my socio economic background, could not have afforded this kind

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.760
[Guest]: of study if they had to pay, say, student loans.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.200
[Guest]: So those kind of intellectual choices, which I was able to make earlier in my life, and

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.240
[Guest]: know of which the professional reward I'm reaping today, you know, without, you know,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.280
[Guest]: having to have ever paid for that, you know, subsidised education, which I received, I

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.160
[Guest]: think in a country like India, it still makes a lot of sense to at least have, you know,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.040
[Guest]: if not all some higher educational institutions, which allow people to do that, because if

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.800
[Guest]: you if breaking even becomes the sole point of education, and this need not know just

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.840
[Guest]: confine itself to economics, any other discipline, I think you'd end up with a very different

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.720
[Amit Varma]: intellectual trajectory in any country or society.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.680
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I had I had coffee yesterday with a friend who's studying right now in JNU.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.800
[Amit Varma]: He's doing his postgraduate economics, shout out to Sanjit.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.440
[Amit Varma]: And he and the tuition fees are still pretty much as low.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, he says he pays more for his hostel and for his tuition fees.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.760
[Amit Varma]: And that also sounded like a really small amount to me.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.600
[Amit Varma]: So what was politics like, like, you know, today, I think of you as one of the sharpest

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.740
[Amit Varma]: minds in political journalism and in covering the political economy and so on.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.660
[Amit Varma]: And it's fascinating to me that you were also at one point a politician yourself.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.560
[Amit Varma]: Is there any sort of correlation between politics on a bigger scale and the kind of politics

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.640
[Amit Varma]: on the smaller scale?

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And what was politics on that smaller scale really like?

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.520
[Guest]: I think it makes a lot of difference, you know, because I was never an active participant

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.520
[Guest]: in it.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.320
[Guest]: But I've seen politics in Delhi University, now Delhi University, for example, I was looking

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.560
[Guest]: at the papers yesterday, so some 70,000 students have taken admission in BA first year.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.560
[Guest]: So if you look at it, when the DUSU elections happen, you're probably talking about an electorate,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.560
[Amit Varma]: which is more than 2 lakh strong.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.880
[Guest]: We're recording on July 30, by the way, yeah, so you can't have any intellectual engagement

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.880
[Guest]: with that kind of crowd.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.160
[Guest]: It is, you know, physically, humanly impossible to even know, think of doing it.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160
[Guest]: Now, compared to this, JNU is the exact opposite.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.320
[Guest]: When we were students, we had around 4000 students.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:38.240
[Guest]: So politics essentially was a lot of room to room campaigns, going to students having,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.480
[Guest]: you know, discussing things ad nauseam with them, a lot of which, you know, the outside

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.120
[Guest]: world would think is probably, you know, purely romanticism and doesn't have any bearing on

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.120
[Guest]: the larger world.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.840
[Guest]: But even then, the crucial thing about JNU was your success or lack of success in politics

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.880
[Guest]: actually dependent on your ability to a do hard work, because, you know, it takes a lot

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.440
[Guest]: of your time, be your ability to sort of come up with arguments and counter arguments.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.280
[Guest]: And the ideological spectrum was very different.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.840
[Guest]: But this I think was the crux of the matter.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.400
[Guest]: And unlike a lot of, you know, what people believe, it actually had a material bearing

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.400
[Guest]: on school.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.480
[Guest]: For example, when we were students, we fought agitations.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.440
[Guest]: So JNU, I don't know whether it's still the case, JNU used to, even though the fees etc

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.000
[Guest]: were really low, it used to give scholarships to students who came whose family income was

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.600
[Guest]: below a certain threshold, I think when we were students, it was 75,000 rupees per year.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.120
[Guest]: So this was only for BA, MA.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.320
[Guest]: Now the question, you know, which we found most difficult was, once you finished your

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.120
[Guest]: MA, you got into an MPhil or a PhD program, now, technically, that's work research in

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.280
[Guest]: any first world country, you paid a lot of money for that.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.080
[Guest]: In JNU, that was not the case, be India still doesn't have that kind of a developed sort

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.560
[Guest]: of academic labor market where you could go out and earn your money.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.160
[Guest]: Those days projects are always still coming.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.200
[Guest]: So making ends meet was really a difficult thing to do.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.640
[Guest]: And even if you come from a relatively well off family or not so poor family, you can't

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.320
[Guest]: ask your family for no sort of supporting yourself beyond post graduation.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.200
[Guest]: So we fought an agitation and Professor Thorat used to be the UGC chairman and some sort

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.040
[Guest]: of a scholarship started, it was bare minimum to make ends meet 3000-5000 rupees.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.560
[Guest]: So politics was, you know, identifying what these material problems were trying to look

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.640
[Guest]: for a constituency in JNU, which would sort of identify with these demands and support

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.520
[Guest]: these demands.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.160
[Guest]: And then, you know, having the larger ideological debates at the same time, for example, JNU,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.160
[Guest]: so I joined JNU in four, now four is the year when the NDA one actually lost power.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.640
[Guest]: So, you know, May were the elections and I went to JNU in July and I believe, but before

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.000
[Guest]: that, the five years JNU being JNU had problems with the first NDA regime as well.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.600
[Guest]: Those were problems of a very different nature.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.680
[Guest]: You know, there was Gujarat riots and all those things.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.200
[Guest]: But then politics qualitatively shifted, I would say for the 10 years under the UPA government,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.560
[Guest]: because the right wing challenge was not so much of a challenge, then it completely shifted

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.120
[Guest]: to things such as more scholarships, more hostels, etc, on the one hand, and then, you

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.560
[Guest]: know, issues such as say, the nuclear deal, you know, which is not it doesn't have a material

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.680
[Guest]: impact on you, but nevertheless, given JNU's ideological leanings is a big debate, Shingur

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.280
[Guest]: Nandigram was a watershed event in JNU, because CPM slash SFI, its student wing has always

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.080
[Guest]: enjoyed an intellectual hegemony, so to say.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.480
[Guest]: But once the Shingur Nandigram thing happened, it really sort of gave a body blow to that

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.480
[Guest]: ideological hegemony.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:30.200
[Guest]: So the 2007 elections were the first elections where the SFI lost all major posts.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.680
[Guest]: And this had only happened once after the TNMN elections.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.520
[Guest]: So JNU that way gives you a very rich political profile, I mean, and experience because you're

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.400
[Guest]: dealing with, I mean, pretty much everything under the sun.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.060
[Guest]: But nevertheless, I mean, people who are voted are equally if not more likely to desert you

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.000
[Guest]: on those ideological issues for more concrete issues.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.680
[Guest]: So that way, I think a lot of what you know, you know, the political arguments and I can

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.000
[Guest]: make or the way I can think JNU has contributed a lot to that.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.400
[Amit Varma]: And what was the impetus behind your getting into politics to begin with?

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.760
[Amit Varma]: Like, was it that, okay, these things need to be done, and someone's got to do them and

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.760
[Guest]: I'm going to get into politics and get it done?

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.720
[Guest]: Well, there was no political ambition.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.160
[Guest]: So when I joined SFI, I did not even know that it was a CPM student wing.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.800
[Guest]: I think the biggest question was, see, for joining any kind of politics, you have to

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.560
[Guest]: have an instinct for social engagement that, you know, my world is not just me, but I want

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.840
[Guest]: to engage with the larger world.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:30.480
[Guest]: But in my case, I think the most important thing was a sense of gratitude to what JNU

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.560
[Guest]: offered to a student like me, because life was very easy.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.880
[Guest]: It was for the first time in my student life after having got out of my home, the comforts

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.520
[Guest]: of my home, I actually did not have to worry about anything else but my studies.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.120
[Guest]: So it was this sense of gratitude, which, you know, sort of attracted me to JNU then

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.480
[Guest]: continues to attract me to JNU even today.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.800
[Amit Varma]: Right, so in those years when you were sort of, you know, doing your MPhil, I think you

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.800
[Guest]: did an MPhil.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800
[Guest]: I finished my MPhil.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.320
[Amit Varma]: So in those years that you did an MPhil, and you also stood for president of the JNU.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.320
[Guest]: I did.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.320
[Guest]: And those elections never happened.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.600
[Guest]: So JNU elections were stayed for the nonconformity to link the committee recommendations.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.000
[Guest]: So I was a presidential candidate who never contested that way.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
[Guest]: But I've been in the union and other smaller posts.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.760
[Amit Varma]: So what were your sort of aspirations in those days?

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.120
[Amit Varma]: Like you told me, you don't always think you'll be a journalist.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.240
[Amit Varma]: What were your sort of aspirations like, and also, what were your interests like, like

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.200
[Amit Varma]: your deep knowledge of data?

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you started building up at that point in time?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.480
[Amit Varma]: What were your influences like, how was your, like, who are the thinkers who influenced

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.480
[Amit Varma]: you?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.000
[Amit Varma]: What are the books you would recommend to my listeners, for example?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.600
[Guest]: There are two ways to look at it, the place where I come from in the country, higher education

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.640
[Guest]: actually went down the drain in Bihar in the 70s itself.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.880
[Guest]: So there's been a large intellectual void, so to say.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.320
[Guest]: And education, because if you could afford it, you would get out of Bihar, it was as

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.320
[Guest]: simple as that.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.760
[Guest]: Anybody who could afford it would not do his or her college or university education in

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.320
[Guest]: Bihar, unless you wanted to make a complete disaster out of your academic career or professional

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.320
[Guest]: career.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.200
[Guest]: So as long as I was at home, education meant a degree of professional success.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.120
[Guest]: You get good marks in class 10, then you go to class 12, you either get into a medical

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.800
[Guest]: school or an engineering school or things like that.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.960
[Guest]: Then when I was in BA, it was many things put together.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.600
[Guest]: Some of us wanted to prepare for the civil services, somebody, you know, management CAT

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.280
[Guest]: was a big thing, then some of us wanted to do, you know, places like JNU, D school and

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.200
[Guest]: probably go outside for GRE, etc.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.880
[Guest]: When I came to JNU, I came with a very open mind, you know, none of these were foreclosed

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880
[Guest]: options.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.320
[Guest]: I'd never made up my mind.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.280
[Guest]: Once the option started, and I saw that I had an interest in political economy, I gradually,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.040
[Guest]: politics also played a role in it, I gradually made up my mind that I'll finish a PhD in

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.320
[Guest]: JNU, probably get a teaching job, as simple as that.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.640
[Guest]: Now that never happened, because I never finished my PhD.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:53.280
[Guest]: But the data bit, I think, again, JNU has a lot of role to play, because, you know,

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.600
[Guest]: the basic courses which we did, so even know things such as political economy of development,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600
[Guest]: etc.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.680
[Guest]: So for example, you know, my professor who eventually became my supervisor, Utsa Pattanaik,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.600
[Guest]: she actually says that it is Lenin who discovered the Lorenz curve.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.840
[Guest]: So Lenin, you know, he has this famous book called Development of Capitalism in Russia,

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.840
[Guest]: in which he plotted those curves.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.160
[Guest]: So we were taught that unless your facts sort of back it up, you can't make an argument

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.440
[Guest]: that's not done.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:24.240
[Guest]: Because no matter how ideologically persuasive it sounds, or no matter how much in agreement

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.240
[Guest]: everybody is in it, as far as research is concerned, you have to have some substantive

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.240
[Guest]: proof.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240
[Guest]: So data work is sacrosanct.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.480
[Guest]: So I'm somebody who never did field for my research, but a lot of my research was based

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.640
[Guest]: on secondary NSS data, I worked on the public distribution system, etc.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.880
[Guest]: So it was then that I realized that, you know, you have to have some factual thing, a lot

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.880
[Guest]: of my time as a political activist, so the only thing, you know, comparable to what a

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.800
[Guest]: journalist does, which I did in JNU was because JNU has this culture of distributing dinner

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800
[Guest]: pamphlets.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.960
[Guest]: So on your mess table, every day, there are pamphlets.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.720
[Guest]: And because I happen to be in the SFI, anybody who leads an organization has to write those

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720
[Guest]: pamphlets.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.040
[Guest]: So four o'clock, we would decide, you know, what to write on.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.880
[Guest]: And within an hour, you had to produce this 600 word copy.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.840
[Guest]: And that is the closest thing I did, a journalist does, you know, as far as JNU is concerned.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.960
[Guest]: But again, then, you say, if you look at the budget, etc, the one way was to go about it

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.040
[Guest]: was to know just throw adjectives, and everybody would agree even then, but the other way was

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040
[Guest]: to actually look at data.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.360
[Guest]: So for example, if the budget has come, what has happened to say educational allotment,

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.920
[Guest]: this scholarship, that scholarship, etc.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.500
[Guest]: Even when you were negotiating with the administration.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.880
[Guest]: So the fact that data was a useful skill set to have, you know, academically as well as

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.280
[Guest]: not to be in a political argument is something JNU taught me.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.200
[Guest]: And that always stayed with me, because, you know, I was never very good at, you know,

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.320
[Guest]: other quantitative stats, such as game theory, or microeconomics, etc.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.800
[Guest]: So that was the natural sort of leaning I acquired, and I used to like it also.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.400
[Guest]: So, you know, for a brief while between journalism and JNU, I was in research there also, I was

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:57.120
[Guest]: looking at food security, I mean, how the Americans support their farm, agriculture,

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.360
[Guest]: etc.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.360
[Guest]: And every day, I would realize that if you add the numbers, your case become really strong.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.320
[Guest]: So that is how data happened to me.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.000
[Guest]: Once again, I think, part of my academic political training, whatever one might call it.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.240
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, it strikes me that while data is objective, the numbers are what they are,

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.560
[Amit Varma]: the facts are what they are.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:20.060
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned before this, when we were having lunch before the recording, that the

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.160
[Amit Varma]: useful thing about data is that it makes you question your prior beliefs and your biases,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.840
[Amit Varma]: you have to back it up with data.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.360
[Amit Varma]: But isn't it also the case that there is so much of data that you can, you know, use data

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.520
[Amit Varma]: to almost support any conclusion, you can cherry pick data, you can, you know, torture

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.200
[Guest]: data till it confesses the truth, as someone famously said.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200
[Guest]: No, exactly.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.080
[Guest]: This is something I try and bring out on my own work as well now as a journalist.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.000
[Guest]: For example, if we were to look at, say, the unemployment rate in India, latest figures

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.840
[Guest]: show that some 6.1%.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.640
[Guest]: Even when it was not that high, if you were to compare, say, unemployment rate in a country

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.920
[Guest]: like India with a with an OECD country, I mean, the rates there would probably be much

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920
[Guest]: higher.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.120
[Guest]: Because, you know, being unemployed in a first world country and being unemployed in a country

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.920
[Guest]: like India are completely different things.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:09.040
[Guest]: I mean, an NREGA worker is technically considered employed in India.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.560
[Guest]: That would not be the case in, say, Sweden, or even in the United States, for most of

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.840
[Guest]: the people in the US at least.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.720
[Guest]: So you of course, have to know the context in which the data is being, I mean, given

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720
[Guest]: to you.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.920
[Guest]: And which is why, you know, rather than one data point, you have to have multiple data

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920
[Guest]: points.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.800
[Guest]: And, and, you know, you have to know what, what exactly is the data point you're looking

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.280
[Guest]: at, you know.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.320
[Guest]: For example, in demonetization, a lot of people said that, you know, because these cash hoards

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.600
[Guest]: would be purchased, so we will get rid of black money.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.080
[Guest]: Somebody who has done his or her basic economics would know that that is not the case.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.320
[Guest]: Now there are stocks and there are flows.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.360
[Guest]: Black money, we know is a flow variable.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.880
[Guest]: So if I had 1000 rupees of black money sitting in my pocket, if it were to get extinguished

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.320
[Guest]: today, in six months from now, I probably had 2000 rupees of black money in my pocket.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.200
[Guest]: So I think it is extremely important, especially in journalism, because and this is something,

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.560
[Guest]: once again, I value a lot from my initial days, as long as I was in school, probably

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:16.080
[Guest]: the only nonfiction I've ever read in my life are newspapers, because you know, places in

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.440
[Guest]: Bihar, even today, I do not think a very strong library culture, etc.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.920
[Guest]: So all my knowledge about the world was either from TV or newspapers.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.920
[Guest]: That's it.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.320
[Guest]: I mean, people take extremely seriously what is written in newspapers.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.600
[Guest]: I mean, I would not say that for television today, but at least even today, newspapers,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.360
[Amit Varma]: if people read them, they take it very seriously.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.080
[Amit Varma]: And in your case, it was like English newspapers or Hindi also?

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.960
[Guest]: I was not very comfortable reading English newspapers until school, but I would read

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960
[Guest]: Hindi papers.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.880
[Guest]: It was more a language problem rather than anything else.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.800
[Guest]: The moment I got comfortable with English, I started reading English newspapers.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:55.280
[Guest]: But so I think it is our duty to sort of, you know, do our own hard work and get our

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.680
[Guest]: own concepts right while we are dealing with data, that I consider is extremely important.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.320
[Guest]: And not all data, you know, should be presented in the form of jargon, etc.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.200
[Guest]: Basic things such as and I think it is more important to use data to ask questions rather

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200
[Guest]: than answer them.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.840
[Guest]: Now, for example, we know that, you know, everybody knows that four quarters GDP growth

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.240
[Guest]: has been declining.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.480
[Guest]: That's there.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.240
[Guest]: So what does one make out of it?

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.600
[Guest]: Who does it impact?

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.600
[Guest]: Which sectors is it impacting?

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.960
[Guest]: What should we you know, a lot of people on the left, for example, used to say that, you

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.920
[Guest]: know, this entire obsession with trickle down growth theory that, you know, growth should

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.800
[Guest]: be the be all and end all of economic policy is not good.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.800
[Guest]: This is neoliberal.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800
[Guest]: All right, well taken.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.760
[Guest]: But today, when the GDP declines, I mean, how do the same people go and criticize the

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.560
[Guest]: government for growth, then you have to have a larger theory or an explanation of who's

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.920
[Guest]: getting impacted by this deceleration in growth, how much I think as journalists, we need to

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.360
[Guest]: sort of answer those questions, and also ask those questions, because there are a lot of

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.440
[Guest]: people about today's world economy, polity, these are the two things I am comfortable

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.520
[Guest]: with, I'm sure applies to a lot of other things as well, where we do not know the answers.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.680
[Guest]: But I think at least an attempt has to be made, especially, you know, from the profession

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.120
[Guest]: I work in journalism to be able to ask those questions.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.080
[Amit Varma]: And have there been moments where, for example, you've gone into looking at a subject with

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.480
[Amit Varma]: certain prior assumptions, and found and changed your mind after looking at the data completely?

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.600
[Amit Varma]: Like, is there something memorable like that, which you remember?

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.800
[Guest]: Well, there's one puzzle, which I know, I think we need some more data points.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.400
[Guest]: For example, this entire demonetization thing which happened now the government said that

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.720
[Guest]: it'll aid, you know, tax collection, etc, because the tax base will widen up and all

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.720
[Guest]: that.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.800
[Guest]: Now, this budget, there's been a shortfall, but the income tax numbers, you know, have

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.880
[Guest]: still been growing quite, quite robustly.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:51.080
[Guest]: Even after demonetization, corporate tax is not growing, GST is not growing.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.080
[Guest]: So how much of it is because of demonetization?

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.360
[Guest]: How much of it is because of normal things is something no, because no, I've criticized

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.440
[Guest]: demonetization a lot in my academic works, and I'm not the only one who's criticized it,

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.960
[Guest]: a lot of people have done that.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.280
[Guest]: But the data doesn't allow me to still make a substantive final argument that this is

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.320
[Guest]: what we know about say demonetization's impact on income tax collections.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.880
[Guest]: Now, we know that those tall claims are probably will never be made, but has there been some

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880
[Guest]: impact?

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880
[Guest]: Has there not been an impact?

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.640
[Guest]: I would still like to wait for some time.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.560
[Guest]: So this is where I think data becomes useful.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.240
[Guest]: It prevents you from sort of, you know, grandstanding about your own ideas or your own prejudices

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.360
[Guest]: if one could use the word.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I've also ranted and raved about demon and I have a bunch of episodes on it,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.960
[Amit Varma]: which are linked from the show notes.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:39.400
[Amit Varma]: But then, you know, that brings me to the question of what do you do when data sources

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.680
[Amit Varma]: aren't adequate, or when they are not adequately trustworthy?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.120
[Amit Varma]: For example, demon, it would be fair to assume that a significant part of the impact was

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.200
[Amit Varma]: on the informal sector.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.340
[Amit Varma]: And we don't have direct data from the informal sector, one has to make sort of assumptions

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.040
[Amit Varma]: based on other proxies.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.500
[Amit Varma]: You know, and even apart from the informal sector, where data is a problem, there's also

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.000
[Amit Varma]: the growing issue of how much of data which comes from the government is reliable anymore.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.720
[Amit Varma]: Like I had an episode recently on the GDP with economist Rajeshwari Sengupta, and who's

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.200
[Amit Varma]: in sort of an expert on it.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And it left me alarmed because at the end of it, the feeling I got was that GDP has

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.920
[Amit Varma]: now become less of an economic measure and more of a political rhetorical tool.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And if you can't trust those kinds of figures that the government puts out, and if you don't

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.360
[Amit Varma]: have independent means of getting that kind of data yourself, then what is one to do?

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:38.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, do you then rely on some kind of jugaad with the data that is available and that you

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.080
[Amit Varma]: know is reliable?

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.560
[Guest]: Or how do you navigate that?

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.880
[Guest]: As far as the particular question about GDP is concerned, I think and you know, it is

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.840
[Guest]: unfortunate that that is the case, unless the government, like you said, decides to,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:54.040
[Guest]: you know, sort of make it open to at least an independent panel of economists, experts,

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.880
[Guest]: we would never know.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.080
[Guest]: That's sad for a country like us, we are not some banana republic, we are a big country,

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.080
[Guest]: in terms of population in terms of our economic size in the world.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.520
[Guest]: But then I think it becomes and, you know, these debates, you know, are so politically

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.500
[Guest]: colored now that it is impossible to sort of, you know, pinpoint as to who's being objective

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.600
[Guest]: and who is not because any criticism is then painted in the same brush by the other side.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.880
[Guest]: And somebody, you know, who makes an argument that maybe it is not 4.5, but five would also

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.920
[Guest]: be put in some bracket or the other.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:32.440
[Guest]: I think in that case, as a journalist, you know, because I am not an academic now, you

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.240
[Guest]: know, my work as a journalist does not give me the luxury to sort of, you know, go back,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.880
[Guest]: I'm not saying journalists should not do that.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.840
[Guest]: You know, sometimes we try and do that, with subjects we like, or we think, you know, we

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.720
[Guest]: can actually make some original contribution to but day to day, it is not possible for

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.040
[Guest]: journalists to take a deep dive into each and every subject, I think then it is important

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:56.080
[Guest]: to realize at least individually as to what you can and what you cannot do.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.400
[Guest]: And if beyond the point, there's nothing you can add to the GDP debate.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.280
[Guest]: Now there are people who have much higher stakes, for example, you know, before the

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.760
[Guest]: RBI monetary policy meetings, Reuters does this poll of economists.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.800
[Guest]: So now a lot of them have rating agencies, brokering agencies, you know, these trading

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.520
[Guest]: firms, etc, they have started doing their own work.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.640
[Guest]: So for them, the stakes are higher, they probably can't sort of accept it as fait accompli,

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.800
[Guest]: which we as journalists have to do, unfortunately, that's one.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.920
[Guest]: But the other thing which you said, you know, is more interesting, because what if data

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.760
[Guest]: sort of doesn't allow you to understand things, you know, or the data which is presented,

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.800
[Guest]: I, let's say the data is not bad, but sometimes data can be half truth.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.800
[Guest]: You know, for example, because, you know, I write on agriculture often, I consider the

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.680
[Guest]: farmer suicide data to be a classic example of it.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.280
[Guest]: Now, there's a lot of song and dance about hundreds of 1000s of farmers have committed

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.600
[Guest]: suicide in our country, after economic reforms, etc.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600
[Guest]: That is a terrible thing.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.800
[Guest]: I do not for a moment sort of endorse what has happened.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:59.200
[Guest]: But should we as a country take, you know, farmer suicides as the ultimate proof of whether

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.200
[Guest]: or not there exists farmer distress in country.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.000
[Guest]: Now, most of the farmer suicides in our country, they happen either in Vidarbha or Andhra Pradesh,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.360
[Guest]: they used to happen in Kerala, Wayanad, etc.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.640
[Guest]: But so basically, it is commercially driven farmers which commit suicide.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.920
[Guest]: Now, you will find very few cases of farmer suicides from say Bihar or Eastern Uttar Pradesh,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.760
[Guest]: which are among the or Odisha or West Bengal, which are among the poorest parts of the country.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.640
[Guest]: Does that mean that there's no agrarian distress or rural distress in these parts of the country?

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.640
[Guest]: I would say there's probably more rural distress if one were to take into account just poverty

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.280
[Guest]: and sort of inability to make ends meet.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.880
[Guest]: So why does the farmer suicide data not show in these states because agriculture is driven

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.000
[Guest]: by a completely different set of considerations there, an average farmer in Bihar is only

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.760
[Guest]: interested in, you know, growing enough wheat or rice, probably or a poor lentil to sort

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:54.480
[Guest]: of grow enough to feed yourself and maybe sell a little and then rest of the time when

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.520
[Guest]: you're not cultivating, you actually go and work as construction worker or something.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:04.720
[Guest]: So I think it is in these things where half truths, you know, being captured by data become

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:10.640
[Guest]: sort of the guiding pole of discussion around very serious issues in our country is where

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.640
[Guest]: we have to be really careful.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.280
[Guest]: For example, the informal thing.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.040
[Guest]: Now, I think it is equally important to keep harping upon the fact that we do not know

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.000
[Guest]: what is happening to the informal sector in our country.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.680
[Guest]: I mean, you have to keep harping upon it and people have to understand that GDP numbers

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.720
[Guest]: probably do not mean a lot for.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:31.840
[Guest]: So with the same amount of GDP growth, pre-GST, post-GST life would have become completely

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.040
[Guest]: different for the informal sector in our country, because margins would have taken a deep hit.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.520
[Guest]: So these are things I think, which have not been emphasized upon adequately, you know,

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:45.400
[Guest]: and I think Western journalism, you know, things like the Financial Times and a lot

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.200
[Guest]: of other things have a lot of good things to teach us when it comes to journalism.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.480
[Guest]: And I've always been a believer in the fact that, you know, wherever good things you can

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.560
[Guest]: learn from, you should always learn.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.960
[Guest]: But to look at and understand a country like India, which still has a very large informal

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.680
[Guest]: sector, a lot of its workforce, almost half of it still depends on agriculture.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:10.080
[Guest]: I think in those areas, you know, even the globally established best practices, best

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.800
[Guest]: works, best minds, especially in the journalistic profession cannot help us in understanding

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800
[Guest]: our country.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.600
[Guest]: There, you know, there has to be some sort of a concerted effort to develop indigenous

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:25.040
[Guest]: thinking, indigenous methods, reportage, analysis, whatever that it might be, to help our own

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.120
[Amit Varma]: case, I would say.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And also, is it like I'm just thinking aloud, you mentioned sort of the farmer suicides.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, when you look at data like that, there are so many things you can do

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.040
[Amit Varma]: with that data, you can make different kinds of political cases with that data, depending

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.880
[Amit Varma]: on how you look at it, you can try to contextualize it by saying, okay, if this is a suicide rate

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.160
[Amit Varma]: among farmers, what is the rate among housewives?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.640
[Amit Varma]: And if it's worse among housewives, what does that mean?

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.920
[Amit Varma]: And should we then ignore the former data, and blah, blah, blah.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:58.680
[Amit Varma]: So in that sense, as a journalist, when you're a journalist, do you find that whatever your

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.960
[Amit Varma]: prior inferences might be, or whatever your biases might be?

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Because I mean, frankly, everybody is biased, but you try to be as objective as possible

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.720
[Amit Varma]: in your reportage.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Of course, but human beings are all biased without exception, but you try to guard against

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.920
[Amit Varma]: bias or be transparent.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:18.340
[Amit Varma]: So do those sort of your philosophical leanings and your the principles that you hold also

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:24.040
[Amit Varma]: then influence the questions that you ask of the data, and therefore influence the directions

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.040
[Guest]: that you go in?

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.560
[Guest]: I think that is the honest way to go about it.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:33.520
[Guest]: So the farmer suicide case is a bit straightforward, because thankfully, the NCRB included a subcategory

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520
[Guest]: in its data.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.760
[Guest]: So it now lists reason for suicide.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.640
[Guest]: And if you look at those reasons, actually, you know, most farmers commit suicide due

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.240
[Guest]: to economic distress, crop failure or economic distress, etc.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.520
[Guest]: That one pretty much stands out.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.680
[Guest]: Now, let us go into a more controversial topic, let us look at the election results we've

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680
[Guest]: had to 2019.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.560
[Guest]: Now, we know that this is a phenomenal victory, which the Bharatiya Janata Party has sort

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.560
[Guest]: of pulled.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.600
[Guest]: Now, a lot of people, you know, liberals, those leaning on the left would like us to

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:06.360
[Guest]: believe that, if not all, an overwhelming driver of this victory has been, you know,

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.720
[Guest]: the Bharatiya Janata Party's and its leaders' abilities to sort of polarize the electorate

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.720
[Guest]: and communal lines.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.200
[Guest]: That is what we are told at least.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.320
[Guest]: Now, this is something the BJP has been doing for ever since its inception, that that's

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.600
[Guest]: its core politics from Ram Janmabhoomi to many other things.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.600
[Guest]: Is it just that?

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.600
[Guest]: Or is there more to this victory, you know, it could be national security, it could be

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.600
[Guest]: pro-poor programs.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.600
[Guest]: Unfortunately, we in India still do not have that kind of detailed, you know, election

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600
[Guest]: data.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.600
[Guest]: I mean, the CSDS does some transparent surveys, but the sample size, etc. are still small.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.400
[Guest]: Those numbers are still not out in the public realm, they probably take their own time to

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.040
[Guest]: release them.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.560
[Guest]: On questions like these, I think, is where the real test comes.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.080
[Guest]: Now, what do you do?

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.320
[Guest]: Because there's no easily accessible data.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.840
[Guest]: You have, you would like to believe, well, let me put it this way, I mean, whether or

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.960
[Guest]: not you'd like to believe there's a convenient set of explanations, you know, which are being

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:03.760
[Guest]: forwarded by people who are otherwise very established in their academic careers.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.760
[Guest]: So what do you do?

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.400
[Guest]: I think this is also a challenge for people, you know, who are doing this kind of work

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.560
[Guest]: in our generation, because, you know, if we look at the world today, globally, you know,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.560
[Guest]: polarization is increasing.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.040
[Guest]: A lot of leaders, very powerful leaders, I mean, our Prime Minister is one example, we

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:27.400
[Guest]: have Donald Trump, who are, you know, treading into waters which were considered, I would

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.920
[Guest]: say, the unimaginable, you know, for the United States President to be making the kind of

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.640
[Guest]: statements he's making, etc.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.400
[Guest]: So these are very different times.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.160
[Guest]: Economically, these are very difficult times also.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.560
[Guest]: So we know that economically, things are not going to be as good as they were even 10 years

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560
[Guest]: ago.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:48.120
[Guest]: Now, when there is economic distress, when there is a lot of polarization already happening,

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.400
[Guest]: how do you explain the world?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.160
[Guest]: How do you even try and engage with the world?

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.960
[Guest]: Now, data can be one bit, but I think the correct approach as far as, you know, or at

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.680
[Guest]: least the one which I try and take is, I mean, look at the data, because that's not at least

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.080
[Guest]: sacrosanct and the good part in India is, you know, most of the data actually comes

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.080
[Guest]: from the government.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.960
[Guest]: So if you're using the government's own data, there's only a limit to which people can disagree

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.960
[Guest]: with you, including those, you know, in the government.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.840
[Guest]: So that's the good part about using data.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.040
[Guest]: But I think then one also has to have a very sort of open mind, you know, you asked me

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:24.520
[Guest]: the question earlier about which are the thinkers I would sort of, I draw my thoughts from,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.720
[Guest]: I think, you know, the kind of world we are in today, and there's not one thinker, who

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.340
[Guest]: you can use to sort of explain the world, you know, for example, let us look at somebody

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.080
[Guest]: like Bawasaheb Ambedkar.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:42.160
[Guest]: I think in today's India, if there's one politician slash leader who is admired by everybody across

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.880
[Guest]: the political spectrum, now, the RSS, BJP has a lot of problems with Jawaharlal Nehru,

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.080
[Guest]: I mean, they do not say so explicitly, but they have a lot of problems with a lot of

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.720
[Guest]: things Mahatma Gandhi also did.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.840
[Guest]: But Bawasaheb Ambedkar is one person with whom everybody now the communists also used

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.840
[Guest]: to be critical of him earlier from from the from the ultra left to the ultra right sort

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.960
[Guest]: of eulogizes Bawasaheb Ambedkar.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.920
[Guest]: If you were to read his writings in entirety, I think Bawasaheb would be the most hated

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.600
[Guest]: political figure in this country today, because he's really spoken in mind and all sorts of

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.600
[Amit Varma]: issues.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.880
[Guest]: In fact, especially hated by the Hindu right wing.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.920
[Guest]: Difficult to say a lot of people would hate him for a lot of reasons.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.920
[Guest]: So, you know, I have been trained in a leftist tradition.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.400
[Guest]: So I of course think you know that the basic thing you know, which sort of Marx Lenin etc

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.440
[Guest]: still holds a lot of, but, you know, you could say that you draw your basic larger analysis

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.120
[Guest]: from the Marxian scheme, but there's no socialism in today's world.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:39.920
[Guest]: I mean, I cannot envisage a socialism which does not allow me free markets, or that basically,

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.280
[Guest]: but no, a lot of people on the left today celebrate basic liberties, what kind of civil

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.160
[Guest]: liberties did the Soviet Union allow to its people?

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.480
[Guest]: What kind of civil liberties does China allow to its people?

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.280
[Guest]: I mean, you say our country, you know, this communal politics, etc, look at what China

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.140
[Guest]: is doing to Muslims who have been put in those camps.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.680
[Guest]: So I do not think there's a grand narrative today, which fits the world.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.860
[Guest]: But I also think that, and it'll probably become more important, I think we have to

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.320
[Guest]: the fact that India and you know, my formal training is in economics.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:14.720
[Guest]: So my knowledge of history and know politics in relatively much poor compared to what the

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.000
[Guest]: student of politics or history would have.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.480
[Guest]: But the more I try and read about it, the more I get fascinated with the fact that India

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.240
[Guest]: as it were, we were able to arrive at this constitutional consensus to sort of adopt

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.240
[Guest]: a constitution.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.800
[Guest]: And what we have managed is, of course, in the third world, sort of unparalleled, I mean,

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:35.160
[Guest]: we look at our neighbors, we look at other third world countries, emerging markets, etc.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:40.680
[Guest]: without a political shock to our democracy, barring the emergency, which also, you know,

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.000
[Guest]: the transition to democracy was, I would say, relatively much more peaceful than what other

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.520
[Guest]: countries have had to have without a major economic crisis.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.440
[Guest]: And no, when we talk about the 91 balance of payment crisis, etc.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.600
[Guest]: But that basically involved shipping some gold from here to London, I mean, look at

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.040
[Guest]: the kind of economic crisis East Asian countries have had Latin American countries have to

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.040
[Guest]: add.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.640
[Guest]: So by and large, we have, you know, emerged pretty much sort of unharmed.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.840
[Guest]: Now, I think India has to change.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:11.200
[Guest]: I mean, it can't be the way it has been, for example, is something I always say, you know,

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.120
[Guest]: so a lot of people on the left today say that if you want to counter Narendra Modi, you

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.880
[Guest]: have to have a Bernie Sanders or you have to have a Jeremy Corbyn, etc.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.800
[Guest]: Now, for people like say, Sanders or Corbyn to be able to know indulge in the kind of

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.760
[Guest]: rhetoric they are doing, and you know, a lot of which I agree with, but that is besides

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760
[Guest]: the point.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:34.000
[Guest]: I think it draws traction from the fact that both the United States, UK, etc, they at least

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.680
[Guest]: know after the Second World War had a golden age, I mean, where social security, education,

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.240
[Guest]: economy, everything was in a really good shape.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.440
[Guest]: I don't think that was the case in India ever.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:51.360
[Guest]: So if one were to ask, you know, say, intergenerationally or otherwise, also, I do not think there are

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.560
[Guest]: a handful of people, you know, who who might be like that, but most people are actually

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.920
[Guest]: materially well off in India even today compared to what they were earlier.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.080
[Guest]: So we need to have a different kind of a theory for it.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.400
[Guest]: I mean, this is something I dwelt on in my last piece also, I mean, class in the classic

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.400
[Guest]: sense of the term as we stand it, for example, in the old left rhetoric of Tata, Billa, etc.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.600
[Guest]: I mean, today, Adani Ambani has replaced the Tata Billa.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.240
[Guest]: I think the average man on the person on the street loves Mukesh Ambani for the geophones

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.800
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, we have cheapest data in our country today, or for the Mumbai Indians

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:28.440
[Guest]: entertainment where you could be but talking in terms of materially, I mean, telecom revolution

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.240
[Guest]: in our country, IT revolution in our country, these are all genuine capitalist driven innovations

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.240
[Guest]: which are which our country has really exploited.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.600
[Guest]: We talk of the IT boom today, you know, I talked about JNU, for example, I said, you

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:46.520
[Guest]: know, JNU, you know, being cheap fees, etc, subsidized education that it was, but JNU has

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.560
[Guest]: only produced a handful of people like me.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.600
[Guest]: If we talk about our success in the IT boom, because of which a lot of remittances come

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.080
[Guest]: into our country, a lot of people in my generation, our generation are employed in those sectors.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.040
[Guest]: This was these are all private engineering colleges.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.920
[Guest]: I mean, your IITs could only have produced so many graduates, I mean, thousands and thousands

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.920
[Guest]: of engineering graduates which we are producing, because of private sector in education.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:12.080
[Guest]: So I think, you know, there have to be certain things which are sacrosanct, civil liberty

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.960
[Guest]: should be one, basic health and education should be one.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.880
[Guest]: But you largely have to have a political framework, even if, you know, you want to criticize any

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.120
[Guest]: regime, be it this regime or the earlier regime or the next regime which comes.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:31.120
[Guest]: I think you have to have a way to sort of evolve on your existing successes.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.720
[Guest]: In case of India, in case of, you know, for example, you know, there were 1,001 million

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.800
[Guest]: problems with the Soviet Union, but it did certain good things to the world.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.480
[Guest]: There was universal suffrage after the Soviet Union came into being, etc.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.440
[Guest]: So I think the successes of the past have to be sort of, I mean, imbibed.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.440
[Guest]: And then you can't ask for going back to say the past.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.440
[Guest]: That is how I think political thinking has to evolve in our country, especially in today's

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.440
[Guest]: times.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.240
[Guest]: You have to know what I mean, for example, I would love to read all of what Bawasabha

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.840
[Guest]: Medkar said, I would love to read more about the Constituent Assembly debates, I've not

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.580
[Guest]: read about them at all.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:07.240
[Guest]: But you have to bring those kinds of debates into focus.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240
[Guest]: What is at stake?

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.760
[Guest]: How did we agree on what we actually agreed on?

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.440
[Guest]: Were there pending disagreements about important things which were, you know, where the attitude

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.480
[Guest]: of the political class was, so to say, kick the can down the road?

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.200
[Guest]: I think those kinds of debates have to be revived today have to be engaged with to be

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:26.200
[Guest]: able to construct any meaningful political civil discourse in our country.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.920
[Amit Varma]: I think what I largely find and this is a lament is that instead of a deepening of the

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.000
[Amit Varma]: discourse, the way you just mentioned, what we are seeing is a shallowing out of the discourse

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.200
[Amit Varma]: where at least in the public discourse, what you see is increasing polarizations as people

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.920
[Amit Varma]: take essentially tribal positions, which, you know, brings me back to your earlier point

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:52.780
[Amit Varma]: that you made that, you know, that when you take something like these 2019 election results,

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.520
[Amit Varma]: and they can be interpreted in so many different ways, and people will just stick whatever

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.640
[Amit Varma]: narrative they want on it, where some people will say this shows that India is bigoted,

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and some people will, you know, you can make different narratives out of it.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.020
[Amit Varma]: And all of which may be true or false to different degrees.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:13.120
[Amit Varma]: But the question here is that, even as a journalist, when you work with data for either journalists

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.200
[Amit Varma]: or public intellectuals, there's also partly the expectation that in some way, you will

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.600
[Amit Varma]: help to make sense of the world.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.640
[Amit Varma]: And in some way, that will involve creating perhaps a narrative of your own, however,

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.000
[Amit Varma]: it might be more nuanced than the other narratives out there.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.080
[Amit Varma]: But however, nuanced, it might be creating a narrative.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:36.440
[Amit Varma]: And my question when you work with data is that, in the social sciences, how easy is

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.440
[Amit Varma]: it to do that?

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.920
[Amit Varma]: For example, I mean, it's very hard to when you talk about public policy to infer causation,

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.160
[Amit Varma]: and you know, figure out what is causation and what is merely correlation, like an economist

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.840
[Amit Varma]: who's been a frequent guest on my show, Shruti Rajagopal, and she once gave me a really good

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.180
[Amit Varma]: example of this.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:57.080
[Amit Varma]: She said, let's say you want to figure out if dropping a coin in water will raise the

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.720
[Amit Varma]: level of the water or not.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.240
[Amit Varma]: Now you can arrive at it through scientific first principles and say that, yeah, of course

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.240
[Amit Varma]: it will.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.600
[Amit Varma]: Or you can say, we'll do an experiment.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.320
[Amit Varma]: And within a lab and control conditions, you take a beaker of water, you measure the length,

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.120
[Amit Varma]: you put a coin, you measure the height again, and you know what it is.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.280
[Amit Varma]: But in social sciences, the equivalent of that is you are in a large swimming pool with

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.760
[Amit Varma]: many people bobbing in and out, and you drop a coin in that swimming pool.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.160
[Amit Varma]: And then you try to measure the height of the water.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.120
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes it will be up, sometimes it will be down.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.840
[Amit Varma]: On what basis are you going to infer causation?

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:34.480
[Amit Varma]: So when you look at all the data that emerges out of our madly messy society and our madly

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:39.440
[Amit Varma]: messy economy, isn't that a sort of a problem that you face that you are supposed to make

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.680
[Amit Varma]: sense of all of this?

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.920
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, how do you handle that challenge?

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.840
[Guest]: There are two, three ways about it.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:51.040
[Guest]: First, like you said, I think, even today, you know, it might seem a cliche for the people

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.760
[Guest]: who actually know the subject.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:58.040
[Guest]: I think as journalists, it is our duty not to sort of engage with, you know, the experts

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:03.320
[Guest]: or the converted, but to the larger audience, which in India, I still believe, sincerely

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.960
[Guest]: looks up to journalism to give them information as unbiased as it can be.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.320
[Guest]: So I think the most important point is to reiterate the first principles.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.840
[Guest]: We have to know what I or you might take for granted, you know, in terms of even inferring

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.960
[Guest]: the data that we have, sort of go out and educate the larger audiences.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.880
[Guest]: For example, a couple of years ago, for Hindustan Times, on the day of the budget, we actually

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.560
[Guest]: did a large data piece explaining the basic things.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.120
[Guest]: For example, what does a revised estimate and a budget estimate mean?

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.120
[Guest]: For us, it's obvious.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.120
[Guest]: I mean, we know it.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.480
[Guest]: But I think for the larger audience, even those bits of knowledge, I mean, we should

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.680
[Guest]: at no point of time consider explaining these basic things beneath us.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.680
[Guest]: That I think is the first requirement of being a journalist.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.680
[Guest]: You have to know you engage with at a very mass level.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:54.640
[Guest]: The second thing is, I think what you said to point that out, that this is what actually

00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:01.520
[Guest]: can happen now, because inflation under this government was, you know, very low, it doesn't

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.200
[Guest]: mean that all of it was a policy success.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.000
[Guest]: Inflation was low also, because this government enjoyed for a very large part of it, the previous

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.160
[Guest]: government low oil prices, something as basic as that has to be explained.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.040
[Guest]: I mean, bonds, the government is planning to issue them.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.920
[Guest]: So a lot of people have written against it, a lot of people have written in favor of it.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.600
[Guest]: I would like to do a piece at some point of time, you know, something as basic as this,

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.720
[Guest]: that note, you borrow $5 billion today, the exchange rate is 70 for $1 today, you expect

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.200
[Guest]: it to be 75 for $1 when you have to repay that loan in say five years, what if the exchange

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.960
[Guest]: rate were to be 90 per dollar, then the kind of money you have to pay, I mean, would increase

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.960
[Guest]: many folds.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.720
[Guest]: Similarly, if the exchange rate were to go down, it probably make a windfall.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.760
[Guest]: Then you go to another data point as to how the rupee has behaved.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.800
[Guest]: So I think a step by step narrative, counting all the possibilities, which might or might

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.280
[Guest]: not happen, actually, this is my experience personally, for example, I am the happiest

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.240
[Guest]: when one day I write a piece in ST, then some class 11 student from say Jalandhar writes

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.320
[Guest]: a mail to me, then I really like this, I want to be a journalist, etc.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.320
[Guest]: Has that happened?

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.320
[Guest]: Sometimes it does happen.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.280
[Guest]: So that is what I really look forward to, because the experts, you know, I'm very grateful

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.720
[Guest]: to them that they promote my work, etc. but that is something where I do not have to make

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.560
[Guest]: an extra effort to sort of go and engage with them.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.480
[Guest]: That is their subject of interest, they like it, they, you know, sometimes they also engage

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.240
[Guest]: with me to sort of promote me, encourage me, develop my own arguments.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:32.920
[Guest]: But when I'm able to engage with a intelligent layperson reader, by not compromising the

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.000
[Guest]: basic method I do in my story writing is when I feel the happiest and I think that the future

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.280
[Guest]: for these kind of arguments to be made more and more people should be making it.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.080
[Amit Varma]: So what you're saying is that your work is not just you don't view your work just as

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.440
[Amit Varma]: interpreting data and coming up with an explanation or a narrative of how things are, but also

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.240
[Amit Varma]: helping people see how the different kinds of data interact with each other, and therefore

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.320
[Amit Varma]: helping them better understand the complexity of it that the complexity of the swimming

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.320
[Amit Varma]: pool for that matter.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.320
[Guest]: And right.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.940
[Guest]: So, you know, as you mentioned earlier, I have this past as a political activist.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.520
[Guest]: So knowing genuine, it's very common with the left.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.520
[Guest]: So Marx has this famous quote of philosophers have only interpreted the world.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.840
[Guest]: The point, however, is to change it.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.120
[Guest]: I think when you're a journalist, only the first part of the phrase applies to you.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.160
[Guest]: Your job is basically to interpret the world as well as you can, and list all possibilities.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.560
[Amit Varma]: But you're basically helping change it also.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:30.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that boy in Jalandhar who wrote to you and you might one day go on to.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.320
[Guest]: But I think this is also an extremely important thing.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.440
[Guest]: And this is something I believe because you know, I've been on the other side of the world

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.400
[Guest]: as a political activist, and today I'm a journalist, and I think, you know, unless and until you're

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.920
[Guest]: writing opinion, there should not be an overlap in these two.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.720
[Guest]: I mean, it is important for unbiased journalism.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.560
[Guest]: But I think as journalists, we also need to understand that, you know, just because we

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.480
[Guest]: think and we always try to be writing what the truth is, it doesn't mean it'll have automatic

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.720
[Guest]: traction in the society.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.400
[Guest]: Now, this is something which is not rocket science, a lot of philosophers, etc.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.200
[Guest]: Marx has written on it that, you know, no matter whether an idea is true or false, the

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.120
[Guest]: kind of social traction, political traction it has, also depends on larger social conditions,

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.640
[Guest]: political conditions, etc.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.680
[Guest]: So if you have that in mind, then it gives you a certain amount of I would say critical

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:19.500
[Guest]: distance or whatever one might call it, or no, or the ability to work very dispassionately

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.240
[Guest]: and objectively also.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:25.560
[Guest]: That is something I consider myself lucky to have developed that thing early in my career.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:30.400
[Amit Varma]: And as someone who looks at data on a daily basis, and perhaps reflexively, you look at

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.160
[Amit Varma]: the data in every subject that you do, do you look at columnists and opinion writers

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.640
[Amit Varma]: like myself, for example, and think ki yaar yeh hawa mein baat kar rahe hain, matlab it's

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.720
[Amit Varma]: not grounded in, because then it must seem very easy for anyone to just sit down and

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.160
[Amit Varma]: write an opinion column, right?

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.640
[Amit Varma]: Because if they don't have to back it up with data, whereas your work is around data, everything

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.640
[Amit Varma]: is around data.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:57.640
[Amit Varma]: So does it change the way you look at other opinion writers, columnists, all of that?

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:03.240
[Guest]: So my newspaper, my idea of a newspaper, and this has never changed, you know, when I was

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.080
[Guest]: standing at five or six, and I used to read a Hindi newspaper, today I read a lot of newspapers,

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.080
[Guest]: I would probably like to read even more.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.440
[Guest]: So my newspaper always used to finish at the op-ed pages.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.440
[Guest]: So business, foreign, sports, I never looked at them throughout my life.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.680
[Guest]: Now that I work in a newspaper, I realize how important they are.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:25.560
[Guest]: So I think one thing which newspapers teach you is plurality and diversity of views is

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.960
[Guest]: extremely important.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.560
[Guest]: And when I say views, I do not just mean views, I also mean work, you know, because, you know,

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.920
[Guest]: I might be doing data, somebody might be covering the BJP, somebody who might be looking at

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.840
[Guest]: personal finance, business papers have more than one reporter just tracking mutual funds.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:45.280
[Guest]: I think, you know, all of those works are extremely important, including people who

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.080
[Guest]: write opinion pieces, because what it allows a journalist is, you know, like I said earlier,

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:56.800
[Guest]: I think good journalism in this country, even today has a lot of potential to bring intellect

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.400
[Guest]: levels up in our society.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:04.600
[Guest]: Now, I might never have read a, what should I say, even the basic, you know, text of Ambedkar,

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.440
[Guest]: I have not read much of it, but a lot of people when they write, the fact that there exists

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.000
[Guest]: something like a constituent assembly debate, the fact that there was a debate on cow protection,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.920
[Guest]: you know, in our country, when the constitution was being made, these are all things I've

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.600
[Guest]: learned from newspaper writings, popular writings.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.720
[Guest]: I think this is where public intellectuals have a role to play.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.000
[Guest]: And public intellectuals need not only be in universities or very high ranking think

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000
[Guest]: tanks.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.400
[Guest]: I think this is where all of us are public intellectuals have a very important role to

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.400
[Guest]: play.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:35.960
[Guest]: We have to learn to agree to disagree, I will not agree with everything you say, etc.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.960
[Guest]: But even then, I think it is extremely important, especially in today's conditions, when there

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:45.680
[Guest]: is a lot of social polarization, political polarization, that we get to engage, for example,

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.560
[Guest]: I would personally like to know a lot more about what Dindayal Upadhyay's writings are.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.120
[Guest]: Unfortunately, I've never read them.

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:56.640
[Guest]: But no, when we have a prime minister, who's probably one of the most popular leaders in

00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.880
[Guest]: my generation, the most popular leader, because I never saw Mrs. Gandhi, who swears by Dindayal

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.280
[Guest]: Upadhyay's ideology, who claims that the BJP is driven by Dindayal, I think there's some

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.640
[Guest]: merit in engaging with that.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:09.560
[Guest]: So I would actually love to have a lot more people writing on what Dindayal Upadhyay wrote.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.440
[Guest]: Now, you have to, there's good work in journalism, there's bad work in journalism, there's good

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.320
[Guest]: opinion writing, there's bad opinion writing.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.160
[Guest]: But I think this is one of the beauties of free market and society, which has, I think,

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.520
[Guest]: a lot of freedom to write, read, engage, etc.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.680
[Guest]: You can always go out and choose what you want to, I mean, the Indian journalistic scene

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.840
[Guest]: to me, I mean, is that we don't have a Walmart in country, but this is the Walmart of ideas,

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:36.240
[Guest]: I think, I mean, you can go and look at what you want to buy and don't want to buy.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240
[Guest]: I think it's very important.

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.760
[Amit Varma]: No, and that's beautifully said, and that strikes a chord with me also.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.120
[Amit Varma]: And what you said about having that multiplicity of kinds of journalism and ideas and all of

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.840
[Amit Varma]: that in a newspaper where you have a business page, a foreign page, and I usually go to

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.760
[Amit Varma]: the sports page first, so kindly judge me for it.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:57.200
[Amit Varma]: But it doesn't worry you that in modern times, how people interact with content is changing

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.080
[Amit Varma]: to the extent that all of this is getting sort of, like earlier, what used to happen

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.720
[Amit Varma]: is that you get a daily newspaper at home, and everything is there is available to you

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:09.800
[Amit Varma]: when you flip through it, and you know, you may or may not read some things, but they're

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.800
[Amit Varma]: all available for you.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:15.160
[Amit Varma]: And today, the way people discover content, discover media is mostly you'll go on Facebook

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:20.000
[Amit Varma]: or you follow a link on social media is all been kind of this aggregated, you don't get

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.920
[Amit Varma]: these filtered packages coming to you.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.600
[Amit Varma]: Instead, you get I mean, there's a different kind of filter which comes at you from social

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:32.120
[Amit Varma]: media, it might even be a tribal filter, because social media is so increasingly polarized.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.240
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of people are being exposed, therefore, to only one specific kind of content and not

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:43.360
[Amit Varma]: to that broad, diverse sort of content that is there in our newspapers.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that I may be overstating or is it something that worries you for the

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.040
[Amit Varma]: future?

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.200
[Guest]: It should not happen in principle is something I agree on.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.600
[Guest]: But you see, there are certain things which, you know, you have to take them as they come.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.800
[Guest]: But I would say I mean, there was a time when there were no newspapers, the time when there

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.520
[Guest]: were no courts in our country, there was no, I mean, not just our country everywhere, society

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.520
[Guest]: has evolved.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.080
[Guest]: So I think the news industry is also evolving today.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.760
[Guest]: And there are no, I mean, you are only talking about the desirability aspect of it.

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.960
[Guest]: I mean, all of us who work in media know that there's a very big revenue aspect to it also.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.960
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.360
[Guest]: Traditional business models in media are struggling.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.200
[Guest]: Now I'm not somebody who understands a lot of it.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.320
[Guest]: But working in a company, I know that how difficult things are today for everybody in

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.820
[Guest]: the media industry.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:32.240
[Guest]: How we'll deal with those challenges, time will tell, there are more capable people than

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.040
[Guest]: me who would have to deal with these challenges.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.680
[Guest]: I mean, free market also means that the ones who adapt survive, the ones who do not probably

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.360
[Guest]: do not survive.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:46.400
[Guest]: But like I said, though, when I talk about it in terms of pure desirability, I think

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:52.360
[Guest]: the casualty which, you know, causation which one draws is that because, you know, Facebook

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.420
[Guest]: and WhatsApp and fake news and videos, etc, are happening.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.960
[Guest]: This is why a certain kind of politics is sort of gaining traction in India, in the

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.680
[Guest]: world, etc.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.560
[Guest]: I think that's partly true, but that's also not true.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.920
[Guest]: The basic premise, you know, if you follow the sort of Marxian scheme of analysis is

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:17.160
[Guest]: that, you know, you were able to make a revolution in 1917, because majority of the people agreed

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:22.520
[Guest]: with the basic cause you were espousing, when Lenin said land, peace and bread, so many

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:28.000
[Guest]: people in what was then Russia later became Soviet Union came with him, made a revolution.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:35.640
[Guest]: Today, if your premise is that, you know, I think OBC, you know, phrased it in the best

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.680
[Guest]: possible way that the Hindu mind has been hijacked.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.880
[Guest]: I think you can't stop there.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:45.240
[Guest]: I mean, if you believe and you know, I think there's an objective basis to saying that

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.320
[Guest]: a lot of people are financially in trouble, things are not as good as they were before

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.320
[Guest]: the crisis, a lot of our young generation who are getting out of colleges, universities,

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.800
[Guest]: etc, are not finding jobs.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.800
[Guest]: Even if you are rich, you sort of having difficulties earlier, you could go to an engineering college,

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.840
[Guest]: probably go to the US now those things will not happen.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.440
[Guest]: You even if your father can afford 20 lakhs for a private engineering college, you will

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.880
[Guest]: not get a job that easily, then ultimately, somebody has to go and build a political case

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.200
[Guest]: that here is what needs to be done.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:19.360
[Guest]: I think, you know, this entire social media and no, I could sound a bit extremist when

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:24.800
[Guest]: I say that is an alibi for a failure to come up with an effective opposition to the kind

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.200
[Guest]: of right wing populism we are seeing, not just in our country, but in the world today.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.840
[Guest]: I mean, you cannot say that we'll go back to the past.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.840
[Guest]: So which is why probably a Hillary Clinton, you know, lost to Donald Trump.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.560
[Guest]: I mean, people associated certain kinds of things with Hillary Clinton, the old elite.

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:44.600
[Guest]: I think, you know, however, and personally, I do disagree with a lot of political things

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:50.120
[Guest]: the present regime says, but I think the critique of the old elite stands and India today, thanks

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.080
[Guest]: to you know, pro market reforms, a lot of upward mobility, which has happened is a far

00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:01.120
[Guest]: more democratized place, in terms of opportunities, and ideas also, they will not listen to the

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:07.000
[Guest]: old elite, they wanted I mean, I've seen in front of my own eyes in Delhi, you know, something

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.480
[Guest]: like an Ahmadi party growing up.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.400
[Guest]: Now, I do not know where the Ahmadi party will go from here in the next election five

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.200
[Guest]: years down the line, they were very promising in Punjab at one point of time today, for

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:19.040
[Guest]: all practical purposes, they are a Delhi based party.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.280
[Guest]: But the fact that in a city like city state like Delhi, which is a proper microcosm of

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.560
[Guest]: what India is, you have placed people from all over the country in the city, could grow

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:34.120
[Guest]: up as a political force capture the imagination of power, I think it also shows how open possibilities

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.120
[Guest]: of building alternative politics are.

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:40.520
[Guest]: And those kinds of options are open to everybody, I mean, it is not just that the BJP only circulates

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.520
[Guest]: fake news.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.920
[Guest]: I mean, if I were to give one example, I think technology can never be an alibi of failing

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.280
[Guest]: to come up with social change.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:52.520
[Guest]: I mean, then the Marxists would have packed their bags and gone long ago.

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.040
[Amit Varma]: That's a fantastic insight.

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.360
[Amit Varma]: And we'll take a quick commercial break now.

00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:00.000

[Amit Varma]: But with that, let's get you on with the show.

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Roshan Kishore about data journalism, about the political economy, which

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:10.560
[Amit Varma]: he writes about regularly.

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:17.120
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, coming to sort of Indian politics now, you you've been a data journalism and

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:22.720
[Amit Varma]: sort of a data journalist and sort of in the thick of things during what is a transformative

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.520
[Amit Varma]: period in our politics.

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:31.480
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about following politics during this time, you know, the 2014 elections,

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.400
[Amit Varma]: the 2019 elections.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.400
[Amit Varma]: Has it?

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Have there been parts of it which are bewildering, which have taken you by surprise?

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.600
[Amit Varma]: And also how has a political, how has our politics changed during this time?

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:48.440
[Guest]: So, ironical as it may sound, my most bewildering political experience actually doesn't come

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.880
[Guest]: from doing data journalism, but going out in the field.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:54.000
[Guest]: This is during the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000
[Guest]: I think this was somewhere between Jabalpur and Bhopal district.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.160
[Guest]: We went to a village, talking to a bunch of people.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.080
[Guest]: All of these people were rooting for the Congress.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.960
[Guest]: They were extremely angry with the BJP government, etc.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.360
[Guest]: And we were having this conversation.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.040
[Guest]: And then this guy tells me that when the Babri mosque was being demolished, he along with

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.080
[Guest]: all other villagers actually went to demolish it.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:24.400
[Guest]: So here is a group of voters who were not just supporters, but active participants in

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:29.360
[Guest]: what is often and rightly thought of as one of the most communal acts of politics in our

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:36.320
[Guest]: country organized then, but they were not voting for the party they were still aligned

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.520
[Guest]: ideologically with.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.760
[Guest]: I think that is how complicated politics has become in our country.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:47.480
[Guest]: Or if I were to put it the other way, maybe politics has always been like that, but we

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.560
[Guest]: never realized it was the way like that.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.440
[Guest]: So let us go back to the 2014 elections, Narendra Modi for the first time in 30 years got a

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.880
[Guest]: majority on his own, made a big thing.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.840
[Guest]: A lot of explanation was that it is actually the anger against UPA2, you know, 2G and Commonwealth,

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.840
[Guest]: etc, etc, etc.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.640
[Guest]: And then, you know, there was mixed evidence.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:13.680
[Guest]: So 2014, you win these elections, then you have some success in Maharashtra, Haryana,

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680
[Guest]: etc.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.000
[Guest]: And then we come to Delhi 2015, the BJP is all but wiped out, you get just three seats.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.360
[Guest]: Then no, you go to a completely different electoral battlefield, which is Bihar in 2015,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.360
[Guest]: October.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:31.360
[Guest]: Once again, somebody who's, who's been epitomized as the symbol of corruption, nepotism, etc,

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.320
[Guest]: by the BJP, Lalu Prasad Yadav pulls off a spectacular victory along with Nitish Kumar

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.120
[Guest]: with the BJP.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.440
[Guest]: Then you again, you know, 16, the BJP is irrelevant, because it's Bengal, Kerala, Assam, they win,

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.600
[Guest]: but by and large, not major players.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.560
[Guest]: Then no demonetization happens, then UP happens.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.320
[Guest]: Then once again, there's a big bang, you know, the Bihar government falls under a bunch of

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.320
[Guest]: its own contradictions, because the BJP, Nitish Kumar said it openly was invincible, nobody

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.320
[Guest]: could defeat it.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.360
[Guest]: So he made it very, very clear why he was going.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.940
[Guest]: Then 17 onwards, we get into a completely different trajectory where the BJP manages

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:07.360
[Guest]: to somehow retain Gujarat, then 18, there was the shock defeats for the BJP.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.280
[Guest]: So by the time we got to 2019, and I'm very honest about it, this was my personal belief

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.840
[Guest]: as well that it was anything but a closed race.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:20.120
[Guest]: I mean, I did not see the BJP performing the way it did, because, you know, being a numbers

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.160
[Guest]: guy was actually looking at those previous numbers.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.880
[Guest]: And if you look at previous assembly elections before 14, there was always 80% of the assembly

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.060
[Guest]: elections actually sort of manifested in the Lok Sabha elections, the trends.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:36.200
[Guest]: So I thought there was no way the BJP could do what it ultimately ended up doing.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.640
[Guest]: Now that it has happened, I think one has to try and go back and ask those questions

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.320
[Guest]: as to how it happened.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.240
[Guest]: Now, there are a bunch of people who think that EVMs are rigged, etc.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.240
[Guest]: I think all that is bogus.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.640
[Guest]: I mean, as simple as that, because, you know, the same sets of EVMs, etc. are being used.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:59.000
[Guest]: The biggest takeaway, I think, from the 19 victory of the BJP is that people in our country

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.240
[Guest]: are actually voting separately at different levels of government formation.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.580
[Guest]: So they might elect somebody else to be the chief minister, they might elect somebody

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.280
[Guest]: else to their prime minister.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.400
[Guest]: I mean, Odisha is a perfect example, it went to poll on the same day assembly and Lok

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.320
[Guest]: Sabha elections have drastically different results.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.960
[Guest]: People voting in the same booth on the same day are voting for two different parties.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.400
[Guest]: Now this is, this is a very big thing as far as Indian democracy is concerned, Indian politics

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.400
[Guest]: is concerned.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.820
[Guest]: This also means that the BJP going from here, no, however implausible it sounds right now,

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:37.680
[Guest]: it sounded so in 2014, also might suffer reverses in state elections, but then the opposition

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.720
[Guest]: because it will not have to not be able to construct a popular sort of narrative, along

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.560
[Guest]: with a figure which is extremely important because now we are voting more for a leader

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.240
[Guest]: rather than a party and the BJP also has absolutely no pretence in acknowledging that it is a

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.280
[Guest]: vote for Narendra Modi.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.160
[Guest]: These are very interesting times.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:02.480
[Guest]: I think one has to have a substantive analysis of what Narendra Modi did.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.880
[Guest]: Now mind you, in politics, there could be things which we think are counterproductive

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.160
[Guest]: something like demonetization, but could help politically.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.280
[Guest]: There are things, you know, such as demolition of the Babri mosque, which we think is very

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.640
[Guest]: bad to do.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.880
[Guest]: But democracy, you know, we have to accept it is also a rule of the majority.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.040
[Guest]: So the majority of the people do not agree with an idea, however, right it is or agree

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.080
[Guest]: with the idea, however, preposterous and dangerous it is, then that idea always sort of carries

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.640
[Guest]: on in a democracy or we are a democracy.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.920
[Guest]: So we have to think along those lines, what are the things which they did right, which

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.840
[Guest]: were also right for the larger interests of the country, the economy, the polity, which

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.120
[Guest]: they did right, which were otherwise counterproductive.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.080
[Guest]: More importantly, what are the things which the opposition could not do, for example,

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.080
[Guest]: something like demonetization.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:55.240
[Guest]: No, I still believe had the BJP been in opposition, the amount of public anger which would have

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.320
[Guest]: erupted against demonetization, and you remember Venezuela tried something similar when demonetization

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:05.620
[Guest]: exactly take it back, Venezuela is today a far more repressed democracy than India is.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:08.760
[Guest]: But India did not have one credible protest against demonetization.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.920
[Guest]: Now that speaks volumes about the failure of the opposition.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.960
[Guest]: Now the crudest explanation could be a lot of people, grassroots leaders were actually

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.620
[Guest]: exchanging notes and you never know.

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:24.880
[Guest]: But to be able to encash popular anger against, you know, a lot of policies which we think

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.240
[Guest]: and some of which we rightly think are wrong, I think is also there also has to be an analysis

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.600
[Guest]: of what was done by the opposition and what was not.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:37.400
[Guest]: So those are the two tracks in which I think any political analysis from now on must progress.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And if you sort of look at the broad currents along which people vote, you know, what really

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:49.640
[Amit Varma]: happened around 89 and the 91 in that phase was that the two big issues that dominated

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:53.280
[Amit Varma]: Indian politics became Mandal and Mandir and they completely changed Indian politics.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.680
[Amit Varma]: And you've written a recent piece called Mandal, Mandir and Markets where you talk about sort

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.440
[Amit Varma]: of these three M's.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.740
[Amit Varma]: And I remember I think right after the election, I think it was Shekhar Gupta who wrote a piece

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:07.720
[Amit Varma]: where he said that there's another M which has completely surpassed all these M's, which

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.720
[Amit Varma]: is Modi.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:14.620
[Amit Varma]: And his point really was that Mandal and Mandir are now irrelevant.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.320
[Amit Varma]: This is a Modi thing.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.640
[Amit Varma]: And again, I believe there's some amount of data by Milan Vaishnava among others, which

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:28.640
[Amit Varma]: backs up that a lot of people sort of, a lot less people would have voted for the BJP in

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:34.240
[Amit Varma]: 2014, at least if Modi had not been the PM candidate.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.720
[Amit Varma]: How do you view this evolution of why people vote?

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:42.360
[Amit Varma]: Are Mandal and Mandir and perhaps Markets still important reasons why people vote or

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.400
[Amit Varma]: is it a very personality driven thing now?

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.720
[Guest]: See, we were talking about it in the early part of the podcast, which is where you have

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:55.720
[Guest]: to sort of realize how much to read into the data which you have now when surveys say that

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.920
[Guest]: half of the people who voted for the BJP would probably not have voted for the BJP had Modi

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.200
[Guest]: not been the prime ministerial candidate.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.400
[Guest]: We have to understand what is it that Modi brings to the BJP.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.080
[Guest]: I mean, it is not that people like his face and vote for him.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.640
[Guest]: I mean, it can't be.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.080
[Guest]: I think Narendra Modi today probably is the not only is the biggest mass leader in this

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:20.640
[Guest]: country, he and under him the kind of BJP leadership which is developing.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:27.000
[Guest]: They are also people who are deeply convinced about what their core politics should be.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.560
[Guest]: So my generation, Narendra Modi is somebody now look at it from the BJP's point of view,

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:35.240
[Guest]: say a core BJP voter driven by Hindutva, etc.

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:39.680
[Guest]: Now, a lot of liberals actually try to turn 2002 against Narendra Modi.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.640
[Guest]: Now, Narendra Modi has never gone on the defensive with that.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:47.640
[Guest]: I think that plays a role in the psyche of the core BJP voter.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.160
[Amit Varma]: That's a feature, not a bug.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.760
[Guest]: He would never desert Narendra Modi because he stood the test of the time.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.400
[Guest]: He's not somebody like a Lalkrishna Adwani who went to Jinnah's mausoleum and did what

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.400
[Guest]: he did.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.840
[Guest]: Similarly, there are a lot of other things.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.200
[Guest]: For example, you know, this entire thing, you know, we do not we did not have a 2002

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:09.080
[Guest]: unlike before the 2004 elections, we did not even have 2003 Muzaffarnagar unlike what happened

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:14.040
[Guest]: before the 2014 elections, which is what I've sort of argued in my Mandir Mandal Markets

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.040
[Guest]: piece.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.640
[Guest]: Now, does that mean that there was no communal polarization before these elections?

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:26.040
[Guest]: Look at things that what is happening in Kashmir today, you know, 370, 35A, these are matters

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.760
[Guest]: of great detail.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.960
[Guest]: These are matters of constitutional integrity.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.160
[Guest]: What is the special status of Kashmir?

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:36.160
[Guest]: If Kashmir does not have a constituent assembly, can you even remove these articles?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.860
[Guest]: If you were to do away with Article 370, will Kashmir technically be bound to be a part

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:41.860
[Guest]: of India?

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.160
[Guest]: We can debate ad nauseum about these things.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:51.000
[Guest]: But when a political party goes to a hinterland constituency in say, Eastern UP or Bihar,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.460
[Guest]: and poses this question that those who want 370 to stay are actually aiding and abetting

01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:01.160
[Guest]: the cause of separatists in Kashmir, I think it makes an extremely powerful impact on the

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.160
[Guest]: voter.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.440
[Guest]: When you go out and say that, you know, we are bringing the citizenship amendment bill

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.720
[Guest]: and all Hindus who are persecuted in say, Pakistan or Bangladesh or Afghanistan would

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.720
[Guest]: be granted a citizenship of this country, I think you are making a very powerful point.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.560
[Guest]: Your core politics like it was in 2002, even today is intact.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.760
[Guest]: And I think the voter gets those messages.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:27.520
[Guest]: When you say that because Rahul Gandhi is contesting from Wayanad, which is a Muslim

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.960
[Guest]: majority seat, it basically means that the Congress is only looking at Muslim votes in

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.640
[Guest]: the 2019 elections.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.240
[Guest]: It makes a very powerful point.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.640
[Guest]: When the Prime Minister of India goes to a Gujarat election campaign and says that a

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.560
[Guest]: former Prime Minister of India actually conspired with Pakistan to get him killed, you know,

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.760
[Guest]: it's beyond the pale, but it strikes a chord.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:54.960
[Guest]: So I think it is the BJP today has mastered the art of keeping the communal pot simmering

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.720
[Guest]: without there being any large precipitation.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.960
[Guest]: They would not have a Muzaffarnagar on their hands, they will not have a Godhra, Gujarat,

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.760
[Guest]: Ahmedabad, Naroda party on their hands, but the pot is still simmering.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.440
[Guest]: So if we were to go back to the social science analogy, the BJP has actually mastered the

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.160
[Guest]: art of keeping the swimming pool empty.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.000
[Guest]: So the only people who jump in the swimming pool will be people of their own choosing.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.520
[Guest]: I think this has been a miserable failure of the opposition on that.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.320
[Guest]: And this is something I say from a lot of personal experience.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.440
[Guest]: I think it was in standard one when Lakhrishna Advani started a Ramshila Poojan Yatra, 89

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.480
[Guest]: was when the Bhagarpur riots happened in Bihar.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.960
[Guest]: I mean, I remember our school was closed for a month because of communal tension.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.360
[Guest]: Since then, the Hindu right wing has never stopped its own propaganda.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.640
[Guest]: Sometimes it's Ayodhya, sometimes it will be Labh Jihad and right now it could be 370.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.280
[Guest]: They kept changing whatever suits them to do.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:50.720
[Guest]: The other side, on the other hand, always thought that the way to deal with it was not

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.600
[Guest]: to take it head on, but sort of build bypasses around it.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.600
[Guest]: So in Bihar, Lalu Yadav built what is now famously referred to as an MY equation.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.640
[Guest]: I have the Muslims which are captive because anyway, they can't vote for the BJP.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.400
[Guest]: I'll get the Yadavs along and here in a first post the past system, I have this invincible

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:10.080
[Guest]: target vote share level of say 36%, which is enough to beat everybody else.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.920
[Guest]: Narendra Modi and Amit Shah today are proving that that is not going to be enough because

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.120
[Guest]: we'll surpass 50% in each and every state.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.240
[Guest]: That is the next level they've taken in the politics.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:27.040
[Guest]: So I think it is extremely important to realize what the success of the present leadership

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.160
[Amit Varma]: of the BJP is.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:33.040
[Amit Varma]: And it also seems to me that there's an apparent contradiction there which bewilders me.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.960
[Amit Varma]: So on one hand, I completely agree with you that a lot of the support for Modi is not

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.800
[Amit Varma]: necessarily because of his personality and all of that, but because he stands for a vision

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.520
[Amit Varma]: and an ideology which people feel deeply.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:51.400
[Amit Varma]: But also it is true that just as the BJP has an ideological purity, which no other party

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:55.840
[Amit Varma]: has because other parties don't really stand for something which is as powerful within

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:01.280
[Amit Varma]: Indian culture, but also a parallel strand of the BJP political movement in the last

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:07.560
[Amit Varma]: few years has been a will to power perhaps, you know, led by the political strategy of

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Amit Shah, where he almost does a mergers and acquisitions things where you're always

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.320
[Amit Varma]: constantly acquiring people from other parties, right?

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.600
[Amit Varma]: So you'll go to the Northeast and you'll acquire people and Gujarat elections or Goa elections,

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.240
[Amit Varma]: whatever happens, you'll acquire some people and you'll do whatever.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.480
[Amit Varma]: And that seems almost contradictory to this because on the one hand, you stand for ideological

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480
[Amit Varma]: purity.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:32.240
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you're bringing in people you opposed and who opposed you very

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.840
[Amit Varma]: strongly into your fold.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And almost like saying that, okay, we'll be this broad umbrella, you know, and it's been

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.600
[Amit Varma]: very successful for them both in terms of bringing other politicians into the party

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.640
[Amit Varma]: and managing to form governments and so on and decimating the opposition.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.720
[Amit Varma]: It's also that broadening of their typical social base has also been successful in terms

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.480
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, for example, famously getting non-Yadav OBCs in UP, non-Jatav Dalits and

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:03.080
[Amit Varma]: in fact, they now, you know, in both elections, they've had a larger share of the Dalit vote

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.360
[Amit Varma]: than the Congress has.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.080
[Amit Varma]: Is there a sort of a contradiction here that on one hand, it stands for this firm kind

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:12.640
[Amit Varma]: of ideological purity and on the other hand, it's just taking in everybody?

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.800
[Guest]: I'll go back to my earlier avatar as a political activist and not a journalist.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.840
[Guest]: I think this is what politics is.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:24.600
[Guest]: Day to day politics, especially in a country which is as diverse as India and as big as

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:30.960
[Guest]: India, it can never be adhering to a text cast in stone.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.360
[Guest]: Politics in India always has to be about and it will be about handling contradictions.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.800
[Guest]: So if the BJP can handle its contradictions in Goa, it'll have a field run.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.520
[Guest]: The BJP could not handle its contradiction in Kashmir, so the government fell.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:49.760
[Guest]: I think politicians, and this is where persons become important, because sometimes, you know,

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760
[Guest]: it could depend on just one person.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.160
[Guest]: So it took an Atal Bihari Vajpayee to run an NDA coalition for that.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.640
[Guest]: I think if the BJP today had those kinds of numbers, nobody would do business with Narendra

01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.640
[Guest]: Modi.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.520
[Guest]: It is only because Narendra Modi has the majority that people know, JDU with all their reservations,

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.280
[Guest]: I don't know how they're going to vote on the triple talaq bill today, but they'll stay

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280
[Guest]: with the NDA.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.200
[Amit Varma]: So I think that is where the art of handling contradictions

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.080
[Guest]: becomes extremely important.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.680
[Guest]: And that is where the rest of the opposition has absolutely no idea what to do.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:23.840
[Guest]: I mean, look at Bihar, for example, now, I'm from JNU, so I have a bias.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.820
[Guest]: So Kanhaiya went and contested Begusarai.

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:30.120
[Guest]: He actually came second, whereas the RJD candidate came third.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.840
[Guest]: But Tejasvi Yadav, you know, he was in charge of things.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.760
[Guest]: He could not even give that one Lok Sabha seat to Kanhaiya.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.760
[Guest]: Look at the BJP.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.520
[Guest]: I mean, it gave an equal number of seats to the Janata Dal United.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.240
[Guest]: Now we all know that the BJP did not need to do that.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.840
[Guest]: Look at what they've done to the Shiv Sena.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.480
[Guest]: Amit Shah went to Uddhav Thackeray's house to sort of accommodate, placate Uddhav Thackeray.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.320
[Guest]: No, no, you have to stay with us.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.600
[Guest]: I think this is something, you know, you might think that the BJP leadership, you know, a

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.320
[Guest]: lot of people say that, you know, they are all fundamentalist and very, you know, sort

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320
[Guest]: of predatory in nature, etc.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.960
[Guest]: But I think behind this so-called strong face of the BJP leadership, which people like Narendra

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.240
[Guest]: Modi and Amit Shah sort of display, I think they also bring with them a lot of flexibility

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.680
[Guest]: in day-to-day politics, a lot of commitment to protect their core ideology, even while

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.160
[Guest]: doing all these compromises.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.160
[Guest]: And a lot of the electoral success with the BJP has had in this country in the recent

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.560
[Guest]: past is also because of that.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.080
[Guest]: It is not just ideology.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.520
[Guest]: They are doing, you know, the BJP might oppose beef-eating in say, Uttar Pradesh or Bihar,

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.160
[Guest]: but they would go to the Northeast and say that you please go ahead, eat your beef, we

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.320
[Guest]: have absolutely no problems with you.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.200
[Guest]: They are doing business with the Christians in Kerala.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.600
[Guest]: They made a minister who comes from the Christian community in the state, they have absolutely

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600
[Guest]: no problems with beef-eating.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.840
[Guest]: So the BJP today is not only the most ideologically convinced party in this country, it is also

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.800
[Guest]: the most flexible and pragmatic party in the country when it comes to political praxis.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.680
[Amit Varma]: So let's say it practices all this flexible politics as a means to an end, which is to

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.880
[Amit Varma]: come to power.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:02.000
[Amit Varma]: But when it comes to power, its core supporters would expect it to carry, to do something

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.280
[Amit Varma]: about their ideology, whether it's Mandir Banao or Bank House Rotter or Build a Hindu

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.280
[Amit Varma]: Rashtra.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.920
[Amit Varma]: So where do you sort of see it going?

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Like what is the future?

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Do you just keep the circle going where, you know, your means to an end is again, coming

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.700
[Amit Varma]: to power is an end in itself?

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.760
[Amit Varma]: Is that where it continues going?

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:22.320
[Amit Varma]: Or does it actually start acting upon some of this and we go in those without casting

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.360
[Amit Varma]: a value judgment on those directions, like, forget whether Hindu Rashtra is desirable

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.920
[Amit Varma]: or not, or whether we should build a temple or not.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.640
[Guest]: But so there are two ways about it.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:37.360
[Guest]: One is, you know, people who are more Christian than the Pope within the BJP ranks, if you

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.960
[Guest]: want to use that phrase, what do they do when the government doesn't deliver?

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:47.160
[Guest]: Now, they either have a choice of going and floating something which is, you know, even

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:51.200
[Guest]: to the right of say the BJP, or they have the choice of going and doing business with

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.200
[Guest]: the opposition.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.880
[Guest]: So like I said, you know, the Babri Masjid, the farmer angry with the BJP example, I think

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.520
[Guest]: both of these cases happen.

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:02.560
[Guest]: So we have that farmer in Madhya Pradesh, who actually went and took part in demolishing

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.760
[Guest]: the Babri Mosque, but voted for the Congress.

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.640
[Guest]: We have somebody like a Praveen Togadia, who my generation has always associated as the

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.280
[Guest]: most rabid right wing political voice in the country, who actually has been who was trying

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:15.800
[Guest]: to criticize Modi and sort of cause some political damage, none of it happened.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.880
[Amit Varma]: And back when Modi was CM of Gujarat, he had actually sidelined Togadia.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.840
[Guest]: So I think both of these trends will continue.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:28.080
[Guest]: But what I think is how it works is a large part of that political spectrum, which actually

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.240
[Guest]: concurs with the worldview of the BJP today, also thinks that if this government were not

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.000
[Guest]: to be in power, they would actually be worse off.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.680
[Guest]: So with all the reservations, which they might have, they actually think that it is in their

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.640
[Guest]: interest to sort of continue investing in this regime.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.040
[Amit Varma]: And let's kind of move on from the BJP to the opposition.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:53.640
[Amit Varma]: And you recently wrote a piece about how Rahul Gandhi's analysis of why they lost the elections

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640
[Amit Varma]: is completely wrong.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.360
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate on that a bit?

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.720
[Guest]: So if one were to very crudely summarize Rahul Gandhi's letter, it basically meant that the

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.360
[Guest]: Congress should be doing more of what it was already doing.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.920
[Guest]: I don't think that helps.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.100
[Guest]: No, the biggest reason it doesn't help is because the Congress actually won those three

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:16.840
[Guest]: states, you know, in December 2018, and in less than six months, it ended up losing all

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:17.840
[Guest]: of them.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.280
[Guest]: So it can't just be organization in my view, it can't be the case that your activists were

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.220
[Guest]: actually delivering six months ago, and today they can't.

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:27.880
[Guest]: The question is, what do you do about it?

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:33.880
[Guest]: I think one part of it is you have absolutely no idea how to build a constructive effective

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.980
[Guest]: critique of this government's economic limitations.

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.360
[Guest]: And there are many, I personally believe that.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.060
[Guest]: So you actually do not know what to go and talk to whom.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:45.880
[Guest]: The second thing is, I think the Congress and which is where I focus a large part of

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.600
[Guest]: my piece on is the Congress has no idea how to take care of this Hindu polarization business.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.080
[Guest]: They actually want to be seen as Hindus, which reflects in the temple visits and whatnot

01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:00.120
[Guest]: done by especially the two active politicians from the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:06.360
[Guest]: in these elections and before these elections, but they don't know how they should be doing

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.360
[Guest]: it.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.800
[Guest]: Because like I argued in this piece, it is not enough for you if you want to counter

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.520
[Guest]: the BJP politically to be seen as pro-Hindu.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:21.420
[Guest]: There would be moments in the campaign in before an election where the BJP would actually

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:28.600
[Guest]: portray itself as either explicitly or not so explicitly anti-Muslim.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.960
[Guest]: So when you say you would implement NRC in the entire country, I mean, people understand

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.040
[Guest]: what you're hinting at.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.480
[Guest]: You basically hinting at the fact that there are a lot of Bangladeshi Muslims in this country

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.600
[Guest]: who could actually be West Bengali Muslims and you would deport them.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.600
[Guest]: He would never come to do around to doing that.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.920
[Guest]: But this is something nobody in the opposition can go and champion.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:52.200
[Guest]: When Narendra Modi goes to say Calcutta and says that Mamata Banerjee is preventing us

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:56.600
[Guest]: from implementing NRC here and she's Farooq Abdullah's ally who is preventing us from

01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:01.160
[Guest]: abolishing Article 370 there, which basically helps terrorists, etc.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:06.880
[Guest]: How does the opposition go and deal with this acquisition by the BJP?

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.000
[Guest]: Now can you go to an average villager in say Begusara in Bihar or Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.160
[Guest]: and teach him or her what was the instrument of accession when Kashmir was being annexed

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.400
[Guest]: to our country?

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.200
[Guest]: What happens if article, no, or do you go to people around the country and show them

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:26.920
[Guest]: census data that this is what Bangladeshi infiltration is, this is what the number of

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.280
[Guest]: Bengali speakers in a lot of places is, doesn't work like that.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:35.800
[Guest]: I think, and this is where, you know, cultural intervention becomes very important.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:41.280
[Guest]: This day-to-day primacy of the unidirectional cultural discourse, which has happened in

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:45.280
[Guest]: our country, which the right wing, especially the, you know, which is sort of in concurrence

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.360
[Guest]: with the politics of the BJP has completely, I think, occupied.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.360
[Guest]: How do you deal with it?

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.800
[Guest]: There's absolutely no, there's been no effort by the opposition to take it.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:59.160
[Guest]: Now one part of it can be economic, you know, that actually, you know, religion is the opium

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.720
[Guest]: of the masses and you don't have the job.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:05.880
[Guest]: So basically all this is being sent to, but I think in a country like India, you know,

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:10.760
[Guest]: so this is something Walter Anderson's book on the RSS when it was released, I was invited

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:14.160
[Guest]: to a discussion on the book where Professor Anderson himself was present.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.980
[Guest]: So this is something I said there that actually, you know, a lot of intellectuals in India

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:27.040
[Guest]: criticize the RSS on the basis of the premise that RSS's worldview does not stand intellectual

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.040
[Guest]: scrutiny.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:33.480
[Guest]: We have to understand that the RSS is not an intellectual institution.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:38.440
[Guest]: It does not require intellectual scrutiny and sanctity to sort of propagate its ideas.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.400
[Guest]: It is at the end of the day, a majoritarian religious body, which basically needs to consolidate

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.680
[Guest]: people from its old religion.

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.400
[Guest]: And I said, look at somebody like Mahatma Gandhi.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:54.400
[Guest]: I mean, if you were to intellectually analyze Mahatma Gandhi, I mean, any rational intellectual

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:58.480
[Guest]: would find a 1000 problems with the kind of arguments, political praxis, behavior he indulged

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.000
[Guest]: in, right from his Gram Swaraj to many other things.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.600
[Guest]: But he was the biggest mass leader in our country.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.480
[Guest]: So politics and rationality are two sets where there is a significant union, but not all

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.480
[Guest]: of it is common.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.360
[Guest]: I think the opposition, especially the Congress Party needs to figure out how do you deal

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:19.520
[Guest]: with this, you know, dog whistling, if one could use the term against Muslims in day

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:24.440
[Guest]: to day politics by the BJP, especially during elections, what do you do about it?

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.960
[Guest]: Unless they have an answer to this question, which I'm pretty sure they do not have because

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.120
[Guest]: the only thing they could figure out was going to temples, they are going to have a very

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.480
[Amit Varma]: difficult time in dealing with the BJP.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.020
[Amit Varma]: And what you just said a couple of thoughts strike me about the Congress.

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:41.040
[Amit Varma]: One is that if you go back to the history of the Congress, you'll find that pre independence

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.240
[Amit Varma]: and even for a few years after independence, a Congress within it had genuine Hindu nationalist

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.680
[Amit Varma]: leaders of nature.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Madan Mohan Malviya founded Banaras Hindu University.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And at the time, you know, you had at the time of independence, Sardar Patel was there,

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.720
[Amit Varma]: Govind Vallabh Pant was the CM of UP, Lal Bahadur Shastri was a Home Minister of UP.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:03.200
[Amit Varma]: In fact, both of them were in charge when the Ram Idol was installed in Ayodhya.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.960
[Amit Varma]: And I think 49 and Nehru said remove it and they obfuscated and they denied it.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.840
[Amit Varma]: So you had these Hindu nationalist leaders whom Hindus could take seriously.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.400
[Amit Varma]: Today, there are no leaders like that within the Congress for good or for bad and all of

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.740
[Amit Varma]: what they do like Rahul Gandhi going to Kedarnath is frankly just very obvious posturing.

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:24.600
[Amit Varma]: You can only sort of just laugh at that.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And I totally agree with what you also earlier said about how you cannot hug back to the

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.800
[Amit Varma]: politics like one point that I keep making about the Congress and the BJP, the contrast

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:40.240
[Amit Varma]: between them and this is actually a criticism of both in a sense, is that the Congress behaves

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.600
[Amit Varma]: as if history began in 2014.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.120
[Amit Varma]: So they will constantly talk about all that has gone wrong since 2014 and a lot has so

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.480
[Amit Varma]: all of that criticism is completely valid.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.920
[Amit Varma]: But they will ignore their own sins of the past.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:57.120
[Amit Varma]: And they will ignore that voters have turned to Modi and rejected them because of the misgovernance

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.840
[Amit Varma]: of decades and you know, not only will they not engage with that, they will promise the

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:07.160
[Amit Varma]: same kind of policies and the same kind of visions for the future, which has already

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:10.680
[Amit Varma]: and correctly, in my view, been rejected by the nation.

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.920
[Amit Varma]: And the BJP is a converse of that where they behave as if history ended at 2014.

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.680
[Amit Varma]: So what Modi did in the last five years is irrelevant.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.680
[Guest]: Everything is Nehru's fault.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:23.200
[Guest]: No, I would actually you know, I was like, I think it is a Congress which believes that

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.200
[Guest]: history.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.400
[Guest]: I think that the Congress actually thinks that we are still not in 2014.

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.400
[Guest]: Okay, we haven't.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:33.520
[Guest]: They have a sense of political entitlement, which I think makes them think that the Congress

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:38.280
[Guest]: still should be the default choice of the people in this country.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.680
[Guest]: Now, 14, there was a question whether it was a one off thing or not.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.180
[Guest]: But I think between 14 and 19, now we know that that is not going to be the case.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:51.280
[Guest]: So the Congress Party has to realize that and if the Congress Party actually wants to

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.520
[Guest]: regain its stature as the default political choice of the people in our country, it has

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.480
[Guest]: to completely reinvent not just its organization, but also its politics.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.640
[Guest]: So there was a phase in Indian politics which lasted, you know, one could say from Nehru

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.920
[Guest]: till the emergency was one phase, then post emergency was a very turbulent phase.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.600
[Guest]: Then we had this relative degree of stability, I think post 14, we have entered into a completely

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.480
[Amit Varma]: new phase, the Congress has to realize that.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:18.600
[Amit Varma]: And is there a way out of it for them?

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:22.160
[Amit Varma]: Both in terms of realistically, is there a way out of it given what the organization

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:27.780
[Amit Varma]: is today, and and the near feudal capture and the erosion of the organization itself?

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.720
[Amit Varma]: And also that if they is there a way out of it?

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.640
[Amit Varma]: Is there a potential hypothetical way out of it just in terms of narrative?

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.920
[Amit Varma]: Because the question that you yourself asked, how do you counter this dominant narrative?

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.760
[Amit Varma]: It's obviously not by you know, going harking back to the past, but then how?

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.480
[Guest]: I think it's a two step problem.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.840
[Guest]: Now, let us go back to the example of Narendra Modi.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.680
[Guest]: Narendra Modi comes from an extremely ordinary family in this country.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.920
[Guest]: The kind of political choices he made when he made them to become a swamsevak, I mean,

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:03.240
[Guest]: despite being married, not have a family life, etc.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.360
[Guest]: I think even in his wildest dreams, he would never have imagined that he would end up being

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.080
[Guest]: where he is today.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.920
[Guest]: You have to give it to him.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.920
[Guest]: Let us come back to the Congress now.

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.840
[Guest]: An average Congress person, you know, who's entrained in the leadership, say, if we were

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.320
[Guest]: to look at top 20,000 people in the Congress organization in this country, if they were

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.980
[Guest]: asked to explain, why is it politically that they are with the Congress Party?

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:34.640
[Guest]: And if you were to exclude say religious minorities in our country, because they have a vested

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.280
[Guest]: interest in promoting a political force, which is by and large secular in its outlook.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.960
[Guest]: Now, the Congress has made those compromises with secularism, but we know that they are

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.360
[Guest]: programmatically completely different from what the BJP is.

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:50.600
[Guest]: If you were to ask those 10,000 people who come from the majority religious community

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.560
[Guest]: Hindus in this country, why are you in the Congress Party?

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.680
[Guest]: I think all of them would struggle very hard to come up with a coherent answer.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.040
[Guest]: That would not be the case.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.960
[Guest]: I would not say it so much about the BJP, but at least with the RSS in this country.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.660
[Guest]: I mean, you might disagree with their worldview or agree with it, but they will tell you exactly

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:11.720
[Guest]: why they are in the RSS and why they would be in the RSS, why they would sort of get

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:12.720
[Guest]: people.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720
[Guest]: So that is the basic problem.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:18.880
[Guest]: I think, I mean, you have to have, now there is that material basis, if you want to enter

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.880
[Guest]: into politics, you do some real estate, you get some more money here.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.240
[Guest]: That is how we know local politics, that is how it operates in the entire country today.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.760
[Guest]: The scale might differ depending on how developed your capitalism is.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.600
[Guest]: But the subjective question regarding politics, I think, and this is a crisis not just of

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.480
[Guest]: the Congress, but also of the left today in our country.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:42.760
[Guest]: I mean, if you were to go to JNU, recruit somebody, say, you know, become a part of

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:43.760
[Guest]: the SFI.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.760
[Guest]: Why?

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.760
[Guest]: I mean, there's not going to be a revolution.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.520
[Guest]: I don't think any communist leader in this country believes that there's going to be

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520
[Guest]: a revolution in the world.

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:54.320
[Guest]: I mean, you used to have a government in West Bengal, which notwithstanding all its problems

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.080
[Guest]: had a very glorious track record in terms of basic land distribution, etc.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.920
[Guest]: That doesn't hold today.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.560
[Guest]: So why should I join the left?

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.080
[Guest]: I mean, in your party program, you still say that North Korea is a socialist country, you

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:10.320
[Guest]: still say that China is a socialist country today, you know, despite of all the problems

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.680
[Guest]: which are happening in Venezuela, and I think Chavez did some good things and certain things

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.540
[Guest]: have came back to bite the regime.

01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:22.940
[Guest]: But you if you continue to celebrate those things, then where do you draw the moral grandstanding

01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:29.360
[Guest]: from to be able to attract bright intellectual people into your folds, who would then be

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.880
[Guest]: willing to make a certain amount of individual sacrifice to sort of further your political

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.920
[Guest]: cause because Narendra Modi made a certain amount of political sacrifice very early in

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:38.920
[Guest]: his political career.

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.280
[Guest]: Amit Shah comes from a very wealthy businessman family.

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.960
[Guest]: So I think, you know, we might have a lot of disagreements with him, but he made a certain

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.600
[Guest]: amount of political sacrifice to give time and resources to the BJP.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.120
[Guest]: And that was the case the entire generation, the socialist leadership of this country from

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:58.640
[Guest]: Nitish Kumar to Lalu Yadav to everybody else, all of them made political sacrifices during

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:03.640
[Guest]: the anti-emergency struggle, they were put in jail, they faced a lot of state atrocity.

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:09.920
[Guest]: Now, all of those acts, I do not think can be, you know, a product of purely Machiavellian

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.400
[Guest]: consideration that I have to do well in politics, hence I have to do that.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.580
[Guest]: I don't think that is the case.

01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:18.960
[Guest]: So there was a degree of romanticism, subjectivism, etc.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.200
[Guest]: As far as the larger thing is concerned, and this is far more difficult here, because a

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.480
[Guest]: with no liberalization, etc.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.220
[Guest]: People who study in elite institutions, I think people like us have a lot more opportunities

01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:33.000
[Guest]: in front of us than what people in the 70s or 80s had.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.760
[Guest]: I mean, if you are really, you know, bright, you have the world to conquer, right from

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.480
[Guest]: here to the United States to everywhere.

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:45.840
[Guest]: Two, I mean, because there's so much, you know, for example, you know, somebody in Delhi

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:50.960
[Guest]: who goes to a private school today, a group private school goes to a good public or say,

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:54.200
[Guest]: you know, went to Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, you went to Ashoka University, you came back

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:59.280
[Guest]: with a PhD, you would have absolutely no idea of what the common people think in this country

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.280
[Guest]: because you've never engaged with them.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:05.680
[Guest]: So the kind of class ghettoization, which is, you know, being imposed, even if inadvertently

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:10.680
[Guest]: on you, I mean, how do you build a connect with the masses, I think these are very serious

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:15.360
[Guest]: sociological economic questions, which people from the opposition, I think.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:19.960
[Guest]: So when Narendra Modi makes that critique about Rahul Gandhi of him being entitled part

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:20.960
[Guest]: of it is true.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.380
[Guest]: I mean, it is not it is it is purely an accident of birth and Rahul Gandhi is not to blame

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.460
[Guest]: for it.

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:31.100
[Guest]: But the kind of India Rahul Gandhi or Narendra Modi would have seen are very different.

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.960
[Guest]: Now Rahul Gandhi tried bringing those kind of people in the organization.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:39.720
[Guest]: But I think unless you have a subjective factor, unless you have a robust critique of you know,

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:44.080
[Guest]: what the BJP stands for as a Hindu party, if you can offer a better alternative to that,

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:47.080
[Guest]: I think it will be very difficult to build an alternative going on from here, either

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.400
[Guest]: for the Congress or anybody else.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.520
[Amit Varma]: Quick note for my listeners, he mentioned Venezuela, I did have an episode on Venezuela

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.880
[Amit Varma]: as well, which will be linked from the show notes.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:31:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Would it be fair to sum up your point by saying that the point that you're making is that

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:05.560
[Amit Varma]: if you look at Narendra Modi's trajectory, he is here today because he joined a party,

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.280
[Amit Varma]: a political party, which wasn't doing so well at the time.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:12.200
[Amit Varma]: So he didn't join it for the lust for power, but because of a deep ideological belief with

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:17.680
[Amit Varma]: whatever the core vision of the party was, and that drove him and many others like him.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.940
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, you see the one person who got to the top to actually form the backbone

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.320
[Amit Varma]: of the BJP.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:27.240
[Amit Varma]: And if someone joins the Congress or the left now, what is that vision which is being sold

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.520
[Amit Varma]: at one point of time, that vision used to be there.

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:35.240
[Amit Varma]: No, and you know what you said about Rahul Gandhi and the entitlement and you know, the

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:39.120
[Amit Varma]: class barrier also reminds me of, you know, Mahua Mitra, who's very much the flavor of

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.520
[Amit Varma]: the town right now gave a recent interview where she said she was once in the Congress,

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:48.280
[Amit Varma]: as you know, in the youth wing or such like, and she was there for some time.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:53.560
[Amit Varma]: And then she left and she she left because a there was sexism, she wasn't being taken

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:58.520
[Amit Varma]: seriously because she was a woman be she found that even regardless of gender, there was

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:03.680
[Amit Varma]: a ceiling and you needed to be to have some political backing to get ahead of it.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.280
[Amit Varma]: And in a party like that, which suffers from that kind of feudal mindset, you're really

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:12.160
[Amit Varma]: not going to rise up the ranks and someone like a Narendra Modi from an OBC background

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.680
[Amit Varma]: and you know, from the kind of poor background where he came isn't going to rise up a party

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.680
[Amit Varma]: like that.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.200
[Amit Varma]: And that's that's sort of something that

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.680
[Guest]: Congress is not the only such party, a lot of these regional parties, including Mitra's

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:28.040
[Guest]: own party, we know that it is not run on what exactly can be termed as democratic principles.

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.040
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.880
[Guest]: So I did not go into these details, because we are talking about larger issues.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:36.560
[Guest]: So if you want to take BJP's ideology head on, you have to have an ideological affinity

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:42.640
[Guest]: for your own political project, which can't be ridiculing everything which is Hindutva.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.640
[Amit Varma]: It can't just be opposition.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.360
[Amit Varma]: You can't stand for something, you can't put off people.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.440
[Guest]: I mean, this is something the opposition doesn't understand.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:52.400
[Guest]: I mean, just because you do not like Narendra Modi, you cannot ridicule that he's going

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.600
[Guest]: to be on this discovery show.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.760
[Guest]: It doesn't help your political cause, let me be as blunt as that.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.620
[Guest]: The pro-BJP people actually enjoy those things.

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:04.480
[Guest]: You have to have a more substantive, material, effective critique.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:10.040
[Amit Varma]: And also just because someone is pro-BJP doesn't mean that he can't stick to those sort of

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.480
[Amit Varma]: beliefs which make him pro-BJP but still find a reason to support you.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.560
[Amit Varma]: For example, so I'm just throwing a thought at you, tell me what you think.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.600
[Amit Varma]: I think that you can't categorize people very simply.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:23.800
[Amit Varma]: We all contain multitudes and there might be an individual who is a believing Hindu

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:26.160
[Amit Varma]: and who believes in the BJP project.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:30.200
[Amit Varma]: But he might also have liberal instincts and he believes in free speech and he might also

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.760
[Amit Varma]: believe in free markets or whatever.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:37.720
[Amit Varma]: We are a bundle of impulses and what the BJP political project has very successfully done

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.920
[Amit Varma]: is appeal to one aspect of their belief systems.

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.380
[Amit Varma]: And for that reason, they support BJP.

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:49.800
[Amit Varma]: But you know, it is still nevertheless, I would believe possible for other parties to

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:56.680
[Amit Varma]: appeal to other aspects of their beliefs and whatever, you know, very complex multifaceted

01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.440
[Amit Varma]: worldviews are and draw some of that support away.

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Now given that a lot of the work that you do, which deals with data is like any political

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.880
[Amit Varma]: data is also in its nature, I would guess social data.

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.000
[Guest]: What would your thoughts be on this observation?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.120
[Guest]: You're exactly right.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:18.960
[Guest]: This was in 2016, I guess, CSDS Lokniti, which is among the few credible political research

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.400
[Guest]: institutes in our country, they did a survey of youth.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.440
[Guest]: So they had this questionnaire, they went along to everybody.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:27.280
[Guest]: One of the questions in the questionnaire was which political party do you support?

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:31.920
[Guest]: There were a host of other questions, you know, ranging from do you support eating beef

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:38.560
[Guest]: to you know, whether somebody who consumes alcohol should be your neighbor, etc, etc.

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:43.480
[Guest]: When we ran cross task, what it shows was that apart from the question of eating beef,

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:47.080
[Guest]: there was by and large complete political concurrence among supporters of different political

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:50.400
[Guest]: parties, whether you supported the BJP or the Congress or anybody else, there was absolutely

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.400
[Guest]: no difference.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:57.840
[Guest]: So your sociological beliefs, you know, your behavioral beliefs, I think are more or less

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.600
[Guest]: shaped by your socialization rather than anything else, rather than which political party do

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.600
[Guest]: you support.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.400
[Guest]: If you were to go to say, South Bombay, and if you were to go to Gaya, the place I come

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:11.360
[Guest]: from, I mean, what is acceptable socially and what is not acceptable socially would

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.000
[Guest]: probably be very different.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.920
[Guest]: And you cannot brand the person living in say, South Bombay or Gaya and be that as may

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:22.760
[Guest]: in either cases, as being prejudiced or biased, or I think social change has to be something

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:28.080
[Guest]: which you consistently strive for, which is where no, I think, you know, take lynchings,

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:34.280
[Guest]: for example, what is the by and by now the established liberal reaction to lynchings?

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:37.960
[Guest]: Something happens, I think both you and I agree that it is completely unfortunate.

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:40.800
[Guest]: Then you have a protest here in Delhi, etc.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.560
[Guest]: Where is the preemptive political effort to prevent such things from happening?

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.160
[Guest]: Has the opposition done a campaign?

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.640
[Guest]: Now, some people like Harsh Mandar, etc, have tried to do it, but they are individuals.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.480
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, you can't have that kind of an impact.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.480
[Guest]: If you want to prevent a religious polarization in this country, where is the preemptive political

01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.320
[Guest]: effort to do that?

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:03.480
[Guest]: I mean, it is extremely convenient for a bunch of political actors to come out everything

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:06.480
[Guest]: ex post after say this thing has happened, where's the ex ante effort?

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.480
[Guest]: I don't see that.

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.560
[Guest]: Then how can you go and say that, you know, people people are becoming bigger, they don't

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.560
[Guest]: listen to us.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.840
[Guest]: I think that's that's intellectual and political lethargy.

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:19.440
[Amit Varma]: So we've spoken about the BJP, we've spoken about the Congress.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's speak about the left because you've been a man of the left yourself.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:26.200
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sure what has happened over the last few years must pain you, though it doesn't

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.480
[Amit Varma]: pain me, but I'm sure it must pain you.

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.920
[Amit Varma]: Is the left dead?

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.040
[Amit Varma]: What did they do wrong?

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.680
[Guest]: What happened?

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:38.760
[Guest]: The political left as we knew it, I see it very difficult that it will revive.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:41.560
[Guest]: I don't think that's going to happen.

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.080
[Guest]: Now, has it all happened in the same way?

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.120
[Guest]: No, let us take the Bengal and Kerala examples, the two states where left was actually very

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.520
[Guest]: strong.

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:53.480
[Guest]: The Bengal thing, I think is a classic case of complete ideological disarray, because

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.760
[Guest]: you ultimately ended up I mean, I think there's been a lot of serious academic work, there

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:01.200
[Guest]: were a lot of problems with, you know, the left front government when it was in power.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:05.640
[Guest]: If you look at the social indicators, etc, Dwaipayan Bhattacharya, who is a professor

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.440
[Guest]: of political science in JNU has written a very good book, you know, it's, it's called

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:15.280
[Guest]: governance as practice, how left got consumed in its own contradictions, gives a very powerful

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.280
[Guest]: account of what happened.

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.160
[Guest]: But ultimately, you basically lost power on the question of acquiring land for a handful

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.160
[Guest]: of corporates.

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:25.240
[Guest]: Now, that's the worst way in which a communist party would like to lose power.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:27.180
[Guest]: Let's go to Kerala now.

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:32.520
[Guest]: I think Pinarayi Vijayan's government and the CPIM and the LDF there took a very principled

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.480
[Guest]: position when it came to the question of Sabarimala.

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.920
[Guest]: They were the only political actors in the state, the Congress and the BJP both sort

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.640
[Guest]: of decided against doing it, who stood for the Supreme Court judgment that women of menstruating

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.200
[Guest]: age should be allowed to enter the holy shrine.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.400
[Guest]: I think this electoral loss is a political price for doing that.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.280
[Guest]: Now they have lost from a politically very principled, this is something I think even

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280
[Guest]: you would agree with.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:57.880
[Guest]: But in Tripura, it took a completely different turn.

01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.800
[Guest]: I think somewhere between the Bengali and the tribal contradiction, they lost the plot

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.360
[Guest]: and ended up losing a large amount of tribal vote.

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.280
[Guest]: And once they lost power, it has all led to a meltdown.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.480
[Guest]: So if one were to talk about the electoral decline of the left, I think one has to take

01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:17.360
[Guest]: a heterogeneous view, because each stronghold, how the left lost it, I'm not so sure whether

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.800
[Guest]: they come back in Kerala or not.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:23.120
[Guest]: But let us for a moment assume that there are all different factors.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.600
[Guest]: But the larger factor and a lot of, you know, political leaders in the left like to say,

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.040
[Guest]: but that why should these states be held accountable for the decline of the left?

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.440
[Guest]: What about the rest of the country?

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:36.680
[Guest]: Why did the rest of the party say not support the Bengal party or the Kerala party?

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:40.720
[Guest]: That is where the ideological question I think becomes extremely important.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.440
[Guest]: That what is it you want to mobilize people on?

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:48.080
[Guest]: Now let us look at some progressive legislations which happened during the UPF 1.

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:53.560
[Guest]: The left played a role in all of them, Rural Employment Guarantee, Right to Information,

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.560
[Guest]: Forest Rights Act.

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.920
[Guest]: I think the left had not been supporting the UPF government, these legislations probably

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:00.720
[Guest]: would never have seen the light of the day.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:07.480
[Guest]: Interestingly, the left did not start the agitations for demanding these agitations.

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:10.440
[Guest]: Employment Guarantee started from the Right to Food Campaign.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.960
[Guest]: Right to Information was Aruna Roy, Arvind Kejriwal, a lot of these other people.

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:18.680
[Guest]: Forest Rights Act bill was a lot of tribal organizations, I mean, there were some left

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.880
[Guest]: leaning organizations also.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:25.120
[Guest]: So even these little successes against the Indian state, which you think actually democratize

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:30.120
[Guest]: the state further, tilt the balance if one could say so in favor of the extremely marginalized.

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.560
[Guest]: Now, these are extremely marginalized sections of the society.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.720
[Guest]: The left did not take an initiative on its own.

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.640
[Guest]: Where is the left really strong today, despite all its political setbacks?

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.640
[Guest]: Bank unions, insurance unions, these are the ones, you know, if the public sector bank

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:48.960
[Guest]: unions decide, which are still dominated by the left, they'll bring the banking industry

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:53.640
[Guest]: to a complete standstill in our country, handful of universities, students unions, etc.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:40:00.320
[Guest]: So you actually have a situation where your remaining political capital rests with people

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.640
[Guest]: who are fast becoming marginalized in their own way.

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.680
[Guest]: We know that public sector banking is not going to be the future of banking in this

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680
[Guest]: country.

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.200
[Guest]: Whether the government privatizes banks or not is a different debate.

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:14.760
[Guest]: But 20 years from now, public sector banks would not be what they are today.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:19.280
[Guest]: So between these two extremes, you know, this is something the left exploited early in its

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.280
[Guest]: career, etc.

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:25.800
[Guest]: I mean, it had a lot of ideology, you know, Jyoti Basu was a lawyer educated in England,

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:27.480
[Guest]: he came back and did that politics.

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:32.360
[Guest]: So I mean, we spoke about Narendra Modi, who comes from a very modest family, had very

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.600
[Guest]: little education, and was not successfully professionally otherwise, but became a political

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.600
[Guest]: old timer.

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.560
[Guest]: Now, here is the other extreme Jyoti Basu, who comes from England is educated in England

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:45.960
[Guest]: could have no and all the money in his life, decides to work for a communist party.

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.720
[Guest]: So there was also the other side of the political infatuation, affinity, whatever one might

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.440
[Guest]: choose to call it, it actually, the Bombay film industry at one point of time, today

01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:00.120
[Guest]: people rave and rant about Akshay Kumar supporting Narendra Modi, etc.

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:04.760
[Guest]: I mean, the Communist Party actually had its headquarters in Bombay, the entire Indian

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:08.880
[Guest]: People's Theatre Association, the galaxy of film stars used to work for the left.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:14.320
[Guest]: So how do you regain that ideological, I think, and I can say this with a lot of confidence

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.400
[Guest]: for the left without a larger ideological narrative, left politics cannot have any future

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:20.400
[Guest]: in any society.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:25.360
[Guest]: I mean, your your basic justification for your politics, even today comes from the fact

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:30.280
[Guest]: that there is a established school of analysis in social sciences, which was founded by Marx,

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:34.920
[Guest]: which has been improved upon by a lot of thinkers, because left politics, by definition is a

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.320
[Guest]: scientific way of politics.

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:39.760
[Guest]: And that is what the left likes to claim it is people might have disagreements with it.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.800
[Guest]: So even if you disagree with the left, you say that the basic problem is in the theory,

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:45.580
[Guest]: I mean, it is not that people do it wrong.

01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.960
[Guest]: So the left has to think about going back to the drawing board on that.

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.920
[Guest]: Now, where do you get your people?

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:54.840
[Guest]: You don't have factories, you can't have trade unions, farmer politics, etc.

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.600
[Guest]: You today, even if you were to say that I want to do land reforms, no farmer would come

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:03.320
[Guest]: to you a land has become hopelessly fragmented, be nobody wants to be in farming.

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:04.960
[Guest]: So where do you draw your ranks from?

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.480
[Guest]: I think is a very important question.

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:10.000
[Guest]: This is a question which is not very easy to answer.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.200
[Guest]: But the existing leadership of the left, I don't think has even made an attempt to answer

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.200
[Amit Varma]: that question.

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:18.120
[Amit Varma]: And what strikes me and obviously, I don't know the left as deeply as you do.

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.920
[Amit Varma]: So feel free to sort of tell me if you disagree.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.880
[Amit Varma]: But what also strikes me is that these sort of theoretical debates that you speak of are

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.960
[Amit Varma]: something that might be happening in academic circles, but how does a common man think of

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:29.960
[Amit Varma]: the left?

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:33.120
[Amit Varma]: And why has the left gained traction wherever it has with the common man?

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.080
[Amit Varma]: And the reason partly is, of course, a reaction against an oppressive state.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:41.880
[Amit Varma]: And apart from that, a certain sort of pro poor rhetoric that you know, the rich are

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:46.000
[Amit Varma]: exploiting you and will, you know, redistribute their wealth a little bit and will make society

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.120
[Amit Varma]: more equal.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:51.800
[Amit Varma]: But what seems to have happened in recent times is that that narrative has been co opted

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:55.080
[Amit Varma]: by the BJP, like you mentioned the NREGA.

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:59.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the multiple factors, which I have read about from reporters, you

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:04.640
[Amit Varma]: know, I think Parth MN reported on this extensively before the elections, is that a lot of people

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.160
[Amit Varma]: seem to have voted for the BJP because of the social welfare schemes, because of the

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:13.800
[Amit Varma]: delivery, the last minute delivery of the social welfare schemes, sometimes when they

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.960
[Amit Varma]: benefited themselves, and sometimes when they saw others benefiting and said, hey, maybe

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.000
[Amit Varma]: I can also benefit in future.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.120
[Amit Varma]: So that whole pro poor populist narrative has, seems to me to have been co opted by

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.760
[Amit Varma]: the BJP, which then then you wondered at what space in the popular imagination, forget the

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.760
[Amit Varma]: theory, what space in the popular imagination can the left possibly occupy now?

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.960
[Guest]: Well, that's one way to look at it.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.040
[Guest]: But let me pose a counter question, let us say the people voted for the BJP because they

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:44.960
[Guest]: got toilets and houses, Swachh Bharat and this Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, perfectly

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:48.480
[Guest]: all right for people to vote for the BJP in one election.

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:52.680
[Guest]: Is that going to be enough for them to vote for the BJP again, because politics the beauty

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:57.720
[Guest]: of it is it's it's, it's an infinite process, it's not a one off thing.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.320
[Guest]: Now will Narendra Modi give them another toilet and another house?

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.320
[Guest]: Probably not.

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.480
[Guest]: Because there's a limit to the amount of welfarism even this government can do, I mean, you don't

01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:06.200
[Guest]: have those kinds of resources.

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:14.680
[Guest]: So, you know, the question is, you know, can you mobilize people who were given say a one

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:20.360
[Guest]: time asset transfer by a government to demand something more?

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:26.480
[Guest]: If a political party were to start a movement in this country today, that we don't just

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.200
[Guest]: need schools in our country, we need better schools.

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:34.040
[Guest]: There's a lot of talk about this learning outcomes, we need learning outcomes to improve,

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:38.680
[Guest]: no, because children when even when they get out of school after class 10th or 12th, they

01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:42.560
[Guest]: can't speak, they can't write, this is something we directly affects your employability.

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:46.520
[Guest]: I mean, even if you want to, you know, work as an assistant at a grocery shop, the shopkeeper

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:49.880
[Guest]: would expect that you probably do the basic maths and a lot of people find that very difficult

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:50.880
[Amit Varma]: in our country.

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:55.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a small part of the jobs crisis is also the disconnect between the jobs and education.

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.640
[Guest]: It's a large part of the job crisis.

01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.720
[Guest]: I mean, you might have an MPhil degree, but so what I mean, how do you make yourself employable?

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:02.720
[Guest]: What are you good for?

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:03.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.920
[Guest]: Especially in provincial universities, things are really bad.

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.800
[Guest]: syllabi have not been revised for 30-40 years.

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.680
[Guest]: Most of them work with my father teaches in a college in Gaya, so I know, I mean, he has

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.360
[Guest]: to take care of 1000 students with the strength of three teachers.

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:21.920
[Guest]: So I mean, you can't teach it's humanly not possible, you go nuts if you try to do that.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.480
[Guest]: So if a political party were to take that thing, mobilize the youth, I think it could

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.040
[Guest]: lead to results.

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.640
[Guest]: And if the government know to prevent the opposition from winning does it, then that's

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.640
[Guest]: the best case scenario.

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:37.640
[Guest]: I mean, then you've completely sort of radically transformed your education system, which would

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.320
[Guest]: make you use your demographic dividend in a better way.

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:45.120
[Guest]: I think one of the biggest reasons for the problem, whether it is a left etc, is that

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:49.800
[Guest]: the people who are at the top, who are making decisions of what needs to be done, what doesn't

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:56.760
[Guest]: need to be done, have absolutely no connect with the, yeah, let me be harsh.

01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:01.880
[Guest]: I think the left leadership in this country is a bunch of bureaucrats awaiting retirement.

01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:06.480
[Amit Varma]: It's very interesting that the political marketplace has transformed itself.

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.840
[Amit Varma]: Many existing players haven't been able to adapt, like the Congress and the left.

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:14.680
[Amit Varma]: However, there is a space for new entrepreneurs and this is demonstrated by the example you

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:20.120
[Amit Varma]: gave earlier of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, where they came up and they found an issue

01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:24.040
[Amit Varma]: like corruption, and they took it and they made a space for themselves within the political

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:25.040
[Amit Varma]: marketplace.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.920
[Amit Varma]: Whether you agree with them or not is a different matter.

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:29.800
[Amit Varma]: It's a it's a triumph of political entrepreneurship.

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.960
[Amit Varma]: And like you pointed out, maybe education is another wedge factor or whatever.

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.960
[Amit Varma]: This is up to political entrepreneurs to figure out what sort of narratives they can find

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:43.120
[Amit Varma]: and which which brings me to my next question, which is the politics of identity, or the

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:47.960
[Amit Varma]: politics of Mandal as it were, which, you know, received a big Philip around 18991,

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:51.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, those years.

01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:56.960
[Amit Varma]: And there was sort of the consensus view of Indian politics was that it is essentially

01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:59.000
[Amit Varma]: a politics of identity.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.760
[Amit Varma]: Even when the 2014 win of the BJP was being analyzed, it was okay, these are the different

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:06.480
[Amit Varma]: kinds of caste coalitions you made, and so on.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.040
[Amit Varma]: And now there is a counter view coming up saying that that has changed completely.

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:15.160
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of these smaller identities have been subsumed within this larger Hindu identity.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.360
[Amit Varma]: And that is a triumph of Modi and Shah.

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.480
[Amit Varma]: What's your sense of this?

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.880
[Guest]: I am not so sure.

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.360
[Guest]: There is definitely an element of Hindutva in the BJP's political success today is true.

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.760
[Guest]: They should dispute that.

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.120
[Guest]: Does it mean that the caste identities do not matter?

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.120
[Guest]: I do not think so.

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.880
[Guest]: I mean, a lot of thought goes in ticket distribution, we know for a fact, you know, even for the

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.280
[Guest]: BJP, caste equations are paramount for them.

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.400
[Guest]: Look at Karnataka, for example.

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:48.240
[Guest]: I mean, Yadurappa has become the chief minister, he's a Lingayat leader, he's not a Hindu leader

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.240
[Guest]: in Karnataka.

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:54.200
[Guest]: I mean, that is the core identity with the BJP thrives on politically in the state.

01:47:54.200 --> 01:48:00.360
[Guest]: But the Hindu consolidation, we also have to understand how it has been achieved.

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:05.400
[Guest]: I think, you know, the othering of Muslims is just one part of it.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:11.080
[Guest]: But in places like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, it has also been achieved against the erstwhile

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:14.380
[Guest]: dominant Yadavs, Jatavs, etc.

01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:17.100
[Guest]: So that is also a very integral part of the Hindu consolidation.

01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:21.640
[Guest]: So the BJP is still at around 35% of the vote, it is not the case that they've reached 60-65%

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:22.640
[Guest]: of the vote.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.400
[Guest]: I think, and this varies a lot across states, there is a lot of social tension in the BJP's

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.600
[Guest]: ranks regarding the caste thing also.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.400
[Guest]: All of us saw how the BJP struggled to balance caste equations.

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:36.120
[Guest]: So when the Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh defeats came, it was said that there was a

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:41.440
[Guest]: lot of pent up anger among the upper caste about how the BJP, you know, nullified the

01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:45.560
[Guest]: Supreme Court's amendments to the SCST Prevention of Atrocities Act, that there was a feeling

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:50.200
[Guest]: that the BJP was being pro-Dalit, which who were victimizing upper caste, was the claim.

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.880
[Guest]: I'm not saying true or false.

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:53.880
[Guest]: What did the BJP do?

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.680
[Guest]: The BJP brought reservation for economically weaker sections from upper caste who had never

01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.280
[Guest]: had reservations.

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.240
[Guest]: This is a complete game changer as far as social justice politics is considered in this

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:04.240
[Guest]: country.

01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:05.840
[Guest]: The BJP does not stop here.

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:06.840
[Guest]: Then what did it do?

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.720
[Guest]: Then another case came in the Supreme Court.

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:12.280
[Guest]: This was about implementing reservations in higher educational institutions.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:15.640
[Guest]: So the question was whether you implement reservations at the level of a department

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.720
[Guest]: or do you implement reservations at the level of the institution?

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:22.000
[Guest]: If you did so at the level of the department, the number of effective seats would be very

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
[Guest]: high.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.120
[Guest]: There, the BJP government actually once again nullified the Supreme Court order, but in

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.520
[Guest]: favor of the socially deprived caste, it was a completely anti-upper caste thing.

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:36.320
[Guest]: So it is doing a lot of flip flop between both camps and trying to keep both the camps

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.320
[Guest]: happy.

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:43.160
[Guest]: OBCs, now we have the talks of an OBC reorganization commission, there is talk that three categories

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:47.380
[Guest]: within the 27% OBC reservation would be made where the communities which have benefited

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:52.200
[Guest]: the most from OBC reservation would only have 7% instead of 27%.

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:56.840
[Guest]: The BJP, I think, is doing a lot of experimentation with the identity politics in our country.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.080
[Guest]: The Congress also tried that.

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.480
[Guest]: They tried to make Lingayats a religion in the Karnataka election, it completely backfired

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.480
[Guest]: on them.

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:06.640
[Guest]: The BJP before the elections in Maharashtra now has given Maratha reservation.

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.360
[Guest]: Effective reservation probably has gone to some 70%, which is absurd in my personal view,

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.760
[Guest]: but nevertheless, I mean, BJP doesn't mean meh.

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.520
[Guest]: So I think identity continues to be a very significant part of it.

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:23.760
[Guest]: But I also think that for an anti-BJP force to just bank on identity and counter the BJP

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.360
[Guest]: has become extremely difficult, because there's a historical legacy to it.

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.460
[Guest]: So if you get just the Yadavs and the Muslims, everybody else will unite against you in Bihar.

01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:36.800
[Guest]: So you basically get 30% of the vote, you don't get any seats, the opposition gets 56%,

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:39.600
[Guest]: the NDA gets 56%, walks away with everything.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:43.480
[Guest]: So it only works for the BJP in today's age, identity doesn't work for the other camp.

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:48.640
[Amit Varma]: But there must be like, if it is true that the politics of identity still matters, and

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.840
[Amit Varma]: it is also true that at some point, there will be limits to how much you can gain with

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:57.320
[Amit Varma]: patronage and some of these coalitions are bound to be uneasy coalitions and fissures

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:00.440
[Amit Varma]: will develop and then there is possibly hope for the others there.

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:04.280
[Guest]: Well, let's see, for example, Goa is a very interesting case, you talked about it earlier.

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:10.600
[Guest]: So this, these MLAs from Congress resigned and went, the BJP actually dumped an existing

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:14.720
[Guest]: ally of it sort of their ministers were removed from the cabinet, and they are feeling completely

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:15.720
[Guest]: betrayed.

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:18.680
[Guest]: So I'm sure there's some identity at play, I think a part of these MLAs were defected

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:19.920
[Guest]: are Christians or something.

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:22.080
[Guest]: So we'll have to see how it goes about.

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:26.960
[Guest]: But like I said, what is important is these things could work at the state level, they

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.360
[Guest]: could work in a Madhya Pradesh or a Rajasthan or a Chhattisgarh.

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:35.440
[Guest]: But I think when it comes to national elections, the political appeal with Narendra Modi has

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:39.880
[Guest]: today, and that I don't think is based on identity that is based on a very larger macro

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:44.880
[Guest]: macho outlook of a national leader, who is not afraid to sort of strike at the enemy,

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:49.200
[Guest]: who has taken India's prestige to completely new levels, etc.

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:54.760
[Guest]: You cannot use identity to puncture those achievements.

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:57.840
[Amit Varma]: So I've taken a lot of your time, we are almost reaching two hours.

01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:04.760
[Amit Varma]: So I want to end with sort of asking a question that asks you for a subjective assessment

01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:08.920
[Amit Varma]: based on objective data, which is, you know, you study data all the time.

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:12.720
[Amit Varma]: For many years, you've been doing that you can see different trends within this country's

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:15.860
[Amit Varma]: social trends, political trends, so on and so forth.

01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:20.320
[Amit Varma]: If I ask you to indulge me for a moment and go 10 years ahead, 10 years forward in time

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:26.520
[Amit Varma]: to 2029, what do you think is a best case scenario and a worst case scenario for the

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.920
[Amit Varma]: Indian political landscape and therefore for India?

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:36.680
[Guest]: I mean, it's, it's, let's come to the worst case scenario, that's easy, easier to envisage.

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:42.000
[Guest]: I think climate change would play havoc with agricultural production in the country.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.320
[Guest]: And a lot of farmers who are already you know, struggling very hard to make ends meet would

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:50.640
[Guest]: have a very difficult time, you know, agriculture would become very difficult and financially

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:55.000
[Guest]: unrewarding in large parts of the country.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.240
[Guest]: Food security is something we've learned to take for granted in a country for a very long

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.560
[Guest]: time now.

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:05.200
[Guest]: I'm afraid that will not be the case 20 years from now.

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:08.320
[Guest]: This I think more than anything else is what really scares me.

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:11.600
[Guest]: You've also written about the water crisis recently.

01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:16.760
[Guest]: The way you know, from Punjab, Haryana, which is the which are the traditional green revolution

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:21.400
[Guest]: states to states such as Bihar, arsenic poisoning is a huge problem in Bihar now.

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:26.220
[Guest]: I mean, Nitish Kumar has, you know, he's started a scheme which promises tap water to every

01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:30.120
[Guest]: household in a village, but basically that tap water comes from a submersible pump in

01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:31.120
[Guest]: said in the village.

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.000
[Guest]: So it's not some natural water supply.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.160
[Guest]: That I think is the worst case scenario.

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:43.640
[Guest]: The best case scenario I think would be the kind of political competition the BJP has

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:46.200
[Guest]: brought into politics in this country.

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:50.440
[Guest]: I think the old ossified establishments of politics, a lot of which, like you said, were

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:53.000
[Guest]: based on patronage, identity, etc.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.060
[Guest]: I think will not remain.

01:53:55.060 --> 01:54:00.840
[Guest]: So even, you know, the Western interests which have thrived on those old establishments sooner

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:04.200
[Guest]: than later will lose their hold.

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:12.240
[Guest]: So there would be a genuine, I think, democratic upsurge to build a constructive opposition.

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:14.320
[Guest]: And when I say this, I'm keeping my personal biases out.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.480
[Guest]: I'm not saying that this is right or the other is right.

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:19.960
[Guest]: It could take any shape, any ideological inclination, etc.

01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:24.840
[Guest]: But there would be an effort to engage with the government.

01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:28.560
[Guest]: Not on what the today's opposition, not on terms on what the today's opposition thinks

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:29.560
[Guest]: they should be.

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:33.560
[Guest]: So there would be a large, because the kind of a young country we are, and the kind of

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:39.080
[Guest]: problems our young generation faces, essentially jobs, employment, etc.

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.240
[Guest]: Even people like us, professionally white collared otherwise, there's absolutely no

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.240
[Guest]: job security.

01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:46.480
[Guest]: Now, India is a country where you have absolutely no social security, you know, you might be

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:48.320
[Guest]: rich enough, you might have a medical insurance.

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:52.080
[Guest]: But if you encounter serious illness, there's a lot of problem.

01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:57.360
[Guest]: So there has to be some sort of occupational solidarity among the young, at least, which

01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.200
[Guest]: will hopefully give a progressive tilt, you know, in terms of at least the economic policy

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.200
[Guest]: of it.

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:06.560
[Guest]: It has to be more egalitarian, we have to take care of development should not just be

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:11.520
[Guest]: more roads and more flyovers and more airports, but it has to, it will have to hopefully take

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:15.040
[Guest]: into account health and education is something which has not been done till now.

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:18.760
[Amit Varma]: But that I think, you know, is the best case scenario we should all be hoping for.

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.680
[Amit Varma]: On that hopeful note, thanks so much for coming on the show.

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.480
[Amit Varma]: I learned a lot from talking to you today.

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.520
