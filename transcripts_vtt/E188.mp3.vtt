00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.420
[Amit Varma]: Among the few things I have learnt in my life, one is this, be selective about the things

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.340
[Amit Varma]: you get involved in. I am still some way off from mastering the fine art of being dispassionate,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.680
[Amit Varma]: but more and more, when I watch the outrage erupt on social media, or the newest scandal

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.900
[Amit Varma]: on news television, I tell myself not to get involved, not to get all het up about it.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.480
[Amit Varma]: My slogan to live by is a simple one, not my circus, not my monkeys. My power to change

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.760
[Amit Varma]: the world is limited, so why sweat what I cannot control. Now I would imagine that this

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.100
[Amit Varma]: is what many economists would think if they were actually asked to become a part of government

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.200
[Amit Varma]: and help run the economy, especially in India, known for its oppressive state, so resistant

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.080
[Amit Varma]: to change, and its venal toxic politics. Why get involved? Stay away and pontificate from

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.480
[Amit Varma]: a mile-high view. My guest on the show today is a well-known economist who was asked six

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.280
[Amit Varma]: years ago to join our central government as the chief economic advisor. He might well

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.640
[Amit Varma]: have refused the offer, thinking, not my circus, not my monkeys. But he did not. He joined

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640
[Amit Varma]: the circus.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.840
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioural

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.000
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My title for this episode is, What a Long Strange Trip

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.480
[Amit Varma]: It's Been. And I'm actually referring to two trips here. One is that of the Indian economy

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.720
[Amit Varma]: through 70 years, a complex monster passing through complicated times, starting small

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.240
[Amit Varma]: and ending troubled. The second journey is that of my guest Arvind Subramanian, who joined

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Arindra Modi's government in 2014 as chief economic advisor, excited about having the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.840
[Amit Varma]: chance to do work that could have an impact on the lives of millions. He held that post

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.120
[Amit Varma]: for four years and continues to speak out today as a public intellectual. I was delighted

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: when he agreed to come on the show to speak about both India's journey in the last 73

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.840
[Amit Varma]: years and his own in the four years he spent in government. I have been a constant critic

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.760
[Amit Varma]: of this government's economic policies and did not refrain from asking hard questions.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Arvind, showing tremendous grace and patience, gave me forthright answers for more than three

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.000
[Amit Varma]: hours. I'm sure even his former boss, Arun Jaitley, never grilled him for so long. No,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.400
[Amit Varma]: but seriously, this was one of those digressive conversations that I really enjoyed spending

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.400
[Amit Varma]: as much time on large meta questions as on policy nitty-gritties. Do note one thing,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.600
[Amit Varma]: by the way, due to a technical glitch, there was some minor sound disturbances in the recording,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.800
[Amit Varma]: which we have tried to cover up in the edit. I'm sure you'll get lost in the engrossing

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.860
[Amit Varma]: flow of ideas and not even notice. Before we begin our conversation, though, let's take

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:05.240
[Amit Varma]: a quick commercial break. Are you one of those people who not only loves to read, but also

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.840
[Amit Varma]: wants to write better? If so, I have something for you. Since April this year, I've been

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.880
[Amit Varma]: teaching an online course called The Art of Clear Writing. Four webinars spread out over

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.240
[Amit Varma]: four Saturdays, in which I share whatever I've learnt about the craft and practice of

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.480
[Amit Varma]: writing over 25 years as a professional writer. The course also contains many writing exercises,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.840
[Amit Varma]: discussions on email and WhatsApp, and much interactivity. It costs rupees 10,000 or $150.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.160
[Amit Varma]: You can check out the details at IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. This link will be in

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.560
[Amit Varma]: the show notes. If you want to bridge the gap between the thoughts in your head and

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.520
[Amit Varma]: the words on the page, then the art of clear writing might be just what you need. September

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.360
[Amit Varma]: batches begin on Saturday, September 5th. So hurry and register before then. IndiaUncut.com

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:01.480
[Amit Varma]: slash clear writing. Arvind, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.680
[Amit Varma]: Thanks, Amit. It's great to be on the show. You know, before we start talking about your

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.480
[Amit Varma]: exciting career and various aspects of that are so interesting to me, both your time as

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.800
[Amit Varma]: an economist and your time working as you know, in the government to actually bring

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.080
[Amit Varma]: about change. I want to talk a little bit about your sort of personal growth, because

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.320
[Amit Varma]: I was sort of looking at your CV. And I found it very interesting in the sense that I assumed

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.560
[Amit Varma]: that, oh, you know, you must have taken the typical economist path where you've kind of

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.400
[Amit Varma]: gone abroad and done a PhD and all of that. But you actually, you know, you did an MBA

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.000
[Amit Varma]: from IIM Ahmedabad. And what I can see from all your public readings and speeches is that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.520
[Amit Varma]: unlike the, you know, most economists have this almost as dry reputation and of not being

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.840
[Amit Varma]: interested in other things and always, you know, engrossed in numbers, but you actually

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.000
[Amit Varma]: given a lecture on, you know, the what economists can learn from literature, you are the only

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.680
[Amit Varma]: person I can think of who can quote both Keats and Keynes. So tell me a little bit about

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.600
[Amit Varma]: your time growing up your formative influences and you know, what your personal journey was

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600
[Guest]: like.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.440
[Guest]: Right. You know, it's a bit always a little bit awkward to talk about oneself, of course.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.480
[Guest]: But I mean, let me just begin by saying that, when I said it's great to be on the podcast,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.640
[Guest]: I should have added that it's almost now a mark of you only arrive as a public intellectual

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.560
[Guest]: in India, when you've been on Amit Verma's podcast, I think this is a certification.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.160
[Guest]: So thanks for having me on the show. Yes. So in terms of, you know, growing up in a

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.600
[Guest]: very kind of pretty conventional middle, upper middle class household, my father was in the

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.320
[Guest]: government, he was in the Audit and Account Service. And he was a very unusual civil servant,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.600
[Guest]: you know, he was posted in the most godforsaken places, where everyone would try and want

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.440
[Guest]: to be in Delhi, whatever he would, you know, we spent five years in Dandekarania, you know,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.960
[Guest]: in Nagaland, Shillong, you know, Ajmer, Udaipur, so I've, you know, traveled all over with

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.840
[Guest]: him. And then I, you know, and of course, he was also a painter and a writer. And and

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.360
[Guest]: so, so so the growing up the household was full of books and things. And, and what I

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.480
[Guest]: remember, of course, is that, even when I was growing up, you know, this was what in

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.560
[Guest]: the 60s, my father used to subscribe to, you know, Time, Newsweek, Life, all these things

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.840
[Guest]: would physically come to the household. So, you know, just almost by osmosis, not that,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.600
[Guest]: you know, I was particularly studious or anything, but just by osmosis, you know, I could pick

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.400
[Guest]: it up. And, you know, I have to say that, so just to give a give an example of, you

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.680
[Guest]: know, things that we pick up that we forget that we've picked up unconsciously. So one

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.440
[Guest]: of my, you know, all time favorite pieces on foreign aid, which I teach in class, is

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.640
[Guest]: by this New Yorker writer called Philip Gurevich. He also has a great book on Rwanda on the

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.800
[Guest]: Rwanda genocide. And, you know, in the early part of the book, he describes the first foreign

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.680
[Guest]: aid intervention, which is on one of the early foreign aid interventions, which was, you

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.200
[Guest]: know, what happened in Nigeria and Biafra. And he has a line describing, you know, the

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.080
[Guest]: famine that happened. And he describes, you know, children with, you know, the victims

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:35.280
[Guest]: of the famine as stick limbed, balloon bellied, ancient eyed. And, you know, I was just blown

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.000
[Guest]: by that description. But then I remember that the reason why it, you know, it evoked so

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.880
[Guest]: much in me was because I remember these pictures in Life magazine of the Biafra crisis and

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.920
[Guest]: that picture of the of the boy or the child, actually, with the distended belly and so

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.240
[Guest]: on. So I mean, this is just an aside growing up. So then I finished my at about the age

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.720
[Guest]: of 13. You know, my elder brother was was a voracious reader, but I was not. But at

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.160
[Guest]: the age of 13 or 14, suddenly I realized that, you know, wow, that's this whole world of

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:18.800
[Guest]: books out there, which I've not at all explored. So almost as a conscious act of catching up

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.520
[Guest]: on lost time, I would ask my brother to give me a list of, you know, 10, 15 books every

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.720
[Guest]: time he would come. He was in college and I was still in school. So, you know, I started

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.920
[Guest]: reading quite voraciously then. And then, of course, you know, finished my schooling

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:39.040
[Guest]: from Chennai and went to Delhi to do an undergraduate degree in economics. I think it was fairly

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.680
[Guest]: unremarkable. I think I think what was great about that period was we picked up almost

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.960
[Guest]: everything from our peers. So it was really a great, you know, my love of Hindustani music,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.520
[Guest]: you know, a love of, you know, sports literature, reading and all of that was intensified in

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.680
[Guest]: now. Of course, growing up, you always listen to Carnatic music at home. But my love of

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.280
[Guest]: Hindustani music came up in college. Then, of course, you know, at that point, you either

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.600
[Guest]: go to Delhi school or you go to, you know, do an MBA at that point. Those are the kind

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.080
[Guest]: of standard options. And I had always wanted to, I think, join, I think, the government.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.800
[Guest]: In fact, I think I wanted to join the Foreign Service then, I think. So I did my MBA. And

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.720
[Guest]: in my second year, I wrote the civil service exam and I failed. I mean, I mean, I wasn't

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:30.520
[Guest]: high enough to get either the IFS or the IAS. And then, of course, I guess it's a sign of

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:37.800
[Guest]: the elite networks that we were part of that I got this scholarship. I'm not sure I deserved

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.080
[Guest]: it entirely, but I got the scholarship to go to England. So after my MBA, I worked for

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.240
[Guest]: a brief period, three months with the Tata. They had the Tata Administrative Service,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.800
[Guest]: which was like the private sector equivalent of the IAS. But then they gave me leave actually

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.720
[Guest]: to go abroad. And I went to Oxford to do, in fact, I went to do an MPhil in management

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.960
[Guest]: studies because that's what I'd done in MBA, but I quickly switched to economics. And I

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:08.760
[Guest]: think I had, again, a fairly unremarkable MPhil in PhD. I was still kind of unsure of

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:15.720
[Guest]: what I wanted to do, you know, not completely confident that, you know, I had actually acquired

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.880
[Guest]: because, you see, an Oxford PhD, unlike an American PhD, you know, it was completely,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.360
[Guest]: you know, open ended, you kind of did what you wanted. And today, for example, I mean,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.280
[Guest]: it's a dirty secret, you know, almost all my academic papers are empirical papers, but

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.360
[Guest]: I have not done one course in econometrics all my life, you know, even though I'm a PhD

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.560
[Guest]: in economics. So, you know, you could do that in if you went to England in those days. So

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:50.800
[Guest]: I felt and then when I finished my MPhil, I did get an academic job. And the truth is,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:57.800
[Guest]: I felt that mediocrity shows up so clearly in academics, and feeling that I was an imposter

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.560
[Guest]: and mediocre, I kind of ran away from academics as it were. And then I went to work for international

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.920
[Guest]: institutions. And then I my first job was at in the GATT actually, at the time that

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.520
[Guest]: the Uruguay round was being negotiated. I still remember, I was at the GATT, I was,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:20.960
[Guest]: you know, a young, very young, lowly officer. And I was assigned to be part of the intellectual

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.360
[Guest]: property negotiations trips, you know, I don't know how many of you remember, but the the

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.560
[Guest]: Uruguay round, the most contentious issue for India and for many developing countries

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:37.280
[Guest]: was patent protection, and intellectual property. And, you know, at that stage, so while working,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.920
[Guest]: I did some, you know, fairly, not very sophisticated empirical research, showing that, you know,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.340
[Guest]: this trips agreement would be harmful for countries like India. And I even kind of roughly

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:57.120
[Guest]: crudely quantified that. And I guess my early kind of moment of epiphany then was, this

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.920
[Guest]: was not even kind of probably wouldn't have even been published in any academic journal.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.320
[Guest]: But I do remember, you know, when and those negotiations, by the way, were, were really

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.680
[Guest]: contentious. I mean, I don't know how many of you recall that it was almost touch and

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.320
[Guest]: go India was almost considering not signing on to it, because, because of the intellectual

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.800
[Guest]: property things, because, you know, pharmaceutical prices would go up, access to medicine would

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:26.560
[Guest]: come down. So I remember, and I, you know, did this work. So I remember my moment of

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.720
[Guest]: kind of, you know, kind of epiphany, but also kind of sense of wonder of, you know, what

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.280
[Guest]: the life of a policy economist could be. You know, I was working there and one of the Indian

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:42.680
[Guest]: officials one day, this was, I think, 90, maybe three or 94. I don't know when it was.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.840
[Guest]: He came and he was a senior person, senior civil servant in the Indian government, who

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.280
[Guest]: used to work in the commerce ministry. He came and said, Arvind, I have to tell you,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.760
[Guest]: you know, last week or a month ago, Carla Hills, who was the US trade negotiator, very

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.840
[Guest]: tough lady, she was called Carla Crowbar Hills, because she wanted to price open markets in

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.360
[Guest]: developing countries. And so what had happened was, when I wrote this, I think Montague was

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.160
[Guest]: the Commerce Secretary at that point. So this official had passed it on to Montague and

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.680
[Guest]: apparently, and Chidambaram was the Commerce Minister, and he had passed it on to Chidambaram.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.800
[Guest]: So this person came to me and said, Carla Hills came and met Mr. Chidambaram to say

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.760
[Guest]: that, why are you Indians fussing over this intellectual property negotiations? You know,

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.760
[Guest]: it's going to be win-win for all of us, it's good for India, etc. And then she said, look,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.880
[Guest]: I have a bunch of 10 studies to show that this is the case. And apparently, I don't

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.480
[Guest]: know, of course, it was later confirmed, apparently, Mr. Chidambaram, the minister said, well,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.480
[Guest]: Ambassador Hills, I have another study which shows exactly the opposite. And he presented

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:54.400
[Guest]: her my paper. And so that was a kind of wow moment for me that, you know, one could do

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.920
[Guest]: policy research and have it taken seriously by policymakers. So that was a kind of quite

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.680
[Guest]: a heady moment of, you know, and I was very young then. And then after that, of course,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:11.680
[Guest]: I went to work for the IMF. And, you know, again, fairly unremarkable career. But then,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:19.280
[Guest]: I mean, basically, my, my kind of academic life took off in around 2000, I think, I was

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.160
[Guest]: the, you know, for the IMF, I, you know, IMF, you go around, you know, to all the countries

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:30.720
[Guest]: in the world, I was the mission leader to Mauritius. And it's just a such an interesting

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.160
[Guest]: country, you know, for so many reasons, literature, history, you know, the Indian presence there.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:44.640
[Guest]: And when I was in in Mauritius, I actually saw a festival that you only see in Chennai,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:50.040
[Guest]: you know, very unusual festival in Chennai, which is related to the God Kartikeya. I saw

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.960
[Guest]: that actually, I saw that in Mauritius, you know, so it's kind of really a, I mean, just

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.400
[Guest]: to see how traditions kind of persist, you know, in distant places. So I was working

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.840
[Guest]: on Mauritius, fascinating country, there's a great Naipaul piece on Mauritius, you know,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.240
[Guest]: of course, Joseph Conrad was in Mauritius, you know, of course, the Amitabh Ghosh trilogy

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:16.360
[Guest]: begins in at least part of it is in Mauritius. So I wrote a paper on Mauritius, basically

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:22.160
[Guest]: saying, how can you explain this, this miracle? And I sent it to, you know, Danny Roderick,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:28.520
[Guest]: who was then a friend and a co author. And, you know, within kind of an hour of receiving

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:34.400
[Guest]: that he said, Arvind, I want this for my volume. And then, of course, then, then I became a

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.240
[Guest]: for about 10 years, I think I was doing hardcore economics research, but never situated in

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.420
[Guest]: academia, I was never, I was always, you know, then at the IMF. So Danny and I did a series

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.440
[Guest]: of research papers, then Raghu and I did a series of research papers that I did on my

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.920
[Guest]: own, a number of research papers, then I moved to this think tank in Washington, the Peterson

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.560
[Guest]: Institute for International Economics and the Center for Global Development. Because,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.960
[Guest]: you know, my, my academic research is mostly on, you know, development and global and,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.880
[Guest]: you know, the global economic system, and almost all of that. So I left the IMF partly

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.760
[Guest]: also, because, you know, people think that, in government, you have to be restrained in

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.720
[Guest]: your public utterances. And that was getting becoming true of the IMF as well, because

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:25.080
[Guest]: actually, Raghu and I wrote a series of papers on aid, then I wrote some pieces on Nigeria,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.280
[Guest]: which I think senior management, they were having difficulty allowing it to be published.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.680
[Guest]: So I left because I wanted to write publicly much more. And then, of course, I wrote a

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:41.000
[Guest]: book on China when I was in the Peterson Institute, which about the rise of China and so on. So

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.840
[Guest]: I got a bit into China as well. And then of course, this, you know, what is probably the

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.720
[Guest]: most exciting three years and nine months of my life was the, you know, being Chief

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.320
[Guest]: Economic Advisor, it was really a completely transformational experience for me in many,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.960
[Guest]: many ways, you know, what you learn about politics, about politicians, about the policymaking

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.800
[Guest]: process, what you learn about oneself, you know, how you build teams. And of course,

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:14.880
[Guest]: the other thing is, you know, is how should one kind of behave as a public intellectual

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.080
[Guest]: in government, you know, what are the dilemmas that you face the, you know, the moral dilemmas

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:24.600
[Guest]: and things, you know, so many, so many unusual things happened when I was in government,

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.480
[Guest]: and so many choices had to be made. So so so and then, of course, now, I finished that

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:35.240
[Guest]: and left a year before my second contract was about to end. Because I felt that, you

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:41.040
[Guest]: know, I had personal reasons, but also, I felt that my usefulness, effectiveness was

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.840
[Guest]: kind of reaching their limits. And so I was working as at the Kennedy School was teaching

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.200
[Guest]: here. And now, of course, as of July one, I've joined Ashoka University. And so look

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.480
[Guest]: forward to, you know, probably the last phase of my career.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.840
[Amit Varma]: That's a fascinating life, you managed to summarize into so little space, I have a couple

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.240
[Amit Varma]: of follow up questions. And for one, I want to go a little bit back, because you know,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.880
[Amit Varma]: as you were talking about your childhood and growing up and going across India, and I felt

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.840
[Amit Varma]: a little nostalgic, because even though I am like 15 years younger than you, I'm in

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.240
[Amit Varma]: my mid 40s. Now, it strikes me that I also did a significant part of my growing up. Before

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:25.260
[Amit Varma]: liberalization, I was also a privileged child, my father was a civil servant. So I would

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.080
[Amit Varma]: imagine that, you know, just thinking of all of the people growing up in similar circumstances,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, in those times, certain kinds of music, which you end up listening to the certain

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.560
[Amit Varma]: kind of books, which you end up reading, you know, everything that you kind of mentioned

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.720
[Amit Varma]: about the magazines, and just sort of thinking about myself, I've often thought that what

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:50.000
[Amit Varma]: that upbringing did to me is that I grew into a sort of default view of the world that I

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.160
[Amit Varma]: had where you take the necessity of this of state paternalism for granted, that, you know,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.280
[Amit Varma]: you have a certain approach to everything. And then later on, as you go through the years,

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:05.320
[Amit Varma]: the scales fall off your eyes now in and you see the world differently in subtle ways.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.280
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, this journey would be different for everybody. Now, it's interesting that,

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, at a certain point, you've done your MBA, you've completed that, and then

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.280
[Amit Varma]: you go abroad, and you spent, you know, most of your career abroad. So my first sort of

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.920
[Amit Varma]: question is that, were there moments where you felt that you could take a step back?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there were some scales that fell off, and you could take a step back and

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:31.160
[Amit Varma]: something which had seemed one way to you, you know, seem different, like, would you

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.800
[Amit Varma]: say that there was a process like that? Or was there a period of time where you felt

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.360
[Amit Varma]: that you began to look at the world differently? And, you know, if so, what was the change

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.200
[Amit Varma]: like whether thinkers who influenced you and or books that you know, kind of changed or

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.280
[Guest]: shaped the way you looked at the world? Yeah, I don't think it would be accurate to say

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.640
[Guest]: that there was one, you know, point of, you know, one or two epiphanic moments, we'd say,

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.880
[Guest]: Oh, my God, whatever. So it was very much, I think, a gradual process. And as you said,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.840
[Guest]: I think this whole, you know, the state is part of your state. And, you know, it's part

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:09.680
[Guest]: of your DNA growing up. I think the first thing kind of the intellectual changes, you

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.680
[Guest]: go out, and you see, wow, you know, all that the state has done wrong, you know, the liberties

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:20.800
[Guest]: it's taken away the, you know, the whole license control Raj and, you know, you kind of we

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.240
[Guest]: used to take, you know, 100 and 200% tariffs as kind of, you know, normal, right? And then

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:30.280
[Guest]: you go abroad and say, what, you know, 3%, 5% tariffs, and you know, what's going on

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.600
[Guest]: kind of thing. And of course, then you read, I read the old, you know, the wonderful Bhagwati

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:41.240
[Guest]: Desai Srinivasan literature, you know, you learn about that. And so I think that process

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:48.480
[Guest]: of seeing what we were doing wrong, I think it just hits you gradually over time. But

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:55.780
[Guest]: then, of course, I think, in some ways, you know, the journey in some ways gets completed,

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:04.240
[Guest]: because then you say, well, but yes, markets, yes, freedom, yes, liberalism. But, you know,

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:10.080
[Guest]: what about all the things that this, you know, the acts of omission that the state has committed,

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.840
[Guest]: you know, we know the sins of commission, then you come back and you say, well, what

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:21.080
[Guest]: about the sins of and so I think the last 10-15 years have been, I think, a lot about

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:26.940
[Guest]: understanding and, and reflecting on, you know, state and markets in India, you know,

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.520
[Guest]: what I call the whole stigmatized capitalism, how that's come about in a way that's detrimental

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.480
[Guest]: to both capital and states. And so I think that's been kind of the intellectual journey,

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.800
[Guest]: to some extent. And I remember, I think, in terms of intellectual influences, you know,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.240
[Guest]: I was reading a lot. But in the academic literature, I think that, you know, I would almost say

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.360
[Guest]: that I learned kind of macroeconomics reading Paul Krugman's writings, actually, I would

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.720
[Guest]: actually read almost everything that he wrote early on here, some, you know, wonderful,

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:04.040
[Guest]: and just I think, just how to write clearly as an economist, I think, that's been a big

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.200
[Guest]: obsession of mine. It's not just, you know, obviously, the ideas matter a lot, but actually,

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.080
[Guest]: how do you make it communicable? And then, you know, both for me, Danny Rodrik and Paul

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:20.800
[Guest]: Krugman were, were really very influential, both in content, you know, Danny's early writings

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:26.000
[Guest]: on political economy were, I think, very, very insightful for me. So also to think about,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.160
[Guest]: you know, you know, not just state and markets, but the whole, you know, because remember,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.600
[Guest]: when we used to speak about, you know, market failure, but I think, you know, the whole

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.640
[Guest]: question about what is state failure was a very important issue. And therefore, understanding

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.680
[Guest]: political economy, you know, what all the things going on, ideology, interests, institutions,

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.920
[Guest]: the rich interactions between them, I think that was something that I always read about

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:56.280
[Guest]: and followed, kind of very, very closely. And, you know, my second question arising

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.080
[Amit Varma]: from that is that, you know, when I read your work, when I read your writings, and your

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.660
[Amit Varma]: speeches and so on, I, I sense this deep sense of conviction, like you've very often spoken

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:09.800
[Amit Varma]: about how during your time, as the chief economic advisor, you would wake up every morning excited

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.760
[Amit Varma]: about the day because, you know, every day was so exciting. And obviously, it's exciting

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.800
[Amit Varma]: because you actually get a chance to sort of make a change in the world. And earlier,

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.280
[Amit Varma]: when you were, you know, talking about your sort of career that, you know, you do an MBA,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.800
[Amit Varma]: the civil services doesn't happen. So you go to Oxford. And after that, you know, you

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.840
[Amit Varma]: feel academics is not the place for you, and then so on and your entire career path. And

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.520
[Amit Varma]: there, it seemed like, okay, you're sort of going along a career path. And, you know,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.440
[Amit Varma]: there's a little bit of serendipity to it. So at what point did you start feeling this

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.760
[Amit Varma]: sense of conviction about your work that look, my work can make a difference to the world?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, was there a time where you looked at something and said, this is a problem, I want

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.040
[Amit Varma]: to solve this problem, my next study is going to be about this, you know, was that a mindset

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.040
[Amit Varma]: that you kind of had from the start? Or did it sort of, you know, evolve over a period

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.040
[Guest]: of time?

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:08.500
[Guest]: Yeah, I think that, you know, to be honest, it was never. I think the sequence was always,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.360
[Guest]: you know, you find yourself somewhere. And then you say, wow, this thing kind of like

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.520
[Guest]: when I was in the GATT, I was working on the intellectual property negotiations. And then,

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.600
[Guest]: you know, I said, Oh, my God, there's such a big issue involved here, that I wanted to

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.680
[Guest]: work on that. Similarly, when I was in Mauritius, you know, again, I said, Wow, what a fascinating

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.800
[Guest]: development experience this is, and I wanted to write. So it's been, it's never been consciously

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.000
[Guest]: kind of trying to find something so much as, you know, I find myself somewhere, whatever

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.800
[Guest]: for all kinds of, you know, historical persistence reasons. And then, you know, you say, so all

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:51.160
[Guest]: the aid stuff that we did, because I was working in the IMF, you know, in the research department,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.440
[Guest]: and you know, debate was going, you know, there's a raging debate between, you know,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.480
[Guest]: Billy Stille, Jeff Sachs, and others. And then, you know, I said, you know, maybe one

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.500
[Guest]: can contribute here. So it was much more that, you know, not so much consciously seeking

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.680
[Guest]: as you know, just finding yourself in places. And of course, I mean, to be honest, I, the

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.180
[Guest]: thing is that, you know, my kind of principle guiding my research is that, A, the question

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:20.540
[Guest]: has to be, you know, very important in terms of policy, you know, I'm not going to do anything

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.480
[Guest]: that doesn't have a policy impact. And that it has to, you know, the contribution has

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:33.140
[Guest]: to be novel and new. So the combination of important in terms of policy, but if I must

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.340
[Guest]: have something new to say, otherwise, you know, it's not worth it, why bother, you know,

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:43.260
[Guest]: so many. So, so there is a kind of, you know, kind of a shock or a novelty element to, you

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.420
[Guest]: know, the stuff that I do. And part of it, of course, is, you know, part of that is also

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:52.580
[Guest]: a way of getting people's attention to important policy issues. Because I remember the, even

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.820
[Guest]: the, you know, the early patent work that I did, you know, I kind of said, you know,

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.540
[Guest]: the loss is like $1 billion, or whatever. So putting numbers onto policy questions,

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:06.660
[Guest]: I think is also something that I really, you know, that kind of, you know, really turns

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:12.020
[Guest]: me on and motivates me as well. So the combination of, you know, new, important and new facts

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:19.180
[Guest]: to kind of evidence to bring to bear. And the difference, I guess, why I don't, maybe

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:25.660
[Guest]: haven't chosen this hardcore academic career is because, I mean, I've been less kind of

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.980
[Guest]: obsessed with this whole, you know, you must show causation in kind of rigorous ways. I

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.820
[Guest]: mean, for me, the big facts are as important as anything else that should be done. And

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.100
[Guest]: I think facts change the world. I mean, I can give you examples of that, not not my

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.540
[Guest]: own research, but lots of other people, it's much more the big facts that I think that

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:50.860
[Guest]: have a big impact on the world and policymaking, as much as any kind of sophisticated attempt

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:55.860
[Guest]: at showing it, well, you know, this happens because of this, you know, that's important,

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.940
[Amit Varma]: but I think its role is

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.500
[Amit Varma]: I'd love a couple of examples of big facts that had that kind of impact.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:08.620
[Guest]: So I think that, you know, to give you one example, you know, Karthik was on your show

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:15.540
[Guest]: a few weeks ago. You know, for me, certainly that the finding that the work on teacher

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.680
[Guest]: absenteeism in India, I think kind of changed a little bit the way we thought about the

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.300
[Guest]: education debate in India, that, you know, you focus on or, you know, whatever, you know,

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.780
[Guest]: you need to pour money, or you need to do other things. But then suddenly, this fact

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.060
[Guest]: comes and hits you and says, wow, you know, this is like, you know, we've completely forgotten

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.980
[Guest]: about, you know, teachers not showing up, and you know, what that does. And I think

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.260
[Guest]: that set in train, a whole different way of looking at it. And I think, you know, similarly,

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:47.420
[Guest]: I think, you know, the patent stuff that I spoke about, I think, that, and, you know,

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.660
[Guest]: for example, if you look around the world, the whole, you know, the work that Piketty

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.740
[Guest]: and his co authors have done, you know, kind of documenting, you know, the rise in a particular

00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:01.180
[Guest]: kind of inequality, top inequality, you know, you may disagree with the policy conclusions

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.980
[Guest]: that follow. But the fact is, the world is a very different place in terms of understanding

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:11.100
[Guest]: the world, because of knowing those facts about the world. So I think that there are,

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:16.060
[Guest]: you know, the other, you know, just to give a personal example, is that, you know, in

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:24.100
[Guest]: the economic survey, we did some work on migration, based on data that nobody had ever used in

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:28.700
[Guest]: India and data that, you know, we had the privilege of getting access to because I was

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.900
[Guest]: in government, this was the the railway data that we had. And my team and I, we made some

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:39.220
[Guest]: use of it. And the numbers that came out, you know, were pretty striking, much bigger

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.460
[Guest]: than what we had believed migration within India was all about. And of course, we presented

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:50.340
[Guest]: it, I think it didn't gain a lot of traction, or people weren't quite didn't cotton on to

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.660
[Guest]: it. But when the actual COVID crisis happened, the migrant crisis happened, it kind of showed

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:01.740
[Guest]: that that work was, in some ways, you know, not incorrect in the quantification of the

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:06.260
[Guest]: magnitudes and so on. So I think, you know, kind of facts are really, you know, but doing

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:12.660
[Guest]: it very carefully, rigorously, but on important issues. And that's what I think is really,

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.740
[Guest]: for me, is very, very challenging and important. And so, you know, even in government, I think

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:27.140
[Guest]: people underestimate, you know, the quality of a simple chart. Because I remember very

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:33.740
[Guest]: early on, this was, you know, I joined late 2014, early 2015. And we were having these

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.980
[Guest]: discussions within government on, you know, what to do, etc. And I think, you know, there's

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.900
[Guest]: not a there's not rocket science, I showed Mr. Arun Jaitley a chart of, you know, real

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:47.940
[Guest]: wages declining, rural real wages declining. And, you know, I could see that, you know,

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.900
[Guest]: he really made a real impression on him. He took note of it. And of course, he acted on

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.380
[Guest]: it in ways that I'm not sure, even I don't know fully, but he did act on it. And I think

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:04.020
[Guest]: that so things like that, I think, are really quite, quite important.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.060
[Amit Varma]: In fact, in one of your interviews, you use the phrase the Dracula effect, which is, you

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.460
[Amit Varma]: know, to shine sunlight on something. So that it kind of becomes obvious. And I was struck

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:17.900
[Amit Varma]: by that. So I want to follow sort of a couple of simultaneous parts during the rest of our

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.900
[Amit Varma]: conversation. One is that, through your readings through your books, through your writings,

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.180
[Amit Varma]: rather than through your books, I've, you know, gained a lot of insights about India's

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:32.180
[Amit Varma]: economy post independence. So I want to sort of discuss that journey, the journey that

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:38.140
[Amit Varma]: the Indian economy has made from 47 to here, and sort of where we are today, and obviously

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.180
[Amit Varma]: zoom in on the years that you were actually in government and all of that. And at the

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:48.380
[Amit Varma]: same time, I'm fascinated by, you know, your experiences within that beast, we call the

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.340
[Amit Varma]: Indian state, and you know, your efforts to sort of bring about reform within that. And

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:58.340
[Amit Varma]: many of my listeners are not sort of trained economists that they'll kind of, you know,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:03.180
[Amit Varma]: be familiar with all of this already. And so what I'll say is that, you know, to begin

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:10.380
[Amit Varma]: with, can you give me a sense of, you know, go back to the choices that we made post independence

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:16.260
[Amit Varma]: and maybe for two or three decades since and what was so unique about this experiment,

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:21.700
[Amit Varma]: like you've spoken about what you called a precocious development model, and you know,

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.620
[Amit Varma]: the two significant ways in which this was so strikingly different and a unique experiment.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.860
[Guest]: So can you can you elaborate on that a bit?

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:34.140
[Guest]: Yeah. Um, so, you know, maybe I will, you know, jump first forward and then backward

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:42.460
[Guest]: in time. And I'll come back to your question. So I guess, my first real academic piece on

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.980
[Guest]: the Indian economy, which was also a kind of which, as you know, triggered a massive

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:53.560
[Guest]: debate in India, which was this paper that Danny and I wrote on, you know, how growth

00:31:53.560 --> 00:32:01.180
[Guest]: took off in the 1980s, especially in 1979, even though the reforms began only in 1991.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.820
[Guest]: So you know, it provoked a massive discussion, because people said, no, no, no, you know,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.380
[Guest]: you know, because there are two camps, right, the camp that says, you know, you get growth

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:15.340
[Guest]: through reforms. And then even the fact that actually, some people had noted that, you

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.940
[Guest]: know, India's actually the growth take off happens actually 79, 1980. But you know, before

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.660
[Guest]: that, we had the Hindu rate of growth, you grow at about three, three and a half percent.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.340
[Guest]: And then suddenly, from 1979, 80, onwards, we grow at about 6%. And so just highlighting

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:34.420
[Guest]: that fact, and then saying, we have to try and understand this, that if you, you know,

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:39.180
[Guest]: if you accept this, then how did we get this sudden, because the real acceleration is not

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:44.180
[Guest]: between, you know, the 80s and 90s. Because remember, the 90s growth is pretty much the

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.820
[Guest]: same as the 80s growth. So how did that happen? And so that was, for me, a real, you know,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:57.700
[Guest]: eye opener. And that, you know, my partial explanation for what happened in the 1980s,

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:03.100
[Guest]: kind of then allows me to now kind of step back and say, come back to your question,

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.980
[Guest]: which is that, you know, if you look at the kind of broad development choices that we

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:12.420
[Guest]: made, you know, and choices to some extent is within quotes, because, you know, some

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:17.020
[Guest]: of it is just persistence in history and, and personality. So, you know, how much active

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:21.060
[Guest]: agency there was in these choices, when we use the word choice, we connote agency, which

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:26.020
[Guest]: may not, at least historically may not be completely accurate. But I think there were

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:32.180
[Guest]: two or three, I would say the big development choices that we made, right? One is, you know,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.660
[Guest]: from day one, you're a democracy, and not so. So if you look at, you know, there's a

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.860
[Guest]: recent paper that I wrote with Rohit Lamba, which kind of brings it out, even more clearly,

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.100
[Guest]: it was first there in the economic survey. If you think about it, if you look at the

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.340
[Guest]: successful models of economic development, there were the two big models, right? One

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:59.420
[Guest]: is Western Europe, and the US, which is essentially what happens is that you economic development

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:06.560
[Guest]: happens over, you know, 150 200 years, and political development, you know, happens alongside.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:13.100
[Guest]: So there's slow economic and co terminus, co evolving, slow political development, and

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:18.940
[Guest]: that's happened over 250 years, successful, and so on. The other model is the East Asian

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:26.020
[Guest]: model, which is, you know, post 19, World War Two, you have a sudden burst of economic

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.460
[Guest]: growth, you know, just to give put some numbers, Western Europe grew at about, let's say, two

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:36.620
[Guest]: and a half percent per capita over 200 years, East Asia, you know, Japan, the Tigers, China,

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:43.140
[Guest]: and now Vietnam, they grow rapidly, Korea, of course, they grow rapidly, over 50, 50,

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:48.980
[Guest]: 60 years, and kind of achieve almost the same level of, you know, income as advanced countries.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:55.700
[Guest]: But so there's more rapid economic development, right? But there's a sequencing, you know,

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.500
[Guest]: economic development comes first, and then political development follows. So you have

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:04.180
[Guest]: these two kind of broad models. And India defies that, you know, India's model, which

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:10.220
[Guest]: says from day one, you have democracy. So both economic development happens after or

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:15.100
[Guest]: at least the attempt is made to happen after political development. So, so that kind of

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:23.100
[Guest]: a, and remember, again, important historical fact is that it's not that this has not happened

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:28.020
[Guest]: at all. There are only four or five other countries in the world that began democracy

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.580
[Guest]: and embarked on economic development. But these are very small countries, you know,

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:39.260
[Guest]: Costa Rica, Botswana, the Caribbean countries, and so on. So there's no comparable, you know,

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:45.060
[Guest]: a large, so this is really striking. So therefore, what does that mean for development? And something

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.820
[Guest]: that I'll come to in just a second. So that was one big choice, you know, democracy first,

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.860
[Guest]: and then you embark on development. Then, of course, we had, you know, the whole commanding

00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:02.540
[Guest]: heights, etc, etc. But remember that the whole import substitution protecting domestic industry

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:08.220
[Guest]: etc, etc, that India chose, whatever, we may have done it to a much more serious extent

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:14.620
[Guest]: than say, Latin America did. But I think we should never forget that that choice of state

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:20.460
[Guest]: led development was completely consistent with the zeitgeist of the times, you know,

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.620
[Guest]: not just, you know, at that point, we thought, you know, the Russian model was doing very

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:31.020
[Guest]: well. Remember, I think there's a very famous scene, event when Khrushchev goes to the United

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:37.020
[Guest]: Nations, he picks up his shoe, and bangs it on the podium and says, we will bury you.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.580
[Guest]: And people thought he said, we're going to, you know, devastate a nuclear holocaust of

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:47.100
[Guest]: the West. But actually, what he meant was, we economically, we will devastate you, we

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:51.100
[Guest]: are model is doing so well, that we will, you know, show you that this is the right

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.700
[Guest]: model. So if you look at Russia, if you look at the Great Depression, if you look at many

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.700
[Guest]: developing countries, and of course, the whole rise of the welfare state in Europe as well.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.420
[Guest]: So, so that choice, I think, was not at all unusual, you may, you know, say, right, wrong,

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:10.300
[Guest]: we can come to that later. But it was not, I think, what was really distinctive about

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:19.820
[Guest]: India is that we combine that with this horrendously complicated system, which, you know, Rajaji

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:25.460
[Guest]: famously called the License Quota Parmitraj, which, you know, there was the complexity,

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.300
[Guest]: there was the corruption that happened, you know, which is going to be, you know, which

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:34.780
[Guest]: is probably the most devastating legacy of all of that. But what was distinctive about

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:40.600
[Guest]: that was, look, and this is something that people don't, you know, grasp sufficiently.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.940
[Guest]: When you protect, you want to help the domestic entrepreneur, you know, whatever, you know,

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.260
[Guest]: the Bombay, we remember the Bombay plan, basically self serving saying, you know, protect so

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:56.300
[Guest]: that you know, we can do it. So that's understood. But the whole, especially licensing, it actually

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:02.660
[Guest]: taxed domestic producers. So whereas protection gives you, you know, is a favor granted to

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:08.140
[Guest]: domestic industry, license is a tax on domestic industry, because you say, you can't produce

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.580
[Guest]: more than so much, you know, every time you want to do this, you have to come and ask

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:19.180
[Guest]: someone. So that tax on domestic production in a sense. So it was a very unusual model,

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:24.580
[Guest]: where there was both import substitution, but a tax on domestic, basically domestic

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:29.740
[Guest]: entrepreneurial activity was taxed in a way that very few countries do. And so that was

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:35.020
[Guest]: the second kind of the big distinctive thing. The third, of course, I think big choice was

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:40.540
[Guest]: that. And the way I like to put it is to say that, you know, this is the country, it's

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:46.900
[Guest]: a premature democracy, democracies redistribute, we know that there's on top of that, there's

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:53.200
[Guest]: the overlay of this hideous hierarchy that we call caste, and so on. So how do you redress

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.860
[Guest]: historical inequality, I think, broadly, there would have been two ways of doing it. One

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:03.860
[Guest]: is the whole opportunity route, you give everyone education, etc. But I call this, you know,

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:10.220
[Guest]: we of course, did not do that, I think it was our second original sin. But instead,

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:15.540
[Guest]: what we did was we went in for these guarantees. So I call this in the opportunity versus guarantee

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:19.620
[Guest]: thing, you know, we went in for guarantees, which is the whole, what we call reservation

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:25.180
[Guest]: and so on. And we can talk about so these were kind of three big choices that we made.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:33.260
[Guest]: Now, I want to link that, why did I jumpstart with 1980, 1990, is because, in some ways,

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:42.220
[Guest]: what happened in the 1980s, was that that tax that we imposed on domestic industry,

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.660
[Guest]: was when we kind of said, let's relax these tax, because remember, we call those pro business,

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.780
[Guest]: not pro competition reforms, because the competition only began in 1990. After the opening up,

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:58.980
[Guest]: the 80s reform was very much, you know, helping incumbents helping domestic business by giving

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:04.020
[Guest]: them better access to inputs, technology, you know, all of that. So in some ways, the

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:12.700
[Guest]: 80s rectify or began to rectify the distinctive tax that we impose. And that's kind of partly

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:18.100
[Guest]: our explanation for why kind of, so if I wanted to put it provocatively, I would say that

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:23.860
[Guest]: the 80s were in fact, the first decade that we actually did import substitution, because

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.660
[Guest]: you know, we continue to protect our domestic industry, but we remove the tax on them. And

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.540
[Guest]: so that happened, of course, the rest is history, we had a crisis, etc, etc.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:36.940
[Amit Varma]: I was sort of struck by these sort of broad strands which are happening through Indian

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:42.180
[Amit Varma]: history. And it's not only economic, but obviously, the thinking encompasses that one, as you

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:47.380
[Amit Varma]: pointed out is the whole command and control mindset, which, as you said, was, you know,

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:52.220
[Amit Varma]: it was the belief of the time, it was completely the rational way to go. In fact, it would

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:57.180
[Amit Varma]: have been going against the grain to not go that way. So that's completely understandable.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:01.140
[Amit Varma]: The second thing that really happens in the political domain, but the thinking carries

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:05.980
[Amit Varma]: through I think, to how you should run the economy is that we don't build a new state,

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:10.860
[Amit Varma]: we take over the existing colonial apparatus. And that is essentially the state. And that,

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.660
[Amit Varma]: of course, has, you know, is incredibly oppressive. In the words of Somnath Lahiri, it's like

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.980
[Amit Varma]: a state designed to be a policeman. And that mindset somehow seems to carry through when

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:27.140
[Amit Varma]: not only do we do the sort of welfarism and the redistribution that is inevitable, because

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.180
[Amit Varma]: we are a democracy, even though you know, we've reached that stage much earlier than

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.500
[Amit Varma]: other democracies, which became wealthy before they became began to redistribute, we don't

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.300
[Amit Varma]: have that option. But that's kind of fine. But not only do we do that, we also constrain

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:44.820
[Amit Varma]: private capital and distrust private capital, like Nehru once said to JRD Tata, do not talk

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:49.940
[Amit Varma]: to me of profit. It is a dirty word, stock quote. And that mindset seems to kind of carry

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.780
[Amit Varma]: through. And like you, I'm inclined to excuse, you know, Nehru for some of these errors,

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.220
[Amit Varma]: because they were very much the fashion of the time, like you said, import substitution,

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.180
[Amit Varma]: and whatever. And like, you've pointed out that, you know, the industrial policy regulation

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:07.420
[Amit Varma]: was a huge issue there. And you've also spoken elsewhere of bank nationalization being one

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:12.780
[Amit Varma]: of the original sins. In fact, there's a great quote of yours, which I found, you know, would

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.700
[Amit Varma]: not come from other economists, but from someone who reads a lot of literature, which is where

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:22.780
[Amit Varma]: you've pointed out quote, over time, original sins become lasting virtues, stop quote. And

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.420
[Amit Varma]: that's something I'll come back to, because I think some of the original sins are not

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.340
[Amit Varma]: these specific policies, but a way of thinking about the world, which, you know, one can

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:37.460
[Amit Varma]: argue, remains to this current day. And those debates sort of over the, you know, the 1980s,

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.460
[Amit Varma]: your 2004 paper with Danny Roderick, the debates with Srinivasan, Panagaria, and so on. It's

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:48.140
[Amit Varma]: very fascinating. But what kind of strikes me is that even these sort of reforms where

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:53.300
[Amit Varma]: first you have the pro business reforms of the 80s, and you remove some of these restrictions,

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:58.140
[Amit Varma]: and then the limited liberalization of 91, which, you know, did not touch factor markets

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.380
[Amit Varma]: and so much more could have been done. But despite them being so limited, they had such

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.660
[Amit Varma]: a massive impact on the people, you know, they caused so much good that one can only,

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.260
[Amit Varma]: you know, fantasize about what the counterfactual could have been.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:16.460
[Guest]: Yeah. So I think I mean, just to go back on a couple of points on the historical thing,

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:23.300
[Guest]: right. You know, when I try and understand why we did industrial licensing, and you know,

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:29.780
[Guest]: that whole apparatus of regulating and taxing domestic industry. And, you see, one has to

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:36.020
[Guest]: try and understand that. And one of the ways I think one partial explanation is that, to

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:44.460
[Guest]: me, that it was kind of like the Gandhian overlay on kind of policy, which is that,

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:49.980
[Guest]: you know, remember, in those days, we had this mortal fear of big, you know, big business,

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.340
[Guest]: you know, people becoming too big, and therefore, you know, what will happen to our democracy

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.900
[Guest]: if you know, if you have these very powerful actors. So in a sense, the only way one of

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:03.380
[Guest]: the ways I understand this whole industrial licensing was to say that, you know, we don't

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.420
[Guest]: want even domestic capital, we don't want them to that's why we had, you know, MRTP.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:17.100
[Guest]: And you know, the sticks and carrots given to remaining small, and preventing small from

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:24.660
[Guest]: becoming big. I think I see that as, you know, the other big idea underlying the early choices,

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:30.620
[Guest]: you know. So, you know, so if you go deeper than just saying, why did we tax, you know,

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.340
[Guest]: domestic capital, I think the deeper thing is that, you know, this, you know, kind of

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:39.220
[Guest]: thing we had for small, but it was Kadi village industries, you know, reservation for the

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:44.940
[Guest]: small scale sector, you know, you know, all these laws applying, coming into play when

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:51.500
[Guest]: you be exceeding certain size, and the whole fiscal regulatory apparatus, if you look back,

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:57.940
[Guest]: was really about, you know, you know, favouring the small and preventing the becoming big.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:03.540
[Guest]: And I would argue that, you know, that aspect actually has come to hurt us quite a lot over

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.780
[Guest]: time, especially when we look more recently at how we've done on, you know, low skill

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:13.060
[Guest]: manufacturing, which, you know, exports of low skill manufacturing, which require really

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.380
[Guest]: size, and so on. So I think that's one thing, one historical fact, I think, which we should

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:24.860
[Guest]: keep in mind. The other is this whole premature democracy thing, right? I think that, as you

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:31.340
[Guest]: rightly said, that, you know, the famous finding is that, you know, by definition, democracy,

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:35.780
[Guest]: you know, if you look at the work of Ace Mogloo and Robinson, they almost say that, you know,

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:40.980
[Guest]: democracy, in a sense, was a pre commitment to redistribution, in a way that just a promise

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:47.940
[Guest]: of redistribution could not guarantee. So democracies have to redistribute. And of course,

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:53.940
[Guest]: in addition, remember, what is distinctive about India, is that you not just have the

00:45:53.940 --> 00:46:03.220
[Guest]: imperative of redistribution on one axis of class, you also have it on, obviously, caste,

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.740
[Guest]: you know, we have so you have it on the base of region, that's why we had all these policies

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:12.260
[Guest]: which says, you know, region should be whatever. So when you have this desire to redistribute,

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:18.660
[Guest]: or this imperative to redistribute on along not just one line, but many lines, you know,

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:23.940
[Guest]: you're going to have a problem. And the premature part comes in is that, you know,

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:29.060
[Guest]: your capacity to do that is just completely incommensurate with that. And kind of this

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:34.500
[Guest]: speaks to your point about, you know, you inherit a state that's basically a kind of,

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:41.380
[Guest]: you know, police state performing all these functions. It neither has the capacity nor

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:47.540
[Guest]: the remember, I think we should be harsh on our early things, that after all the state at that

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:51.380
[Guest]: point should have said, you know, we can't do many things. But we should provide say health

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:56.100
[Guest]: and education to everyone, like what China did, they didn't do that. And of course, you don't

00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:02.580
[Guest]: have the fiscal capacity, either to deliver on redistribution, or in kind of raising the resources

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:10.980
[Guest]: required to this. So that is why what happens is that redistribution willy nilly takes the form

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:17.700
[Guest]: of messing with the price system. Because remember, prices are the, you know, if you can't,

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:22.500
[Guest]: you know, today, we say, you know, redistribute, either you build schools or whatever education,

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:28.020
[Guest]: or you have transfers, efficient transfers, whatever, right? But then you had neither.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:33.380
[Guest]: And then so the only way you redistribute is through messing around with the price system

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:38.900
[Guest]: and distorting everything, you know, low prices for goods, cheap inputs. And so you just

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:45.380
[Guest]: tamper systematically with the price system. And then that's what, you know, persists over time,

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:51.620
[Guest]: it exacts a huge cost toll in terms of the economy. But again, I think you can be very

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:57.540
[Guest]: critical about it. But I think the criticism should be more that conditional or not,

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:04.180
[Guest]: either being able to, or choosing to do other forms of redistribution, then you're willy nilly

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:11.060
[Guest]: left with this. So just to give you a modern day counterpart of this, you know, and this is the

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:16.260
[Guest]: GST, and because I was kind of privy to these discussions. So take the GST discussion, for

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.140
[Guest]: example, right, on the what should be the rate structure for the GST. And I think this really

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:28.580
[Guest]: really typifies the early dilemma in some ways, except that it's 75 years on. So we all know that,

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:33.700
[Guest]: you know, one rate is the best system, you know, by definition, you know, that's, it's clean,

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:38.660
[Guest]: it's simple, it reduces corruption, it's easy to administer, it's going to improve your tax

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:46.180
[Guest]: collection efficiency. And as the IMF shows, I think, after 2000, almost 80% of the countries

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:52.580
[Guest]: that adopted the value added tax, which is the GST, went in for one rate. So in India,

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:57.380
[Guest]: so we have this discussion, as you know, I wrote a report then saying, we should have three rates,

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:04.020
[Guest]: not one rate. Now, think of it this way, that I would have been completely in favor of one rate,

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:12.900
[Guest]: right. But remember, though, if you go for one rate, you will have to have some rates going up,

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:17.380
[Guest]: right, you know, the rates for essential goods will have to have one rate by definition,

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.140
[Guest]: some will go up, some will come down, but some will go up. And those going up will be

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:26.340
[Guest]: affecting those, you know, those are goods generally consumed by poorer people. So what do

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:33.300
[Guest]: you do? If you have instruments to protect, you know, those in some ways, you know, transfers,

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:40.020
[Guest]: whatever, then of course, you would say, you know, one rate. But if you don't have those,

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.340
[Guest]: you have a dilemma, right? Can you just say one rate and say, you know, go to hell? I mean,

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:49.300
[Guest]: I think the political process will not allow that. What we've done historically, of course,

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:55.140
[Guest]: is, you know, for every good we say, oh, this is consumed by this strata, this is consumed by this

00:49:55.140 --> 00:50:00.340
[Guest]: strata. So you have a multiplicity of rates. Each of them is, you know, trying to meet two

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:05.220
[Guest]: objectives, the efficiency objective, and the kind of equity objective, but, you know, in all its

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:11.060
[Guest]: messy complexity. So what I thought the compromise was that we can't do one, because state capacity

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:18.420
[Guest]: is limited to do the compensation. Therefore, a compromise would be to have, you know, one rate,

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:23.780
[Guest]: but applying to all goods at the lower end, you know, a standard rate, and of course, one demerit

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.900
[Guest]: good, which, you know, applies to all the luxuries and so on. So in some ways, the three rate

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:33.700
[Guest]: structure that, you know, that I propose, of course, in practice, and now it's become a multiple,

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:38.660
[Guest]: multiple rate structure. And so it's gotten, it's really, it's gone back to the side of

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:46.180
[Guest]: erring on complexity. And actually, so conceptually, therefore, you know, a three rate was kind of a

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:52.420
[Guest]: compromise between efficiency and equity, because you couldn't ignore equity completely. But

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:57.220
[Guest]: historically, what we did was, you know, we would have as many rates as there are categories of

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.860
[Guest]: people we wanted to satisfy. And so that, in a sense, was the early dilemma that, you know,

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:08.500
[Guest]: you didn't have, remember, in 2016, we at least have some mechanisms for redistribution, like

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:14.340
[Guest]: PDS, Monrega, you know, now more and more cash transfers, but at that stage, we had nothing. So

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:19.060
[Guest]: willy nilly, the price system had to bear the brunt of that. And that's where we were. So in

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:24.180
[Guest]: some ways, therefore, you know, again, one has to be careful, it's not that, I mean, obviously,

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:29.780
[Guest]: you know, maintaining and sustaining a democracy are fantastic achievements. And you know, what's

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:37.540
[Guest]: happening to that now, of course, is not within my range of expertise. But to not realise that that

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:44.660
[Guest]: created also some serious consequences and adverse consequences and burdens, one could almost call

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:49.620
[Guest]: it the democracy tax, as it were the premature democracy tax, as it were, you know, you could

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.620
[Guest]: see that happening. And to some extent, I think we're paying the price for that.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:58.260
[Amit Varma]: While you were speaking, a couple of related questions popped up to mind about sort of that

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.420
[Amit Varma]: sort of that historic period before we come closer to present time. So I wonder what you

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:08.020
[Amit Varma]: sort of think about these. One, it's always it's not always one in the last couple of years or

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:12.740
[Amit Varma]: more, I've been reading up on it. And I've done a bunch of episodes on the history of and politics

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:17.620
[Amit Varma]: of that period. It struck me that much as we think of the 50s as a time which were Nehruvian,

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:23.300
[Amit Varma]: it strikes me that only Nehru was Nehruvian. And it was kind of serendipitous that he was a man in

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:28.900
[Amit Varma]: charge. Now, it certainly seems to me to be this way, at least in the social domain. For example,

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:34.020
[Amit Varma]: if you look at all the other tall leaders of the Congress from Patel to Prasad to Pant to

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:40.180
[Amit Varma]: Lal Bahadur Shastri later, and all of those guys were leaders with a tilt towards Hindu nationalism,

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.740
[Amit Varma]: like you know, Pant was CM of UP and Lal Bahadur Shastri was Home Minister when the idol was

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:50.260
[Amit Varma]: installed in the Babri Masjid. So there it seems that Nehru was a man who kind of stood alone.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:55.380
[Amit Varma]: But in economics, is it necessarily the case that, you know, had Nehru not been there,

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.740
[Amit Varma]: for example, I think socially, India would have looked very different. But economically,

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:03.060
[Amit Varma]: would it have been any different? I mean, one hears of the exceptions like Rajaji and Masani

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:08.820
[Amit Varma]: and so on, who were sort of, of a different bent of mind. But one, do your readings give you a

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.060
[Amit Varma]: sense that there were different directions that could have happened? And it was this one individual

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.780
[Amit Varma]: who happened to be there. And, you know, that's just how the luck played out. And the other

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:22.660
[Amit Varma]: question which is related, so I'll, you know, ask it at the same time is that it seems to me that a

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:30.340
[Amit Varma]: lot of the economic policy of, you know, that period was determined after actual intellectual

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:35.300
[Amit Varma]: query where people were grappling with these questions in good faith. Even if we can look back

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:39.700
[Amit Varma]: in hindsight and say this was a bad decision, or this was a good decision, they were grappling with

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:45.460
[Amit Varma]: it in good faith and trying to figure it out on the basis of ideas. But what seems to me to have

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.820
[Amit Varma]: happened towards the end of the 1960s, is that, you know, we know that a lot of Indira Gandhi's

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:55.780
[Amit Varma]: leftward tail, the bank nationalization sphera, and so on and so forth, a lot of that leftward

00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:01.460
[Amit Varma]: tilt was because she had to politically position herself as being distinctive from the syndicate,

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:07.380
[Amit Varma]: who were her rivals in the Congress. And it seems that at that point, there are sort of three other

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:13.540
[Amit Varma]: imperatives that gradually come into the play and consolidate. One is political imperatives and the

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:19.940
[Amit Varma]: incentives that politicians face, either if they are appealing to populism or to short termism,

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:25.140
[Amit Varma]: because, hey, everybody's got their eye on the next elections. Second, the natural inertia that

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:30.820
[Amit Varma]: sets in into any system, particularly a large bureaucratic system, like ours, and not just

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:36.740
[Amit Varma]: inertia of action, but inertia of thought. And third, the interest groups which then get settled

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:43.300
[Amit Varma]: in and entrenched and make it difficult to change anything. So was that perhaps a tragic shift,

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.420
[Amit Varma]: which people don't remark on that we begin with policies that we can criticize today in hindsight,

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:53.300
[Amit Varma]: but that were made in good faith with people like Nehru actually engaging with ideas, but we move

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:58.500
[Amit Varma]: to a cynical time where ideas don't really matter. And you have these incentives from these three

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:05.940
[Guest]: different directions, driving policy. Yeah, I mean, really a terrific question. You see,

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:12.420
[Guest]: I think that we forget when we look at kind of histories of nations, and that there are these

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:19.940
[Guest]: critical junctures in countries' history when, you know, some special things can happen. You know,

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:24.740
[Guest]: it could be at the time of independence, it could be a revolution, it could be a crisis.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:29.220
[Guest]: So there is something I feel if you look at historically, something distinctive about

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:34.500
[Guest]: certain points in time. And I think, you know, clearly for India, that distinctive period was

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:40.580
[Guest]: the post-independence period, partly a result of this. So I think therefore, kind of two or

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:47.380
[Guest]: three things come together, right? One is this moment of, you know, idealism, and so on. And

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:53.620
[Guest]: that's critical juncture. Second is almost intrinsic to these movements is you are going to

00:55:53.620 --> 00:56:01.700
[Guest]: have politicians with the temperament of, you know, let's set aside personal things, and whatever.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:07.460
[Guest]: Maybe the third aspect what happened in those early years also was kind of the dominance of

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:12.420
[Guest]: the Congress Party. So you don't have, you know, political competition. I'm not saying that's

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:16.820
[Guest]: necessarily good. But you did have this kind of, you know, because when Mrs. Gandhi comes into

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:20.660
[Guest]: power, it becomes more competitive. And as Atul Kohli and others have shown, you know, that,

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.740
[Guest]: you know, that creates the whole dynamic that you mentioned about interests, and you know,

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:30.500
[Guest]: you need money and so on. So I think a combination of these three things, you know, the critical

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:36.180
[Guest]: moment, the idealism, the quality of leaders, you know, the monopoly of the political monopoly,

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:41.620
[Guest]: which kind of allows you to do certain things that might otherwise not happen. But then that

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:47.540
[Guest]: comes to the other point that you raised about, you know, was it all Nehru? You know, I think it's

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:52.420
[Guest]: undeniable that, you know, state led industrialization, you know, the emphasis on

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.820
[Guest]: technology, the emphasis on higher education, I think that certainly comes from, you know,

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:00.180
[Guest]: you read Discovery of India and things, you know, what he wants the, you know, the whole

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:04.980
[Guest]: rationalism emphasis on science, because as you know, I think somewhere in Discovery of India,

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:10.900
[Guest]: he says, quite prescient, I mean, quite accurately, that if you look at history, for example,

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:20.260
[Guest]: around 1450, Mughal India, Aztec America, Aztec Mexico, the Ottoman Empire, were, you know, and

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:25.460
[Guest]: of course, Ming China, were at the top of, you know, development. And that's when the Great

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:30.260
[Guest]: Reversal happens, you know, from about 1500 1600 onwards, and then you have the Great Reversal,

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:35.700
[Guest]: where the two rich countries become poor. And Nehru's point is that even then, we were losing

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:40.900
[Guest]: this edge in science and technology, which kind of contributed. So he was very much into that,

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:50.420
[Guest]: and therefore, but having said that, you know, he had a really dominant role, I think we forget that,

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:55.940
[Guest]: you know, one agriculture, you know, agricultural income was never allowed to be taxed, not because

00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:01.060
[Guest]: of Nehru, he would have happily taxed it, it's because of, you know, Sardar Patel and the whole,

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:06.980
[Guest]: you know, agricultural thing. Then you also have, as I just said, you know, the overlay of, you

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:12.500
[Guest]: know, small, remaining small, it's not just a Nehruvian obsession, I think it's also this, you

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:17.300
[Guest]: know, broader obsession with remaining small, which is, I think, you know, partly a Gandhi

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:23.860
[Guest]: legacy, you know, village and small and so on. And of course, also, we forget that, you know,

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:29.540
[Guest]: I think Nehru's instincts would have been to push land reform much more. But you know, land reform

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:33.780
[Guest]: never went anywhere, because partly it was his own democratic instinct, you know, you don't want

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:39.140
[Guest]: anything by coercion, but partly there was this broader thing, I think. So therefore, while his

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:46.260
[Guest]: imprint was very strong, you know, he loved these big temples and dams and things, you know,

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:50.020
[Guest]: so all of that, that whole commanding heights, I think is very much him, but there were lots of

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:56.740
[Guest]: other things, which perhaps were not due to him. And, you know, again, counterfactual history is

00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:01.700
[Guest]: very difficult, because my sense is that, and I think it's an important point that we forget,

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:11.220
[Guest]: that I'm not sure, you know, the whole Rajaji's strand of thinking, whether that was ever dominant

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:17.460
[Guest]: enough to have, you know, because at that stage, you know, people were completely unfamiliar with

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:23.220
[Guest]: how a market economy in all its kind of full blown thing functions. So I think it would have been,

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:28.020
[Guest]: you know, I think our choices, even looking back, I think our choices would have been,

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:33.220
[Guest]: you know, statism or less statism, never, you know, a full blown kind of market economy. But

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:36.980
[Guest]: I think some of the more egregious, I mean, industrial licensing, I think, was something

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:42.820
[Guest]: that we could have really avoided. And of course, I think, you know, I'm just being, you know,

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:49.300
[Guest]: unnecessarily kind of, you know, bold here. But I think, had we done the education and health

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:55.060
[Guest]: that a state should have done, and, you know, not had industrial licensing, for example,

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:59.620
[Guest]: and allowed actually domestic entrepreneurship to flourish, you know, maybe, you know,

00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:04.020
[Amit Varma]: trajectory of Indian history would have been different. On that wistful note, let's take a

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:11.460
[Amit Varma]: quick commercial break. On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive sum games.

[Amit Varma]: at IndianColors.com. Welcome back to the scene and the unseen. I'm chatting with Arvind Subramanian

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.780
[Amit Varma]: on both the fascinating journey of India as an economy and his own fascinating journey in

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:36.500
[Amit Varma]: playing a part in shaping this economy. And we've sort of been stuck in history for the first half

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:41.940
[Amit Varma]: of the show. Let's let's kind of get closer to modern times now where you've kind of spoken

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:49.460
[Amit Varma]: about one of the transitions that India made was in sort of moving from socialism with restricted

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:56.820
[Amit Varma]: entry to capitalism without exit. And you've also spoken about the latinization of the Indian

01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:01.540
[Amit Varma]: economy. And all this is, of course, happening post liberalization. And, you know, so tell me a

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:08.580
[Amit Varma]: little bit about these currents of change that are happening within the Indian economy, you know,

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:14.660
[Amit Varma]: for the two decades leading up to 2014, when you know, you finally arrive in India as a CEA.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:21.700
[Guest]: So I think that India's growth takes off in the 1980s. And then we have this macroeconomic crisis

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:27.700
[Guest]: in 1991. Of course, partly it was because the 80s growth was also fueled by this, you know,

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:34.260
[Guest]: fiscal binge that we went on. And of course, the fiscal binge we went on was partly also for the

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:39.700
[Guest]: first time politics becomes remember, at that stage, the Congress loses monopoly, not just at

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:44.580
[Guest]: the center, but also in the states. So politics becomes much more competitive. And therefore,

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:50.420
[Guest]: I think we find, you know, fiscal policy becoming much more an instrument of, you know,

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:55.220
[Guest]: politics, a much more intrinsic, you know, part of politics. And we have this binge, we have,

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:59.300
[Guest]: you know, imports, you know, going up, classic running out of foreign exchange, it's what,

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:03.780
[Guest]: you know, Krugman and call a first generation crisis was essentially, you have a fixed exchange

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.340
[Guest]: rate, the government spends too much, you run out of foreign exchange, and lo and behold,

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:14.020
[Guest]: and then of course, we had, you know, the real opening of the Indian economy. We move from the

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:20.500
[Guest]: pro business reforms of the 1980s, to the pro market and the pro competition reforms in the 90s.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:25.220
[Guest]: And of course, you know, there are different phases, what happens, but essentially,

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:30.100
[Guest]: when I look back at the Indian economy, and I'm, you know, doing some work with a colleague,

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:36.100
[Guest]: Sumitra Chatterjee, on how India's trade is done. But if you look back, I think that the 90s and

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:43.060
[Guest]: the 2000s, leading up to about 2011-2012, I think it was just a golden age for the Indian economy.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:48.340
[Guest]: I think that, you know, in broad terms, I'll come to what happened, why it kind of ran out of steam.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:53.380
[Guest]: But I think it was a golden age, you know, we were obviously we opened up, we reaped a lot of

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:59.700
[Guest]: the benefits of opening up the efficiency, and so on. Then, of course, we had this,

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:04.260
[Guest]: some would say serendipitous, whatever this discovery of the service sector, the IT sector.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:12.260
[Guest]: But if you look at the 90s and 2000s, I'm beginning to see how across the board,

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:18.340
[Guest]: how well the economy performed. It was not just, you know, services, it was not just manufacturing,

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:23.700
[Guest]: it was just across the board. So clearly, we reaped benefits. And what has struck me recently

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.700
[Guest]: is that, you know, in the boom of the 2000s, you know, every economy in the world boomed,

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:33.540
[Guest]: but we did much better even relative to other economies. Even our exports were growing

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:39.620
[Guest]: gangbusters in the 2000s. That's something that I've been really surprised by. So we had this,

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:44.580
[Guest]: you know, incredible, you know, kind of the golden age of, you know, the Indian economy

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:50.740
[Guest]: in the 90s and 2000s. Definitely, you know, some of it, of course, as we said earlier,

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:55.620
[Guest]: is also catch up, you know, you do a little bit of reform, you're so far away from the frontier,

01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:02.340
[Guest]: you know, our per capita GDP, let's say 1980 was like, probably 3-4% of US per capita GDP.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.660
[Guest]: So, you know, there is a logic which says, if you're very far behind, you will have some

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:12.100
[Guest]: advantage of cheaper labor, you know, so you can grow much more rapidly. And so we reaped,

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:16.260
[Guest]: so a combination of, you know, that, you know, the advantage of backwardness, as it were,

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:22.820
[Guest]: we were very poor, then we did these reforms. And, you know, some basic, you know, ability

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:28.740
[Guest]: in the economy, some, you know, skilled labor, some modicum of state capacity, whatever,

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:35.700
[Guest]: allowed us to do gangbusters. And then, of course, you know, the global financial crisis happens,

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:41.220
[Guest]: you know, the world economy collapses. And really, my reading is that we never really

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.740
[Guest]: recovered from that era. So that, in a sense, was what happened. We never really recovered from

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:55.780
[Guest]: that. And of course, you know, this is where I think a new kind of problem arises. And the other

01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:00.980
[Guest]: and the other problem that is, let me speak about both of these, is that, remember, we never

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:04.660
[Guest]: believed in markets, we never believed in capitalism, right? I mean, that is always,

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:11.860
[Guest]: and in a sense, the license quota Raj, kind of, in some extent, intensified that, you know,

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:16.100
[Guest]: you could, in fact, some people call it the era of crony socialism, not just crony capitalism,

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:22.580
[Guest]: but crony socialism, some truth to that. I mean, we forget today, how even some of the early

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:29.060
[Guest]: entrepreneurs, I mean, really became big by manipulating the minutiae of the excise and

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:35.220
[Guest]: tariff code. I mean, you know, it's incredible, right? So it was always, you know, it was always

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:41.140
[Guest]: stigmatized capitalism, we forget. Then, of course, we had this brief period where we says,

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:48.020
[Guest]: wow, you know, we've now got at least a modicum of capitalism, which is not based on proximity

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:52.820
[Guest]: to the state, or favors from the state. And that was the rise of the services, you know,

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:58.740
[Guest]: that whole period of the services boom, it was not just services, but saying, wow, India can do

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:04.660
[Guest]: a form of capitalism, that is, you know, based on good governance, corporate governance,

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:08.900
[Guest]: based on not getting favors from government, and, you know, and can be internationally competitive.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:13.460
[Guest]: So this is kind of, you know, the brief window when we said, Oh, my God, you know,

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:18.980
[Guest]: Indian capitalism is here. And then, of course, what happens is that we have all these scandals

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:26.660
[Guest]: of the 2000s, you know, so the way I phrase that period, you know, what Rajaji called the license

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:32.740
[Guest]: quota permit Raj, I call that period the rents Raj, because, and you know, just to be a little

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:38.660
[Guest]: bit cute about this, I said, you have ethereal rents, terrestrial rents and subterranean rents,

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:44.660
[Guest]: which is, you know, spectrum, you know, land, coal, you know, so the rents Raj. And then,

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:49.140
[Guest]: of course, the rents Raj is absolutely devastating, because, you know, you say,

01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:54.260
[Guest]: you're back to this old kind of, you know, stigmatized, sort of a crony, socialism,

01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:01.540
[Guest]: capitalism, but really, we're not really gone past that, you know, really messy relationship

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:07.060
[Guest]: between the state and capital. And, of course, as a result, you know, both come out with their

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:13.460
[Guest]: legitimacy completely undermined. And so therefore, you know, we're back in a sense,

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:20.660
[Guest]: post those scandals, in terms of political economy, we're back to a situation where,

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:26.340
[Guest]: you know, neither the state nor the thing has legitimacy. So what do you do about it? So coming

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:31.860
[Guest]: now to the period that, you know, I was in government for 2013-14 onwards, I mean, I do

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:38.740
[Guest]: think that a lot of the choices looking back, oh, sorry, the other thing I forgot to mention in that

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:44.580
[Guest]: era of, you know, thing was the whole, you know, we had the infrastructure boom, but it also was

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:50.500
[Guest]: financed by, you know, the public sector with all the phone, telephone banking, and all that. So

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:56.500
[Guest]: that is part of the rents Raj that happened. So fast forward to 20, you know, 14, 15, so on,

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:03.860
[Guest]: I think a lot of the choices then were taking place against the, you know, background of this,

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:10.500
[Guest]: you know, stigmatized capitalism. So that constrains a kind of lot of your choices

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.860
[Guest]: going forward. So and of course, and this is where then you come to this capitalism without

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:20.900
[Guest]: exit problem. And the two are related. And I'll explain that you had a question. So let me explain

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:26.260
[Amit Varma]: that. Yeah, I just wanted to sort of sum up my understanding of this period and ask you if

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:30.820
[Amit Varma]: you know, it broadly sounds okay to you and also end with a question. And one is that it seems to

01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:35.940
[Amit Varma]: me that what happened in 91 was obviously that it was serendipitous. It was a crisis, we had no choice.

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:40.420
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I've had Ajay Shah on the show before, and he's spoken about how they would,

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:45.620
[Amit Varma]: you know, that intellectual infrastructure of reforms was actually happening from the 80s.

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:51.460
[Amit Varma]: You know, you had would be reformers all their thinking along those lines. And there was some

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:55.620
[Amit Varma]: back end there, it wasn't just serendipitous. But what it seems to me that happened was that

01:09:55.620 --> 01:10:00.340
[Amit Varma]: local crisis forced us into this bunch of changes. But then we got complacent very fast.

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.420
[Amit Varma]: We took the progress, we took the growth for granted, we took the progress for granted.

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:09.300
[Amit Varma]: But the mindset remained the same. The state apparatus remained the same with the Indian

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:14.340
[Amit Varma]: state remained one which doesn't do like it should do a few things well, instead of which it does a

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:20.580
[Amit Varma]: lot of things badly. And that kind of broadly continued. So no mindset change. And we take the

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:25.220
[Amit Varma]: growth for granted and don't learn the big lessons that we should learn from it about unleashing

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:30.580
[Amit Varma]: private entrepreneurship and so on. And then there's this excellent book by Pooja Mehra,

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.740
[Amit Varma]: I wonder what you think about it called The Lost Decade, where she recounts the events,

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:43.140
[Amit Varma]: you know, after 2008, and what happened in UPA2, where basically, because of the terrorist attacks

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.780
[Amit Varma]: in Bombay, Chidambaram is shifted to the Home Ministry. And so Sonia Gandhi wants Pranab

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:52.900
[Amit Varma]: Mukherjee in the Finance Ministry as he's installed there, and he remains there for a long period.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:58.820
[Amit Varma]: And his mindset is the 70s sort of socialist mindset of the Indira Gandhi era. And it is

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:03.140
[Amit Varma]: pretty disastrous, because that is when you know, you're having the phone alone scandals, you're

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:09.380
[Amit Varma]: having the retrospective taxation. And it's as if the mindset has just done a complete reverse,

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:14.340
[Amit Varma]: and we start going downhill. And Pooja's narrative, of course, has him being booted upstairs to the

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.820
[Amit Varma]: presidency. But there's not enough time for Chidambaram back in the Finance Ministry to make

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:24.660
[Amit Varma]: much of a difference. And she describes that period of the, you know, when the Modi government

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:29.380
[Amit Varma]: comes into power, the first few months is being pretty hopeful, you have the bankruptcy code,

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:34.900
[Amit Varma]: you have a lot of good people in good positions like yourself, and, you know, like Mr. Panagari

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:39.300
[Amit Varma]: at Niti Aayog and whatever, so there is some hope that reform will happen. But then there are those

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:44.660
[Amit Varma]: jibes of Sood Bhut ki Sarkar, and then there are, you know, state elections being lost. And,

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:49.780
[Amit Varma]: you know, like you also mentioned, the Sood Bhut ki Sarkar jibe, in a sense, speaks directly to

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:54.740
[Amit Varma]: the fear of stigmatized capitalism. And what has happened in all this time is that people in India,

01:11:54.740 --> 01:12:01.300
[Amit Varma]: sadly, still confuse pro markets and pro business and they still, you know, mistake capitalism for

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.700
[Amit Varma]: cronyism, whether you call it crony socialism or crony capitalism doesn't really matter. But it's,

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:11.620
[Amit Varma]: it's cronyism, it's not free markets. And all of this leads to the political imperatives changing

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:17.940
[Amit Varma]: and not enough reform happening there. And we'll, of course, get to the sort of the specific

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:24.420
[Amit Varma]: economic policies of the Modi government after this. But, you know, is this a summary that you

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:30.900
[Amit Varma]: broadly sort of agree with? And if so, or if not, were you sort of, you know, how cognizant were you

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:36.820
[Amit Varma]: of this entire changing picture and the politics of the situation when you joined?

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:42.740
[Guest]: Yeah, firstly, just going back to the point that you made about the 1990 reform, I think that

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.620
[Guest]: there is no doubt that it was, of course, part the crisis, but there's no doubt that there was a,

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:55.940
[Guest]: you know, something else going on. And I would put that something else, partly as, of course,

01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:02.420
[Guest]: all these, you know, would be reformers, you know, exposed to ideas outside coming in, and, you know,

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:09.140
[Guest]: and, you know, having more, more influence. But I also think that, you know, if you look back,

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:15.780
[Guest]: after all, it's not that just again, intellectual history, that in the 70s and 80s, after all,

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.700
[Guest]: people said, look, look at the East Asian tigers, they're doing well, you know, what you guys,

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.740
[Guest]: I think that the reaction, the pushback always was, you know, but we're India, we're big,

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:30.740
[Guest]: whatever. But I think a critical element of the change also was the rise of China. I think that

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:36.180
[Guest]: China was a country that, you know, embraced reforms, foreign direct investment, etc. I mean,

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:41.140
[Guest]: we come to the, you know, the other part of the Chinese stories, which also which we haven't

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:46.100
[Guest]: internalised, which is the early health and education thing that we'll talk about. But

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.340
[Guest]: certainly when you know, when China in the 80s started booming and embracing things, I think

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:55.620
[Guest]: that took the final leg out of the, you know, the pushback that oh, no, no, this is not for us,

01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:00.580
[Guest]: we are whatever. So absolutely right. I think there was intellectual thing building up. But

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:06.900
[Guest]: also shaped by experiences around the world, and a critical one being the rise of China.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:13.460
[Guest]: See, now, coming back to, you know, what you said about, you know, Pooja Mehra's excellent book,

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:21.060
[Guest]: and how you read what happened. Look, I don't think we have to be a little bit careful here.

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:27.380
[Guest]: I don't think anyone believes today that we should go back to, you know, 60s, 70s style

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:32.980
[Guest]: statism. And I think there has been a decisive shift. I think that's no, I don't think there's

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:40.260
[Guest]: any, it's more, I think that once we've transitioned from the state as owner to the

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:46.100
[Guest]: state as regulator, and the state potentially as provider of other public goods, I think that's

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:53.060
[Guest]: where I think now the locus of action has shifted to that. I think the problem is that all these

01:14:53.060 --> 01:15:00.580
[Guest]: discussions have really been, you know, messed up by that experience of the 2000s and all that

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.460
[Guest]: happened that you described. And you described that, you know, in Pooja Mehra's book as well.

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:12.820
[Guest]: And look, I think the closer we are to history, the more we try and put it down to individuals

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:18.180
[Guest]: and so on. In a way that I think it's something that we need to guard against. I think it's true

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:23.060
[Guest]: that, you know, in the 50s, we were talking about the 50s, we talked about, you know, not just Nehru,

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.220
[Guest]: but all the things. So there's a natural, the closer you are, the more you try and look at it

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:31.460
[Guest]: in terms of, you know, individuals, and he went here and he went there. And all that I'm not saying

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:37.700
[Guest]: is not true. It's just that I think that we don't have the kind of distance to step back and say,

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:46.340
[Guest]: are there kind of deeper things going wrong. And in my view that, you know, it's not that I think

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:53.300
[Guest]: we said, let's go back to statism. No, I think we've decisively, the sense that I think that

01:15:53.300 --> 01:16:00.500
[Guest]: we should be more open is there. So if you look at the early, some of the early actions in the

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:05.300
[Guest]: Modi government, so, you know, opening up to FDI, for example, was a thing. And, you know,

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:10.660
[Guest]: there's the whole exit problem that we realized that, you know, remember that, you see, I think

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:15.300
[Guest]: this is where I think we need to be a little bit careful about history also is that the exit

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:22.420
[Guest]: the exit problem was first signaled in a sense by Ashish Gupta and the House of Debt reports,

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:28.740
[Guest]: we were seeing that that was happening, right. And of course, essentially, everyone played this

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:35.140
[Guest]: extended pretend strategy, because, you know, exit is very difficult in India. And that's why

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:42.420
[Guest]: I think capitalism that exit is a serious problem. Now, let's kind of delve. So in the early period,

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:48.580
[Guest]: there was definitely a sense of optimism. And let me say one thing that's a little bit, I think,

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:54.100
[Guest]: it kind of speaks to this, you know, reduced legitimacy of the state and markets, right.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:59.780
[Guest]: So if you were to ask me, just, you know, as an outsider, as someone who, you know,

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:03.380
[Guest]: thinks a little bit about these things, to say, okay, how do you reverse this, you know,

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:08.580
[Guest]: because stigmatized capitalism is not going to go away, you know, whatever, right? It has to be

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:16.180
[Guest]: done consistently over time. And one, the only way you kind of reverse that is the state acquiring

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:25.380
[Guest]: legitimacy, right, in one sense, and state saying, we will be distant from capital. Now, in some

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:31.540
[Guest]: ways, you could interpret the early actions of the Modi government as going exactly in that

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:36.820
[Guest]: direction. Remember, the complaints that happened from business that, you know, you know, nobody

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:42.260
[Guest]: sees us, you know, etc, etc. That was, I think, one way of signaling that, you know, we were going

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:47.540
[Guest]: to, you know, put our distance with, you know, crony capital. I mean, people would say it wasn't

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:52.340
[Guest]: uniform and so on. But anyway, but at least the at least the overt signal was, you know,

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:59.060
[Guest]: we are going to be distant. And then on the other side, and this is where I think this, in my view,

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:04.740
[Guest]: was one of the major, you know, partial achievements of the government, which I think

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:12.740
[Guest]: needs to think, is that, and this is what I think is the distinctive brand of the new welfarism

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:18.580
[Guest]: of the Prime Minister. Now, remember, the old welfarism is, you know, you have to, you know,

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:23.620
[Guest]: give these, you know, all the handouts, you know, I mean, I'm just caricaturing here, handouts,

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:29.460
[Guest]: you know, PDS, Monrega, whatever, you do the handouts. But the Modi brand of the new welfarism

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:38.340
[Guest]: was, as I call it in my book, the public provision of essential private goods and services, right?

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:42.980
[Guest]: It's, it's not a handout. So that's distinctive. It's not health and education. So it's not

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:47.620
[Guest]: providing public goods. And I'll explain for reasons why I think that was the case. But it's

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:54.580
[Guest]: the public provision of private goods, essential goods, you know, power, toilets, bank accounts,

01:18:54.580 --> 01:19:00.820
[Guest]: and then more recently, water, and there are a couple of others. So essentially, the logic is,

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:09.220
[Guest]: if you step back, is that the state regains legitimacy by delivering these things effectively.

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:14.020
[Guest]: So you regain the trust to be able to do the other things. And I'm going to give you an example of

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:20.100
[Guest]: that. And use it, you know, by leveraging the new technology. And that's what this old jam thing

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:25.140
[Guest]: came in, you know, Jaddan Aadhaar mobile, which, you know, the coin phrase that, you know, we coined

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:32.340
[Guest]: in the economic survey early on. So in some sense, the combination of, look, early on, so to put some

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:41.460
[Guest]: kind of method on that initial period, there's a Sudbhut Sarkar overhang, right? So we cannot do,

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:47.140
[Guest]: remember, and remember, this is people forget, the first opportunity to reform happened on coal,

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:53.220
[Guest]: when the Supreme Court said, you know, you can, you know, remember that in I think August of 2014,

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:58.820
[Guest]: before I joined government, the early opportunity to reform coal was there, you know, the Supreme

01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:03.860
[Guest]: Court came down in favor, but I think the government chose not to. So that was a Sudbhut

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:08.580
[Guest]: Sarkar because, you know, you don't want to be thing. But, you know, we distance ourselves from

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:14.420
[Guest]: capital. And we embark on this to regain the legitimacy of the state. And that's the new

01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:22.020
[Guest]: welfarism, the public provision of private goods and services. Then we come to the capitalism

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:28.900
[Guest]: without exit. So here's a problem, very evidence becoming bigger and bigger. And, you know, in 2014,

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:35.220
[Guest]: 2015, you know, many of us pointed this out. And, you know, of course, the wanted to the bad bank,

01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:42.580
[Guest]: the early attempt to grapple with this exit problem. Now, the problem, stigmatized capitalism

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:50.180
[Guest]: and capitalism without exit come together, because in order to exit, right, you have to do haircuts,

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:55.700
[Guest]: you have to, you know, do these things. And Sudbhut Sarkar means that no public official,

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:59.380
[Guest]: no thing is going to be, you know, in the business of doing this haircuts, because,

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:07.380
[Guest]: you know, immediately the allegation of crony capitalism would be alleged. And so, instead of

01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:14.260
[Guest]: a quick, expedited, executive led process, and this is what I wrote in my piece yesterday on Mr.

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:19.540
[Guest]: Jaitley as well. Therefore, you know, it was a really a pass the buck strategy to a judicial

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:24.420
[Guest]: process. Luckily, you know, the IBC had been passed. And, you know, they said, let's pass the

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:31.380
[Guest]: buck to the judicial process. And that's where I think the whole Sudbhut Sarkar once again,

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:35.460
[Guest]: came in the way of, you know, those decisions of, you know, we could have done it quicker,

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:40.580
[Guest]: faster, but it would require some political courage. But then we opted for this judicial

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:44.740
[Guest]: process. And, you know, we know what's happened on this judicial process. It's once again,

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:52.180
[Guest]: run up against all these things. But the point is that, I think, over the course of the government

01:21:52.180 --> 01:22:00.180
[Guest]: of this tenure, you know, at least the hope and the expectation was that accumulate enough

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:05.620
[Guest]: legitimacy by doing these other things, which are good in themselves. I mean, you know, after all,

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:08.980
[Guest]: provision of toilets, you know, nobody talked about toilets, you know, toilets, you know,

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:13.940
[Guest]: whatever is really the way to you gain the legitimacy that gives you the political space

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:19.460
[Guest]: to do the other things. So my own reading is that, you know, the corporate tax cut, for example,

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:25.620
[Guest]: is an example of, you know, because discussions of this happened early on. And there was no way

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:29.620
[Guest]: the corporate tax cut would have happened early on, because Sudbhut Sarkar, you come in and you

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:34.740
[Guest]: do the corporate tax cut, you know, this is just, you know, UPA2, but in a more legitimate way.

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:39.540
[Guest]: But then, you know, again, of course, there was, you know, challenging times, near crisis,

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:46.100
[Guest]: corporate taxes were done. But I do think that at that stage, the kind of confidence and courage to

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:52.660
[Guest]: do something that was explicitly pro capital came also because of having some accumulated,

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:58.740
[Guest]: some goodwill, some legitimacy and so on. So I think that's how I understand the process

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:04.980
[Guest]: by the way. And so, and of course, also the early hope that, you know, the government attracted a

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:11.540
[Guest]: lot of FDI, the GST happened, the IBC happened, this whole, you know, the new welfarism. So in

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:18.580
[Guest]: some ways, there was almost you could, you know, post facto, intellectualize this and say, look,

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:24.180
[Guest]: there was a kind of coherent thing. But then, of course, you know, things have turned out the way

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.060
[Amit Varma]: they have for various reasons. Yeah, no, that's extremely insightful. And I have a couple of

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:35.780
[Amit Varma]: follow up questions on that. Before we, you know, dive into your tenure as a CEA, one question that

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:40.340
[Amit Varma]: sort of strikes me, and this is also, you know, one of the chapter titles in your excellent book

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:47.700
[Amit Varma]: of counsel, where, you know, you write about the relationship of the state to the individual,

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:53.380
[Amit Varma]: and I want to sort of discuss this particular point, not with reference to your own role within

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:57.060
[Amit Varma]: role within the government or within this government at all, but just at the realm of

01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:03.460
[Amit Varma]: ideas, where it strikes me that when you speak about the relationship between the state and the

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:11.460
[Amit Varma]: individual sort of shifting, it seems to be shifting in a sense of better directed paternalism

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:17.300
[Amit Varma]: that, okay, you know, we'll do provision of these private goods, we'll use jam, which is, you know,

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:23.380
[Amit Varma]: gender and accounts and other and mobile, and we'll, you know, we'll do all of this much more efficiently.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:28.820
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we'll be legitimacy. And I kind of get that, but the mindset is still a paternalistic

01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:35.220
[Amit Varma]: one, it's saying will be paternalistic in a more efficient way. And what sort of the directional

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:40.420
[Amit Varma]: shift, which, you know, I crave to see, and I don't know how much of that we've seen, perhaps,

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:46.500
[Amit Varma]: since the watch by government is a shift towards, you know, empowering people to help themselves.

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.500
[Amit Varma]: I mean, markets are a mechanism through which, you know, society solves its own problems. That's

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:55.860
[Amit Varma]: how I've always seen them. And yet, you know, we've gained the ease of doing business ratings a

01:24:55.860 --> 01:25:01.540
[Amit Varma]: little bit, but it hasn't really improved. You know, I have so many friends who are who run

01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:06.900
[Amit Varma]: factories and who run businesses. And of course, this is anecdotal from my experience, but many of

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:12.820
[Amit Varma]: them are viscerally devastated and not now because of COVID or whatever, but you know, over the last

01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:18.020
[Amit Varma]: few years. So that's kind of one question where I have a little skepticism that if I want the

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:23.380
[Amit Varma]: relationship between the state and the individual defined, I would like it defined in terms of

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:29.060
[Amit Varma]: empowering individuals more to help themselves, which is what markets do, rather than, you know,

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:34.340
[Amit Varma]: more directed paternalism. And my other question, also, the thought that kind of struck me is

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:39.380
[Amit Varma]: something that you articulated while you were talking about it, when you spoke about the

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:45.140
[Amit Varma]: post facto nature of, you know, giving a direction to all of this, where what you know, you were

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:50.820
[Amit Varma]: speaking about that, okay, the state needs to improve its legitimacy. We can't do XYZ, like

01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:55.140
[Amit Varma]: corporate tax cuts, because of stigmatized capitalism, how do we improve legitimacy,

01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:59.380
[Amit Varma]: let's provide, you know, private services better and all of that. And all of that sounds very

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:05.220
[Amit Varma]: logical. But looking from the outside in, if one looks at our politics, you know, one, the leaders

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:10.260
[Amit Varma]: in charge don't seem the kind of people who would think it through in this kind of manner. Rather,

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:16.100
[Amit Varma]: you've had sort of a haphazard ad hoc mix of policies going in different directions and

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:21.540
[Amit Varma]: catering to different incentives, most of them political. And also, the fact of the matter is

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:26.980
[Amit Varma]: that, and we'll, you know, discuss a work that you did as CEA, and I loved your economic surveys,

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:31.700
[Amit Varma]: by the way, and how closely you work with Mr. Jaitley. But it seems that a lot, you know,

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:36.740
[Amit Varma]: there were key decisions like demonetization, in which even Mr. Jaitley wasn't, you know,

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:41.140
[Amit Varma]: too instrumental, or couldn't do much about it. So I'm just wondering that how much of this is

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:46.900
[Amit Varma]: sort of looking back and rationalizing the things that happened? Or at the time, is this something

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:51.540
[Amit Varma]: that people actually thought that, you know, you had cabinet meetings where you discussed it, okay,

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:56.740
[Amit Varma]: we need to first increase our legitimacy as a state. So let's do XYZ. And later, we'll do future

01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:01.380
[Amit Varma]: reforms. Was there thinking like that? And if there was, why did that then get derailed?

01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:08.020
[Guest]: Very, very probing and good questions. Let's come back to first, you know, the whole mindset issue,

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:15.300
[Guest]: the state and the individual, right? See, I think, in a country like India,

01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:22.340
[Guest]: given this whole legacy, where, you know, it's all state, state, state, and, you know,

01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:28.500
[Guest]: the process is one of, you know, kind of the Leviathan being slowly, slowly on, taken off

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:37.460
[Guest]: the back. And this is where I think the failure of the state to equip every Indian with the basic

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:44.740
[Guest]: human capital to, you know, kind of, you know, then, you know, it's a completely unlevel playing

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:50.980
[Guest]: field unless so. So in some ways, if you haven't done that basic, which is what by the way, China

01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:57.380
[Guest]: did that very early on, the Chinese Communist Party did that early on. And so in that sense,

01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:03.780
[Guest]: that original sin having been committed, I think all these, you know, notions that, you know,

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:09.220
[Guest]: the individual should be left to the market, etc., you know, they become less, I think,

01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:14.180
[Guest]: meaningful, or at least the discussion of that has to be qualified by the fact that, you know,

01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:18.820
[Guest]: you haven't provided no health and education. I mean, you know, I'm doing some research with

01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:24.740
[Guest]: Devesh Kapoor on this. I mean, if you look at, you know, stunting and heights and everything in

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:28.900
[Guest]: India, you know, you think, you know, that, you know, or if you look at, you know, the ASAR results

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:36.980
[Guest]: on, on learning outcomes, and so on. So if those two key ingredients are so badly under provided,

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:43.940
[Guest]: and also so asymmetrically provided between, you know, the vast mass and things, then the whole,

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:50.340
[Guest]: you know, capitalism as an equal opportunity space where people thrive, I think that discussion just

01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:55.540
[Amit Varma]: becomes much more difficult. So, can I button here, you know, I hear this observation often

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.860
[Amit Varma]: from people who support statism, which I know you're not doing, but I hear this argument often,

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:04.900
[Amit Varma]: and I feel it that it's a little bit self-serving. For example, in education, you don't allow private

01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:09.700
[Amit Varma]: enterprise, you don't allow for profit education. So therefore, you know, we remain underserved and

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:14.420
[Amit Varma]: undereducated. And then you say that, listen, they are not getting educated, the state has to do it.

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:20.900
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, you sort of justify the role of the state by saying that it isn't going

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:24.900
[Amit Varma]: to happen otherwise, but you're not allowing it to happen otherwise. And this seems to me to be

01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:29.540
[Amit Varma]: an unfortunate situation that can then, you know, just continue in this vicious circle.

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:34.100
[Guest]: Yeah, I think that's, I mean, that's a fair point about, you know, how much

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:39.620
[Guest]: the, you know, I don't know the sector well enough, you know, you had people who

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:47.620
[Guest]: know much more on this, I do. But I think all I think is important to notice, whether it's

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:53.060
[Guest]: it's an act of omission or commission, and you're saying it's also a sin of commission, not just

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:58.340
[Guest]: a sin of omission. I think the fact is that, you know, once you have individuals who are not equipped

01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:05.860
[Guest]: to take advantage of opportunities, it's that's what the second thing I think is that, you know,

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:11.780
[Guest]: the state as regulator, because remember, we can't have, you know, no one thinks that a market

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:16.340
[Guest]: economy, you know, almost everything should be done by the private sector, obviously, but,

01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:20.740
[Guest]: you know, certain basic things like health, maybe health education, along with this, but also some

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:26.340
[Guest]: amount of, you know, reasonable regulation has to be there, right. But I think, so the failure in

01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:32.260
[Guest]: the last few years has also been that in the last decade or so, is that the state as a regulator,

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:40.260
[Guest]: I think, has become a very problematic thing, you know, both, you know, the undercapacity,

01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:44.580
[Guest]: the lack of thing, and of course, the capture on the other side from the usual thing. So I think

01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:51.860
[Guest]: you've had, you have both sets of problems. And therefore, you know, so on the one hand, you say,

01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:57.380
[Guest]: you know, yes, we believe in, you know, markets with things, but the essential wherewithal,

01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:03.540
[Guest]: you know, 90% doesn't have the wherewithal. And then post facto, you know, it's kind of,

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:08.660
[Guest]: you can't have a marketplace where, you know, you know, firms can pollute, firms can be corrupt,

01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:14.500
[Guest]: you know, firms can do. So I think in some ways, we're kind of stuck, right, neither at the

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:20.420
[Guest]: ex ante stage, nor the ex post stage, you have that thing. And then we say, you know, whatever.

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:26.980
[Guest]: So it really is. And I say, you know, I think there are just so many things that the state just

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:31.780
[Guest]: should not be doing. I mean, you know, state in telecom, you know, as a provider, I mean,

01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:36.580
[Guest]: state should not be a provider for almost, you know, everything except a few core things, right,

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:42.340
[Guest]: but the state needs. So ex ante exposed to have such a weak state, and then you have a kind of

01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:47.620
[Guest]: over-accrucive state on all this, you know, just this, you know, starting a business,

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:52.580
[Guest]: I completely agree with you. I don't know whether you saw that, you know, I saw this on Twitter,

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:57.860
[Guest]: you know, how many approvals you still need to start, you know, a small business. So it's like

01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:03.780
[Guest]: a triple whammy, you know, you don't have the wherewithal, the post facto regulations thing,

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:09.540
[Guest]: and you have this thing. And so it's a very fair question as to, you know,

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:17.540
[Guest]: why on all of these, we haven't changed. By the way, on the regulatory side, there was a period,

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:23.700
[Guest]: you know, in the early 2000s, where I feel there was some hope that we could get, you know,

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:29.300
[Guest]: very effective regulation. I think the early try, for example, was actually doing quite well.

01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:34.740
[Guest]: And somehow there too, you know, the whole regulatory state has become less, I mean,

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:40.340
[Guest]: I think even the RBI, for example, you know, you've got so many, you know, it's a wonderful

01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:45.620
[Guest]: and highly respected, deservedly respected institution. But all these, you know, things

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:50.900
[Guest]: that have happened, partly it's because I think partly kind of Urjit Patel's point, partly it's

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:55.940
[Guest]: because of public ownership, because there, the regulator has less say. But partly it's also

01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:59.620
[Guest]: because, you know, in the areas where the regulator has freedom, we've not been able to,

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:06.980
[Guest]: I mean, to have a series of scandals like this in a financial system, I mean, is part overbearing

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:13.300
[Guest]: state, but part also kind of weak regulation. So I think that, you know, when we think about

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:17.940
[Guest]: therefore, and that is why now coming to the last point on the state and the individual,

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:22.660
[Guest]: and we can talk about that in terms of the ideas that, you know, we were associated with when I

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:30.820
[Guest]: was in government. I do think, therefore, that, you know, a UBI, something like a universal basic

01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:37.860
[Guest]: income, it's kind of says, look, you know, that minimum wherewithal for you to survive,

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:42.820
[Guest]: not fall into poverty, not be subject to the vicissitudes of health and education shocks,

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:48.980
[Guest]: etc. You know, we provide you that wherewithal. And that allows them, you know, the kind of your

01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:55.220
[Guest]: agenda that you have for the state to kind of, you know, get away from the over-obtrusiveness.

01:33:55.220 --> 01:34:01.060
[Guest]: I think that's why ideas like UBI, for me, resonate a lot, because they're very valuable

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:07.300
[Guest]: in themselves in terms of this whole what we want social protection to be. And that's why

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:12.740
[Guest]: I remember UBI is something that both the right and the left like for very different reasons.

01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:20.580
[Guest]: But it also allows you to kind of not burden the price system, you know, the efficiency cost that

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:26.580
[Guest]: the price system has to bear for providing redistribution. That's where ideas like that

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:34.020
[Guest]: matter. Now, we'll come to your questions about, you know, post facto rationalization versus,

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:39.940
[Guest]: you know, in real time, you know, do you actually have discussions like this that say, look,

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:45.620
[Guest]: we've had stigmatized capitalism, you know, look, I mean, something that came up in your

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:52.260
[Guest]: discussion with Pratap as well. I think, for me, one of the fascinating, you know,

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:59.460
[Guest]: things about being in government is just, you know, getting a glimpse into, you know,

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:08.340
[Guest]: personalities and how, you know, personalities really and their, you know, deeper psychology,

01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:15.140
[Guest]: you know, can be so important in driving these things. You know, nobody ever studies it,

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:19.460
[Guest]: nobody is going to, you know, write about it, because there's so many kind of, but I think it's

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:29.220
[Guest]: undeniable. But I think on this thing about the fact that the provision can reclaim legitimacy,

01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:35.060
[Guest]: I think was actually, I have no evidence, whatever, but just observing, I think one could,

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:42.420
[Guest]: even in real time, get a sense of that, even in real time. So, I wouldn't say it's all post

01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:47.780
[Guest]: facto rationalization. There was a, I think we have to, you know, some stage credit leaders with,

01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:54.100
[Guest]: you know, at least some leaders with a sense of, you know, being driven by, you know, obviously,

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:59.700
[Guest]: they're driven by all the, you know, sordid things that politics is all about. But also,

01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:04.420
[Guest]: I think there are, I think, deeper things that drive and I think this trying to overcome

01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:09.460
[Guest]: stigmatized capitalism, recognizing that what does one need to offset, I think there were,

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:14.100
[Guest]: there was, I couldn't get a sense of that, you know, at least in the early years that I was there.

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:18.820
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the sort of your personal experience as a CEA, which, you know, I have a

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:23.460
[Amit Varma]: lot of questions on that. And I find that sort of that whole experience you must have had very

01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:27.220
[Amit Varma]: fascinating. But before that, another sort of question in the realm of ideas, because you

01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:32.100
[Amit Varma]: mentioned the UBI, and I was going to kind of come to that later, which is that, and I also

01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:38.020
[Amit Varma]: simultaneously want to bring up the GST in this context, which is that there are often ideas,

01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:43.300
[Amit Varma]: which seem to us from a purely conceptual point of view, that, oh, these are, you know, so brilliant,

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.820
[Amit Varma]: this is why they'll make such a great difference. This is why they make sense. And all of that,

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:52.740
[Amit Varma]: like GST, for example, I was so excited to, you know, the first time I heard about a GST coming

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:57.620
[Amit Varma]: up. And like you said, people's views of the GST might be colored because of what happened during

01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:03.300
[Amit Varma]: demonetization. And we'll come back to that as well. But you know, I've done an episode of the

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.980
[Amit Varma]: scene in the unseen with the journalist Zewang Sudatta, where he pointed out and this was before

01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:11.860
[Amit Varma]: the GST was passed. And he pointed out quite recently, all the things that could go wrong

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:17.860
[Amit Varma]: with the GST. And as it turns out, I think they did go wrong. Like, when I think of the GST,

01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:23.300
[Amit Varma]: I think of something now, and this is in hindsight, and obviously post facto, that it's something that

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:28.020
[Amit Varma]: is a phenomenal idea. It's a necessary idea, you want to reduce the friction of so many taxes,

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:32.980
[Amit Varma]: and you want something much more simplified. But at the same time, it was perhaps foreseeable,

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:36.740
[Amit Varma]: and even foreseen by others, what problems would come, many of these were unavoidable,

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:41.140
[Amit Varma]: they were part of the political economy, like the multiple rates and the exemptions and the

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:46.820
[Amit Varma]: different interest groups fighting all the way and the discretion to the lowest level tax officer,

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:52.500
[Amit Varma]: which, you know, frankly, I'm at sort of that end of the economy, where so many of my friends are

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:57.220
[Amit Varma]: the receiving end of what I can only describe as tax terrorism. And you know, one of my friends

01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.220
[Amit Varma]: actually is a manufacturer runs a couple of small factories. And he keeps telling me that

01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:06.820
[Amit Varma]: dude, GST was far worse for us and demonetization was. So I asked him to send me some pointers of

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:11.220
[Amit Varma]: what went wrong with it. And I'll quickly read through them. He talks about how compliance was

01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:15.460
[Amit Varma]: much more expensive and tedious, and they now have to have additional full time employees,

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:19.700
[Amit Varma]: a consultant to make sure they're not in violation. The confusion of the initial

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:24.340
[Amit Varma]: months costs them actual real money in loss transfers from the old system. The rules and

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:29.780
[Amit Varma]: the guidelines keep changing, there is confusion is KitKat, a biscuit or a chocolate, you know, and

01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:36.180
[Amit Varma]: more tellingly, that a number of small vendors that he used to work with simply shut down because

01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:41.300
[Amit Varma]: they were not able to survive in the new regime that was sort of the transaction cost of shifting

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:47.940
[Amit Varma]: from one regime to another and the cash locked up in the system has made doing business more

01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:52.660
[Amit Varma]: expensive. And even for me, I have to file my, you know, GST every month and a fair amount of

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:57.220
[Amit Varma]: time goes to it. Now, I'm not asking you to address any of these specifically. My larger point

01:38:57.220 --> 01:39:03.220
[Amit Varma]: here is that, you know, in their excellent book, in service of the Republic, Vijay Kelkar and Ajay

01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:09.140
[Amit Varma]: Shah made the point that given Indian state capacity, we should have presumptive laissez faire,

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:14.900
[Amit Varma]: which is a separate point. But the larger sense there is that whatever policies that, you know,

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:20.260
[Amit Varma]: we think about, we should think about in the context of what they call how much state capacity

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:25.300
[Amit Varma]: is there. But what I would think of is not just state capacity, because it might be state capacity

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:31.060
[Amit Varma]: to implement a lot of this. But also what is the structure of the state? Like, when I look at the

01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:36.500
[Amit Varma]: structure of the state with regard to taxation, it seems to me that it is by and large predatory and

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:43.460
[Amit Varma]: parasitic, that where I mean, tax terrorism is a very real term. So the larger question, I'm sorry

01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:48.740
[Amit Varma]: if I've rambled a bit, but and the reason I thought of this in the context of UBI is that when you

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:53.540
[Amit Varma]: think about policies, and even by the way, people who worked on the IBC, the bankruptcy court tell

01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:58.100
[Amit Varma]: me that it is stuck in various places, because state capacity hasn't kept up with it, though

01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:03.300
[Amit Varma]: obviously, overall, it's a net benefit that we have that reform in place. And we have that on the

01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:10.500
[Amit Varma]: books. So now, my question is that when we sort of implement policies is one of the things that we

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:17.300
[Amit Varma]: should take into account, not only sort of how it is intended to work, but how given what our state

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:23.300
[Amit Varma]: is actually like, and our structures are actually like how it will actually work. So to me, it seems

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:28.500
[Amit Varma]: that for example, this is where a lot of GST went wrong and did damage. And one could argue that,

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:33.060
[Amit Varma]: okay, in the long run, it'll work out fine, but it did a lot of short term damage. And similarly,

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:37.700
[Amit Varma]: with UBI, I could say that, you know, the UBI with the way you write about it and present it,

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:43.220
[Amit Varma]: and others do as well, it obviously, you know, it makes fiscal sense in all your projections,

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.820
[Amit Varma]: where you talk about, okay, we'll cut all these subsidies, and we'll cut all these hazard things

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:51.700
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. But in the real time political economy, which is dominated by so many different

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:56.980
[Amit Varma]: kinds of interests and political compulsions, many of those are not going to go. And this will

01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:02.580
[Amit Varma]: eventually the UBI will also eventually become, if it comes into being a sort of very perverted

01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:09.060
[Amit Varma]: populist handout, which really helps nobody and has all kinds of perverse unseen consequences.

01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:15.780
[Amit Varma]: So is this something that sort of plays a large part in how the policy making mechanism flows

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:22.900
[Guest]: that you're actually considering sort of all of these things? See, again, very, very important

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:30.100
[Guest]: kind of conceptual things that we should think about. But let me just say, just to make it come

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:36.820
[Guest]: alive, talk about it in the context of both GST and UBI, right? I think, in the case of the GST,

01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:46.180
[Guest]: look, on this, I would rephrase the Kelkar-Shah thing in a little bit more, I think that they're

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:53.220
[Guest]: absolutely right. I would rephrase this as, you know, in the case of tax, for example, you know,

01:41:53.860 --> 01:42:04.100
[Guest]: simple tax policy is 70% of tax administration. I mean, if you have simple policy administration

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:10.980
[Guest]: becomes, you know, so the complexity just makes everything worse. So in that sense, I think that

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:20.100
[Guest]: there is no question that we kind of went, definitely have gone excessively in the direction

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:26.900
[Guest]: of complexity. But just to step, to be fair to this whole process, and let me just take you back

01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:34.020
[Guest]: to, I think the feeling at that, so remember, I wanted three, no more, you know, that was the

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:43.460
[Guest]: maximum, I still think we should have attempted that. But I think that the way it went, part of

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:52.100
[Guest]: the justification was, look, it's less complex than the previous regime. And so that was part

01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:58.340
[Guest]: of the, so you know, you had like 15 excise duties, now we only have seven, you know, seven

01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:04.180
[Guest]: is, I mean, so in a sense, it was, the standards kept changing, instead of the standard being,

01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:10.020
[Guest]: look, going forward, what is the best way to maximise the system, you know, this path

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:16.340
[Guest]: dependence came in. Now, and this is where I certainly do think that this was something that

01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:23.940
[Guest]: could have been avoided. The path dependence comes in, because one, you say, look, there are so many

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:31.140
[Guest]: excises and vats, when I change, there should be no increase in the incidence at all. I mean,

01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:34.980
[Guest]: if that's the way, you know, your politics is going to, you know, the policymaking process

01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:40.340
[Guest]: going to run, then you're going to get into complexity. And I think it was that. So I do

01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:50.020
[Guest]: agree, I think that the conviction that simplicity is the way forward in itself, and also, because it

01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:56.820
[Guest]: helps, you know, vastly helps administration, I think that conviction, I think, could have been

01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:03.700
[Guest]: much greater. And I think that has come in the way of that. And so I think, I don't know the

01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:08.420
[Guest]: income tax system well enough. But remember, what you said about tax terrorism, you know,

01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:14.420
[Guest]: here's the tragedy, right? The tragedy is, you know, I'm sure what you're saying is right. And

01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:19.300
[Guest]: I've heard the word, tax terrorism, and even the most ardent supporters of the government

01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:25.860
[Guest]: also think that this thing. But if you look at actually the tax intake attacks to GDP ratios,

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:32.420
[Guest]: I mean, it's not, you know, sterling by any means. So in a sense, we kind of get the worst of all

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:38.660
[Guest]: possible worlds, we get the administrative thing, which really chills entrepreneurial activity and

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:45.380
[Guest]: whatever. And we don't get the fiscal benefits as well. So the notion that actually simple design

01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:52.740
[Guest]: and simple administration can help both, you know, is something that I think is a kind of

01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:58.180
[Guest]: indictment of our system, you know, for not just now, but for many, many, I mean, this is a kind

01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:05.620
[Guest]: of a historical thing. But on the GST, let me say that, you know, again, there was always going to

01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:10.020
[Guest]: be a short term cost. I mean, nobody was under any illusion that that was not to be the case.

01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:16.580
[Guest]: So the question really was, you know, was there adequate preparation to minimize that cost? And

01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:21.620
[Guest]: I think that's really a, you know, because remember, after the GST was implemented,

01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:28.100
[Guest]: steps were taken to minimize the compliance burdens, but I think certainly, much more could

01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:33.620
[Guest]: have been done on that. So there was, I think that that was one. And then, of course, you know,

01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:40.100
[Guest]: GST came on top of demonetization. So, you know, some of the, you know, so that constituency

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:45.140
[Guest]: got a double whammy, right? I mean, the demonetization and the GST, and therefore,

01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:49.860
[Guest]: you know, I don't know how much to separate out what is the pure GST impact and what was that.

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:56.660
[Guest]: Now, but there are two design features conceptually, I think that I, so I think on the

01:45:56.660 --> 01:46:02.660
[Guest]: simplicity, I think just it we just kind of could have done better, no question about it. And I

01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:07.140
[Guest]: think there are no real, real excuses for that. I think we should have and could have done better.

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:12.580
[Guest]: And also on the on the, you know, minimizing the tax, we could have done better. For me,

01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:20.100
[Guest]: the really difficult issues were, you know, looking back, or, you know, looking forward,

01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:26.900
[Guest]: we said, look, one market, one India. And I think, again, I don't have enough evidence,

01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:32.180
[Guest]: but there's some at least some good evidence saying that, you know, at the border, the waiting

01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:38.660
[Guest]: times, etc, have come down considerably. So the virtues of having one market in India,

01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:43.460
[Guest]: I mean, those were huge. And I don't think, you know, looking back, I don't think we should,

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:48.660
[Guest]: you know, ignore those things. So, so I think those benefits were huge, we could have reaped more.

01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:54.340
[Guest]: And that was what we really wanted, right? I mean, in a sense, we wanted India to be one market,

01:46:54.340 --> 01:47:00.900
[Guest]: it's like, you know, internal liberalization, and the benefits would be huge. The price of that,

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:11.300
[Guest]: of course, remember, the price of that was one, this whole compensation that we say that

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:18.740
[Guest]: regardless, we will pay the states as a way of getting political buy-in for this. And the second

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:24.180
[Guest]: related point was that we knew that so the compensation was a short term thing, right?

01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:32.260
[Guest]: You want to get political buy-in. But we knew that this one market would come at the cost of

01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:39.300
[Guest]: loss of fiscal sovereignty for the states, right? And what the COVID crisis has shown is that,

01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:45.460
[Guest]: you know, states have lost a lot of fiscal sovereignty, and their tax handles, as it were,

01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:52.980
[Guest]: are now much less than they used to be. And the way we kind of justified or thought about this

01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:59.860
[Guest]: ex ante, is that you do the compensation, you have the trust. And, you know, yes, there'll be

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:05.460
[Guest]: loss of sovereignty, but you know, the underlying system would be buoyant enough that you wouldn't

01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:11.460
[Guest]: feel that much. It's not that you won't ever feel it. But you know, but that trade off, I think,

01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:19.140
[Guest]: has started looking a little bit more tricky now. But partly, it's see, remember, partly,

01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:24.580
[Guest]: it's kind of endogenous to the way it's been implemented. You know, my own view, as I said,

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:30.020
[Guest]: in the piece yesterday, is that, you know, had we preserved the trust between, you know, the

01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:34.980
[Guest]: center and the states, I think some of these things would have been less severe. So it was

01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:43.060
[Guest]: ex ante a calculation where we had a certain vision of politics, and how federal politics,

01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:47.940
[Guest]: center state politics to play out, which post facto has turned out to be a little bit different

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:54.820
[Guest]: from what we anticipated. In fact, I have a paragraph in my book on the GST, where I say that

01:48:55.540 --> 01:49:03.060
[Guest]: my kind of nightmare scenario for the GST is that, you know, for whatever reason, trust breaks down,

01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:07.780
[Guest]: and then individual states say, look, you know, we disagree with the center, and we're just going

01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:13.620
[Guest]: to go back and do our own thing, at which point the GST would be just dead. And therefore, I think,

01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:18.580
[Guest]: you know, the practice of politics, the practice of center state politics in India,

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:23.300
[Guest]: is something that's absolutely critical to ensuring that because otherwise, you know,

01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:28.580
[Guest]: kind of all bets are off. And, you know, I just hope that this will get sorted out,

01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:34.980
[Guest]: because that that's an ingredient that I think that maybe we just, I kind of knew a little bit,

01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:39.060
[Guest]: you know, what might happen should center state, because remember, when the GST was done,

01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:43.300
[Guest]: you know, most of the states were aligned with the center, you know. So conceptually,

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:47.780
[Guest]: one did think of what would happen, you know, when the center state alignment would vary.

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:54.100
[Guest]: But I was just hoping that, you know, politics would evolve in a certain way. So I think these

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:59.460
[Guest]: were the, you know, really kind of conceptual questions about the design of the GST,

01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:04.100
[Guest]: which I think, you know, I think about a lot more. And some of it, frankly, we did not that

01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:08.500
[Guest]: we didn't think about any of these things earlier. But I think, you know, as the, you know,

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:14.100
[Guest]: as they say, stuff happens, or as Harold Macmillan famously said, events, dear boy events, you know,

01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:20.020
[Guest]: so that's, and some of these things, you know, you can't just can't control. So that I think,

01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:26.660
[Guest]: on the UPI, I do think that there's a very serious, you know, risk. And it is a design

01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:32.180
[Guest]: challenge that, you know, if it just becomes one more scheme on top of every other scheme,

01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:40.660
[Guest]: whatever. And this is a point that I think, it's a kind of theoretical, but very deep conceptual

01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:46.740
[Guest]: point. It's a point that I think I've heard Tharman Shanmugaratnam make, in the context of

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:54.420
[Guest]: Singapore, he says, you know, ex ante, a desirable design feature of simplicity

01:50:54.420 --> 01:51:01.940
[Guest]: might really be the problem post facto. And give you an illustration, right, that, so for example,

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:06.260
[Guest]: in labour markets, we generally have two different ways of doing things, right? You can either have

01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:12.180
[Guest]: a minimum wage, or you have, you know, what's called an EITC, which is basically like a tax

01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:18.980
[Guest]: credit for low income workers. I think Tharman's point was that it may be ex ante minimum wage is

01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:23.060
[Guest]: actually a less complex policy, you don't have to mess around the tax score, you just announce

01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:29.700
[Guest]: it, whatever. But that very feature post facto, if you get competitive populism, for example,

01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:33.780
[Guest]: it's easier to raise the minimum, keep raising the minimum wage, than to, you know, say, you know,

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:38.740
[Guest]: I'm, you know, tackling some aspect of the EITC code. Similarly, there's a kind of risk with the

01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:44.420
[Guest]: UBI. It's very simplistic, people say, you know, or you said 80 rupees a month, we will say 150

01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:50.020
[Guest]: rupees a month. And so this is a, but you know, but, you know, in the real world, you know,

01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:56.580
[Guest]: you can you therefore say, because of this risk, I will not contemplate UBI at all, or do you

01:51:56.580 --> 01:52:01.940
[Guest]: struggle with saying no, I will, but let me see what are the kind of checks I can build into this

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:07.620
[Guest]: going forward. And that's what makes you know, politics and policymaking, you know, so bloody

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:13.540
[Amit Varma]: hard, but also so important and challenging. So let me get to another conceptual question now.

01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:17.940
[Amit Varma]: But before I do, you know, what you said about stuff happens reminded me of that famous John

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:22.660
[Amit Varma]: Lennon quote, life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans. And I often used

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:28.660
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, at an sort of individual level to tell my friends why I have, you know, written so

01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:33.300
[Amit Varma]: few books in my life, and so on and so forth. But now you've given a new context to it of the state.

01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:38.180
[Amit Varma]: And I sort of totally get and you know, one what I, you know, have noted in your book and in your

01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:43.540
[Amit Varma]: writings is that that whole political maneuvering to make you know, the cooperative federalism

01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:47.940
[Amit Varma]: happened where the center and the states work together is also miraculous. And, you know,

01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:53.060
[Amit Varma]: an entire episode would not suffice to talk about that, because that's also quite phenomenal. And

01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:57.860
[Amit Varma]: also, it's undoubted that, you know, I remember in Mahir Sharma's book restart, he had an anecdote

01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:03.220
[Amit Varma]: about how if you have to send a truck full of goods from two cities, I forget which one two

01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:08.660
[Amit Varma]: of Madras, Bangalore, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad, but from one to the other, rather than

01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:12.980
[Amit Varma]: go over state borders, it's it's cheaper to send it to Paris and then have it sent to the other

01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:18.580
[Amit Varma]: city from there. And that's obviously one of the things that, you know, GST would have eliminated.

01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:23.460
[Amit Varma]: But my larger conceptual question is there is that you were talking about trade offs and cost

01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:29.780
[Amit Varma]: and benefit and so on. And this is something that I thought about at the time of demonetization,

01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:33.940
[Amit Varma]: when costs and benefits were touted. And I of course, you know, wrote against demonetization

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:40.260
[Amit Varma]: from day one, I thought it was a largest assault on property rights in human history. And it sort

01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:46.500
[Amit Varma]: of seemed to me that when we talk of cost and benefits in that context, and it became stark

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:52.420
[Amit Varma]: in the context of demonetization, but I guess this is an inevitable part of public policy making

01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:57.620
[Amit Varma]: anywhere that when you talk of costs and benefits, you are talking about cost to one set of people

01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:03.860
[Amit Varma]: at one point in time, and benefits to another set of people at another point in time. And in the

01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:08.900
[Amit Varma]: case of demonetization, obviously, to, you know, the cost is so large to so many people and the

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:15.220
[Amit Varma]: benefits are, you know, dubious and invisible, that it seems beyond question. So let's not discuss

01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:20.420
[Amit Varma]: it in the context of demonetization. But in the context of any public policy, whether it is,

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:25.940
[Amit Varma]: you know, GST or whatever, we often have to deal with trade offs where one set of people get costs

01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:31.780
[Amit Varma]: and another set of people get benefits. And it seems to me to be a sort of a danger to watch

01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:37.460
[Amit Varma]: out for what Hayek would have called the fatal conceit almost that you can sort of, you know,

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:42.420
[Amit Varma]: treat these people as pieces on a chessboard. And you can just sort of plan out that, okay,

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:46.980
[Amit Varma]: I lose my night here, but I get a checkmate there. But these are real people, these are individuals

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:51.460
[Amit Varma]: who also deserve to have their autonomy respected. And at the same time, these trade offs are

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:56.500
[Amit Varma]: inevitable, you can't get around them in most public policy. So is this something that you

01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:01.940
[Amit Varma]: think about? And then how do you guard against the kind of arrogance that might come, for example,

01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:06.500
[Amit Varma]: from being in the state and having all these power over the lives of chess pieces as a court?

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:11.140
[Guest]: So, you know, you said, let's talk of it, you know, outside the context of demonetization,

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:15.460
[Guest]: let me make it easier, more interesting. So let me talk, let's talk about in the context of

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:24.340
[Guest]: demonetization. So one of the pieces that I'm, you know, kind of proudest of having written

01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:30.100
[Guest]: is on the political economy of demonetization in my book, you know, here, I don't want to get

01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:34.340
[Guest]: into controversy and talk about, you know, good, bad, did I know, did someone else know, you know,

01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:41.700
[Guest]: all of that. But to me, it was just the most fascinating experience of political economy.

01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:46.900
[Guest]: And let me, you know, kind of, you know, because you've thought about it,

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:53.220
[Guest]: maybe you can, you know, tell me why I'm completely wrong. You see, think about,

01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:58.820
[Guest]: think about this, about demonetization, right? It also speaks to your question about autonomy

01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:03.940
[Guest]: of respecting autonomy, and so on. And I don't even know how to, you know, given what I've seen,

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:09.540
[Guest]: I don't even know how to think about these things anymore, right? That I think everyone would have

01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:17.300
[Guest]: agreed with you. And you know, that there would be a lot of short term costs on a lot of people,

01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:23.060
[Guest]: right? Maybe there was some, you know, potential long term benefits, whatever. And, you know,

01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:29.780
[Guest]: that's how it would play out. And therefore, you know, both because there were a lot of people

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:36.420
[Guest]: affected. It was quite, you know, significant. And, you know, the gains were more tenuous and

01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:44.100
[Guest]: long term. So political economy would tell you that this would be a vastly unpopular policy.

01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:49.940
[Guest]: I mean, this is, you know, when we think about, you know, political economy, we say that,

01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:55.860
[Guest]: you know, even in the context of trade policy, we say, you know, if the losers are concentrated,

01:56:55.860 --> 01:57:01.780
[Guest]: the gainers are diffused, even though aggregated may be greater, the concentrated losers,

01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:09.060
[Guest]: I think, sure, it was not even concentrated losers, it was, you know, the vast majority,

01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:14.180
[Guest]: and yet revealed preference, you know, I don't want to draw to, but I think generally,

01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:20.660
[Guest]: we would say that what happened in the UP election afterwards, was certainly not a reaction against,

01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:26.340
[Guest]: if anything, it was maybe not a validation, but certainly, relative to a prior that it should

01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:31.460
[Guest]: have had a huge impact, it did not have that impact. So at least that, so I'm trying to still

01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:37.060
[Guest]: trying to understand why that is the case, you know, it's a complete political economy puzzle.

01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:42.580
[Guest]: It's a little bit like, you know, in the in the US and others, even now, people are asking,

01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:49.300
[Guest]: you know, what's wrong with Kansas? Why do, you know, white, poor white middle class voters

01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:54.740
[Guest]: vote for an administration that, you know, threatens to take away the welfare benefits,

01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:59.060
[Guest]: provides tax cuts, which you're not benefiting at all, you know, how do you explain this, you know,

01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:02.980
[Guest]: people voting against their apparent self interest? Of course, there are arguments about

01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:09.380
[Guest]: identity here, and so on. But then, I mean, you know, it's like, 80 90%, very badly hit,

01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:14.660
[Guest]: you know, and the intensity you can see, and yet they turn out and, you know, behave a certain way.

01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:24.180
[Guest]: So how do you explain this? And more and more, I think about it, I think of these huge costs of

01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:31.940
[Guest]: demonetization as a feature, not a bug, in political terms. And so that's why this autumn,

01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:38.100
[Guest]: so it's like, you know, it had to be, you know, a cost inflicted on a lot of people. And my

01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:44.900
[Guest]: explanation for this, you know, ideas, you're not a thing. One is that, you know, you have to feel

01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:52.340
[Guest]: the pain for you to be convinced that it's a kind of, you know, really important policy. It has to

01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:58.820
[Guest]: be widespread in its impact, because otherwise, you know, the charge that it was selected,

01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:05.940
[Guest]: because remember, the puzzle of demonetization is, why did so many people have to be hit in order

01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:11.460
[Guest]: for these benefits? You know, if you really wanted to, you know, go after the rich, you have

01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:16.500
[Guest]: selective policy instruments to go after the rich, you don't have to have take a huge swipe at so

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:21.700
[Guest]: many people, you know, because you can do tax raids, you can, you know, you raise taxes. So

01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:27.700
[Guest]: you have selective instruments. But this was a conscious policy to use a bludgeon of an instrument,

01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:34.020
[Guest]: you know, for some political and it worked. So that's the puzzle that because remember,

01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:40.820
[Guest]: the other thing in this was, it's interesting, right, that, you know, many people said, just

01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:45.700
[Guest]: do that. Why was the 500 rupee note all done by also the 1000? Because after all, with a 500

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:51.860
[Guest]: rupee note, you're more likely to hit more poor people, because, you know, relative to the gains.

01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:58.180
[Guest]: So there was this puzzle about this. And, you know, my explanation for it is that, you know,

01:59:58.180 --> 02:00:04.100
[Guest]: it had to be huge, because then it's like Thomas Schelling said, you know, in a strategy of conflict,

02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:10.900
[Guest]: to show that you're doing something big, it's credible that it has to be costly, you can't do

02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:16.180
[Guest]: things on the cheap. So it's like situating your nuclear shelter right in the middle of the city,

02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:20.660
[Guest]: because you show that, you know, that's a credible commitment. So the inflicting of the huge cost

02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:26.180
[Guest]: was part of that. The fact that it was uniform was to prevent against any allegation of corruption.

02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:30.980
[Guest]: And then, of course, maybe you tap into this notion that you want to sacrifice for a larger

02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:36.820
[Guest]: good. But in that sense, what is one therefore to make of it that, you know, you say that,

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:42.500
[Guest]: you know, you should respect autonomy, especially if you're inflicting, but the politician says,

02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:46.420
[Guest]: I have respected it. See, this is the proof.

02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:51.940
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so I kind of have some related thoughts on that. First of all, I enjoyed your chapter

02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:56.580
[Amit Varma]: on demonetization and off council very much. And in fact, the whole book is fabulous. I think

02:00:56.580 --> 02:01:01.140
[Amit Varma]: all my listeners should pick it up. And you raised a couple of interesting questions there. And I'll

02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:04.980
[Amit Varma]: share my thoughts on that. I won't say I'm answering them. But I'll just share my thoughts.

02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:10.500
[Amit Varma]: One is yes, the political benefit at the time blew me away, because I thought they would lose

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:16.660
[Amit Varma]: every district in UP. And instead, it was a landslide, right. And my sort of couple of

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:20.900
[Amit Varma]: post facto explanations that come to mind and yours are also excellent, and I'll process them

02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:25.780
[Amit Varma]: over time. And one was, of course, the explanation of schadenfreude that the poor didn't mind,

02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:30.820
[Amit Varma]: because they also saw that it's suffering. The other is that I think that Indians have such an

02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:36.260
[Amit Varma]: ingrained state of fatalism, that when bad things happen to them, they don't necessarily ascribe it

02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:41.380
[Amit Varma]: to the state because the state has been a constant failure over the last 70 something years, as

02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:46.420
[Amit Varma]: Landbridge had called it, it's a flailing state. So that sense of fatalism kind of takes you

02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:51.780
[Amit Varma]: through but at some level, it doesn't matter what the explanation for this is. The point is that

02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:56.660
[Amit Varma]: you're absolutely right. It was a political benefit for them. I would perhaps dispute and

02:01:56.660 --> 02:02:01.460
[Amit Varma]: you would maybe have more better insider information. But I don't know how much intent

02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:06.900
[Amit Varma]: there was behind this. My sense of this is that Mr. Modi genuinely thought that this will solve

02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:11.220
[Amit Varma]: the problem of black money. And because he has not bought anything from a store in the last 20

02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:16.740
[Amit Varma]: years, he probably didn't realize that 500 rupee notes are, you know, something that are in everyday

02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:22.100
[Amit Varma]: use. And he must have thought is only for storing black money under beds or whatever. And my sense

02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:27.140
[Amit Varma]: was that they actually believed that it would work. And it so happened to work out in a way that

02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:32.740
[Amit Varma]: it politically benefited them. The other question that you raised that I don't have a convincing

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:38.900
[Amit Varma]: answer for is that while you showed that it did hit the economy, you point out that it does not

02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:44.340
[Amit Varma]: seem to have hit the economy as badly as some people said it would when people spoke of a

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:52.260
[Amit Varma]: contraction of eight, 9%, and all of that. And to be honest, I myself, you know, overestimated the

02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:56.500
[Amit Varma]: damage it would do according to the data. And that is, you know, going to bring me down to a later

02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:02.740
[Amit Varma]: question that so when we know that so much of India is informal sector, and a lot of the data

02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:08.820
[Amit Varma]: on how the informal sector is stuff that we get by proxies, you know, how reliable is that data

02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:14.500
[Amit Varma]: and you know, how much can we sort of taken into account, but that still doesn't answer sort of the

02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:19.380
[Amit Varma]: core conceptual question, that even if the politicians knew that we will make them suffer,

02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:25.540
[Amit Varma]: and we will win votes at the end of it, it still doesn't justify causing suffering. And that dilemma

02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:31.460
[Amit Varma]: still remains that how can how do we talk about costs and benefits at a time where the costs go

02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:37.140
[Amit Varma]: to one set of people at one time and the benefits to another, like how does one sort of resolve this

02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:41.460
[Amit Varma]: and where does one draw the line, saying that no matter what the costs are, this is where we draw

02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:46.820
[Amit Varma]: the line, the cost will not exceed these like, can one think about these? Yeah, yeah. So again,

02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:52.820
[Guest]: Amit, I'm going to first take you up on, you've raised a number of questions. So I have them. So

02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:59.380
[Guest]: three things, one on the demonetization, one on the data, and then on the broader justifying this

02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:05.300
[Guest]: thing. Okay, all three. On the Schadenfreude thing, as I said, remember that I don't fully

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:10.740
[Guest]: buy the Schadenfreude, because you have selective instruments, if you want to make sure that you're,

02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:15.300
[Guest]: you know, want to go after the rich, you can do it. And I mean, why should I suffer to inflict,

02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:19.620
[Guest]: you know, that's kind of a mystery, right? So that I think, the fatalism point, you know,

02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:26.420
[Guest]: it may be true. But you know, Amit, the point is that, you know, even Milind Vaishnav and others

02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:34.820
[Guest]: have done something that certainly there was a period in the 2000s, where we felt that, you know,

02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:40.900
[Guest]: there is a kind of law of Indian politics that, you know, there's anti-incumbency that, you know,

02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:45.220
[Guest]: whatever, you know, no matter what happens, that's not inconsistent with the fatalism argument.

02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:51.700
[Guest]: But we did see for a period, you know, good performance being, you know, validated in the

02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:55.460
[Guest]: polls, you know, you know, we, you know, whether it was in Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Chauhan or the

02:04:55.460 --> 02:05:01.220
[Guest]: re-election in Odisha, you know, there was a period where, so the whole fatalism thing,

02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:05.780
[Guest]: it may be true in some times, but it does beg the question of why it's also not true in other times.

02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:12.820
[Guest]: On intent, of course, what do I know? Who knows what intent was? But, you know, I think there are

02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:21.140
[Guest]: signs here and there that we can pick up. I think the 500 rupee note, I think that there was input

02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:25.700
[Guest]: showing that, you know, the 500 rupee note, there must have been input that, you know,

02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:31.700
[Guest]: 500 and 1000 are very different in terms of things. And if you look at some timing of these things,

02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:36.020
[Guest]: so I think you can't, you know, I don't know intent is finally, but certainly, you know,

02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:39.380
[Guest]: I think there was some, maybe some intent, but certainly in terms of consequence,

02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:44.900
[Guest]: I think the whole thing. Now, on the impact on the economy, I've been surprised as well.

02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:53.780
[Guest]: So it is certainly true that some of the impact is not picked up in the data. And I think we

02:05:53.780 --> 02:06:01.060
[Guest]: should completely think, but I think even allowing for that, you know, the impact turned out to be

02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:05.380
[Guest]: less than we thought. And, you know, there's also a recent paper by, you know, the IMF chief

02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:12.100
[Guest]: economist Geeta Gopinath saying that. But for me, the most surprising aspect of this, which,

02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:17.060
[Guest]: you know, we wrote about, you know, Josh Feldman and I wrote about in that 2019 paper about the

02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:25.540
[Guest]: slowdown, even pre-COVID. I think what I think we didn't fully anticipate was, remember,

02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:32.820
[Guest]: demonetization, one angle on that, look, again, this is not, I'm not taking any stand justifying

02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:41.620
[Guest]: or not, this is a much broader question. But it did lead to a de facto financialization of savings,

02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:47.220
[Guest]: you know, kind of the money under the carpet coming out, which then led to, you know,

02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:56.020
[Guest]: the mutual funds, etc. So in 18, you know, I think 17, 18, there was a period when the economy had a

02:06:56.020 --> 02:07:03.060
[Guest]: bit of a mini boom, as it were, partially fueled by the financialization of the savings, and some

02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:08.500
[Guest]: of that going into lending to real estate and so on. So this was against some kind of not completely

02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:14.500
[Guest]: anticipated consequence. So in that sense, demonetization, you know, when someone does a

02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:19.300
[Guest]: kind of dispassionate economic analysis of this, you know, five, seven years, I think it's going

02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:24.820
[Guest]: to be, you know, whatever all this, not taking away from the fact that the costs were huge.

02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:30.260
[Guest]: Now, you come to this, you know, how do you justify this, right? You see, I think, you know,

02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:37.620
[Guest]: the great moral philosopher and intellectual of our time, Donald Rumsfeld once said, you know,

02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:42.660
[Guest]: you go to bat with the, you know, army you have war with or not the army you wish you had.

02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:51.460
[Guest]: So, you know, when you talk about, you know, how do you justify this? You are, Amit, if I may say so,

02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:58.180
[Guest]: you are coming dangerously close to a framework that you actually don't, that you would disavow

02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:05.780
[Guest]: completely. Because, you know, it's not as if, you know, you can do meta, go meta over and say,

02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:11.060
[Guest]: you know, some meta entity says, this is justified, this is not justified. You know,

02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:16.500
[Guest]: in these things, by definition, these are judgments that are made through democratic politics. And

02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:21.380
[Guest]: therefore, you know, in some sense, these validations come from within this, from within

02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:28.340
[Guest]: the system, not by, you know, a planner or a moral planner, you know, that Amit should be completely

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:34.660
[Guest]: against because he's against, you know, the conceit of the regular planner. So in that sense,

02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:42.820
[Guest]: so all you can do is, therefore, you know, in democratic politics, you know, the different,

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:49.380
[Guest]: you know, constituencies have to have the kind of, you know, say and influence and power in

02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:53.700
[Guest]: democratic politics, because finally, that's what you work with, you know, you can't kind of go

02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:58.420
[Guest]: above a system, you know, whether it is ideas or interests, I think you have to, I think,

02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:04.180
[Guest]: and, you know, that's the sense in which I think you should read, there's a very nice piece by

02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:10.500
[Guest]: Jean Drez about two years ago, you know, it is this thing about who decides and for whom,

02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:15.300
[Guest]: and, you know, and therefore, you know, how do you ensure that the poorest in this case,

02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:20.980
[Guest]: as you yourself said, a lot of poor people got affected, you know, you know, they were suffering

02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:26.820
[Guest]: from some grand false consciences of Marx and, you know, went and voted in a particular manner,

02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:31.780
[Guest]: but how do you protect them in the process? I mean, they have to be empowered, you know,

02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:37.300
[Guest]: so it's basically you come back to saying, how can democratic representative politics

02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:42.260
[Guest]: be much better done? Because only then do you get these better decisions being made,

02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:46.340
[Guest]: because you go to bat with democratic politics, not with some, you know,

02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:48.980
[Guest]: meta welfare system of decision making.

02:09:48.980 --> 02:09:53.860
[Amit Varma]: So that's a fantastic answer. And it kind of addresses my query completely, because,

02:09:53.860 --> 02:10:00.340
[Amit Varma]: you know, I buy the fact that, you know, we are, my statement was not an absolutist statement

02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:04.900
[Amit Varma]: that, oh, look at the costs, and we should not do this. I recognize that even in doing nothing,

02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:08.980
[Amit Varma]: there are costs and benefits. So you are making a choice no matter what you do,

02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:14.740
[Amit Varma]: especially when you have the sort of coercive power of the state with you, which can bring us

02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:18.420
[Amit Varma]: to another question, which perhaps we'll leave for some other day before we go to a commercial

02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:23.140
[Amit Varma]: break, and then come back to talk about your time as CEA. But the other question that it then leads

02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:27.460
[Amit Varma]: to is that even within the democratic system, where you're juggling different interests or

02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:32.020
[Amit Varma]: whatever, where do you draw the line? Where do you draw the line and say that no, the costs are

02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:39.220
[Amit Varma]: too much here? And, you know, is that something that you simply let interest decide? Or is there

02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:43.060
[Amit Varma]: some other compass or some other set of rules that can guide that? Because, you know, there

02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:49.540
[Amit Varma]: is that famous cartoon about two wolves and a lamb debating what to have for dinner, and one

02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:55.060
[Amit Varma]: of them says, let's put it to the vote. So there's also sort of a danger there. Let's take a quick

02:10:55.060 --> 02:11:01.140
[Amit Varma]: commercial break. And then we come back, we shall leave India for just a moment and visit Machu Picchu.

02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:07.380
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and The Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the show

02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:12.660
[Amit Varma]: alive. The Scene and The Unseen has been a labor of love for me. I've enjoyed putting together many

02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:18.180
[Amit Varma]: stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe, and hopefully yours as well.

02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:23.060
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:27.540
[Amit Varma]: Although The Scene and The Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken up

02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:32.340
[Amit Varma]: to the insane engagement level of podcasts. And I do many, many hours of deep research for each

02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:39.060
[Amit Varma]: episode, besides all the logistics of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios,

02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:44.420
[Amit Varma]: paying technicians, the travel and so on. So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going.

02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:50.020
[Amit Varma]: And that involves you. My proposition for you is this. For every episode of The Scene and The

02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:55.780
[Amit Varma]: Unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel is worth.

02:11:55.780 --> 02:12:02.020
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of your

02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:08.020
[Amit Varma]: choice. This is not a subscription. The Scene and The Unseen will continue to be free on all

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:15.460
[Amit Varma]: podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in. This is just a gesture of appreciation. Help keep this thing

02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:24.020
[Amit Varma]: going. sceneunseen.in slash support. Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen. I'm chatting with

02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:28.980
[Amit Varma]: Arvind Subramaniam. And finally, after two hours of digressions and talking about ideas and concepts

02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:34.180
[Amit Varma]: and so on, I'm delighted that I've reached the specific moment where he becomes the chief

02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:38.500
[Amit Varma]: economic advisor. You mentioned you were on holiday in Machu Picchu when you got the phone call

02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:43.940
[Amit Varma]: asking if you'd be interested. So kind of take me through the process of what your thinking was

02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:48.500
[Amit Varma]: about the job. Should I take this job? What will I achieve? And also your early days in the job

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:53.380
[Amit Varma]: where you described this as quote, the most exciting job in the world, stop quote.

02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:59.060
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, family, we were all in Machu Picchu taking a family holiday. And in fact,

02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:04.340
[Guest]: I got an email from, you know, someone asking whether I'd be interested in the job. And,

02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:10.500
[Guest]: of course, you know, this is kind of the dream job for, you know, most economists who are

02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:14.820
[Guest]: interested in policy. And if you're, you know, interested in working on your own country,

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:21.060
[Guest]: and remember that, you know, the wonderful thing about India is that, you know, this notion,

02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:29.220
[Guest]: this concept of a technocratic policymaker, you know, either working with or in government is not

02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:33.700
[Guest]: at all new. I mean, it goes back, you know, decades, you know, even if you go back to the

02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:41.540
[Guest]: 60s and 50s, series of, you know, economists who've worked in, for, with government. And so

02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:47.300
[Guest]: this was just, and also remember, you know, we spoke about the would be reformers who came to

02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:53.220
[Guest]: government in the 70s and 80s. You know, we know the, you know, very illustrious people, you know,

02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:59.860
[Guest]: Monte Kalwalia, Shankaracharya, Rakesh Mohan, you know, Vijay Kelkar, you know, so many, and I

02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:06.180
[Guest]: should name many, many more. And then, of course, you know, Kaushik, Raghu, all these people. So

02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:12.100
[Guest]: it really is, you know, for an economist, you know, if you care about policymaking, so,

02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:16.980
[Guest]: so for me, it was not a difficult decision at all to accept. I mean, the only question was how

02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:22.340
[Guest]: we'd sort out the, you know, my family was still in the US, son was still, you know, in the last

02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:28.980
[Guest]: years of school. So, you know, we had to work that out. And, but so I went to India, I kind of

02:14:30.660 --> 02:14:35.380
[Guest]: met a few people, met Mr. Jaitley there. And then, of course, you know, what happened,

02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:40.420
[Guest]: I thought I was about to get the job. And then for two months, there was, you know,

02:14:40.420 --> 02:14:45.540
[Guest]: there was radio silence from the other end. And of course, you know, apparently some pushback,

02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:52.420
[Guest]: and, but finally, you know, it happened. And, and of course, Mr. Jaitley was also had his

02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:56.820
[Guest]: operation, then his bariatric surgery, that's also the interregnum. And then, of course,

02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:03.940
[Guest]: but when I came, I came with a sense of, you know, this is a dream job in terms of, you know,

02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:11.620
[Guest]: all the things that needed to be done and could be done. And I was really a man on a mission with,

02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:18.100
[Guest]: you know, thinking about nothing else. And from, you know, what needs to be done, how it needs to

02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:23.540
[Guest]: be done, what teams do we need to build? What are the various aspects of policy you want to get

02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:29.700
[Guest]: involved in? How to, you know, I did spend a fair amount of my time, you know, thinking about the

02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:34.580
[Guest]: Indian Economic Service, and how to, you know, build capacity for them, and, you know, all of

02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:37.780
[Guest]: that. So, and then, of course, the public communication part of it, right? I mean,

02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:45.380
[Guest]: you know, I had this, you know, maybe a completely misguided, deluded desire that,

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:51.220
[Guest]: you know, everything that one does, should be communicated in a way that kind of raises,

02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:55.220
[Guest]: you know, the level of discourse on these issues in India. And that's why, you know,

02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:59.780
[Guest]: when you look at the Economic Service, the point was, it must be very rigorous, obviously,

02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:07.060
[Guest]: but it must also, you know, it must come alive to people. And I don't know, I don't know,

02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:12.740
[Guest]: I guess, the motto for all this, the inspiration was that there's a famous quote by John Maynard

02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:17.780
[Guest]: Keynes about what it takes to be an economist, you should read that quote, you know, he must be,

02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:23.620
[Guest]: you know, mathematician, economist, he must be, you know, aloof, but he must be in the weeds,

02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:28.340
[Guest]: you know, it's like, he must be everything, you know. And that's the sense in which that's the

02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:36.260
[Guest]: kind of thing I had that. And, you know, it was very, very fortunate for me that I just had a

02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:42.420
[Guest]: a dream boss who, you know, open, constructive, it's not that he agreed with everything that I

02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:47.940
[Guest]: said, or not, you know, sometimes completely think, but, you know, you, that open communication,

02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:54.020
[Guest]: and, you know, and giving me both the freedom and the protection, actually, both to do this. And,

02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:58.980
[Guest]: you know, that's why, you know, I said, I would, I would get involved in everything. And the other,

02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:04.900
[Guest]: in terms of the how, I think, what is really critical, it's a point that, you know, Pratap

02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:12.500
[Guest]: made in your pieces, I think that when a kind of technocrat comes into policymaking, he should be

02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:19.300
[Guest]: given no, I mean, he should not, he or she should not think that just because he has an expertise,

02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:25.140
[Guest]: therefore, that kind of exempts him from the nitty gritty of, you know, building teams,

02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:30.420
[Guest]: you know, working with people, all down the hierarchy. And, you know, I really did want to,

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:35.220
[Guest]: you know, for example, when I worked on the GST, I used to work with people, you know, under

02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:40.180
[Guest]: secretaries, joint secretaries, you know, really, because, you know, they have so much value and

02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:44.020
[Guest]: knowledge. And it's not that I'm doing them a favor, they were, you know, doing me a favor,

02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:48.980
[Guest]: because they knew. So just this working with as many people as possible in government,

02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:55.460
[Guest]: and to do as many things as possible, I was just driven by that. And I really wanted to

02:17:55.460 --> 02:18:01.620
[Guest]: do all that I could. And of course, the Economic Surveys provided a forum. And being involved,

02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:07.380
[Guest]: I think, in some critical policies, like the GST, you know, also provided. But I did overreach,

02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:13.060
[Guest]: you know, I did think that I was no CEO has any business to be involved in. Because I felt that,

02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:18.980
[Guest]: you know, at the level of ideas, you could contribute even more than, you know, there's a

02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:23.620
[Guest]: part where you have to get into the trenches and do these things. But like in the Keynes quote,

02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:28.100
[Guest]: you should also be able to provide, you know, the big ideas around which you can have discussion,

02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:31.620
[Guest]: you know, whether they're going to get implemented immediately or not, you know, it's not,

02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:37.220
[Guest]: you know, up to you. But, you know, can you provide what I would call, you know, can you

02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:42.740
[Guest]: soak the intellectual ecosphere with ideas, then that you know, that others can, you know,

02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:47.940
[Guest]: reject or dismiss or accept or whatever. So that's what, you know, it was really an opportunity to do

02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:53.060
[Amit Varma]: a lot of things. I enjoyed your Economic Surveys a lot, especially, you know,

02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:58.020
[Amit Varma]: especially the fact that in a, you know, you're starting each chapter with a quote from a work

02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:04.740
[Amit Varma]: of literature and so on, far more readable than, you know, other such documents that I've read.

02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:09.860
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting sort of thing that kind of struck me while reading your book and while

02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:14.900
[Amit Varma]: reading what else you've written about it, is that I was, if I may say so, filled with

02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:19.860
[Amit Varma]: admiration for the man which is you, but ambivalence about the post, because as you've described the

02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:24.500
[Amit Varma]: post, your only job, the only job of the Chief Economic Advisor is the Economic Survey.

02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:30.020
[Amit Varma]: And after that, it's then up to the man that what can I do, and you pointed out how you went about

02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:34.500
[Amit Varma]: it with a sense of humility and team building, and you had been advised, I don't just talk to

02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:39.060
[Amit Varma]: the secretaries, talk to the joint secretaries, and you put in that time of effort. And there's

02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:43.780
[Amit Varma]: another great quote from you from an interview that you did with Shekhar Gupta, which I'll link

02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:48.740
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes where you say, quote, one thing we must try and avoid as economists is to

02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:53.700
[Amit Varma]: try and trace a direct link between what you say and what gets done. It's much more complicated and

02:19:53.700 --> 02:19:59.140
[Amit Varma]: subtle than that. You feed the ecosphere of ideas and policymaking, and various other forces come

02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:03.940
[Amit Varma]: into play, and then decisions are taken. Stop quote. So you pointed out about how one, you're

02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:08.660
[Amit Varma]: building a team that has both insiders from the Indian Economic Service as well as outside

02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:13.300
[Amit Varma]: consultants, and you're making them kind of work together. Two, you're in touch with all the joint

02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:17.860
[Amit Varma]: secretaries and the bureaucrats and so on. Three, it so happens that you have a very good relationship

02:20:17.860 --> 02:20:23.060
[Amit Varma]: with the minister, who's your boss, and all of these things are working. But what struck me while

02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:27.780
[Amit Varma]: reading all this was that fine, you've, you know, you build these relationships, and therefore you've

02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:33.700
[Amit Varma]: had whatever impact you have, some of which might even be diffused and hard to define precisely.

02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:39.940
[Amit Varma]: But isn't this something that should be a little more systemic built into the role of the position

02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:46.820
[Amit Varma]: itself, rather than just say that, okay, the job of the CEA is to do, you know, the economic survey

02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:51.380
[Guest]: every year, and after that, it's all, you know, it's all up in the air. So, Amit, it's something

02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:58.820
[Guest]: that I have thought about, right? But can I draw the analogy with kind of, you know, institutions

02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:04.660
[Guest]: and politics, right? In all these things that are kind of formal rules, you know, setting of

02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:10.980
[Guest]: objectives, you know, even monitoring outcomes, whatever, you have the whole system of formal

02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:18.260
[Guest]: things. But then so much of what we know about outcomes are determined by, you know, individuals

02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:23.780
[Guest]: and the informal network of relations that you build. So the question is that I just feel that

02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:30.100
[Guest]: if that's true, more broadly, it's why should it not be true of, you know, any significant post

02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:34.980
[Guest]: in government like that of the CEA. So I think that, you know, I think we have this

02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:39.860
[Guest]: slightly exaggerated importance in informal structures and formal rules,

02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:46.820
[Guest]: and not enough attention we pay. I mean, that's not to say that maybe you shouldn't define a few

02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:54.180
[Guest]: more things, for example, and maybe there is scope for that. But, you know, you know, had I had a

02:21:54.180 --> 02:21:59.060
[Guest]: different boss, or, you know, had, you know, my temperament been a little bit different,

02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:02.900
[Guest]: you know, regardless of what the formal rules were, you know, the outcomes would have been

02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:08.980
[Guest]: very different. So I just feel that there should be both a set of formal, a set of rules, but

02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:15.380
[Guest]: a lot more gets, you know, it's like politics as well, you know, there are, you know, politicians

02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:19.380
[Guest]: who do well and politicians who don't do well, it's, you know, by dint of their, you know,

02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:25.300
[Guest]: personality and so on. So why would that be any different here? So while that's not a thing to

02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:32.660
[Guest]: not have some more kind of structure, I mean, but I think there is enough structure to kind of, you

02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:39.620
[Guest]: know, give the opportunity to the incumbent to kind of play a helpful role, both inside and

02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:44.500
[Amit Varma]: outside government. And, you know, many of us have an impression of the state which comes,

02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:48.500
[Amit Varma]: especially for people of my generation from watching Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister,

02:22:48.500 --> 02:22:52.500
[Amit Varma]: where you know, Parkinson's law that the only thing a bureaucrat wants to do is expand their

02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:57.780
[Amit Varma]: budgets or their power or whatever. And, but you know, of course, in Yes Minister, your caricature

02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:02.580
[Amit Varma]: bureaucrat is deliberately obfuscatory. While whatever I've heard from people who work within

02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:07.460
[Amit Varma]: the system in India is that bureaucrats are often incredibly smart, well informed, well meaning,

02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:13.940
[Amit Varma]: they want to do the right thing. And yet, it seems sometimes that the system is so creaky

02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:20.980
[Amit Varma]: and things happen so kind of at a snail's pace. So, you know, even with the best intentions,

02:23:20.980 --> 02:23:25.300
[Amit Varma]: I'm very fascinated to know about sort of your experience in the belly of this beast.

02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:32.420
[Guest]: I would say that, you know, I went in and I have come out with an enormous admiration for

02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:38.660
[Guest]: all the, you know, most of the, you know, colleagues that I've worked with, you know,

02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:43.780
[Guest]: right down the hierarchy from secretaries to, to the lowliest, whatever, I say lowly,

02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:48.580
[Guest]: only in a hierarchical, not in a, in any pejorative sense at all. You know, there are

02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:55.540
[Guest]: people at the lower end who have so much to contribute as well. And I think my default

02:23:55.540 --> 02:24:01.460
[Guest]: mode was, people were helpful, people were constructive, people were, you know, wanting to,

02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:09.220
[Guest]: you know, be nice and good. But yet, it is true that, you know, the sum turns out to be

02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:14.660
[Guest]: a little bit, this is what you were, I think, implying as well. The sum does turn out to be

02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:21.140
[Guest]: a little bit different, you know, than the parts. But, I mean, that being said, I think that

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:30.180
[Guest]: I would not succumb to any kind of cynicism or, you know, negativity about, you know,

02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:34.580
[Guest]: the quality of staff and the quality of state capacity within government. I mean,

02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:40.660
[Guest]: they're just exceptional people, you know, across the sphere. And, you know, you will get your,

02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:45.460
[Guest]: you know, in any institution, you will get your, you know, people on the left tail of the

02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:51.860
[Guest]: distribution. And it's not a, but you certainly don't get more of that, say, in the Indian

02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:57.460
[Guest]: government. And I would say on the right tail, you get a lot of exceptional people on the right tail

02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:06.420
[Guest]: that you can work with. So, you know, so that's why I think that, you know, as certainly as kind

02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:12.660
[Guest]: of personal advice or whatever, to work in government is kind of still the, you know,

02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:18.580
[Guest]: a high calling, it's a worthwhile calling, and I would urge, and that's why I do believe strongly

02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:23.220
[Guest]: that, you know, all the technocratic services like the Indian Economic Service and so on, I think,

02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:29.300
[Guest]: you know, we must invest a lot in improving their capacity, their training, and so on,

02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:34.260
[Guest]: because I think, ultimately, it matters a lot. Ultimately, you see, just stepping back a little

02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:42.020
[Guest]: bit, you know, Amit, you know, I think that there was a view of the world, and I think it's a

02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:48.020
[Guest]: legitimate view that, you know, what the state needed to do was not to do certain things. But I

02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:51.860
[Guest]: think we've come around to the view, while that's very, very important, I think that, you know,

02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:57.860
[Guest]: the state also has to do a lot of good things, you know, and I think this kind of, and I certainly

02:25:57.860 --> 02:26:05.380
[Guest]: saw myself, my office, the Indian Economic Service, other parts of government, as very much

02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:11.380
[Guest]: part of state capacity. And, you know, when, you know, the, for example, the economic surveys were,

02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:16.900
[Guest]: you know, reasonably well read, and, you know, internationally also well read, I felt that,

02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:25.060
[Guest]: you know, this was really an effort to show that Indian state capacity could deliver at,

02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:30.420
[Guest]: you know, international, you know, levels of, you know, efficiency and standards,

02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:35.700
[Guest]: and sometimes maybe even more. And that it's doable, that we have the ability to do that,

02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:40.100
[Guest]: it's not because we don't have the talent, or we don't have whatever, you know, or we have,

02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:45.540
[Guest]: you know, this image of, you know, the kind of bad bureaucratic state at all. I think that

02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:53.300
[Guest]: the Indian state certainly allows opportunities for people to, you know, express themselves and

02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:58.820
[Guest]: contribute as much. So I would not at all succumb to any kind of cynicism or negativity on that

02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:03.220
[Guest]: score. And it's not just true, you know, you know, my being in CA, I mean, it's been true.

02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:10.820
[Guest]: How many technocrats have done such good work in Indian government? I think that's, it's really it,

02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:16.100
[Guest]: but it is true. I mean, all that being said, a lot is going to so, so partially answering your

02:27:16.100 --> 02:27:21.620
[Guest]: question, then why does the sum turn out to be different? I mean, it's certainly, you know,

02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:28.820
[Guest]: the usual, what is the ecosphere of ideas, you know, politics, political compulsions,

02:27:28.820 --> 02:27:37.380
[Guest]: interests, and so on, you know, obviously, they're going to have a final say in what gets done. So

02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:45.540
[Guest]: that I think that but the input on the part of the technocrats can be as good as needs to be.

02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:49.700
[Guest]: And I don't think the system holds that back in any systematic way.

02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:55.700
[Amit Varma]: That's what I've heard from all my friends in policy, that there is no shortage of intellectual

02:27:55.700 --> 02:28:00.100
[Amit Varma]: capacity, that even in terms of mindsets have gradually changed, which is why it's constantly

02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:05.060
[Amit Varma]: kind of baffled me that for so many years, and so many of the different areas like agriculture,

02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:10.180
[Amit Varma]: for example, or education or whatever, we know what the solutions are. We've, you know, journalists

02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:16.740
[Amit Varma]: have been writing about it for 20-30 years. It's part of the ecosystem, the ecosphere of ideas,

02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:22.980
[Amit Varma]: as you say in it, yet nothing seems to get done, which was a mystery to me. And I guess one part

02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:29.060
[Amit Varma]: of the mystery could be just politics, like it has always seemed to me that, you know,

02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:33.380
[Amit Varma]: politics becomes a fatal flaw when you want to carry reform out because the incentives of

02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:40.180
[Amit Varma]: politicians, you know, deviate in two significant ways. One is the short termism that they need to

02:28:40.180 --> 02:28:45.060
[Amit Varma]: win elections all the time. And therefore, they want to do something which will show results

02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:51.220
[Amit Varma]: immediately and not 10-15 years down the line and which is attributable to them. And secondly,

02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:58.260
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that populist ideas sell that a lot of the ideas, the more complex ideas of economics

02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:03.540
[Amit Varma]: like spontaneous order and the positive some nature of voluntary interaction, they're deeply

02:29:03.540 --> 02:29:09.780
[Amit Varma]: unintuitive, people don't get it. Well, people very easily get, you know, ideas of welfarism

02:29:09.780 --> 02:29:14.580
[Amit Varma]: and handouts and things which sort of coincide with our intuition of the world as a zero sum

02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:20.980
[Amit Varma]: game, which of course, it's not. So, you know, how was it for you to then sort of work with

02:29:20.980 --> 02:29:25.860
[Amit Varma]: politicians within the system? And did you when you were selling reform to them? Did you have to

02:29:25.860 --> 02:29:31.380
[Amit Varma]: add a layer of it, not just a layer of what is the economic benefit, but what is a political benefit?

02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:39.300
[Guest]: Absolutely. See, I think that, look, fundamentally, I think, I mean, one way of putting it would be

02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:46.500
[Guest]: to say that if you did not believe that good economics was good politics, right, we should

02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:53.700
[Guest]: just give up on our thing, right? But the only thing is that you qualify that or you at least

02:29:53.700 --> 02:30:00.500
[Guest]: reconcile yourself to the fact that, you know, the horizons over which that might happen might

02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:05.540
[Guest]: not be, you know, one election, but you know, whatever. But even within that, I think, you know,

02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:11.300
[Guest]: people, you know, I certainly did not subscribe to the views that you give the technical thing,

02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:18.900
[Guest]: and, you know, let the politics take over. No, you know, lots of my discussions with, you know,

02:30:18.900 --> 02:30:24.900
[Guest]: with the senior politicians would be to say why, you know, good economics is good politics. And,

02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:34.100
[Guest]: you know, sometimes, you know, as again, I think the Keynes quote that, you know, you have to be,

02:30:34.100 --> 02:30:38.580
[Guest]: you know, behave like a grubby politician, you know, you have to be in the trenches, you have

02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:43.540
[Guest]: to use all the arguments that you can, you know, for example, in the case of the of the GST, for

02:30:43.540 --> 02:30:55.620
[Guest]: example, you know, I would, you know, say that we need low rates, because, you know, you're a party

02:30:55.620 --> 02:31:04.180
[Guest]: that believes in, you know, low taxes, and, you know, lower inflation. So, you know, so, harnessing

02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:10.820
[Guest]: those kinds of arguments to make your case, I think, are critical. So I think that, but if

02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:15.620
[Guest]: fundamentally good economics is not good politics over various, you know, over a sufficiently long

02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:23.300
[Guest]: period of time, then of course, it's a difficult thing. But I do want to come back to one, you

02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:30.100
[Guest]: know, so when we talk about the sum and the parts, right, what you said, you know, the supply of

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:37.220
[Guest]: capacity, but the outcome depends upon the demands of the demand side, which is politics, and so on.

02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:44.100
[Guest]: So, Shailesh, I think, I don't know whether this came up in your talk on education. So it was very

02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:51.140
[Guest]: rewarding, or very heartening in a certain period in Indian politics, when you felt that routine

02:31:51.140 --> 02:31:57.380
[Guest]: anti-incumbency gave way to, you know, electoral politics being rewarded by good or bad performance,

02:31:58.100 --> 02:32:03.060
[Guest]: rewarded through good and penalized through bad performance. But here's, I think, one of the

02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:09.620
[Guest]: biggest, biggest, take the field of education, for example, right? You know, it was the original sin,

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:18.660
[Guest]: we didn't do basic education. But here's a kind of a puzzle of Indian politics that I kind of still

02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:29.380
[Guest]: grapple with is, if you have a lot of poor, uneducated kids, why does democratic politics

02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:39.540
[Guest]: not make the provision of that an electorally, you know, rewarding exercise? So that's kind of

02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:44.260
[Guest]: the demand side that, you know, all of us, you know, we may say, you know, no simplicity in the

02:32:44.260 --> 02:32:49.380
[Guest]: GST, but, you know, finally, at least democratic politics should rule. So in the case of education,

02:32:50.020 --> 02:32:54.100
[Guest]: you see, and remember, because it's a state subject, or at least whatever,

02:32:55.140 --> 02:33:01.940
[Guest]: this is a question that over 70 years, why was it not the case that some state government

02:33:01.940 --> 02:33:06.660
[Guest]: somewhere in time, you know, because, you know, it's not that there are, you know, 10% of the

02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:11.780
[Guest]: population is uneducated, it's like, you know, massive amounts. So you would think one, but

02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:19.060
[Guest]: second, the puzzle gets compounded, because in the post liberalization era, when the private

02:33:19.060 --> 02:33:24.740
[Guest]: returns to education went up so much, you know, why didn't people get even more things saying,

02:33:24.740 --> 02:33:30.260
[Guest]: look, you know, it's not a social good, it's a private good, my kids will get better jobs,

02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:38.580
[Guest]: get higher salaries, because this, why didn't that also, I think, you know, so if that part of the

02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:44.500
[Guest]: the puzzle is, in some sense, inadequate or missing, then you will always, you know,

02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:49.460
[Guest]: flounder in terms of, you know, the kind of almost the frustration that you feel that

02:33:49.460 --> 02:33:54.420
[Guest]: how come outcomes are so disappointing, relative to this, you know, I think that's kind of,

02:33:54.420 --> 02:34:00.980
[Guest]: you know, fundamental in democratic politics. And that's why, you know, you know, I'm not a

02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:06.740
[Guest]: partisan, I have no party affiliation or anything. But it did seem to be the case that,

02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:13.780
[Guest]: you know, the Aam Aadmi Party in its first term, staked its electoral fortunes on health and on

02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:17.860
[Guest]: the provision of health and education. That was made it a really interesting thing, because they

02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:23.300
[Guest]: were saying, look, crudely speaking, you know, vote for us, because we provide your kids health

02:34:23.300 --> 02:34:30.020
[Guest]: and education. So if that, you know, and that's true, not just education, but in other places as

02:34:30.020 --> 02:34:36.900
[Guest]: well. So if you're in this system of democratic politics, you always have to, you know, wonder,

02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:43.060
[Guest]: or take account of the fact that, you know, if there's a gap between outcomes and capacity,

02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:48.100
[Guest]: there is a, you know, that black box of democratic politics, which I think is going to

02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:53.300
[Guest]: invariably affect the outcome. And so, you know, cracking that in some sense,

02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:58.500
[Guest]: is going to be more as important as just having, you know, smart people in government,

02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:02.820
[Amit Varma]: smart technocrats in government. No, no, that's very insightful, what you just said.

02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:07.060
[Amit Varma]: But the two halves of what you just said seem to be at cross purposes, because,

02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:11.860
[Amit Varma]: you know, I agree with you that good economics should be sold as good politics for it to get

02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:15.940
[Amit Varma]: through. But it doesn't seem to me to be the case that good economics is good politics, because,

02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:20.180
[Amit Varma]: you know, demonetization was good politics. And I don't think it was good economics. But even apart

02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:25.140
[Amit Varma]: from that, I mean, I think it is evident that if good economics was good politics, and given that

02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:30.740
[Amit Varma]: politics is a game of supply and demand, you know, we would all be doing well, all policies would be

02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:35.460
[Amit Varma]: good, because, you know, politics would see to that, but that seems to be to be not be the same.

02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:40.500
[Amit Varma]: And I wonder if you have any candidate answers for the question that you pose that, you know,

02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:44.980
[Amit Varma]: given that we are so uneducated, and people want it and all of that, still, the state hasn't been

02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:51.460
[Amit Varma]: able to, you know, fix a problem, which would, you know, seem to, you know, which is a very powerful

02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:55.620
[Amit Varma]: and evocative rhetorical question, because obviously, it's a great moral feeling of the

02:35:55.620 --> 02:36:01.380
[Amit Varma]: Indian state that we have failed so miserably in this. But what are sort of your candidate answers

02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:06.260
[Amit Varma]: for that? Why is it the case that, you know, the supply hasn't caught up with the demand in terms

02:36:06.260 --> 02:36:13.380
[Guest]: of outcomes? I mean, you would have to get into, you know, what are the feelings of Indian democratic

02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:20.100
[Guest]: politics more broadly. And I think that, you know, certainly the fact that, you know, you know,

02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:26.020
[Guest]: the points that you've said are not unimportant, you know. So I think one point that you made,

02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:34.100
[Guest]: I think, is really very important. And I think it's worth emphasizing. It's not so much the

02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:40.340
[Guest]: short term thing, but a related, you know, in politics, you know, attribution and getting

02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:47.540
[Guest]: credit for what you do, is like, you know, absolutely fundamental to democratic politics.

02:36:47.540 --> 02:36:54.580
[Guest]: And I think that, you know, when you think about why did this government choose the public

02:36:54.580 --> 02:37:02.580
[Guest]: provision of private goods and services, that's part of the answer. You know, if you produce,

02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:11.220
[Guest]: you know, if you say I produce more growth, the link between, you know, the outcome and who was

02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:17.540
[Guest]: responsible for that outcome gets, you know, attenuated, as it were. But when you provide the

02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:24.100
[Guest]: toilets, when you provide this, all of that, for example, I think that, so the thing with, you know,

02:37:24.100 --> 02:37:30.180
[Guest]: with things like health and education, certainly, you know, education, the fact that it's not,

02:37:30.180 --> 02:37:35.380
[Guest]: because remember, so the attribution thing which you raised, there are two dimensions to it in

02:37:35.380 --> 02:37:41.300
[Guest]: India. One is what we just spoke about, you know, who gets good. The second thing is that that gets

02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:50.900
[Guest]: mixed in with federalism. So, for example, you know, if someone at the center wants to do something

02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:57.220
[Guest]: that was the prerogative of the states, and, you know, cannot get credit for that, it's going to

02:37:57.220 --> 02:38:02.580
[Guest]: be under provided. So, you know, schooling and health are provided by state governments.

02:38:02.580 --> 02:38:07.060
[Guest]: And therefore, you know, you want to, you know, not emphasize that because you, you know,

02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:11.940
[Guest]: if you just give more resources, and God forbid, it actually succeeds, you know, someone else is

02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:16.500
[Guest]: getting the credit for that, and you don't. And that's, and that's why also, if you see, for

02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:23.220
[Guest]: example, the health schemes that were started, were schemes that for which the, you know,

02:38:23.220 --> 02:38:29.780
[Guest]: attribution could be for, you know, you know, the person at the center providing this. So I think

02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:35.220
[Guest]: it's, so for me, that was a new learning experience. It's, you know, we know good economics,

02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:41.380
[Guest]: we know the short termism, but how do you satisfy this, you know, and that's intrinsic to politics,

02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:46.660
[Guest]: you know, you, you get elected, but in a sense, but but remember that, in a sense, that should

02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:54.100
[Guest]: also take away your cynicism, because you know, that if a politician is craving attribution,

02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:59.780
[Guest]: then you know, there's, you know, it matters to the, you know, he knows that it matters to the voters

02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:03.860
[Guest]: for him to want attribution in the first place. And therefore, you know, it should kind of say that,

02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:09.380
[Guest]: well, how can I do things that, you know, that can not only be done, but for which, you know,

02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:14.660
[Guest]: attribution can be, you know, appropriated, as it were, so that it also makes good politics,

02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:19.060
[Guest]: makes for good politics. So I think these are, I mean, I think this attribution thing is just

02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:26.500
[Guest]: so, I mean, that's also why, you know, when leaders kind of want to do schemes, they want

02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:32.340
[Guest]: to be associated with them, and, you know, and not with anyone else. You know, so it has a downside,

02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:37.540
[Guest]: and it has it, but it can potentially be harnessed. But it's just something that you cannot

02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:44.740
[Guest]: ignore about democratic politics, that, you know, so if it were the case that, you know, I guess,

02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:50.580
[Guest]: if it were the case that, you know, somehow, you could show within five years that your child,

02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:57.220
[Guest]: you know, because of what I did, got actually got a better job and more, more, more earning power,

02:39:57.220 --> 02:40:01.060
[Guest]: problem is that can't happen, you know, that there is a so so there is a problem, you know,

02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:06.260
[Guest]: attribution cannot be, you know, if there are things that have long gestation lags,

02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:13.540
[Guest]: you have to contend with that as well. So it just makes, you know, policymaking more difficult,

02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:21.460
[Guest]: but again, not, shouldn't fall prey to, you know, giving up or cynicism. But that's what,

02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:23.300
[Guest]: you know, that's what I would strongly feel.

02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:28.740
[Amit Varma]: No, that issue of attribution is a fantastic nuance. But it also strikes me that,

02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:31.780
[Amit Varma]: you know, in some cases, for example, let's take agriculture, right?

02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:37.220
[Guest]: I was going to come to agriculture, by the way. But go ahead, but go ahead.

02:40:37.220 --> 02:40:42.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, it is often the case that the demand would be for a policy that is bad economically,

02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:47.140
[Amit Varma]: is bad economics and not for something that is good economics. For example, you know,

02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:54.340
[Amit Varma]: the farmer may not want the removal of MSPs or fertilizer subsidies, but may instead want a

02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:59.380
[Amit Varma]: farm loan waiver and often a farm loan waiver is a necessary anesthetic. So I'm not disputing that.

02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:04.980
[Amit Varma]: But the really the core structural reforms like the removing the MSP or removing fertilizer

02:41:04.980 --> 02:41:09.140
[Amit Varma]: subsidy or power subsidy, for example, which makes Punjab grow so much rice when it has no

02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:13.300
[Amit Varma]: business growing rice, for example, those can never happen, because those cannot be sold

02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:18.420
[Amit Varma]: politically. And that seems to me to be a clear instance of where, you know, economics and

02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:22.740
[Guest]: politics run counter to each other. No, but see, but Amit, okay, let me actually a little bit push

02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:29.540
[Guest]: back a little bit, right? So look, the world over, you know, once you give an entitlement,

02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:34.660
[Guest]: taking away an entitlement is, you know, it's a universal law of politics that, you know,

02:41:34.660 --> 02:41:39.060
[Guest]: it's called the third rail here, you know, whatever, you know, there is something. So I would

02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:44.820
[Guest]: not say, therefore, you know, the fact that you can't take away subsidies is, you know, bad politics,

02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:53.460
[Guest]: right? So the challenge, therefore, for policymakers and politicians is, in fact, you know, so just to

02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:59.140
[Guest]: give a concrete example, you certainly cannot take away fertilizer subsidies on its own in India,

02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:04.900
[Guest]: right? But look at the two successes that have happened, right? And so just tells you that the

02:42:04.900 --> 02:42:12.340
[Guest]: options are in. One is that supposing you tied the taking away of the subsidy to a universal basic

02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:18.020
[Guest]: income. So you linked two reforms in a way that you don't take away an entitlement, you just

02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:23.060
[Guest]: replace it with a better, more efficient enlightenment. So that's a way forward for,

02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:28.180
[Guest]: you know, thinking about policymaking in creative ways. The other thing, of course, is that remember

02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:34.180
[Guest]: how the petroleum subsidy was eliminated in India, it's just very small, but very frequent changes

02:42:34.180 --> 02:42:43.140
[Guest]: over time. So that, you know, it is kind of the behavioral economics insight, where you say,

02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:48.100
[Guest]: you know, you don't want to impose huge costs, suddenly, the costs are spread out over time.

02:42:48.100 --> 02:42:52.740
[Guest]: And then you can, you know, in that case, even without replacing it, you were able to eliminate

02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:59.060
[Guest]: a subsidy. So I think there are lots of, you know, ways like that. So I think the other kind of,

02:42:59.060 --> 02:43:04.340
[Guest]: you know, behavioral economics thing is that the whole give it up scheme early on, for example,

02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:12.260
[Guest]: right, is a kind of way of, you know, can you kind of use name and shame kind of things to,

02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:16.660
[Guest]: you know, say, it's like the way I would implement the universe, you know, I had this kind of

02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:22.900
[Guest]: fascinating discussion with, with the Telangana chief, Mr. KCR on his, you know, he was the

02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:28.340
[Guest]: original scheme, the Raithubandhu scheme, right, that was a kind of, in some ways, India's first,

02:43:28.980 --> 02:43:34.020
[Guest]: you know, kind of, kind of, I mean, to be a universal basic income kind of scheme,

02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:39.780
[Guest]: not quite, but sort of, and, you know, talking with him about the politics of that is actually

02:43:39.780 --> 02:43:46.580
[Guest]: fascinating. So, so if you think about it, right, my preferred thing is not a universal basic income,

02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:52.340
[Guest]: but a quasi universal basic income, i.e. don't give it to everyone, give it to everyone, but

02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:56.980
[Guest]: someone a few at the top, because, you know, you can make it more affordable, you can make it less

02:43:56.980 --> 02:44:03.140
[Guest]: costly. And also the notion that, you know, you know, you know, the big businessman doesn't don't

02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:08.260
[Guest]: deserve a 10,000 rupee check, it's kind of ever, right. And also, it may be more, more easier to

02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:14.980
[Guest]: implement. But here's where ideas like, you know, don't make it don't make the taking away mandatory,

02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:20.980
[Guest]: but kind of make it voluntary, for example. So there are lots of ideas like that, which can,

02:44:20.980 --> 02:44:27.540
[Guest]: you know, make, you know, reasonable policymaking, you know, a good policy is feasible,

02:44:27.540 --> 02:44:31.220
[Guest]: and not say, you know, take, you know, nowhere in the world, can you take away an entitlement and

02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:38.180
[Guest]: say, you know, this is a, you know, and say, so, so I think, you know, again, it's the task of

02:44:38.180 --> 02:44:45.860
[Guest]: policymakers and technocrats to kind of internalize this when they talk about policymaking.

02:44:45.860 --> 02:44:50.820
[Amit Varma]: Looking back on your time as Chief Economic Advisor, what would you look at, you know,

02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:55.540
[Amit Varma]: as your biggest success, maybe not a specific policy, but just a process you put in place or

02:44:55.540 --> 02:45:00.260
[Amit Varma]: whatever, what frustrated you the most? And most interestingly, is there something that

02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:05.460
[Amit Varma]: you've changed your mind on, you know, during the course of becoming the CEA?

02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:14.980
[Guest]: Right, that's a great question. See, I think that, you know, in terms of any one,

02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:25.540
[Guest]: you know, any one thing, I think, it'd be difficult to say, because, you know, I guess what,

02:45:25.540 --> 02:45:31.540
[Guest]: you know, I would want a kind of people to take away is that, you know, fundamentally,

02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:36.580
[Guest]: what we spoke about, that there are things that are doable, you know, across the board,

02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:41.540
[Guest]: it's not any one thing, you know, whether it's better advice for policymaking, better analysis,

02:45:41.540 --> 02:45:48.020
[Guest]: better communication, you know, so a whole more training, building capacity, working with

02:45:48.020 --> 02:45:57.860
[Guest]: youngsters, you know, lots of things are, I think, so it's more, we should have more ambition about

02:45:57.860 --> 02:46:03.140
[Guest]: state capacity, in some ways, I think that that's what I would hope, you know, maybe there'll be

02:46:03.140 --> 02:46:08.580
[Guest]: people who say no, it shows exactly the opposite, you know, there'll be people who say that as well.

02:46:08.580 --> 02:46:16.900
[Guest]: On, you know, I certainly I write in my book that, you know, I think the fertilizer subsidy is,

02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:21.460
[Guest]: you know, I worked really hard on that. And, you know, nothing really happened. And,

02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:27.220
[Guest]: you know, that, for me, was was kind of a big disappointment, which, of course,

02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:31.860
[Guest]: there were other aspects, I mean, the way the kind of GST turned out relative to the original

02:46:31.860 --> 02:46:37.300
[Guest]: conception, I think that also was left me, you know, a little bit, but I think hopefully these

02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:44.340
[Guest]: are not irretrievable mistakes, I think, I hope they can be rectified. The last question about,

02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:52.340
[Guest]: you know, I mean, I have changed my mind on, you know, specific aspects of, you know,

02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:59.940
[Guest]: even the whole GST, what we spoke about, you know, the trade off between efficiency and the

02:46:59.940 --> 02:47:07.300
[Guest]: loss of fiscal sovereignty. I, you know, I think I have learned that, you know, maybe that trade

02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:14.580
[Guest]: off is much more complicated than we originally thought. I think that I think we didn't go into

02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:23.140
[Guest]: this, but the whole kind of measurement issue, which, you know, I think is is also something

02:47:23.140 --> 02:47:29.700
[Guest]: that I feel, you know, maybe we could have done more on and, you know, although, you know, I did

02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:39.300
[Guest]: try to do it in government, that's something that, but I fundamentally come away more feeling that,

02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:51.860
[Guest]: you know, a kind of optimism and hopefulness that these are opportunities for doing rather than

02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:57.940
[Guest]: the more kind of pessimistic, cynical view that, you know, that actually this experience shows,

02:47:57.940 --> 02:48:04.740
[Guest]: you know, so in some ways, my ex ante going into government, as I said, was that, you know,

02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:11.700
[Guest]: ex ante, I thought that actually, it would be much more difficult, you know, ability to do things

02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:19.940
[Guest]: would be much less. But I come away actually having changed my ex ante perception of this,

02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:26.660
[Guest]: and certainly feel that these are all opportunities for where, you know, one should be more

02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:33.620
[Guest]: optimistic, you know, proactive, and have the belief that, you know, things can be done well,

02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:41.140
[Guest]: and done well, and rather than the others. So there is a change in my ex ante view.

02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:47.700
[Guest]: But ex post, I come away thinking that, you know, in that sense, ex post, I feel,

02:48:48.980 --> 02:48:54.660
[Guest]: you know, not I have not changed that much about looking back that, you know, you can do a lot.

02:48:54.660 --> 02:49:00.340
[Guest]: And so, let's see, I think that's what I kind of come away with. No, in particular regrets,

02:49:00.340 --> 02:49:06.340
[Guest]: particular highs, I think there will be but, you know, those are, but fundamentally, I think,

02:49:06.340 --> 02:49:10.820
[Guest]: of course, with the with the caveat, always, there's a caveat, and I don't want this,

02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:16.820
[Guest]: the caveat always is that all of this is subject to the broader, you know, configuration of

02:49:16.820 --> 02:49:22.980
[Guest]: personalities and politics, you know, you know, I don't want to, by any means, discount that. So

02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:28.020
[Guest]: that's kind of, I mean, that's a card that, you know, you don't control. So that that you just

02:49:28.020 --> 02:49:33.380
[Amit Varma]: work with that. I must confess here that, you know, I'd expected that over this time, you would

02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:36.900
[Amit Varma]: have become less hopeful, but it turns out that you're actually more hopeful, which, you know,

02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:41.540
[Amit Varma]: should give all of us hope as well, that maybe there is scope for change in the system. I've

02:49:41.540 --> 02:49:46.340
[Amit Varma]: taken up a lot of your time. So I'll come to my penultimate question. Now, before I go to my final

02:49:46.340 --> 02:49:50.740
[Amit Varma]: question, which is a penultimate question is that and I want this to be a pre COVID question that

02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:56.580
[Amit Varma]: before COVID happened in March or in Feb, or whenever, if you were to take stock of the Indian

02:49:56.580 --> 02:50:02.580
[Amit Varma]: economy as things are today, and sort of describe what is wrong with it and what the big dangers are

02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:08.180
[Amit Varma]: and you know, what are the things that we should be worried about? What would you pick like one

02:50:08.180 --> 02:50:12.340
[Amit Varma]: subject that we haven't spoken on at all during this, but you've written so much on is the

02:50:12.340 --> 02:50:16.660
[Amit Varma]: financial system, the credit crisis, you know, I was part of this reading group, which was active

02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:20.900
[Amit Varma]: last year, which was run by Ajay Shah, and he brought your friend Josh Feldman to it a couple

02:50:20.900 --> 02:50:26.260
[Amit Varma]: of times. And Josh used to be, you know, used to scare everyone by talking about how the credit

02:50:26.260 --> 02:50:32.420
[Amit Varma]: crisis was such a cancer within the Indian system and was just affecting every other part of the

02:50:32.420 --> 02:50:37.620
[Amit Varma]: Indian economy and how disastrous it was. And I get the same sense when I read the things that you

02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:44.260
[Amit Varma]: have written that I think that, you know, people who are not familiar with policy and, you know,

02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:49.780
[Amit Varma]: the actual particulars, don't really understand how bad things really are. So is that your main

02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:54.580
[Amit Varma]: concern about the Indian economy? Like, how would you sum up the things that worry you?

02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:59.860
[Guest]: You know, again, here, I want to give the answer at two levels, right? One is that,

02:50:59.860 --> 02:51:04.980
[Guest]: you know, even the paper that Josh and I wrote in 2019, when we said the economy was in

02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:11.380
[Guest]: ICU, this is pre COVID, right? And remember, at that stage, we said that the twin balance

02:51:11.380 --> 02:51:15.780
[Guest]: sheet problem had become the four balance sheet problem, because, you know, and by the way,

02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:21.620
[Guest]: I have to give, you know, two people entire credit for alerting me to how important one is,

02:51:22.180 --> 02:51:25.540
[Guest]: Josh, of course, who from day one has been telling me it's important. And of course,

02:51:25.540 --> 02:51:30.100
[Guest]: the work of Ashish Gupta, I think, has been very, very influential in thinking about the

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:36.260
[Guest]: empirical basis for that view. But you know, in late 2019, we said that the twin balance sheet

02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:41.780
[Guest]: problem had become the four balance sheet problem, right? And in recent pieces, we've written,

02:51:41.780 --> 02:51:48.260
[Guest]: you know, our view is that now, rather than, you know, identifying balance sheets, which have a

02:51:48.260 --> 02:51:53.780
[Guest]: problem, it's probably easier to identify those that don't have a problem, because almost every

02:51:53.780 --> 02:52:01.860
[Guest]: balance sheet is, is short in India. But here's, I think, a kind of, so I think that's problem

02:52:01.860 --> 02:52:08.580
[Guest]: number one, right? But there's a kind of deeper question here. And I think I want to, you know,

02:52:08.580 --> 02:52:15.540
[Guest]: raise this, you know, in the last minute is that, you know, why is it that policymakers have not

02:52:15.540 --> 02:52:20.020
[Guest]: taken this seriously in India? Because that's the deeper question, you know, you know, all of us can

02:52:20.020 --> 02:52:27.460
[Guest]: keep saying, but it's not resonating with the kind of intensity that it should, right? And I have two

02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:34.580
[Guest]: kind of tentative solutions for the hypotheses for that. One is that, you know, it's in the nature of

02:52:34.580 --> 02:52:42.900
[Guest]: these things that when you have big, disruptive changes, like crises, you have more of a policy

02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:49.540
[Guest]: response, when you have a kind of slow bleed kind of situation, which is what this whole financial

02:52:49.540 --> 02:52:55.540
[Guest]: crisis has been about. Because remember, we identified the twin balance sheet in 2014. I

02:52:55.540 --> 02:53:01.460
[Guest]: think that, you know, that the slow bleed is, by definition, not conducive to, you know, you say,

02:53:03.060 --> 02:53:08.260
[Guest]: okay, not 5%, we'll get to 3%, 4%, or maybe 5,000, or whatever. And that lack of that,

02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:12.820
[Guest]: by the way, and this is abstracting from the usual, you know, political interest,

02:53:12.820 --> 02:53:16.500
[Guest]: commercial interest, you know, crony capitalism, all of that is there. But I want to get to

02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:23.060
[Guest]: something, why don't policymakers respond? And I think my second hypothesis for this is that,

02:53:23.060 --> 02:53:36.340
[Guest]: look, it's, you know, that India has never had the only major crises it has had are all macroeconomic

02:53:36.340 --> 02:53:41.300
[Guest]: and, you know, whatever, you know, 66, we had the food crisis, you know, basically the four Fs,

02:53:41.300 --> 02:53:47.220
[Guest]: you know, food, fuel, forex, fiscal, these have been the source of crisis. And usually,

02:53:47.220 --> 02:53:51.780
[Guest]: they've been fairly disruptive and sudden and things, and people have responded. So whether

02:53:51.780 --> 02:53:58.820
[Guest]: it's 66, or, you know, 91, or, you know, 2013, or now, now big things happen, you want to respond

02:53:58.820 --> 02:54:07.940
[Guest]: 1979, 80, as well. This is like a slow bleed, not so big, but we've had no experience of this in

02:54:07.940 --> 02:54:13.700
[Guest]: the past. So we have not been kind of, you know, socially kind of inoculated to this kind of, you

02:54:13.700 --> 02:54:22.660
[Guest]: know, we don't, it's a bit like, why did the West, you know, not react as quickly to COVID as East

02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:29.140
[Guest]: Asia? I mean, remember, as Nietzsche said, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger. You

02:54:29.140 --> 02:54:36.500
[Guest]: know, East Asia was hit by pandemics, you know, serious enough, but which didn't kill, kill them.

02:54:36.500 --> 02:54:42.420
[Guest]: So they had this social immunity. Western Europe never saw a pandemic, so it was very strong. So

02:54:42.420 --> 02:54:50.020
[Guest]: in that sense, we've never had a history of, you know, financial crises, which have exacted a huge

02:54:50.020 --> 02:54:56.340
[Guest]: toll. It is exacting a huge toll, but it's gradual, and it's unprecedented. So I think that's part of

02:54:56.340 --> 02:55:00.820
[Guest]: the reason why, you know, the whole policymaking, you know, Josh and I have struggled with this,

02:55:00.820 --> 02:55:05.940
[Guest]: that, you know, you know, say, he kept saying, boss, it's a diagnosis problem. It's not a, you

02:55:05.940 --> 02:55:11.460
[Guest]: know, and that diagnosis is, you know, elusive, it doesn't really, you know, resonate with people,

02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:15.380
[Guest]: you know, never had it before. What is, you know, financial crisis? I know, we'll recapitalize the

02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:21.540
[Guest]: banks or, you know, credit, you know, we'll get a bit more growth. So this is like, you know,

02:55:21.540 --> 02:55:27.780
[Guest]: a slow bleed and unprecedented, with no kind of social inoculation. And that's kind of explains

02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:34.660
[Guest]: part of the reason why I think. So it's a kind of a little bit more conceptual kind of stepping

02:55:34.660 --> 02:55:40.020
[Guest]: back answer to yes, we have a massive problem in the financial system. Post COVID, of course,

02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:49.860
[Guest]: it's, it's gotten much, much worse. And we have this deeper things. And then, of course, you have

02:55:49.860 --> 02:56:00.100
[Guest]: that extra layer that, you know, if in a system, you know, the transparency of the reality is kind

02:56:00.100 --> 02:56:05.300
[Guest]: of obscured and hidden and things again, and again, and again, that is another thing that adds

02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:11.300
[Guest]: to sort of broader problem of, you know, kind of data transparency that, you know, I've written

02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:17.380
[Guest]: about in the context of the GDP and things that I think is kind of like a much deeper system. I

02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:22.180
[Guest]: don't know what, you know, Vijay Kelkar and Ajay Shah say about this in their book. But this is

02:56:22.180 --> 02:56:28.020
[Guest]: kind of very kind of deep, I think, and you know, unless we can crack that as well. And by the way,

02:56:28.020 --> 02:56:32.500
[Guest]: it's true for the GDP, it's true for the financial system, it's true for the fiscal numbers, it's

02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:36.500
[Guest]: true for the unemployment numbers, it's true for the consumption numbers, you know, we've got the

02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:42.500
[Guest]: situation where kind of kind of basic, you know, kind of the basic ingredients for integrity and

02:56:42.500 --> 02:56:49.860
[Guest]: accountability, I know, are kind of eluding us in that sense. And that is kind of very worrying as

02:56:49.860 --> 02:56:54.500
[Guest]: well. And that pertains, of course, also. So in a sense, I've answered, I've tried to answer your

02:56:54.500 --> 02:56:59.860
[Guest]: questions at three levels, right? Yes, twin has become four. But the deeper reason why we haven't

02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:06.260
[Guest]: responded, maybe even a meta reason for that is that the basic, you know, transparency, the

02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:11.060
[Guest]: ingredients for transparency, no, but I mean, it could be both supply and it could be all of

02:57:11.060 --> 02:57:16.900
[Guest]: course, these are things that, you know, we don't have that, you know, you get the data that you

02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:22.180
[Guest]: want to in some ways. So I think there's some of that as well. But, you know, that's kind of my

02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:24.980
[Guest]: view on on this, these kind of bigger issues as well.

02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:30.260
[Amit Varma]: That's very enlightening. This episode suddenly became much darker, and it's going to get even

02:57:30.260 --> 02:57:34.260
[Amit Varma]: darker with my last question. So we'll end it there. Because if I go beyond that, we'll be in

02:57:34.260 --> 02:57:39.620
[Amit Varma]: zombie apocalypse territory. But my last question is, is that we are now, you know, in the middle

02:57:39.620 --> 02:57:42.820
[Amit Varma]: of this COVID pandemic. And I don't even know if I should say middle, because we don't know how

02:57:42.820 --> 02:57:47.700
[Amit Varma]: long this is going to go on. I hope this is not just kind of the beginning. And obviously, this

02:57:47.700 --> 02:57:53.780
[Amit Varma]: is like, to everything that was going wrong, this is a force multiplier, it's just a disaster is

02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:58.980
[Amit Varma]: probably set us back many years. So sort of looking into the future, let me say that we are in

02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:04.500
[Amit Varma]: 2020. If you look at 2030, you know, what's your best case scenario? And what's your worst case

02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:10.180
[Amit Varma]: scenario for India, keeping all this in mind, and maybe I should, it's unfair of me to make COVID

02:58:10.180 --> 02:58:15.220
[Amit Varma]: part of the question, because it'll, you know, get into the territory of what the philosopher,

02:58:15.220 --> 02:58:20.500
[Amit Varma]: you like to quote Donald Rumsfeld calls unknown unknowns. So just sort of leaving COVID out of

02:58:20.500 --> 02:58:26.340
[Amit Varma]: leaving COVID out of it, and assuming that it, you know, a vaccine comes along soon, and it doesn't

02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:32.180
[Amit Varma]: get too much worse. Assuming that, if you look ahead to 2030, what would you say is our best

02:58:32.180 --> 02:58:36.180
[Amit Varma]: case scenario and our worst case scenario? What gives you hope? And what gives you despair,

02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:43.940
[Guest]: rather to, you know, to frame it differently? See, when I look back on, you know, the last

02:58:43.940 --> 02:58:49.460
[Guest]: two decades, it's kind of a little bit slightly a longer view on the future by, you know, you look

02:58:49.460 --> 02:58:56.740
[Guest]: at the past. You know, the truth is that, you know, we've had one decade of, you know,

02:58:57.940 --> 02:59:03.060
[Guest]: weak performance, you know, basically, since about 2011, I think we've had weak performance,

02:59:03.060 --> 02:59:08.820
[Guest]: and maybe that's what is the message of, you know, Pooja Mehra's book on the last decade,

02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:14.660
[Guest]: right. And certainly my own, you know, looking at the numbers and what happened, you know,

02:59:14.660 --> 02:59:22.660
[Guest]: it seems like kind of the, so it's been longer, the underperformance and weakening has been much

02:59:22.660 --> 02:59:31.860
[Guest]: longer than this. Maybe to add to that little bit pessimism is that, I mean, you could also

02:59:31.860 --> 02:59:41.380
[Guest]: make the case that while the weakening has been a decade old, you know, new active positive reforms

02:59:41.380 --> 02:59:46.180
[Guest]: are basically stopped in the early 2000s. You know, that's one view. That's also, I think,

02:59:47.060 --> 02:59:51.620
[Guest]: the view of some people, even Raghu, I think, has that view. I would kind of dispute that,

02:59:51.620 --> 02:59:54.980
[Guest]: I think, at least conceptually, you know, the GST was a major reform, and of course,

02:59:54.980 --> 02:59:59.860
[Guest]: it went through. I think the public provision of private goods is something, I think the

02:59:59.860 --> 03:00:06.740
[Guest]: bankruptcy did conceptually allow us to address this problem of, you know, decades, decades old

03:00:06.740 --> 03:00:13.780
[Guest]: problem of capitalism without exit. But given that they're also faltering, you could say we

03:00:13.780 --> 03:00:21.940
[Guest]: have had one decade of, you know, underperformance, and two decades of, you know, not enough policy

03:00:21.940 --> 03:00:29.780
[Guest]: reforms. And, you know, and even state capacity has not really been strengthened. So the bad case

03:00:29.780 --> 03:00:34.820
[Guest]: scenario is that, you know, this is not, you know, a three or four year old problem is actually a

03:00:34.820 --> 03:00:40.820
[Guest]: decade old problem. And therefore, you know, this kind of continues going forward. And of course,

03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:46.340
[Guest]: now the starting point is much worse, because COVID has really kind of shot all balance sheets.

03:00:46.340 --> 03:00:51.620
[Guest]: And, you know, the world looks completely different post COVID. Now, how do you kind of,

03:00:52.900 --> 03:01:01.300
[Guest]: you know, try and, you know, extract some glimmer of hope from this? I guess the glimmer of hope,

03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:05.860
[Guest]: you know, actually, potentially, what could be the glimmer of hope, I'm not saying that's what

03:01:05.860 --> 03:01:13.860
[Guest]: will happen. You know, this thing has to be rescued from by politics, you know, in India,

03:01:13.860 --> 03:01:22.900
[Guest]: this is democratic politics, that if you believe that, you know, if you believe that actually,

03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:27.940
[Guest]: our politics is getting again, once again, decoupled from economic performance, which is

03:01:27.940 --> 03:01:34.180
[Guest]: what some of the indicators are saying, that's going to add to the sense of thing. But I think

03:01:34.180 --> 03:01:39.940
[Guest]: the way to extract something is to say, look, even for this government, it's kind of much more

03:01:39.940 --> 03:01:46.180
[Guest]: confident, right, it has more political capital. And, you know, it also has built up some

03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:50.820
[Guest]: credentials on this, you know, legitimacy, this provision of public goods, you know, whatever,

03:01:50.820 --> 03:01:56.660
[Guest]: you know, that there is a sense in which the new welfarism has worked, I think that agenda

03:01:56.660 --> 03:02:02.740
[Guest]: needs to be completed for all of this, you know, the jam, infrastructure, etc, or UBI, whatever,

03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:09.620
[Guest]: that thing has to be completed. But in principle, you have the, you know, the political capital

03:02:10.340 --> 03:02:15.540
[Guest]: to actually do the things that, you know, need to be done, whether it's IBC, or, you know,

03:02:15.540 --> 03:02:23.460
[Guest]: reforms or growth or whatever, or all these things. So I think so that would be one kind of,

03:02:23.460 --> 03:02:28.740
[Guest]: you know, possibility that, you know, the conditions are there, but the mindset and the,

03:02:28.740 --> 03:02:33.300
[Guest]: you know, the diagnosis has to be right, and then you move forward. The other, of course,

03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:39.060
[Guest]: I think the always the perennial glimmer of hope about India is that, you know, it's not one

03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:44.740
[Guest]: country, it's a, you know, there are, it's a country of, you know, 27 quasi sovereigns,

03:02:44.740 --> 03:02:50.580
[Guest]: or whatever. And then you think that, you know, some of the positive change, even if it doesn't

03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:56.180
[Guest]: happen at the centre, will actually, there will be pockets where, you know, good things will be

03:02:56.180 --> 03:03:01.380
[Guest]: done, you know, maybe, maybe people will see what ARP has done on health and education. And, you

03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:07.460
[Guest]: know, you know, the kind of competitive federalism by way of ideas, kind of spreads in that way as

03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:12.420
[Guest]: well. So the potentially good news is that, you know, we have different governments in different

03:03:12.420 --> 03:03:17.140
[Guest]: parts of the country, which we now, and, you know, and they embark on a post COVID, you know,

03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:21.620
[Guest]: there are, I mean, all of them are in bad trouble. But post COVID, they say, look, you know, for

03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:26.980
[Guest]: example, public health, all of us need to be more like Kerala, you know, we learned lessons for that

03:03:26.980 --> 03:03:33.220
[Guest]: education, we can take lessons from this. So I think, attracting investment, whatever, you know,

03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:39.620
[Guest]: so I think federalism, competitive federalism in India, always is, is hope. See, in the old days,

03:03:39.620 --> 03:03:44.180
[Guest]: you know, we used to say about India, it has the wheels of a bullock cart and the brakes of a

03:03:44.180 --> 03:03:49.300
[Guest]: brakes of a Rolls Royce, as a kind of, you know, system that always only did incremental things.

03:03:49.300 --> 03:03:54.740
[Guest]: But I think that, you know, there's no reason why you could also not have new ideas coming from

03:03:54.740 --> 03:04:03.220
[Guest]: different parts of the country. And that kind of drives and motors change, at least in parts,

03:04:03.220 --> 03:04:09.140
[Guest]: which then spreads elsewhere. So, you know, so that would be my, you know, trying to,

03:04:09.140 --> 03:04:15.380
[Guest]: you know, pick up some glimmer of hope, in what are obviously very, very challenging times.

03:04:17.140 --> 03:04:22.180
[Guest]: But it's not just, I mean, I think for me, the real kind of looking back, in fact,

03:04:22.180 --> 03:04:27.540
[Guest]: post my CA ship, you know, you look back and say, it's been, you know, one decade of weak

03:04:27.540 --> 03:04:33.220
[Guest]: performance, and then another decade, maybe of inadequate reforms. And, and, you know, maybe

03:04:33.220 --> 03:04:38.340
[Guest]: we need to think about it in those, you know, terms, even when thinking about what needs to be

03:04:38.340 --> 03:04:40.580
[Guest]: done, and whether things can happen going forward.

03:04:41.220 --> 03:04:46.020
[Amit Varma]: And maybe one day, we'll have the wheels of a Rolls Royce at the brakes of a bullock cart and

03:04:46.020 --> 03:04:50.740
[Amit Varma]: fall right into the river. I've been so enlightened and inspired to have this conversation. Thank you

03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:52.820
[Amit Varma]: so much, Erwin, for your time and your insights.

03:04:53.380 --> 03:04:57.780
[Guest]: Amit, it's been great to be on the show, wonderful questions. And you know, it's a hallmark of,

03:04:57.780 --> 03:05:04.180
[Guest]: you know, a conversation, you know, in terms of how much, you know, I've had to think and how many

03:05:04.180 --> 03:05:08.500
[Guest]: new thoughts have been provoked by your questions. So, thank you very much.

03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:34.500
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

03:05:38.500 --> 03:05:48.500
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

03:06:08.500 --> 03:06:14.500
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.
