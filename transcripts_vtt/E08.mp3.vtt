00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.560
[Amit Varma]: A few nights ago I had a bad dream. I was lying in an operation theatre undergoing surgery.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.200
[Amit Varma]: I was having a toenail removed. I was fully conscious and for some reason the doctor had

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.760
[Amit Varma]: cut open my torso and was bent over it in deep concentration. After some time he pulled

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.240
[Amit Varma]: out my kidney and held it up proudly. Here's your toenail, he said. I managed to find it.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.140
[Amit Varma]: That's not my toenail, I shouted at him. It's my bloody kidney. I mean it's literally my

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.800
[Amit Varma]: bloody kidney. What have you done? Have you studied medicine? He looked at me and gave

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.760
[Amit Varma]: me a wild smile. Actually, he said, I don't exist. I'm just a creature in your dream.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.100
[Amit Varma]: But doctors like me could be reality if not for the Medical Council of India. Everyone

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.280
[Amit Varma]: in India should be glad they exist. Because if they did not, I would. And then he gave

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.160
[Amit Varma]: an evil laugh as in front of my eyes, my kidney turned into a toenail.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.560
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.640
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.500
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, my weekly podcast where I examine the intended effects

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.720
[Amit Varma]: and the unintended effects of public policy. Today, I'm going to talk about the Medical

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.400
[Amit Varma]: Council of India, which is a statutory body that oversees medical education in India.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.480
[Amit Varma]: What do they do? To quote from Wikipedia, the council grants recognition of medical

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.520
[Amit Varma]: qualifications, gives accreditation to medical schools, grants registration to medical practitioners

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.140
[Amit Varma]: and monitors medical practice in India. What is the scene effect of this?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.520
[Amit Varma]: The scene effect of the Medical Council of India is that it sets high standards for medical

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.200
[Amit Varma]: education in India. That sounds like a healthy effect. But what are the unseen effects of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.120
[Amit Varma]: such regulation? To discuss that, I've brought Pawan Srinath onto the show. Pawan is a fellow

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.240
[Amit Varma]: at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.240
[Amit Varma]: Pawan, so it sounds intuitive to me that the Medical Council of India should, after all,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.880
[Amit Varma]: regulate medical education because they are doctors. They're in the best place to make

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.920
[Amit Varma]: those decisions. What do you feel about it?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.320
[Guest]: So yes, on the offset, it feels like it's better that you have qualified doctors rather

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.080
[Guest]: than appointed bureaucrats manage medical education. The problem is one of professional

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.560
[Guest]: competition. We all know that we have a limited number of doctors in the country and basically

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.840
[Guest]: medical education allows for new doctors to come in, you know, younger folk who are probably

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.080
[Guest]: better trained, who probably have a bit more modern outlook. They have the latest research

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.600
[Guest]: and these guys will start providing competition for the incumbents.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.880
[Guest]: So if you are regulating competition to yourself, will you be honest? Not really. And remember

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.120
[Guest]: that the Medical Council of India is not just a board of some sort, but it's sort of an

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.040
[Guest]: elected body. It has membership. So presidents get elected. So there is a politics inside

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.480
[Guest]: the Medical Council of India, which wants a lack of competition.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.080
[Amit Varma]: They have their own incentives.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.320
[Guest]: Yeah. So the incentives get perverse. So I do think that the Medical Council of India

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.920
[Guest]: should have a role in intervening in medical education, but that should be to set standards,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.640
[Guest]: to do stuff like that, rather than be a gatekeeper for how many new colleges can be opened and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.520
[Amit Varma]: how many new people can come in.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.920
[Guest]: So what are the unseen effects of this regulation?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.520
[Guest]: So the first unseen effect, which is seen in a certain way, is scarcity. So let me give

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.280
[Guest]: you a few numbers. There's a rough estimate that we have about 600 to 700,000 doctors

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.120
[Guest]: in the country who are practicing right now, who are qualified and trained and have a proper

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.920
[Guest]: degree. And to this, we are now adding about 45,000 odd doctors every year who are graduating.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.920
[Guest]: And of this, the postgraduate numbers and the super specialization numbers are way smaller.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.080
[Guest]: We're talking 5,000 to 10,000 from within the country, a few more from outside. So that's

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.960
[Guest]: very tiny a number. That's half a doctor for 1,000 people in the population. WHO says,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.880
[Guest]: you know, by and large, you're better off if you have about two and a half, three doctors.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.040
[Guest]: And the thing is, this scarcity is misattributed. We say that, oh, this is because we are a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.480
[Guest]: poor country. That's the standard. So many things are wrong because we are a poor country.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.880
[Guest]: But no, even as a poor country, we are producing far more engineers. And I would argue, increasingly

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.040
[Guest]: better quality engineers over the last two decades. Right. So the situation that it was

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.400
[Guest]: in, say, 1990 to now is fundamentally different. Whereas in medical education, maybe in 1990

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.520
[Guest]: or 2000, you would have, say, 25,000 doctors or 20,000 doctors coming out. Now it's 45.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.520
[Guest]: Right. So the scarcity is acute. And again, various folk devils get created where, who

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.440
[Guest]: are to blame for this shortage, right? Oh, doctors don't care for the country. They go

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.760
[Guest]: abroad and they pursue sort of personal interest, but don't do anything for the nation. So all

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.360
[Guest]: these sort of tropes come about from this idea of scarcity. That's the first unseen

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.240
[Guest]: effect. The second one is the immense cost of medical education, which we seem to have

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.880
[Guest]: taken for granted. Right. There are two parts to this. One is we know that private medical

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.880
[Guest]: education is extremely expensive. And we just think that, yeah, this, because they have

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.960
[Guest]: to do so much lab work, so much clinical work, it just costs so much. But that's simply not

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.200
[Guest]: true. It's because the moment you restrict supply and demand is immense, prices go through

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.600
[Guest]: the roof, either legally or illegally. Right. And then the knock on effect of that is you

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.240
[Guest]: say, oh, therefore, you need state subsidization of medical education. Right. So state should,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.840
[Guest]: so you need an AIMS in every state and, you know, just like we had, we wanted an IIT in

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.520
[Guest]: every state. So you have the old trope sort of continuing. Right. And then what happens

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.200
[Guest]: is there is perverse incentives for doctors who enter the system as well. There is a desperate

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.040
[Guest]: need to super specialize so that you can sort of recover all this investment you've put

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.800
[Guest]: in. Right. So remember, it's not just cost. Right. So probably doctors who go to private

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.200
[Guest]: medical colleges between their MEBS and their post graduation spend maybe 50 lakhs, a crore,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.880
[Guest]: and not just that, but what, eight years of their time, 10 years of their time studying

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.480
[Guest]: for all those exams and so on. So now you're 30 or 28, and now's the chance for you to

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.920
[Guest]: start earning and you have to recover this. Right. And you want to. And then we say that

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.520
[Guest]: medical costs are through the roof. Right. So that's the knock on effect that happens.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.720
[Guest]: Even beyond that, what happens is because this, the gate is so restricted, even the

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.260
[Guest]: private players who get in, with a few salient exceptions, are slightly dodgy players. Right.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.680
[Guest]: So the people who know how to get in, because they know the right people, they know how

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.480
[Guest]: to make the right connections and so on. Right. So do they not have an incentive to deliver

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.600
[Guest]: quality education, but you have adverse selection where the best possible players in the market

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.440
[Guest]: sort of leave. And I don't even want to go into the lack of FDI and education, the lack

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.240
[Guest]: of foreign competition, all of that. Right. We still don't have that in other branches

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.320
[Guest]: of higher education, but I would argue that the sectors are doing much better than how

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.920
[Guest]: medical education is doing. So what you have is bad private players coming in and then

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.400
[Guest]: private players in general getting a bad name, the old idea of, you know, private enterprise

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.000
[Guest]: being evil in India. So the trope sort of continues. So it's a larger sort of, I would

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.680
[Guest]: argue, a moral decay in society and sort of a misalignment of what is good and what is

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.020
[Guest]: bad. Right. Which, which seems far fetched when I sort of draw this, it's like a third

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.720
[Guest]: order effect, but I think it's really important.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.720
[Amit Varma]: And would I be correct in saying that a knock-on effect of the scarcity, which you alluded

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.600
[Amit Varma]: to as a first effect, also then has an impact on healthcare costs, because there are less

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.120
[Amit Varma]: doctors, healthcare costs are way higher for the consumers, for the patients. And then

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.640
[Amit Varma]: this is blamed on private greed and so on. Exactly. Right. Or either private greed or

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.600
[Amit Varma]: graft. Right. Those are the two. So the government essentially doesn't allow a free market to

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.280
[Amit Varma]: operate. And the effect of restricting the supply is that prices go through the roof,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.920
[Amit Varma]: there is scarcity, healthcare prices also go through the roof, and all of it is used

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.080
[Amit Varma]: by the government to say that, hey, look, the private free markets aren't working when

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.080
[Guest]: there weren't free markets.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.420
[Guest]: And therefore, we need a National Health Service, we need nationalizing this. So, and the other

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.840
[Guest]: problem that happens is, again, more folk devils are, oh, look at the United States,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.480
[Guest]: look how messed up their system is. That's like talking about obesity to a malnourished

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.040
[Guest]: person. It doesn't make sense. I mean, this person's not getting enough food. We don't

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.920
[Guest]: have enough doctors. So they have sort of a postmortem problem, right? Or a first world

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.280
[Guest]: problem. Our problems are entirely different. So healthcare costs go through the roof. And

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.920
[Guest]: then what happens is quacks, charlatans, alternative medicine and pill peddlers step in to fill

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.520
[Guest]: the vacuum because people desperately need solutions for their medical problems. And

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.360
[Guest]: people are seeing that elsewhere in the world, sort of different diseases are getting tackled.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.640
[Guest]: And one of the things is no matter what income level you're in, if there's a cure, you will

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.880
[Guest]: do whatever it takes to get your family member the cure, right? So, this is there at all

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.800
[Guest]: levels, right? At one, you would have seen if you ever go to a medical store, you'll

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.800
[Guest]: have people who come up and say, hey, I have a fever, what should I take? And the medical

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.680
[Guest]: store clerk is dispensing medical advice. While we are loftily saying we want high standards

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.960
[Guest]: for doctors, we're having a medical store clerk giving medical advice, right? That's

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.720
[Guest]: patently ridiculous. I mean, at the other end, you have people who say, doctor, and

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.880
[Guest]: then start practicing and, you know, start giving pills, start giving injections. The

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.200
[Guest]: placebo effect is a real thing. So, you feel like this doctor has given you a dramatic

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200
[Amit Varma]: intervention.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.200
[Amit Varma]: Plus, we have a ministry of Ayush with homeopathy.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:07.560
[Guest]: Let's not even go there. But so, you have quacks of all types who get in. And yeah,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.440
[Guest]: you have Ayurveda, you have, I don't have a problem with Ayurveda, per se, but it desperately

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.760
[Guest]: needs to be modernized. And you have actual sort of quackery, which is homeopathy, Reiki,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.640
[Guest]: and all kinds of things that sort of fill up this vacuum that is there. And I'll give

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.640
[Guest]: you one example of how weird this becomes. In 2014, there was this announcement that

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.760
[Guest]: homeopathy and Ayurvedic practitioners can now start performing abortions. And this was

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:41.600
[Guest]: done in the name of promoting sort of, you know, women's rights, you know, safety, and

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.800
[Guest]: so on. Why? Because you don't have enough OBGYNs and doctors who can perform abortions.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.680
[Guest]: And it's ridiculous. I mean, homeopathy, by the way, does not believe in surgery either.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.280
[Guest]: So there are multiple levels of cognitive dissonance that is happening over here. But

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:02.000
[Guest]: those are the kinds of weird solutions that people come up with. And I would say the final

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.720
[Guest]: thing, the biggest sort of unseen effect that happens is, frankly, a curb on personal freedom.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.000
[Guest]: Right? We are saying, oh, you got a medical degree, now go spend a year and a half in

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.280
[Guest]: a rural area. Or you do this, only if you clear conditions A, B and C, will I allow

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.480
[Guest]: you to go abroad to practice medicine abroad.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Are there conditions like this?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.680
[Guest]: They're trying desperately to put it in. The good news is state capacity is a little limited.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.960
[Guest]: So they can't enforce some of the more draconian things. And as we have seen with any draconian

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:41.120
[Guest]: rules, people find work around it. So what you see is just skewed decisions, people doing

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.120
[Guest]: weird things to get around weird rules. And in general, you have a lack of freedom. I

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.240
[Guest]: mean, so the reality is, if we didn't restrict supply, if instead of 45,000 doctors a year,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.720
[Guest]: we had 200,000, 500,000 doctors.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Or whatever the market can take.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:03.120
[Guest]: And the reality is, India has been providing labor to the world. So it's not doctors in

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.440
[Guest]: the US versus doctors in rural India. If we start supplying enough doctors, trained doctors,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.800
[Guest]: and India can do it more cheaply compared to most other countries, we can supply doctors

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.240
[Guest]: everywhere. And we can solve, we can bring down medical costs in the United States if

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.640
[Guest]: we get our medical education policy right.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.920
[Amit Varma]: We can send homeopaths to Pakistan to perform abortions, sir.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.360
[Guest]: Yes, that's probably we can do now.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.120
[Amit Varma]: So what in a utopian world where there's no opposition at all in the political economy

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.760
[Amit Varma]: is bowing down to you, what would be your policy recommendation? What would you do?

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:46.320
[Guest]: Okay, so for what it's worth, this is a hard problem, right? Healthcare does not lend itself

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.240
[Guest]: to a complete free market very easily. Because contestability is a big issue. And without

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.640
[Guest]: contestability markets, you know, struggle to work.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.360
[Guest]: Can you explain contestability?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:04.840
[Guest]: So you go in saying that you have a cough and mild fever. One doctor says, oh, you have

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.640
[Guest]: nothing, you just take good bed rest, stay at home for a day. Another doctor says, no,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.480
[Guest]: no, no, you need to go for these three tests, that this person, this diagnostic center who

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.840
[Guest]: will give me money, you have to go get those tests done. And I'll do all these expensive

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:24.000
[Guest]: things, right? And you as a patient, have no idea which doctor is better. So you need

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.940
[Guest]: some form of mechanisms to sort of intervene over here.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.840
[Amit Varma]: What kind of mechanisms exist in more advanced markets where the market is allowed to operate?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.920
[Guest]: So the first thing is, you do need a body of doctors to sort of prescribe standards

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.480
[Guest]: for medical education, right? What should people know before they get into medical school?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.520
[Guest]: What should they know after they get into medical school? What kind of exams should

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.920
[Guest]: they go through? And this needs to be continuously updated, right? Because science is rapidly

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920
[Guest]: improving.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:01.040
[Guest]: But you probably need something. So I'll tell you what India is trying to do. There is a

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.720
[Guest]: bill that's been put out by the Niti Aayog, a draft about how the Medical Council has

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.160
[Guest]: to go. And this has happened because of some really giant scams in the last few years,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.360
[Guest]: which were inevitable when all the conditions were set in. So what they say is they want

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.080
[Guest]: to get it back to the government. So the current solution, which I still think if they do it

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.440
[Guest]: even half right is better than what it is right now, is create independent boards. These

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.560
[Guest]: are not elected doctors, but they'll have, you know, doctor appointees, you will have

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.920
[Guest]: sort of bureaucrat appointees. And the idea is also to separate functions, right? So you

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.240
[Guest]: want to have a Medical Council overall, but then you want to have a separate accreditation

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.560
[Guest]: board, right?

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:49.080
[Guest]: So these guys will just take care of, you know, approving licenses for medical colleges.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.880
[Guest]: But even over there, I'll tell you, the way government policy happens is so silly. They

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.520
[Guest]: want to say, oh, there should be adequate financial resources of any medical school

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:05.960
[Guest]: that comes in. Why is that a criteria? So I think they should only see if equipment

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.320
[Guest]: facilities, doctors and teachers are well trained, and maybe you should do random inspections

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:17.080
[Guest]: a few things, but they should not have power to impose penalties themselves. They can only

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.960
[Guest]: report, right? So the idea is to separate functions in a big way, and probably provide

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.880
[Guest]: regulatory competition. So the current idea that's been envisaged in this new draft is

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.400
[Guest]: you have this accreditation board, and there are state level boards, and they delegate

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.840
[Guest]: a bunch of the powers to the state level. So this is automatically better because different

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.640
[Guest]: states can experiment with different ideas. And then over time, the ideas, the best ideas

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.240
[Guest]: sort of bubble up, right? So competition always, even at the regulatory level can provide interesting

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.120
[Guest]: outcomes. But even here, you have a local monopoly, right? There's only that state board

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:57.320
[Guest]: in that state. So instead, supposing we had, you know, the Medical Board of India A and

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.080
[Guest]: the Medical Board of India B, and both of them had jurisdiction across the country,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.680
[Guest]: and you were a qualified doctor, and you were a qualified medical college, if you got approved

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:12.360
[Guest]: by either of them, then they don't have as much of an incentive to seek rent, because

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:18.200
[Guest]: automatically colleges will go to the player who is seeking less rent, right? So I would

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:26.480
[Guest]: say some form of intelligent regulatory competition, which does not involve elected bodies of doctors,

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.220
[Guest]: you know, is sort of an improvement over the status quo. And I think it's a complex enough

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.640
[Guest]: field that it's, I would hesitate to provide one solution, which I think will work. I think

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.920
[Guest]: we need to do these. I mean, it's, I remember my economics professor telling me it's not

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.320
[Guest]: about good or bad. It's about better or worse, right? So let's get better with this. And

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.480
[Guest]: then let's keep tinkering as to what improves, rather than have one Medical Council of India,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.520
[Guest]: which was set up in 1993, which now may finally meet its end.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Right. And what are the obstacles within the political economy to these reforms taking

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.200
[Guest]: place? The biggest thing is, currently, the private

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:11.000
[Guest]: medical colleges are run by individuals and groups which have a good amount of political

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000
[Guest]: power, and they're able to seek a lot of rent. So any changes in this will affect how much

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.560
[Guest]: rent they are seeking from the economy, right? So there is some immense opposition. The good

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.680
[Guest]: news over there is if the union government intervenes, most of this rent takes place

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.040
[Guest]: at the state level. So arguably, an union level intervention could be blind to some

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.120
[Guest]: of these considerations. But unless they manage this intelligently, they might pass the law

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:43.200
[Guest]: and the states may not implement anything, right? The other thing is the old mentality

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.320
[Guest]: of oh, the state will provide this, right? And there is intellectual support for this,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.160
[Guest]: which is the most troubling, right? If it was only the government saying this and intellectual

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.760
[Guest]: support was against it, the game would be different. But there's intellectual cover

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:02.160
[Guest]: being provided for why the state knows best. That is a mindset, and it's also power, right?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.760
[Guest]: So you have departments with immense power, immense budgetary power. And supposing you

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.520
[Guest]: only have private medical colleges, or you only do financing, right? You don't do sort

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.200
[Guest]: of you don't manage them as line department, then power is immensely reduced for those

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.320
[Guest]: who are sitting in those departments. So they have a strong interest against this, right?

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:29.760
[Guest]: So but these are problems that are not insurmountable. I mean, people wait for the right crisis,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.080
[Guest]: right? A crisis is always an opportunity.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.880
[Amit Varma]: But do we need a crisis for change to happen?

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.200
[Guest]: I hope not. Well, for what it's worth, I'm quite happy that in 2009, there was a government

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.760
[Guest]: committee called the Yashpal committee, which we sort of looked at this and gave fairly

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:50.840
[Guest]: sensible suggestions along the lines that we discussed. In 2011, the previous government

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.120
[Guest]: tried to pass the new bill, it somehow didn't go through. Now the Niti Aayog has a draft

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.320
[Guest]: out. So hopefully, when this demonetization fracas gets over, I have no idea when it will.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.800
[Amit Varma]: If people still have money to go to doctors.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:09.240
[Guest]: Yes. And if people still have money to pay for their kids medical education, hopefully

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.920
[Guest]: we expect something in the next year.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.360
[Amit Varma]: Awesome. It was great talking to you Pawan. Thank you so much.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.360
[Amit Varma]: My pleasure.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.360
[Amit Varma]: It's sad how often good intentions lead to bad outcomes. The state of health care is

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.400
[Amit Varma]: abysmal in India, and the Medical Council of India might actually be a contributor to

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:33.840
[Amit Varma]: its ill health. There is an old proverb here that is quite apt. Physician, heal thyself.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.500
[Amit Varma]: The physician here, of course, is the Indian government, which is about as competent in

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:45.400
[Amit Varma]: governance as 18th century physicians were in treating disease. Back then, bloodletting

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:52.400
[Amit Varma]: was a common remedy for many diseases. Today, we know is usually just harmful, but our governments

00:19:52.400 --> 00:20:06.480
[Amit Varma]: keep bleeding us. On that cheerful note, see you next week.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.520
[Unknown]: Next week on The Scene and the Unseen, Amit Verma will be talking to Parth Shah about

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.860
[Unknown]: profit motive in education. For more, go to sceneunseen.in.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.920
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to The Scene and the Unseen, check out another hit show from

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:27.120
[Amit Varma]: Indusworks Media Networks, Cyrus Says, which is hosted by my old colleague from MTV, Cyrus

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.920
[Amit Varma]: Brocha. You can download it on iTunes or any other podcasting network.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.960
[Unknown]: Hi, this is Amit Doshi, and I wanted to thank each and every one of our listeners. It's

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.200
[Unknown]: been two years since I founded IVM, and it's been an amazing two years. We wanted to learn

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.640
[Unknown]: a little bit more about who is listening to our shows, and so we put together a short

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.240
[Unknown]: survey. The survey is anonymous, and we aren't going to be collecting any personal information.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.040
[Unknown]: I would really appreciate it if you could take a couple of minutes out of your day and

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.640
[Unknown]: go to ivmpodcast.com slash survey and fill it out. Thanks, and please keep listening.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:03.040
[Unknown]: Hey, man, just help me out, man. I need some podcast, man. I haven't had a fix in a week.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:09.040
[Unknown]: I need some. Don't you worry about it. I got podcasts galore for you, man. Just go to ivmpodcast.com.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.640
[Unknown]: You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Thanks, man. I'm going to check

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:33.760
[Unknown]: it out.
