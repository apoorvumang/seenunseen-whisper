00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
[Amit Varma]: There is a story I have told a couple of times on this show, and while it's a true story,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.080
[Amit Varma]: it's not the full story. There is another side to it. Let me tell you that story again.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.720
[Amit Varma]: A few years ago, I was hanging with a friend who worked closely with Narendra Modi in the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.040
[Amit Varma]: auties. She has fallen out with him since, but for a period of time when Modi was the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.520
[Amit Varma]: Chief Minister, she was his friend. And she told me that one day, in his residence, some

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.720
[Amit Varma]: of them were hanging with him, maybe six or seven people, and Modi told them a story.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.100
[Amit Varma]: He said that one day when he was a kid, his mother fell ill. At one point, she felt hot

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.960
[Amit Varma]: and wanted the fan on. The young Narendra went to switch on the fan, and then realized

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.880
[Amit Varma]: that there was no electricity. And he couldn't even do this for his mother. When he reached

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.800
[Amit Varma]: this point of the story, Modi started crying. My friend's point was that this is how he

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.640
[Amit Varma]: understands the world, through experience. He's an experiential Prime Minister, or as

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.360
[Amit Varma]: I wrote in a column later, an aankho dekhi Prime Minister. He has experienced the importance

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.440
[Amit Varma]: of electricity, so when he becomes CM of Gujarat, he makes it his mission to electrify as many

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.440
[Amit Varma]: villages as he can. Similarly, he has walked on roads, and he can see their importance,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.200
[Amit Varma]: and so on. And my friend who told me this story felt, and I agreed, that this approach

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.520
[Amit Varma]: has its limitations. There are some things you can experience and understand, and there

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.240
[Amit Varma]: are others that you can't. They may be outside your experience, or they may be frameworks,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.840
[Amit Varma]: ways of looking at the world, which affect real people and remain unseen. Like spontaneous

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.280
[Amit Varma]: order, for example, or the power of voluntary exchange, or the countless oppressions of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.720
[Amit Varma]: the state that we have normalized. This is why Modi as Prime Minister made huge blunders

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: like demonetization. There was no way he could have understood the working of the economy

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.360
[Amit Varma]: from direct experience. And he had never learned the mental frameworks that would help him

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.560
[Amit Varma]: make sense of this. Now in the column I wrote about this, which I'll link from the show

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.560
[Amit Varma]: notes, I made this an argument for reading. How can we learn those things about the world

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.160
[Amit Varma]: which direct experience may not teach us? We do it through reading. The lives of others,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.080
[Amit Varma]: the thoughts of others, all of human knowledge is available to us. And while one can't blame

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.520
[Amit Varma]: Modi for not being much of a reader, as he didn't have that sort of privileged upbringing,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.400
[Amit Varma]: he should have realized his limitation, remained humble about the extent of his knowledge,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.920
[Amit Varma]: and read more, listened to experts more, instead of pushing them away. Now this story, this

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.880
[Amit Varma]: narrative, while it is the truth, is not the whole truth. There is an opposite problem

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.040
[Amit Varma]: also. That opposite problem is this. You may have all the intellectual knowledge in the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.640
[Amit Varma]: world, theories about public policy, notions of how to make the world better, and you may

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: imprison yourself in an ivory tower because you feel you know it all, and you don't need

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.720
[Amit Varma]: to interact with reality because hey, you get it. This is also a mistake, and it leads

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.840
[Amit Varma]: to a top-down way of thinking. In fact, if you consider Jawaharlal Nehru and Narendra

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Modi, they both came to the fatal conceit of top-down central planning, but they came

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.800
[Amit Varma]: to it from different roads. Nehru's intellectual arrogance, and I had a recent episode on this

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.080
[Amit Varma]: I urge you to listen to with Rupert Dhaman Singh and Adil Hussain, which I linked from

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.680
[Amit Varma]: the show notes, Nehru's intellectual arrogance led him to believe that he had figured out

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.200
[Amit Varma]: deep truths about the economy and society, and he could engineer both from the top-down.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.800
[Amit Varma]: He was wrong, and he failed. Modi thinks that what he has learned from his experience of

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.280
[Amit Varma]: the world is all that needs to be learned, and now he must guide others from the top-down,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.920
[Amit Varma]: like a wise sage. He is also wrong, and he has also failed. And the big lesson in this

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.840
[Amit Varma]: is something that my guest today figured out through years of being both an intellectual

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.640
[Amit Varma]: and a grassroots activist, that a true understanding of the world can only come in a bottom-up

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.160
[Amit Varma]: way. The world is complex, there is always more to it than you think you understand.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:59.080
[Amit Varma]: We cannot stop searching for the truth, and the truth lies out there, not in here.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.400
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is a man I adore, a dear friend, a wise

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.560
[Amit Varma]: guide, a man I call Dadamoni. Barun Mitra is that rare creature who is both a man of

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.160
[Amit Varma]: ideas and a man of action. He was a prolific participant in the marketplace of ideas from

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.240
[Amit Varma]: the 1990s, writing powerful, counter-intuitive and thought-provoking pieces. He also founded

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.420
[Amit Varma]: a classical liberal think-tank, or a libertarian think-tank, called the Liberty Institute.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.160
[Amit Varma]: He was also always a grassroots worker. He threw himself into various farmer's movements,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.000
[Amit Varma]: supporting a mass agitation led by the great Sharad Joshi that led to actual policy change

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.600
[Amit Varma]: around two decades ago. He also participated in a remarkable movement to get property rights

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.360
[Amit Varma]: for tribals, in which modern technology played a part in solving an ancient problem. We'll

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.640
[Amit Varma]: discuss both of these in our conversation, the highlight of which is when he shares how

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.900
[Amit Varma]: in his journey, he realised that for his ideas to mean anything, they have to be informed

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.440
[Amit Varma]: by ground realities. His idol, and someone we discuss here, is Mahatma Gandhi, who made

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.760
[Amit Varma]: our freedom movement into a mass movement, by taking his ideas to the people, by putting

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.320
[Amit Varma]: them first. Barun says, a key moment in his way of thinking about the world, was when

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.660
[Amit Varma]: he realised that the important word in the phrase public policy, is not policy, but public.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.280
[Amit Varma]: You have to go past the abstract and look at the concrete. I have always admired Barun

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.200
[Amit Varma]: for his clarity and depth of engagement, and when I double clicked on those, I realised

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.360
[Amit Varma]: where they came from. His clarity comes from his curiosity. He always tests his ideas and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.120
[Amit Varma]: he's open to challenge. His engagement comes from his genuine empathy. Over the years I've

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.040
[Amit Varma]: learnt a lot from Barun, and I could go on and on talking about this, but why don't you

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.840
[Amit Varma]: listen to this conversation instead, which by the way, we had in November, that's when

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.560
[Amit Varma]: I recorded this. Do listen, but before that, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.120
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.800
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.240
[Amit Varma]: Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.200
[Amit Varma]: workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community interaction.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.520
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.720
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.160
[Amit Varma]: a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs Rs. 10,000 plus GST,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.960
[Amit Varma]: or about $150, and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.440
[Amit Varma]: at indiauncut.com slash clear writing. That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing. Being

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.720
[Amit Varma]: a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.240
[Amit Varma]: idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.520
[Amit Varma]: Barun, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.440
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit. I'm still wondering why am I here, but thanks for having me.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.080
[Amit Varma]: Firstly, you've been here before. Secondly, this is an episode I'm excited about because

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.800
[Amit Varma]: I'll just tell my listeners that when Barun just sat down, he was like, why are you calling

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.000
[Amit Varma]: me? I have no accomplishments. I haven't written books. And it's true, he hasn't written books,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.360
[Amit Varma]: so he should. But my whole point was that one, accomplishments are something which is

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.840
[Amit Varma]: not up to us to judge. Barun, your social work is so immense that, you know, some of

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.760
[Amit Varma]: the value of it is perhaps incalculable. And also, you know, one of my friends once described

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.920
[Amit Varma]: himself as a person who collects interesting people. And I think in a manner of speaking

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.480
[Amit Varma]: through the show, I have conversations which make me think and therefore by extension also

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.760
[Amit Varma]: make listeners hopefully think. And the other thing that I have realized is that when I

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.400
[Amit Varma]: speak with people I already know as friends, like we've known each other for 15-20 years,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.760
[Amit Varma]: like you just mentioned, I find that after the conversation, I realized I hadn't known

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.800
[Amit Varma]: them at all, because we talk about so much else. So that's kind of what we do. Like,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.520
[Amit Varma]: since I have known you, you have basically been father time with your flowing white beard

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.840
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. A 21st century libertarian Marx, as it were. So tell me a little bit

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.960
[Amit Varma]: about sort of your childhood, where were you born? Where did you grow up? What were your

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.560
[Amit Varma]: early years like? Give me a sense of the texture of your life, because the texture of these

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.080
[Amit Varma]: modern times are so different, where we are surrounded by smartphones and sensory influences

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.440
[Amit Varma]: and networks and all of that, but it wasn't like that when you were growing up.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:19.960
[Guest]: Yeah, it wasn't like that. And, you know, I'm kind of split on history or the past,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:29.920
[Guest]: mine or otherwise, because, you know, we seem to invariably draw kind of very destructive

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:38.900
[Guest]: lessons from history. I rarely look back as such, except to figure out how is it going

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:46.800
[Guest]: to shape or influence what I'm going to do next. So I rarely, I mean, I rarely look back

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:55.680
[Guest]: in any particular meaningful sense. But, and I grew up in a, you know, compared to you,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:04.480
[Guest]: I grew up probably 10-20 years before you. I think you've just passed 60 and I'm 47.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.960
[Guest]: I'm probably heading towards 61. Why probably? You might be father time, but you haven't

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:24.080
[Guest]: stopped time. I was born in Calcutta and a very different Calcutta, a city that's still

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:31.280
[Guest]: my home. And that actually also shows every time I go back to Alcatraz, it kind of a benchmark

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:40.680
[Guest]: for me to where we are and where we were. I mean, personally, socially, city, collectively,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:48.120
[Guest]: community wise. Yeah, it's a sea change. And I studied in a Bengali school. So that was

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:56.560
[Guest]: one of my first kind of throwback. My primary education was in a Bengali medium, you know,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:05.680
[Guest]: like a local school, like most of us in those days. And then the Naxalite movement happened

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:15.760
[Guest]: in the late 60s. And my father had been in politics since his youth days. He was a member

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:23.880
[Guest]: of the Congress and a manager of the local, election manager for the local MLA, MP. So

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:30.280
[Guest]: it was a challenging time for him and for us and the schools, etc, were to shut. So

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:38.560
[Guest]: my father shifted me to my uncle, who was then in Madhya Pradesh. And so my first shock

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:47.120
[Guest]: was for all of them and me was, I had no knowledge of English, nor Hindi. You know, English,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.760
[Guest]: I could read alphabets, but nothing more than that. And Hindi, I had no knowledge. And you

00:10:51.760 --> 00:11:01.280
[Guest]: were like 9 or 10. Yeah, probably. And so that was a shock and what kind of amazed me

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:08.080
[Guest]: and what I still remember, I don't remember the name of the class teacher. But I do remember

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:17.880
[Guest]: the length to which she went to have me in the class and yet prepare me in a way for

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.240
[Guest]: which I needed to be prepared because I was far behind the class in virtually every subject.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.200
[Guest]: And that to me was quite an interesting because I was different, yet I was made to feel, you

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:37.640
[Guest]: know, part of the same class. So that was, I mean, looking back was one of my nice pleasant

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:46.500
[Guest]: experience that she took so much trouble and that's how, I mean, English became my second

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:55.440
[Guest]: language as such. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have. But then I came back to Calcutta for

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:02.760
[Guest]: my higher secondary and did my engineering. You know, in my days, from my kind of a family,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:08.240
[Guest]: you either had to be a doctor or an engineer. Yeah, I mean, there was literally no option

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.000
[Guest]: and we just tried our luck that whichever we got and I got engineering. So I went for

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.520
[Guest]: engineering in the REC Suratkal. So that was another first, for instance, for my class

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.880
[Guest]: or my friends, I was probably the first one who was put on a flight and asked to go to

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:36.160
[Guest]: the college on his own and figure out everything of admission, which compared to what's happening

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:43.120
[Guest]: today and I see all around me is, you know, people don't believe. It was fun and the best

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.640
[Guest]: part was that that college five years that I spent my engineering was five years, those

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:58.080
[Guest]: days it was 11 plus 5. And I really enjoyed it. One because the experience itself outside

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:04.440
[Guest]: the outside home and alone and in a very cosmopolitan place because regional engineering colleges

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:10.400
[Guest]: were literally mini India. Yeah, I had no idea of South India when I landed there. So

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.160
[Guest]: to get used to everything, the food and people, the language and everything. But most importantly,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.560
[Guest]: what I remember and what I really, you know, what's this my kind of second bright spot

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.160
[Guest]: was that that college was located on the beach, literally.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160
[Unknown]: Wow.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.520
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, there was a tiny village, but it was really tiny fisherman's village. Now

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:37.800
[Guest]: it's quite different because it's developed like most places. But we could virtually,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:46.320
[Guest]: in fact, our kind of preference as we climbed the ladder in the college was to find a room

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.840
[Guest]: from which we could see the sea, you know. So that was an incredible experience to have

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.840
[Amit Varma]: that.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.400
[Amit Varma]: And you didn't get a room where you could see the sea?

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.640
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah. Most of the time. Because you go on the higher floor, second or third or

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.880
[Guest]: fourth floor, you'll see the sea. The sea was just there. So, and the breeze, you could

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:15.160
[Guest]: always smell the sea. So that was really the most memorable college experience because

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.160
[Guest]: I was a mediocre student. I mean, like we all had to finish and we had to look for,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:27.320
[Guest]: you know, all the public sector exams for jobs, etc, etc. Yeah, so that was, but I do

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.640
[Guest]: my, my, I mean, apart from the location, the thing I think I learned, perhaps the only

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:39.120
[Guest]: thing I learned or I still remember and use perhaps is, you know, engineering is about

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.760
[Guest]: solving problems. I try to look at what's the problem, how to break it down, how to

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:52.440
[Guest]: figure out the steps to go around it. And that, to me, I think has been the real education

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:58.920
[Guest]: that I think I'm very pleased or very grateful about, that I didn't know it'll turn out

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:05.400
[Guest]: this way. But that's something I've used perhaps right through, I mean, for the last

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:14.000
[Guest]: 30, 30 plus years, yeah. So that I think has been, so I'm still carrying that sense all

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.800
[Guest]: the time in my mind, that I can perhaps look at things somewhat differently and figure

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.240
[Guest]: out how to go around it and gives me, and that's my only satisfaction, that if I can

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.520
[Guest]: find out something that I had not thought before, that I had not come across before

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:36.280
[Guest]: and get a handle on it. To me, there's nothing more satisfying than that. So it's, yeah,

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.600
[Guest]: it's a completely personal, personal trip. So, which is why, you know, there's no book

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600
[Guest]: to showcase.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.720
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, as you were speaking of your school in Madhya Pradesh, the thought struck

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.480
[Amit Varma]: me that in a sense, and I'll explain what I mean by that, in a sense, we're all born

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.040
[Amit Varma]: blind in the sense that we don't really have a way of seeing the world when we are

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.040
[Amit Varma]: kids. And when we begin to see the world, we are blind to a lot of things because we

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.880
[Amit Varma]: haven't kind of experienced them. Like it strikes me that you're not knowing English

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.200
[Amit Varma]: or Hindi, and the teachers spending that time with you, being compassionate, reaching out

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:15.200
[Amit Varma]: to you, empathizing, understanding, you know, for, she must have had that extra layer of

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.960
[Amit Varma]: empathy for someone who is not one of her kids in the sense, not from there. And equally

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:27.680
[Amit Varma]: for you, at some level, it must have also made you more aware in your later life, wherever

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.920
[Amit Varma]: that there are people around you who may not see things the same way, who may be unfortunate

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.400
[Amit Varma]: in different ways, and they don't need to be condemned or cast aside, but helped and

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.720
[Amit Varma]: all that. And, you know, one of your qualities as our mutual friend, Mohit and I were discussing

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.760
[Amit Varma]: last night is your incredible compassion for people you don't even know. And for all the

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.680
[Amit Varma]: other kids, it might not have been like that. They may have completely ignored you and not

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.260
[Amit Varma]: given a shit because they haven't had that experience. Like I look at myself growing

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:59.880
[Amit Varma]: up also in a cocoon of privilege, and I was blind to a lot of things and you grow older

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.720
[Amit Varma]: and experience a world and more and more layers kind of fall off. And I'm just thinking aloud

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.880
[Amit Varma]: here. But how much do you think there is something to that in the sense that people can be innately

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:18.520
[Amit Varma]: compassionate and empathetic, I mean, to lesser or greater extents, or experiences can play

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:24.920
[Amit Varma]: a big part in them seeing the world a little differently or making an effort to see the

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:31.640
[Amit Varma]: world a little differently in this way. And the reason I ask this is that too often, through

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.200
[Amit Varma]: our lives, as thinkers, as people wrestling with ideologies or ways of looking at the

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.680
[Amit Varma]: world, too often, I think me and many other people I know, have made the mistake of thinking

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.480
[Amit Varma]: at of everything at an intellectual level. And one of the things that I am still learning

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:53.120
[Amit Varma]: from you is that don't think about ideas, think about people, everything is really about

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.800
[Amit Varma]: people and reaching out and connecting, which you are so good at doing. So bit of a ramble,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.720
[Amit Varma]: but what are your sort of thoughts on this?

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:09.400
[Guest]: It's interesting you put it that way. I probably wouldn't or probably that wasn't my kind

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.760
[Guest]: of direct experience. Well, you know, I am grateful to everything that has happened in

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:27.720
[Guest]: the past and most of which I had no control. But I think, you know, for instance, after

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:34.400
[Guest]: my initial first 20 years, since I thought, and that was one of my reasons to explore

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.560
[Guest]: public policy, was that I'd look into things that I am interested in, that I had not done

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:47.680
[Guest]: before. And to me, that was my biggest kind of stimulus that you can venture into any

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.320
[Guest]: issue because as a citizen, as a member of the public, you must have a handle to it.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:19:02.200
[Guest]: And which I realized very late, although I experienced it for since about 2000 on. But

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:11.440
[Guest]: I realized it only in the last five years, perhaps, that we forget the public part of

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.440
[Guest]: the policy.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.480
[Guest]: Public policy, when you're saying before the policy, consider the public.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.200
[Guest]: We forget the prefix, you know, it's always there. It's always, you know, the phrase is

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.400
[Guest]: public policy, but we forget the public and we focus on the policy and we think, you know,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:34.440
[Guest]: we are doing the best job we can, we are preparing the most rational, most contextual policy

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.280
[Guest]: we can think of, and the public will just lap it, accept it, because after all, what's

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.800
[Guest]: the public?

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:48.000
[Guest]: I think that has been one of, I mean, as of now, I'm sure it may change as I go along.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:57.520
[Guest]: As of now, that has been kind of my realization, which was a conscious realization because,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:03.640
[Guest]: I mean, whatever is innate or whatever was seen normal, I wouldn't be aware of it as

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.200
[Guest]: such.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.280
[Guest]: But last five, six years, I've become really aware that where we went wrong.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.600
[Guest]: And I think, and I mean, not just me, but I think what you just said a little earlier,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:29.840
[Guest]: that the intellectual discourse has a tendency to create a sense of knowledge and an imperceptible

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:39.560
[Guest]: sense of arrogance, which I have tried, at least consciously, tried to break down and

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.320
[Guest]: challenge myself, at least in the last five, six years.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.120
[Guest]: Every time I kind of felt that, you know, I think I know.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:55.120
[Guest]: So the moment I feel that I think I know something, I try to push to see, is there all to it or

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.080
[Guest]: is there a way to look beyond?

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:05.680
[Guest]: And I think that is, I think has been a real realization that why we made the mistake and

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.680
[Guest]: which is what I've been very provocative, even before that, when I was kind of grappling

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:16.920
[Guest]: with this, that, you know, among the kind of circles I was in, education and awareness

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:25.160
[Guest]: was a big thing, that we need to make people aware, make people, educate people.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:32.680
[Guest]: And to me, that itself carries in it the seed of arrogance and therefore the blindness to

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:42.200
[Guest]: people because a teacher is supposed to know and communicate that and make the student

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.600
[Guest]: who is kind of innocent or ignorant aware of the so-called issues.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.420
[Guest]: But that I think is only half the story.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:59.680
[Guest]: If the teacher can't relate to the student or if the teacher can't place the issue in

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.760
[Guest]: the context or through the lens through which the student might be seeing it, no amount

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.720
[Guest]: of education and awareness is going to help.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:18.960
[Guest]: So all this came to me much later because I began to kind of ask at many meetings that

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960
[Guest]: what are we teaching?

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.280
[Guest]: To whom are we teaching?

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:29.360
[Guest]: Is it because we know or is it because every opportunity is an occasion for us to know

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.560
[Guest]: a little bit more?

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:41.640
[Guest]: You know, that puts me in a kind of a jeopardy because I tend to always think on my feet.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:49.760
[Guest]: I like that and therefore even when I prepare a text, I deviate because if I prepared it,

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.760
[Guest]: I know it.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:57.640
[Guest]: You know, I need to push no matter what I am trying and that comes with its risk because

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.600
[Guest]: I may not know where I am headed.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:10.320
[Guest]: But to me the satisfaction is that at the end if I make a mistake, I hope I try to recognize

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.360
[Guest]: it so that I can rectify it and take that one more step.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:21.400
[Guest]: And if I think I put the thing in a way that satisfied me, then perhaps I have a base to

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.400
[Guest]: build further.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.960
[Guest]: So I look at it as a win-win, you know, no matter what happens and which to me actually

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:38.240
[Guest]: has kind of helped I believe that currently or last few years, I actually try to go out

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.360
[Guest]: and engage with not just people I didn't know but engage with people or try to reach

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:52.320
[Guest]: out to people with whom I might actually have a disagreement and figure out how do I learn

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:59.680
[Guest]: to communicate, to have a meaningful discussion, dialogue with people with whom both of us

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.160
[Guest]: may know that we disagree on some things and disagreements can be quite fundamental in

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:12.880
[Guest]: terms of ideology or intellectual perspectives but yet have a conversation which is another

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.480
[Guest]: way of saying that that's another way for me to push myself.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:24.120
[Guest]: But how do I and in today's context it becomes even much more relevant because 10-15 years

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.320
[Guest]: ago there was no eco-chamber to speak of as such, you know.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.800
[Guest]: So today's context, I mean to me there can't be anything much more fundamental than figuring

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:42.720
[Guest]: out how do we break out from our own cocoons, own, you know, safe zones and really have

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.760
[Guest]: some exciting things to do, to learn, to push, yeah.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:55.040
[Guest]: So that I think which is probably why I'm interested in people because it always puts

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.800
[Guest]: me in a new situation because everybody is different, you know, everybody is looking

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:05.320
[Guest]: at the world through a different lens than mine even those who may agree with me on very

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.920
[Guest]: many things.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:15.480
[Guest]: So I think that's quite an exciting way of taking the next step, yeah.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.480
[Amit Varma]: So yesterday I recorded an episode with Abhinandan Sekri, the News Laundry founder that'll probably

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.360
[Amit Varma]: come out a few weeks before this one and in that he said something very interesting.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.280
[Amit Varma]: He spoke about how while shooting for a television show he was going through the Northeast and

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.440
[Amit Varma]: in the Northeast when they were in these different villages, they asked the people that, you

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.800
[Amit Varma]: know, if the government is to spend money on you or if you have money to spend, what

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.280
[Amit Varma]: would you spend it on?

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.800
[Amit Varma]: And the answers he said that we were expecting in all our arrogance, we thought they will

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.640
[Amit Varma]: say roads or infrastructure or bridges or whatever.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.840
[Amit Varma]: And they said, make a cinema theater or make a dance hall.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:54.300
[Amit Varma]: And he said his initial reaction was one of a sort of a patronizing looking down on these

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.120
[Amit Varma]: people that don't they understand their greater good?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.760
[Amit Varma]: Why do they want a cinema hall?

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.440
[Amit Varma]: But then when he spoke to them deeper, he realized that what was behind it was as a

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.040
[Amit Varma]: young people were growing up, they wanted to see movies because there was nothing in

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.640
[Amit Varma]: their own village or town where they could see movies.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.920
[Amit Varma]: They would go to other cities like whatever, Imphal, Shillong, whatever is the nearest

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920
[Amit Varma]: big city.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.080
[Amit Varma]: And the roads were so bad that an accident rates were so high.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.720
[Amit Varma]: The death rate was pretty high just going to watch a film.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.760
[Amit Varma]: What if the cinema theater was in the village itself?

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is something no central planner from a distance can foresee.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.400
[Amit Varma]: So if you go with the arrogance of a public policy person and you say externalities, roads

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:36.520
[Amit Varma]: or from another point of view, you might say then they will vote for us if we build a temple

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.720
[Amit Varma]: for the gods.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:43.560
[Amit Varma]: But actually, locally, what people may want individuals in a community they want is completely

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.560
[Amit Varma]: different.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.200
[Amit Varma]: And as you were saying that it just reminded me of the wiseness of that, that even though

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.040
[Amit Varma]: you're an engineer, you thankfully don't have what we derisively call the engineering mindset,

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.600
[Amit Varma]: which is that thing that you can design a society or you can design an intervention

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.280
[Amit Varma]: in particular ways, assuming that people are a static thing, but people are not a static

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.280
[Amit Varma]: thing.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:10.600
[Amit Varma]: Their needs and desires are very local, very specific and inaccessible to outsiders.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:16.800
[Amit Varma]: So tell me something, this realization of yours, which I'm beginning to think about

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.600
[Amit Varma]: seriously and realizing myself and just by talking to you learning from that must have

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.120
[Amit Varma]: happened over a period of many years.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.720
[Amit Varma]: So can you, for example, think of mistakes in your thinking, assumptions you made at

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.800
[Amit Varma]: some point, perhaps, which got corrected when you actually, you know, met with people like

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.640
[Amit Varma]: moments where you thought, oh, my thinking was arrogant and wrong and simplistic.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.520
[Amit Varma]: And now I know better because I made the effort to kind of reach out.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.120
[Amit Varma]: So can you give me like instances of that so I can understand how the process went?

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.200
[Guest]: Yeah, it was like you said, it was long drawn.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.880
[Guest]: I mean, obviously, there was no kind of a sunrise moment that it happens.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:07.640
[Guest]: I mean, primarily it was that when we started or when I started in the late 80s, early 90s,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:18.360
[Guest]: India was liberalizing and we didn't know where we will head.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:24.360
[Guest]: But by that time, I had kind of a clearer idea where I would like to head.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.480
[Guest]: And therefore, public policy greatly interested me in the hope that it will shape the tomorrow

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.480
[Guest]: or the future.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:45.120
[Guest]: So in that early 90s, the issue primarily as I see it now was, how do I win the debate?

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.200
[Guest]: You know, how do I score the points that I want to score so that the other side is kind

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.680
[Guest]: of beaten back?

00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:05.960
[Guest]: Over the next 10-15 years, I realized that that is one of the fundamental flaws.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.440
[Guest]: It's not about defeating the other side.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.480
[Guest]: It's about winning over the other side.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:17.760
[Guest]: You know, so to me, that became, I mean, again, this realization didn't happen overnight.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:26.160
[Guest]: But as I see it, it began to happen about 10-15 years since I began.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.840
[Guest]: And one critical point, which I again, which I didn't realize, which happened 20 years

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:39.120
[Guest]: ago, but I actually didn't realize its significance since I'm looking back now.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:46.480
[Guest]: It was in 2000 and when I was really active, I mean, you know, I mean, the climate change

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:53.040
[Guest]: or the WTO or whatever, where a liberal angle could be placed and where I could be as provocative,

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040
[Guest]: I would be as provocative.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.480
[Guest]: I mean, for the sake of scoring that point.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:05.440
[Guest]: So I wrote and spoke on things which would be outlandish even today.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:20.280
[Guest]: But in 2000, I happened to come across a movement that Sharad Joshi was leading at that time.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.520
[Guest]: I mean, Sharad Joshi is the farmer's leader who passed away a few years ago.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.220
[Guest]: I met him in the early 90s, so I knew him.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:34.320
[Guest]: But we knew each other intellectually that we had a liberal orientation, etc.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:41.880
[Guest]: But in 2000, I came across his first, and that was also mine, a first direct experience

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:47.880
[Guest]: exposure even to a limited extent of a mass movement, because I did grow up during the

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.640
[Guest]: anti-emergency when I just went to college.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.960
[Guest]: And I still remember the blank pages of newspapers that came on the day emergency came, when

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.600
[Guest]: I was just completing my class 11.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:09.080
[Guest]: And therefore, I had seen that era of public enthusiasm for change, etc., etc.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:15.960
[Guest]: But it was in this one, in 2000, that I began to see and actually experienced it, because

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:24.440
[Guest]: proof of the pudding is in eating, that Sharad Joshi's ability to connect with the people

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:38.560
[Guest]: beyond the intellectual dimension actually made people aspire or get inspired to strive

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:45.040
[Guest]: for things which otherwise they may not have, or it may have happened much later.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:51.120
[Guest]: And secondly, once the people connected, the policy followed.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:32:00.000
[Guest]: So that was my first direct experience on a movement that was built on the first generation

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.360
[Guest]: genetically modified cotton, which the cotton farmers in Western India, particularly Gujarat-Maharashtra

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.800
[Guest]: and some other parts wanted.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:18.920
[Guest]: They were already growing the unauthorized, unapproved varieties, which is how the world

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.320
[Guest]: came to know that Indian farmers were already growing something that hadn't been approved

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.640
[Guest]: or authorized by the state.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.800
[Guest]: And Sharad Joshi sought to leverage that.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:41.320
[Guest]: And in 2002, in a matter of a month, the government changed its policy.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.840
[Guest]: To me, that was, you know, I was more an observer, but a close observer since I knew him and

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:51.480
[Guest]: had been to some of the things, and because it was new to me, because I had never interacted

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.000
[Guest]: with public in my adult life as much as then.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:10.000
[Guest]: So it was kind of an eye-opener that the policy could change if we can build the political

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.320
[Guest]: capital, and the political capital can only come if we can take the people or significant

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:25.040
[Guest]: number of people with us, something which I had not experienced nor thought of then.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:35.760
[Guest]: And again, I didn't realize the full significance till over quite a few years, a decade or more.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:44.660
[Guest]: But to me, that was one direct personal experience that I can think of, which turned me from

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.640
[Guest]: the policy to public policy, yeah.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:55.680
[Guest]: So for that, and Sharad Joshi not being primarily an intellectual, although he was, given his

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:03.680
[Guest]: background, you know, extremely educated, accomplished person coming back to India to

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:11.720
[Guest]: look into agriculture from a family who had not been in agriculture for a few generations.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:17.680
[Guest]: So he did it as a practitioner, you know, so he was not pursuing the issue primarily

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:28.200
[Guest]: on the intellectual plane, which to me is my kind of lesson that intellectual dimensions

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.640
[Guest]: are important, but they're not nearly the whole story.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.960
[Guest]: It's the people and how do we reach out.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:45.240
[Guest]: And to reach out, it becomes two ways, you know, like either you reach out patronizingly

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.200
[Guest]: or you reach out more as your equal.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:57.040
[Guest]: You empathize with them in a way a human being ought to empathize with another person.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:04.080
[Guest]: And which to me is amazing that five, six years after his death, in parts of Maharashtra,

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:13.600
[Guest]: I've been, people still give me or show me wedding cards for their daughters or sons,

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.280
[Guest]: not with pictures of gods, but with pictures of Sharad Joshi, which to me is something

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:27.040
[Guest]: amazing that people would hold someone, you know, who was merely an Rajya Sabha MP, you

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.200
[Guest]: know, I mean, I don't know to how long he'll be remembered as such beyond the people who

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.760
[Guest]: knew him.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.840
[Guest]: But that this could happen.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.720
[Guest]: And therefore, how did, how could this happen?

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:49.880
[Guest]: That how do you build the relationship where this level, this depth of bonding happens

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:55.400
[Guest]: and what a contrast it is with today, with social media and the rest, well, we are more

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.280
[Guest]: connected.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.280
[Guest]: We have no connection.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280
[Guest]: Isn't it amazing?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I feel it really amazing.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.800
[Amit Varma]: That's beautifully put, I'll just give some context to my listeners about Sharad Joshi

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.560
[Amit Varma]: and the specific movement you were, you know, you witnessed up close.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.920
[Amit Varma]: Sharad Joshi was a great leader, bureaucrat, etc, etc, who essentially came back to India

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.600
[Amit Varma]: in the late 70s and said, I'll go back to farming and then realized as a farmer the

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.800
[Amit Varma]: problems that agriculturalists throughout the country faced.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.360
[Amit Varma]: But unlike the other political rhetoric of the day, which saw the state as a solution

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:33.640
[Amit Varma]: to these problems, he realized that most of these problems had been created by the state

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:38.960
[Amit Varma]: and that these counterintuitive ideas had to be communicated to the people at large.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.600
[Amit Varma]: And he managed to actually build a mass movement of farmers who were, in a sense, asking for

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.880
[Amit Varma]: the state to get out of the way.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.320
[Amit Varma]: And I have a very good episode in Hindi, which kind of explains this with the leader.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.520
[Amit Varma]: You introduced me to Varun Gunwan Patil.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.520
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you were present at the recording in the room when I recorded with Gunwan ji.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.520
[Amit Varma]: So that's episode 86.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.400
[Amit Varma]: I'll link it from the show notes.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And I also wrote a column called A Tale of Two Satyagrahas.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And one of them was the one that you speak of, that essentially, just to give context

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:13.440
[Amit Varma]: again, in the 1990s, as the 90s were coming to an end, cotton crops across India started

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.580
[Amit Varma]: failing because there were pests like bollworms that were ravaging these crops.

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:22.400
[Amit Varma]: And farmers had to use increasing amounts of pesticide to keep them at bay.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.120
[Amit Varma]: And there was so much more labor involved, the cost of the pesticides were high.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.160
[Amit Varma]: The crops would often fail anyway.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.160
[Amit Varma]: It was just a downward spiral.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.800
[Amit Varma]: Then technology.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.960
[Amit Varma]: Farmers heard of something called BT cotton, which was a genetically modified kind of cotton.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.920
[Amit Varma]: And it was being used across the world, completely safe.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.480
[Amit Varma]: But because it's a new technology, Luddites everywhere were kind of protesting and they

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.400
[Amit Varma]: were illegal in India.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.920
[Amit Varma]: So then what happened is farmers in Gujarat got hold of a bunch of these BT cotton seeds

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.480
[Amit Varma]: and they planted them.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:59.400
[Amit Varma]: And what happened in 2002 was that all cotton crops in Gujarat failed, except the 10,000

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.800
[Amit Varma]: acres with BT cotton.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.160
[Amit Varma]: You would imagine that there would be a lesson in this.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.560
[Amit Varma]: But the lesson that the government took was not that these are the crops that survived,

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.080
[Amit Varma]: but that these are the crops which are illegal.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.200
[Amit Varma]: So they wanted to burn these 10,000 hectares of cotton.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.120
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, Sharad Joshi, who leads the Shetkari Sangatana in Maharashtra, took

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:25.320
[Amit Varma]: around 10,000 farmers with him to Gujarat to stand with their fellow farmers.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.520
[Amit Varma]: And they basically just went into those fields and they said, you want to take the cotton

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.240
[Amit Varma]: over our dead bodies, come and do it.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.400
[Amit Varma]: And like you said, the people's movement there was just too much.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.040
[Amit Varma]: And the ban on BT cotton was lifted by the Vajpayee government, which is such an inspiring

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.560
[Amit Varma]: story at many levels.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.960
[Amit Varma]: Like, I think I've seen a clip of you at a press conference of farmers in 1999 or something,

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960
[Guest]: right?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:55.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, where, you know, a distant clip where you are also holding forth on this.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.160
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, I'll put a link to my column, which kind of talks about why, you know, GMO

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.400
[Amit Varma]: is great, fantastic, we should embrace it.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, let's go a little further back in your journey that we've spoken of public policy,

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.160
[Amit Varma]: we've spoken of policy and we've spoken of public policy, as you said, but before this,

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.040
[Amit Varma]: you were a marine engineer and you sailed the world.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.880
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, post your engineering and all that.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.920
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about those sort of experiences like at that time when you were in college in RSC

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.920
[Amit Varma]: Suratkal doing engineering and so on.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.920
[Amit Varma]: What did you want to be?

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.200
[Amit Varma]: What was your view of the world?

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:32.280
[Amit Varma]: And in ideological terms, how was your view of the world sort of developing?

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.780
[Amit Varma]: Because I remember, I didn't think the things I think today when I was 20 or even 25.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:42.560
[Amit Varma]: It took a lot of time for me to gradually come around to my way of thinking.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:47.840
[Amit Varma]: And otherwise, it was very vague in college, I was just all over the place, no fixed ideas

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.160
[Amit Varma]: on anything, which is not surprising, because the received wisdom around you is so flawed

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.600
[Amit Varma]: in so many ways, with the religion of the state and so on.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And also, you have so few books to read, though I was more privileged than most, but you have,

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.240
[Amit Varma]: you just don't have that kind of access and exposure.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:08.440
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense of your intellectual development through that early period and how the way

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.000
[Amit Varma]: you look at the world begins to change.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.240
[Guest]: I mean, I grew up in, like I said, I grew up in a family which was very political.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.320
[Guest]: From both sides, from my father's side and from my mother's side.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:26.120
[Guest]: Although part of my, from my mother's side was on, in the left, quite actively involved

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:32.440
[Guest]: with left politics in Bengal, and my father's side and my maternal grandfather, they were

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.920
[Guest]: all deeply into Congress from, you know, almost the time they were born.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.400
[Guest]: And my father continued in that vein.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.080
[Guest]: So I grew up, so it was natural that, you know, I grew up in a family that would be

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:51.760
[Guest]: anti-CPM or left in Bengal and Congress.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:41:00.120
[Guest]: But then I saw my father change during 77 or 76, I mean, emergency time.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.520
[Guest]: And that was just the excitement, you know, like it was a David versus Goliath thing for

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.520
[Guest]: me.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.200
[Guest]: I mean, more than because I didn't really have a full grasp of emergency except the

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:17.040
[Guest]: blank spaces I saw in Statesman in Calcutta that, you know, the printed blank spaces because

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.040
[Guest]: of censorship.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:24.600
[Guest]: So apart from that, I don't really have a direct, this thing except for occasional columns,

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:29.440
[Guest]: Minoo Masani or things that would interest me, that's something different, something

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.760
[Guest]: to think about, or something that made me think.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:45.080
[Guest]: But I think what happened was or how it happened perhaps is the emergency and the turmoil and

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:51.680
[Guest]: the best part of that turmoil was perhaps that it happened in the physical space, you

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:59.080
[Guest]: know, having and seeing how the social media space or the digital space, the behavior takes

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.320
[Guest]: place.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:07.120
[Guest]: I think my initial experience were all in the physical space, so while we had less access

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:15.320
[Guest]: to books and there was no internet in the 80s, but we did, and I actually, I mean, me,

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.040
[Guest]: my brothers, we came up from a family which read a lot, you know, I was, I remember books

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:25.000
[Guest]: and comics and things of every kind in our household from my birth.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.960
[Guest]: And my mother used to feed me anything that she thought I could read, and all of our brothers,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.560
[Guest]: we read a lot.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:40.400
[Guest]: So reading was natural and therefore in the 80s, while we didn't have direct access or

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:47.080
[Guest]: a quick access, because of this physical involvement or presence, because we happened to be in

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:52.400
[Guest]: a situation where there is so much foment and turmoil, you know, emergency, then Mrs.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.840
[Guest]: Gandhi's assassination, you know, I mean, there was always turmoil, a major ones.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:06.320
[Guest]: And which invariably makes one, at least made me curious to look and read to try to figure

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.360
[Guest]: out what's happening all around, because it's happening all around, literally.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:15.320
[Guest]: For instance, you know, I still remember that when Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 84,

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:22.280
[Guest]: I was in a village in Sundarbans, and we were stuck for a week, because all connections

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.400
[Guest]: were broken.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:29.680
[Guest]: But people were taking out rallies with, you know, chanting Indira's name and the flag

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:37.120
[Guest]: and all the rest, even in a remote village, which had no electricity, no toilets.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:44.280
[Guest]: So you know, and that kind of made me wonder, and I came from a world which was very urban,

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.000
[Guest]: you know, I grew up completely in urban India.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.640
[Guest]: So to grow up, to experience that, and to think that how different we can be and how

00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:04.580
[Guest]: do we survive in such diverse situations, the marine engineering experience actually

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:12.040
[Guest]: only expanded that, because I joined the marine engineering primarily as my incentive was

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.960
[Guest]: to see the world at no cost, because I was not as intelligent as my brother, who could

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.360
[Guest]: go to an IIT and go to US for his higher studies.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.400
[Guest]: And therefore, I had to be satisfied with less, and therefore, I thought marine engineering

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.720
[Guest]: would at least give me a chance to see the world at no cost, which it did.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:41.600
[Guest]: But that, of course, actually increased my sense of curiosity or inquisitiveness or at

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.600
[Guest]: the gulf.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:48.920
[Guest]: You know, so I remember one of my first letters to my mother from one of the ports I visited

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:55.560
[Guest]: was particularly a western port in Canada, that it does look like you see in Bollywood

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.560
[Guest]: films.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.640
[Guest]: You know, till that time, I had no realization actually, because in our home, we didn't

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.760
[Guest]: have television till after 84-85.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:10.840
[Guest]: So we had experience of the outer world primarily through films, you know, as a visual medium.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:16.320
[Guest]: And the Bollywood was one kind, and we all knew that Bollywood either depicts things

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:24.680
[Guest]: that are too harsh, you know, the realistic ones, or are too fantastic.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:30.440
[Guest]: But the harsh ones are something we don't directly experience, most of us, we haven't.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.680
[Guest]: And the fantasy ones, we can only imagine.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:41.600
[Guest]: Whereas in the West, in Canada, I found that the roads, the people are actually as what

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.600
[Guest]: you see in the films.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:49.400
[Guest]: So that kind of was an eye-opener, that how could it be so different?

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.960
[Guest]: And that was probably my first introduction coupled with this experience in the village

00:45:53.960 --> 00:46:01.000
[Guest]: after that for a few years, that there is something going on that we need to grapple

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
[Guest]: with.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.840
[Guest]: You know, that why is this gulf?

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:12.680
[Guest]: Why is this gulf that my brother who could get admitted in the US and spend next 25 years

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:24.080
[Guest]: working for multinationals, could be an Indian, enjoy the Western standards, yet the family

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:31.600
[Guest]: and the community and the country is a century perhaps behind, in every which way, not just

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.320
[Guest]: financially, economically, but every which way, why?

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:44.920
[Guest]: So that was my kind of quest into actually trying to understand public policy as such.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:52.840
[Guest]: And something that happened, which again, reflectively we know, because one of the stand-alone

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.720
[Guest]: thing about emergency is the Nasbandi, which everybody almost in North India, or perhaps

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:03.440
[Guest]: all over India knew, even as a youngster, I knew that something was happening, because

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.440
[Guest]: everybody talked about it.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:10.480
[Guest]: So it was there, which basically was apart from the policy aspect of it, or the physical

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:19.640
[Guest]: torture and the grossness of it, the policy aspect of it was that population is a challenge.

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.840
[Guest]: And which would seem that population is indeed a challenge, how can you deal with people,

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.320
[Guest]: with so many people growing, etc.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:34.120
[Guest]: That's when primarily one kind of another piece fell in place.

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:39.360
[Guest]: Because I used to read, I sometimes, or quite often actually, whenever I could, I could

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:45.400
[Guest]: visit British Council or American Library in Calcutta, just to read what's happening

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.400
[Guest]: elsewhere.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:57.840
[Guest]: And I discovered Julian Simon, that was in 1986-87, just an accident, no one had told

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.880
[Guest]: me anything about that.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:08.400
[Guest]: And I found he was a man who was arguing something very different.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:19.920
[Guest]: And then in 1990, he won his famous bet, that while the population would increase, the prices

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.320
[Guest]: of some basic commodities that were decided on, would actually decline.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:29.320
[Guest]: And there were some people, biologists and economists on the other side who said, since

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.200
[Guest]: the population is increasing, the prices would rise.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.960
[Amit Varma]: Just to give context, the person on the other side of the bet was a guy called Paul Ehrlich,

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:43.280
[Amit Varma]: who was a famous Luddite, who was a famous sort of Malthusian rather, and a biologist,

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.040
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise a learned man, but completely wrong about this one subject.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.360
[Amit Varma]: And so Julian Simon made a bet with him and said, no, growing population is a good thing

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.360
[Guest]: in 1980.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.520
[Amit Varma]: And they made a bet about certain commodities, whether the prices will go up or down, where

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.320
[Amit Varma]: Ehrlich said, of course, they will go up because population will go up and there'll be less

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.320
[Amit Varma]: resources.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And Simon said, no, no, no, no, no, they'll go down, wait and watch.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.680
[Amit Varma]: And Simon, of course, won the bet.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.680
[Amit Varma]: Sorry, continue.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:12.840
[Guest]: Yeah, so that happened over, I mean, the bet was from 1980 to 1990 in the 10-year period.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:20.200
[Guest]: And I began to read Simon early and late 80s, I mean, just as an accident.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:25.160
[Guest]: And then I read the news that he's actually won the bet.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.560
[Guest]: So that was kind of a startling this thing.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:33.000
[Guest]: And because I was reading these at the American library, because there was no internet, I

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.360
[Guest]: found his address and wrote to him that this is amazing.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.560
[Guest]: And because of the past 10 years where the population, demography, etc. was such a big

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.560
[Guest]: issue in India.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.760
[Guest]: So I thought that I want to know more.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:52.160
[Guest]: And that was kind of the single biggest spark as far as policy world is concerned, because

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:59.240
[Guest]: before that I had no idea of public policy as such as a kind of a domain by itself.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:04.960
[Guest]: And Simon introduced me to the whole world of public policy and particularly free market

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.560
[Guest]: public policy and free market environmentalism.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:17.160
[Guest]: And I kind of, my first 10 years was almost completely on how do we understand the market

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:22.000
[Guest]: in the, or the economics in the context of environment.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
[Guest]: Simon wrote back to you when he wrote to you.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.720
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, he wrote back to me and I mean, we corresponded for the last eight years of

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:32.400
[Guest]: his life.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:39.120
[Guest]: And he came to India, he and his wife came to India in 97, when we did our second conference,

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:45.000
[Guest]: so called libertarian conference in Deolali in 97.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.680
[Guest]: And Simon passed away in 98.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:53.120
[Guest]: And before that, he'd introduced me to a whole world of free market think tanks in Europe

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:57.360
[Guest]: and US particularly.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:03.640
[Guest]: So all that excited me and my interest particularly was because one, the demographic battle, the

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:09.600
[Guest]: policy battle, which was so demonstratively won in my view as Simon won the bet.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.320
[Guest]: But from all the others that I was seeing, because environment and population is related

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:18.800
[Guest]: to environment was such a big, I mean, it kind of interested me because I hadn't thought

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.720
[Guest]: about it.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:26.080
[Guest]: And therefore, I thought, let's try to apply it and see.

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:31.720
[Guest]: So that was kind of my own way of self-education that let me take the biggest challenge that

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:36.720
[Guest]: people say it is there in terms of policy that what to do with environment.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:42.840
[Guest]: And let's see if my understanding or my understanding of economics of markets, which I had not studied

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:48.640
[Guest]: at all in my through my education, I could help resolve it.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.480
[Guest]: At least in my mind, even if I don't convince anyone else and which had some interesting

00:51:53.480 --> 00:52:00.620
[Guest]: fallouts in the sense, for me personally, in the sense that I realized that being from

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:09.120
[Guest]: outside the disciplines, neither economics nor environment, I was relatively free to

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:17.160
[Guest]: ask anything and was only limited by my own lack of imagination or confidence.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:23.000
[Guest]: You know that I didn't, that I hadn't studied environment or economics in my college or

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.080
[Guest]: school or whatever, or any formal way, didn't kind of deter me.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.680
[Guest]: To me, because I had not studied it, I probably tried to understand it and apply it in a way

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:40.080
[Guest]: that I could, which was kind of, you know, I mean, I think was very, very helpful.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:46.960
[Guest]: Because firstly, it gave me the confidence that I could think because at least in my

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:51.160
[Guest]: mind, I thought that what I am saying makes sense to me.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.560
[Guest]: So that was very satisfying.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:53:01.800
[Guest]: Secondly, they were in the late 80s, 90s, by that time, or mid 90s, I started writing

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.560
[Guest]: for newspapers, etc.

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:09.320
[Guest]: And while the editors, etc. may not have agreed with what I am saying, but they thought it

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:19.040
[Guest]: was new, it was different, and it was in a way related to the liberalizing tendency of

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.640
[Guest]: the society and the state at that point.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.800
[Guest]: You know, the 90s was quite exciting in that sense, that people were exploring different

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800
[Guest]: issues.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.160
[Guest]: So I got some space to write.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:37.360
[Guest]: So that was my first, first inter, what should I say, inter-immersion into the world of public

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.520
[Guest]: policy.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:45.680
[Guest]: But there was another thing, another turning point, I think, during my shipping days, apart

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:52.640
[Guest]: from the gulf that I said before, was the coincidence, you know, ships generally had

00:53:52.640 --> 00:54:02.480
[Guest]: libraries and videos, VCRs, but because I was more attracted to reading, so I did.

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:07.440
[Guest]: And one book, again, hardly, no one had actually recommended it, I just came across, which

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.280
[Guest]: was Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:20.160
[Guest]: So that was another of those kind of turning points in the mid 80s, that there is something

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160
[Guest]: to it.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:26.880
[Guest]: You know, that there is something that I need to explore which I hadn't thought of, and

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:38.800
[Guest]: which seems to make a lot of sense in where I am, that is, in India and in our context.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:43.400
[Guest]: And because as I read Rand and read other things that she and others began to recommend,

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:48.880
[Guest]: that is how I kind of accidentally came across Julian Simon, that here is something I should

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.560
[Guest]: read because I thought it was interesting.

00:54:51.560 --> 00:55:02.440
[Guest]: So you know, so those mid to late 80s was a kind of two big kind of stations in my journey,

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:11.200
[Guest]: Rand and Simon, and the next 10 years, in the 90s, I just did that.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.200
[Guest]: That how do I apply?

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.200
[Guest]: How do I apply?

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:20.240
[Guest]: And in that search, you know, we had the Liberty Institute and all the rest as a public policy

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:27.200
[Guest]: think tank trying to copy or model on more Western think tanks.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:33.400
[Guest]: We are perhaps one of the very few at that time who were very, very public and gung-ho

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:40.600
[Guest]: about liberty and free market and all the rest.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:49.840
[Guest]: And so 90s went, you know, I mean, was personally and extremely hectic because I was involved

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:57.600
[Guest]: in so many issues, so many campaigns, so many policy dimensions, intellectual property,

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:04.240
[Guest]: environment, climate change, WTO, trade, yeah, I mean, I can't think of, there was no end

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.880
[Guest]: to the issues I could plunge into.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:11.360
[Guest]: And that was exciting, not because I knew, but it gave me an opportunity to know something

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:16.560
[Guest]: I hadn't known before, you know, to explore that new world, new issue.

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:22.840
[Guest]: But the next one was this Sharad Joshi's movement, which is on hindsight, which I didn't realize

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:23.840
[Guest]: then.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:27.840
[Guest]: Rand and Julian Simon, I realized while I was reading that I was reading something different

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:31.200
[Guest]: and I would like to explore it.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:38.800
[Guest]: Sharad Joshi's intervention in 2000-2002, at that time, I was elated that we had won

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.520
[Guest]: a victory in terms of the policy dimension that the government changed its policy on

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:51.680
[Guest]: GM Cotton and GM Cotton was approved in 2002, in February or March 2002.

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.040
[Guest]: But it was more, you know, a feather in the cap, it was nothing more, I hadn't really

00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:04.760
[Guest]: grasped the public part of the policy still, which took perhaps another 10 years of struggle.

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:10.040
[Guest]: And in that time, I was kind of getting more attracted to things that were happening on

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.040
[Guest]: the people dimension.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:17.720
[Guest]: You know, I came to know about organizations who were acting on the ground to make things

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:22.600
[Guest]: change and particularly their focus, because they were coming from the ground, so their

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:29.160
[Guest]: focus was, or the starting point was the public, whereas my starting point was the policy.

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:38.280
[Guest]: So that, you know, so one major thing or exposure for me was the Arch Vahini, you know, in Gujarat.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:43.640
[Guest]: I mean, I couldn't believe that I would, or I had never dreamt that I would ever come

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:53.960
[Guest]: across a grassroot organization who was so steeped into the ideas of liberalism and freedom

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:57.260
[Guest]: from their experience on the ground.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:03.200
[Guest]: That to me was, you know, the next kind of a turning point and that change could happen.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:10.400
[Guest]: So that was in the, you know, from the late 90s to early 2000s or mid-2000s or late 2000s.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.720
[Guest]: So that's probably 10 years.

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:20.480
[Guest]: It took me to realize that what I am seeing is not an exception, but could be the rule,

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:26.780
[Guest]: you know, that we could reach out, that it is possible to reach out.

00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:33.600
[Guest]: So what Sharad Joshi showed in actual performance of reaching out, here were people who were

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:38.920
[Guest]: on the ground, who could still relate their ideals and the people, you know, the ideals

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:44.660
[Guest]: of freedom and liberalism, etc., with the people and build from that.

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:51.720
[Guest]: Because most of, a lot of activism still, and more so then, were completely on the other

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:58.000
[Guest]: side, that we wanted the state to intervene to do this, that and the other, that we accepted

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:05.000
[Guest]: that people were helpless, ignorant, illiterate and all the troubles that they have, that

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.900
[Guest]: it's the responsibility of the society and the state to do something, to intervene as

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:14.720
[Guest]: aggressively as they can to root out some of these challenges.

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.360
[Guest]: And here was something that was arguing very differently.

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:25.200
[Guest]: And in that, another landmark was, and again, primarily because I probably would never have

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:29.600
[Guest]: observed it or had the opportunity to observe it in such close quarters, had I not come

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.520
[Guest]: to know Archwayane.

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:40.200
[Guest]: Because they were deeply involved in the forest rights movement for the tribal people for

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.680
[Guest]: a long time.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:50.120
[Guest]: And then they were part of the groups that were mobilizing, campaigning for recognition

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.800
[Guest]: of the rights of the tribal people over their lands and local resources in the forest areas

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.000
[Guest]: where they live.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.360
[Guest]: So that was taking place through the early 2000s.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:07.040
[Guest]: And that was another policy change that I saw, not as directly, but through my personal

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:12.960
[Guest]: interaction with them primarily, that the government did change the policy.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:21.560
[Guest]: They did pass an act in 2005, recognizing the rights of the tribal and indigenous communities

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:27.320
[Guest]: and others who live in conventional, traditional communities who are living in the forest areas,

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:33.760
[Guest]: whose rights are generally were not recognized till then, so that it was possible.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:45.480
[Guest]: And the second learning was that legislative change would never be perfect.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.840
[Guest]: It will only be incremental.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.000
[Guest]: And we have to build from that again.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.320
[Guest]: And it's because many times it happens that we think of a legislative victory and think

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.560
[Guest]: that the battle has been won forever.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.120
[Guest]: No battles won forever, neither in GM cotton, which is a glaring example that we haven't

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:13.680
[Guest]: approved the third generation GM cotton since 2006 or 2008.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.840
[Guest]: The world has moved on to the fifth, sixth, seventh generation of GM.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.720
[Guest]: And not just in cotton, there are more than 12 GM crops that are being commercially grown

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.720
[Guest]: across the world.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:28.640
[Guest]: But we are still debating and stuck with the second generation BT cotton that we had.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.080
[Guest]: So the battle is never won.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.840
[Guest]: The battle may be won at a particular point, but the war is a continuous one.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.960
[Guest]: You have to keep fighting all the time.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.200
[Guest]: And same with the Forest Rights Act.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.320
[Guest]: Here was a change, which is a big victory for the people who fought for it.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.720
[Guest]: I was more marginal in this, but I tried to understand it as closely as I could.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:55.000
[Guest]: Because to me, what was interesting and to my friends in ARCH, that it was also a property

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.280
[Guest]: rights movement, which was one of the core beliefs or principles we held of a liberal

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:07.200
[Guest]: free world, that property in land and whatever else.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:15.280
[Guest]: So it's not a perfect legislation, but it's still a step ahead of where we were.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.280
[Guest]: And again, because of the people, you know, so things perhaps began to fall into place

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.960
[Guest]: that I really need to grapple with this people question even more.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:34.760
[Guest]: And then, of course, I had some opportunity to be with them and see how their work were

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:40.120
[Guest]: actually progressing on the ground and what were the potential and what were the limitations

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:47.280
[Guest]: as well of reaching out, you know, how it can happen, whether the new communication

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:53.200
[Guest]: and other technologies available can help, which it did 10 years later with them in terms

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.240
[Guest]: of using satellite imageries and GPS to help people document their claims much, much better

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.120
[Guest]: than it was ever possible when the law was enacted in 2005.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:10.280
[Guest]: And people are incrementally getting at least some rights recognized, although perhaps it's

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280
[Guest]: far from satisfactory.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.000
[Guest]: There are probably more people whose rights have not been recognized even 10 years or

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.640
[Guest]: 15 years after the law was passed then.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.960
[Guest]: But like I said, it's a continuous journey.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:26.560
[Guest]: Every generation, every community has to, every individual has to engage and fight for

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.480
[Guest]: what they stand for.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:36.560
[Guest]: So that was, you know, that was the beginning of my trying to really move and try to understand

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.960
[Guest]: that I had missed something, that the people dimension.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:51.040
[Guest]: So that probably has been the last 5-7 years and in fact, I just wrote to somebody that

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.240
[Guest]: the people dimension is a practitioner's issue.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.760
[Guest]: Sharath Joshi was a practitioner.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:55.760
[Guest]: He was not an ideologue.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.680
[Guest]: You know, he was not an armchair ideologue.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.240
[Guest]: I was an armchair ideologue.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:07.120
[Guest]: I could write anything I wanted, anything my imagination would let me and be satisfied

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.760
[Guest]: with it.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:17.920
[Guest]: But to implement, and that is where my engineering also fit in, that to implement we need practitioners.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920
[Guest]: Engineers are practitioners.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.380
[Guest]: They are not theoretical physicists.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:28.560
[Guest]: And Sharath Joshi was the first practitioner that I saw who made a difference.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:36.320
[Guest]: Arch Vaini was another set of practitioners from rural India who had amazing achievements,

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.440
[Guest]: I think.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:46.560
[Guest]: And as I looked into it, I rediscovered Gandhi, that here to me is the ideal practitioner.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.520
[Guest]: Yeah, so it's been a long journey.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:57.400
[Guest]: It's been a long journey, but I mean, to me, I mean, it's been a very exciting, exciting

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400
[Guest]: journey.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.880
[Guest]: Each breakthrough is, you know, to me, since I'm a non-believer, I don't go to temples

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.960
[Guest]: or have any prayer to say.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:13.480
[Guest]: To me, these are as ecstatic or as I could, I could enjoy it as much as any other excitement

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.960
[Guest]: stimulus I could have, so.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.240
[Amit Varma]: So we'll discuss Gandhi in length later.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.760
[Amit Varma]: And I'll also double click on the Arch Vaini forest rights movements, because I think there

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.160
[Amit Varma]: are so many lessons there.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:30.520
[Amit Varma]: So before we do that, an observation, a little setting of context, another observation, and

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.280
[Amit Varma]: then a couple of questions in that order.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:37.480
[Amit Varma]: So my first observation is that, you know, I used to believe that many of the things

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:43.160
[Amit Varma]: we believe in are counterintuitive ideas, like the fact that every voluntary interaction

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.360
[Amit Varma]: between two people is a positive sum game, both people are better off, what I call the

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.600
[Amit Varma]: double thank you moment, or spontaneous order, the way it works, that you don't need something

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.760
[Amit Varma]: to be centrally directed, that societies and languages and cultures, you know, should not

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.160
[Amit Varma]: be centrally directed, they can run on their own.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.560
[Amit Varma]: And I thought these are counterintuitive ideas, and people may not necessarily understand.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.760
[Amit Varma]: And one experience which forced me to reconsider this notion of mine, was when you called me

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:15.840
[Amit Varma]: to that farmers conference in Deolali three years ago, where in fact, I had had that conversation

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.560
[Amit Varma]: with Gunawan Patilji episode 86.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And there I realized that all of these people, farmers and farmer leaders held pretty much

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:29.520
[Amit Varma]: identical ideas to mine, except that those ideas did not come from books and thinking,

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.680
[Amit Varma]: they came from lived experience.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.940
[Amit Varma]: And that these weren't necessarily that counterintuitive.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:41.000
[Amit Varma]: It was from the fabric of their lives, they could devise these lessons, they could protest

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.480
[Amit Varma]: against the oppression of the state, and realize all the ways in which they were sort of held

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480
[Amit Varma]: back.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.400
[Amit Varma]: So that was a moment for me, which taught me that don't be condescending, don't be patronizing

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.880
[Amit Varma]: these people, you know, from their lived experience, they can arrive at, you know, similar ideas

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:02.320
[Amit Varma]: to you, except that they are in a sense deeper, because it's come from the bottom up.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's not like a top down intellectual thing.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:10.040
[Amit Varma]: The context I want to set is I want to click a little bit on the Julian Simon and the population

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.960
[Amit Varma]: thing, that this is a common trend through Indian history and a dangerous trend, which

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.640
[Amit Varma]: is why I want to click on it, that we assume that our population is the greatest of our

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.160
[Amit Varma]: problems.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:25.560
[Amit Varma]: And this is also a belief that's been incentivized by others, for example, in the early 50s,

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.000
[Amit Varma]: I think the Ford Foundation in the late 50s and early 60s, rather, the Ford Foundation

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.480
[Amit Varma]: was giving incentives to India to do population control.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.640
[Amit Varma]: Population control was a big theme, Sanjay Gandhi kind of believed in it and did a lot

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.160
[Amit Varma]: of coercive nonsense, Kumi Kapoor has a great book on the emergency, which talks about that

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.240
[Amit Varma]: absolute monster.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.760
[Amit Varma]: And this belief has kind of persisted to the current day, where there are still incentives

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.600
[Amit Varma]: given for Nazbandis and population control and all of that.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And at the time we are recording in November, there have been rumors for a while that this

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.920
[Amit Varma]: government may do some population control policy.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.320
[Amit Varma]: But the truth is, population is not a problem.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Population is, in the words of Julian Simon, he wrote a book with this title, the ultimate

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.800
[Amit Varma]: resource.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.260
[Amit Varma]: People are brains, not stomachs.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.620
[Amit Varma]: This is fundamental.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:17.640
[Amit Varma]: And one thing that illustrates this is that the movement of human beings throughout history

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:23.760
[Amit Varma]: has been a movement from villages and rural areas to cities and urban areas to places

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:28.280
[Amit Varma]: with more population density, because that population density is a feature, not a bug.

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.960
[Amit Varma]: You have deeper economic networks, more opportunities, all of that.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.960
[Amit Varma]: That's why people go to cities.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:38.780
[Amit Varma]: There's a great study by Nicholas Eberstadt in 2007 called Too Many People?

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:42.380
[Amit Varma]: And that found no correlation between population density and poverty.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:47.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, Monaco has 40 times the population density of Bangladesh, Bahrain has three times

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.940
[Amit Varma]: the population density of India.

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:54.940
[Amit Varma]: So this is a terrible misconception and it's important to point that out because it leads

01:08:54.940 --> 01:09:02.680
[Amit Varma]: to coercive policies on common people, which are crimes on humanity and this kind of thinking

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.680
[Amit Varma]: still continues.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.120
[Amit Varma]: So I'm really glad that you kind of mentioned that.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.280
[Amit Varma]: I never knew you'd corresponded extensively with Simon.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.640
[Amit Varma]: The other sort of sideways observation I'll come to is Ayn Rand.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.760
[Amit Varma]: In the sense it's become fashionable, for example, on Twitter, too shit on Ayn Rand.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.480
[Amit Varma]: I got to say, I haven't read Rand, I tried and I didn't like the quality of the prose

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.480
[Amit Varma]: and just for that reason alone, I didn't.

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.360
[Amit Varma]: I've seen some of her quotes, which sound very interesting to me and I agree with them.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:35.680
[Amit Varma]: For example, the smallest minority is an individual, which I think is something we should all internalize.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.480
[Amit Varma]: But it's kind of become fashionable to have this thing about what is the worst book ever

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.000
[Amit Varma]: and people will say Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.600
[Amit Varma]: And it's such a, you know, this speaks to a tendency within us to show our virtue by

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.280
[Amit Varma]: standing in judgment over others, like I am too good for that.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280
[Amit Varma]: That is so bad.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.240
[Amit Varma]: See, I am so discerning, I know that is bad.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.360
[Amit Varma]: And to me, that question itself, what is the worst book ever, is fundamentally flawed.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.240
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, whenever any of us starts reading a really bad book, we stop reading

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.280
[Amit Varma]: if we never read it, we don't complete bad books.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.720
[Amit Varma]: So how are we in a position to judge what is the worst book ever?

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.200
[Amit Varma]: We simply are not and I bet that many of the people who write these things haven't read

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.800
[Amit Varma]: Rand and neither have I.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.120
[Amit Varma]: And I know that we share many of the same beliefs about individual freedom and liberty

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.680
[Amit Varma]: and why consent is good and coercion is bad.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:26.200
[Amit Varma]: And I have arrived at it through different places.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:31.400
[Amit Varma]: And to some extent you and another person I also admire greatly, who's influenced by

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.800
[Amit Varma]: Rand, which is Alex Tabarrok, both of you have arrived at it through Rand.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.960
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like you to kind of talk about the ideas that like, how does she change your

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.960
[Amit Varma]: thinking?

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.960
[Amit Varma]: What are the ideas?

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.240
[Amit Varma]: What are your thoughts of looking at the world that you got from Anne Rand?

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:53.600
[Guest]: You know, Rand was a, was kind of a shock.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:11:02.680
[Guest]: That from everything that I had heard, read, experienced in the first 25 years, and I read

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.240
[Guest]: Rand relatively late in my life, I was already a graduate and all that.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.480
[Guest]: Most people read Rand, begin to read Rand, it seems, in their school or high school or

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.480
[Guest]: college.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.640
[Guest]: So I read Rand late and perhaps because we didn't have, there was no internet and there

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:22.720
[Guest]: was no such thing to get to acquaint with her and I read her by accident.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:33.200
[Guest]: But the shock of it, that how could somebody think and provide a perspective which seems

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:46.200
[Guest]: to stand against or stand alone in the backdrop of everything we have read, heard, believed.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.840
[Guest]: And what you said that, you know, and that the individual is the smallest minority in

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:57.720
[Guest]: any collective, no matter which group, whereas today we talk of all the minorities, minority

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:03.440
[Guest]: rights, etc., but we never consider the individual within those minorities.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.240
[Guest]: Because that's the unifying bond, that could be the potentially unifying bond cutting across

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.840
[Guest]: various communities, ideological, ethnic, religious.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:19.560
[Guest]: And second was that, and because perhaps, and this is perhaps my context, because I

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:25.120
[Guest]: came from engineering, I studied science, pure science, physics, chemistry, mathematics

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.880
[Guest]: throughout my education.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:34.040
[Guest]: So I had no particular inclination or understanding of social sciences at all.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:40.480
[Guest]: And that Rand could provide, and perhaps because I was a blank slate, Rand, at least in that

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:47.760
[Guest]: dimension, so Rand could provide a social science explanation for what's happening

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.880
[Guest]: in such a telling manner.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.320
[Guest]: And which is probably why I think people, the books are pirated and I first, in fact

01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:02.400
[Guest]: long before I even realized what intellectual property and copyright, etc., were, I used

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:08.080
[Guest]: to buy, and I still have some of those copies, bought copies from the streets of Calcutta

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.400
[Guest]: which were all, from today I know, they were all pirated.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:18.720
[Guest]: You know, if people were not reading, no one would be pirating and copying and printing

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.720
[Guest]: them.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.000
[Guest]: And in those days, even photocopying was so difficult.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.680
[Guest]: Yeah, photocopying was not as easy as it is today.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:33.040
[Guest]: So all that, and which meant that in Calcutta I did, when I began to read, I began to really

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.040
[Guest]: read.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:37.440
[Guest]: One, because reading came naturally to me, and secondly, I could look around and I could

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.280
[Guest]: find so many of her books and the books that she recommended and otherwise.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:50.120
[Guest]: So that was, and my first impulse, in fact, not just me, another friend whom both of us

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:59.080
[Guest]: know, Parth, we came across each other in, around that time, 86 perhaps, because of our

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:03.160
[Guest]: common affinity to Rand.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:11.520
[Guest]: And some others also, Rakesh Wadhwa, another friend you know, Ajay Gandhi, another friend

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.520
[Unknown]: you know.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520
[Unknown]: Wonderful man, so sad.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.240
[Guest]: Yeah, we all, we all, so sad that he passed away so suddenly last month, amazing, I still

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.680
[Guest]: miss him each day, because he used to correspond so much on WhatsApp, almost on a daily basis.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:30.440
[Guest]: So all these people I came to know, and many others, and most prominent of them, my wife.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:36.280
[Guest]: That it's in the 80s, late 80s that we had these Aindran clubs in many parts of, many

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.280
[Guest]: cities of India.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.480
[Guest]: And we used to circulate reading material and audio cassettes to listen to, because

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.680
[Guest]: you know, we had to literally post them from one place to another.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.640
[Guest]: One group would listen to first few sets and pass the rest of the lectures to the next

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.640
[Guest]: group, etc.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.720
[Guest]: So it was a large network, which is how I came to know some of these people in Tara

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.920
[Guest]: Malkani and Govind Malkani in Bombay.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.440
[Guest]: So in that, in the personal journey, that period was interesting, because we were all

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.320
[Guest]: exploring to figure out, are there other people like us?

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.280
[Guest]: Or are we being taken for a ride?

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.720
[Guest]: You know, so it was amazing to discover Parth or so many others.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.880
[Guest]: And that's how I met my wife, because she responded to one of these efforts.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:27.240
[Guest]: And because she was in, she was from Calcutta, so we could meet up in 87, 88 perhaps, and

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.960
[Guest]: we married in 89.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:38.400
[Guest]: And that's one person probably, I mean, I have no, I can't express how, how glad I am

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400
[Guest]: for that coincidence.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.080
[Guest]: Love at first sight.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:46.240
[Guest]: Yeah, it was, it was, but more than that, she, I mean, much more than that, because

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.200
[Guest]: she's borne me for the last 30 years.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:54.880
[Guest]: Yeah, it's not easy, because of my habits and because of my way of doing things, that

01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:00.120
[Guest]: she's virtually subsidized a lot of what I do and what I think.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:06.580
[Guest]: So that's been, on a personal level, an incredible, incredible journey.

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:13.280
[Guest]: And that we shared so much in common, at least, you know, the basic premises.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:20.680
[Guest]: So that was, yeah, that was, RAND was in that sense, quite, I mean, quite startling.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.520
[Guest]: Because I had, perhaps because I had not come from that world.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.760
[Guest]: Maybe people from the social sciences who are already familiar with economics and social

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:35.040
[Guest]: issues, they have a frame and therefore can assess and therefore can reject RAND as much.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:40.960
[Guest]: But I think most people do not, like me, so many people like me then, do not come from

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.040
[Guest]: a set perspective, because for any number of reasons, either we didn't, we're not educated

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.760
[Guest]: in that stream, or we are not practitioners in that stream.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.720
[Guest]: You know, so that probably, and which is probably why people like RAND sell across the world

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.000
[Guest]: or continue to sell, how many years, 30 years after her death.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.560
[Guest]: In 82 she died and the books are still being pirated.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:07.520
[Guest]: I mean, this is a phenomenon I cannot, you know, one can't understand unless one feels

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:13.400
[Guest]: that there are people who are, of course, reading doesn't make one take it up in any

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.400
[Guest]: meaningful manner.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:20.480
[Guest]: But to me, I mean, I probably took it up a little bit more than some others.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:27.360
[Guest]: But that was, to me, that was my first and the Julian Simon was my next.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:35.480
[Guest]: And one query, I mean, of course, RAND made me completely convinced me about the needlessness

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:42.280
[Guest]: of believing in God or a superhuman force or person or whatever.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:49.120
[Guest]: So she completely cured me of that.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:57.480
[Guest]: But what she didn't show, which kind of came to me much, much later, 20-25 years later

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:04.120
[Guest]: is, and what I said a little earlier, that the point is not about winning the debate,

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.360
[Guest]: the point is about winning over.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:14.120
[Guest]: Sharad Joshi gave a glimpse of that winning over, Arch Vaini provided another glimpse

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:20.160
[Guest]: of trying to reach out and winning over people who may not be coming from your side.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:25.480
[Guest]: And the ultimate one, for instance, for me is in this regard of winning over and not

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.840
[Guest]: being a practitioner to the core, to me is Gandhi.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:33.960
[Guest]: Because public policy, and which again is my, you know, I mean, my re-reading of Gandhi,

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.440
[Guest]: that public policy, if you have to take people forward with you on the on issues that you

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:48.760
[Guest]: think deserve social, political capital to back it, then no one, I think, in the modern

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:59.720
[Guest]: era or perhaps ever, could reach out and connect at a scale and at a time that Gandhi did.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:06.320
[Guest]: So that to me was, you know, so to me, in fact, this is my current, my latest passion,

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:13.760
[Guest]: that if I really believe that it is not about winning the debate, but winning over people

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:23.960
[Guest]: with whom I may disagree, it is not so much to convince them of my merits, but about legitimacy

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:30.280
[Guest]: of the different perspectives, because once we recognise the legitimacy of different perspectives,

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:35.280
[Guest]: then we will take a step back from imposing our perspective on others.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:40.760
[Guest]: So that's the first step, and in that, I think, my current, this thing has been, I mean, I'm

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.600
[Guest]: completely into it, personally, as well as intellectually.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:54.520
[Guest]: How do I reconcile, for instance, Rand with Gandhi?

01:19:54.520 --> 01:20:00.660
[Guest]: You know, there would seem, until 10 years ago, I would have thought that it's not easy.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:06.920
[Guest]: But precisely because it didn't seem easy, I'm now completely into it.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.280
[Guest]: That if it's not easy, is there a way?

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:14.640
[Guest]: That how do we reconcile people and ideas that I think, and that many of us think, are

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640
[Guest]: irreconcilable?

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:27.160
[Guest]: Is there something in the ideal, in the premises of socialism, which can be brought together

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:35.600
[Guest]: with the premises of a free society, for instance, or if there is Julian Simon's way of looking

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.160
[Guest]: at environment and consumption, etc.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.960
[Guest]: That mind is the ultimate resource, and therefore, the more we consume, the more we have.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:49.240
[Guest]: And which, to me, was one of my direct experiences, that when I spent a few years in the villages

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.800
[Guest]: of Sundarbans, we consumed hardly anything.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.520
[Guest]: But we didn't even have tap water.

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.360
[Guest]: I mean, we had to really struggle to get clean water.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.360
[Guest]: And we had no toilets.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.760
[Guest]: So it was all outdoors.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.440
[Guest]: And we had no consumption.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:12.920
[Guest]: Yet when I saw the West, they were consuming so much, but it was so clean.

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:18.400
[Guest]: You know, so to me, it's not necessary that consumption leads to pollution, or there is

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.720
[Guest]: something called overconsumption leading to pollution.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.440
[Guest]: So how do I reconcile Julian Simon with, again, Gandhi?

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:29.720
[Guest]: Because Gandhi would be seen as, you know, the famous quote, which is kind of tenuous,

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.400
[Guest]: but still, I mean, which is referred to, although he may not have actually said it, that the

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:38.320
[Guest]: world is enough for everyone's need, but not sufficient for everyone's greed.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:44.200
[Guest]: Because then we don't, I mean, no one goes on to define what's need and what's greed

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.200
[Guest]: is.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.880
[Guest]: And Gandhi was not an intellectual, he was not in the business of defining things in

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.880
[Guest]: that manner.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.880
[Guest]: He was a practitioner.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.400
[Guest]: We had to see it from his life.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.640
[Amit Varma]: So some trends, one, I think that there might be a false dichotomy here, in the sense, I

01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:01.400
[Amit Varma]: think it is possible to be like you probably are both a Randian and a Gandhian, in the

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:07.400
[Amit Varma]: sense that if you look at Rand in say, the business of ideas, that this is the way the

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.400
[Amit Varma]: world works.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.960
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, these are values which help move us to a better place, then that's a business

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.000
[Amit Varma]: of ideas.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.320
[Amit Varma]: And Gandhi more in the business of that second aspect that you spoke about, how do you convince

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.320
[Amit Varma]: people?

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.320
[Amit Varma]: How do you bring people with you?

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.520
[Amit Varma]: How do you build mass movements, all of that.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.840
[Amit Varma]: And I think that they're kind of orthogonal and can, you know, one can follow the other

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:32.480
[Amit Varma]: one can learn from Gandhi, how to build a movement, but not necessarily share many of

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.480
[Amit Varma]: his ideas.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.840
[Amit Varma]: And as you know, I admire many of his ideas, I despise many of his ideas.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.280
[Amit Varma]: People contain multitudes, there are all of those kind of angles.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:46.040
[Amit Varma]: I want to now double click on again, something that you alluded to earlier and to just now

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:52.400
[Amit Varma]: where you said that once you sort of found this frame of looking at the world from Rand,

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.720
[Amit Varma]: from Simon and so on, you moved heavily into the environment, which I find really interesting,

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:01.760
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, people who support the free markets like you and me, talk about the

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:02.760
[Amit Varma]: beauty of markets.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:08.360
[Amit Varma]: The most common counter given to them always is that, okay, fine, we accept that all voluntary

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.280
[Amit Varma]: transactions leave both people better off and markets are great and blah, blah, blah.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.720
[Amit Varma]: But what about externalities, what about the environment, what about pollution?

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.080
[Amit Varma]: What about the smog of Delhi?

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.800
[Amit Varma]: What about, you know, all of those things?

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.520
[Amit Varma]: Take me through sort of your thinking about all these issues, because that also seems

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:31.400
[Amit Varma]: a very interesting reconciliation to make, to be able to go into that domain like you

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:37.880
[Amit Varma]: did to, you know, to band with all the experts on it, and the practitioners on it, to enter

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:44.080
[Amit Varma]: mass movements, all the while, holding firm about how, you know, you need to look at it

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.400
[Amit Varma]: a little differently, that markets aren't evil, maybe they are the solution.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:51.760
[Amit Varma]: So expand on that a little bit, because I'm sure many people who have this objection to

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.360
[Amit Varma]: free markets would be interested in knowing.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:59.680
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I was not looking at people at that point, primarily, I was looking at

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:05.440
[Guest]: it as a challenging intellectual exercise, which was very satisfying, because I was looking

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:12.000
[Guest]: into a problem differently, and I was applying it to our context in India, rather than what

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.600
[Guest]: one would hear or read from the Western or other context.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:25.200
[Guest]: And you know, so for instance, I found it quite natural, which I know is not so natural.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.640
[Guest]: But I found it natural in those days, one of the first questions that kind of struck

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:37.080
[Guest]: me is that how come we have more chickens than we have more tigers or elephants.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:43.240
[Guest]: And that to me was relevant, because, and from personal experience too, because I grew

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.760
[Guest]: up at a time in the 60s, when there was hardly any chicken, you know, chicken was, I think

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:54.320
[Guest]: in our house, Bengali household, complete non-vegetarian all the time.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.040
[Guest]: I think we had chicken only in the 70s, started having chicken only in the 70s, before that

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.120
[Guest]: it was mutton, the goat or at times if there are people coming from the village, it was

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.520
[Guest]: the duck, there was no chicken.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:13.200
[Guest]: And my grandmother, as long as she was running the house, she would not let chicken be cooked

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:21.000
[Guest]: in the common chulha, you know, the coal-fired stove that we had, I mean that everyone had

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.360
[Guest]: at that time.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.360
[Guest]: So, why is it that we have so many chickens?

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:34.360
[Guest]: You know, that was kind of a filling, I mean fill in the blank kind that how is it that

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:44.120
[Guest]: a western city, New York or London or Tokyo, where not just there is huge population, enormous

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:50.800
[Guest]: wealth and incredibly clean.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:57.840
[Guest]: You know, so all the three were together, so that to me was my kind of lived experience

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:03.240
[Guest]: that there is something that we need to explore, that we need to understand.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:09.320
[Guest]: And that is where I think Rand and the Simon and all the rest kind of, Rand for instance,

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:16.760
[Guest]: the basic advantage was that she provided an ethical frame of the idea of rights and

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.720
[Guest]: what's right and wrong as a first shot, which I hadn't thought of earlier.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:30.160
[Guest]: And Julian Simon with his enormous information base on how things are changing, was that

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:36.480
[Guest]: you know, if this is really happening, then why isn't it happening here?

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:42.160
[Guest]: You know, and perhaps while India was reforming, liberalizing in 1990s, that was, I mean I

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:46.840
[Guest]: really didn't have the technical expertise to look into the fiscal policy or, you know,

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.120
[Guest]: things of that kind.

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:54.360
[Guest]: So my interest grew into environment because, you know, that was a big, you know, 92 was

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.360
[Guest]: the Rio summit.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.520
[Guest]: So, you know, that was a big buzz and then WTO, so that was another big buzz.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.240
[Guest]: So I plunged into it because there were big buzzes and because I wanted to know, I really

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:08.960
[Guest]: wanted to explore that is there something I can say or think which makes sense to me

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.960
[Guest]: firstly.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.480
[Guest]: And if it makes sense to me, then I can take it forward.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:19.920
[Guest]: So the environment fit in exactly in that post-Rio scenario.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.720
[Guest]: And the more I looked, the more I felt that I can ask questions which people are not asking

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.720
[Guest]: and which needs to be asked.

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.120
[Guest]: For instance, why there are more chicken than tigers and this thing.

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:34.320
[Guest]: So I, one of my first, and not just chicken, there are more crocodiles, there are probably

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:40.400
[Guest]: 2 million crocodiles being killed across the world for the leather, whereas in India, crocodile

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:46.680
[Guest]: is an endangered species and harvesting and farming is illegal, prohibited.

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:47.680
[Guest]: Why?

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:55.880
[Guest]: You know, and to me, that was one of my starting this thing and it was at around that time

01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.680
[Guest]: probably, I do not remember the exact year now, that I came across, because I was exploring

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:09.560
[Guest]: these ideas, came across the ideas and experiences of a person, I do not know, I mean which most

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:14.520
[Guest]: Indians may not remember these days, Romulus Whitaker.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:23.360
[Guest]: He, I do not know what his background was, but he set up a farm in outside Chennai, Madras.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.440
[Guest]: And once, I think my wife and I, we were on that stretch of the East Coast and had visited

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.600
[Guest]: them once.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:38.720
[Guest]: The answer, question was, here is a farm that was pioneer in the world in terms of figuring

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:44.320
[Guest]: out how to ensure a more efficient breeding of crocodiles, but has been prohibited from

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.440
[Guest]: breeding.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:57.640
[Guest]: So that to me, perhaps because I was not coming from the stream, I had a frame which was different.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.000
[Guest]: My experience and the frame, I was trying to link the two, because I had nothing else

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
[Guest]: to go by.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.960
[Guest]: I had no baggage, so to say, to carry.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:15.040
[Guest]: So that to me was my, you know, I mean, so when I wrote one of my kind of pieces, which

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.080
[Guest]: a lot of people remember 10-20 years after that, I still remember it, that New York Times

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.080
[Guest]: piece on tigers.

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.080
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.080
[Guest]: But why could not it be?

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.080
[Guest]: Why can not we think?

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.120
[Amit Varma]: Why can not we imagine a world which is different?

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll quickly tell my listeners what that piece was, because I remember reading it and being

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.600
[Amit Varma]: absolutely mind blown.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.840
[Amit Varma]: And your piece essentially made the argument, and I think it was in the context of China,

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:42.240
[Amit Varma]: that if you want to save tigers, and you know, make sure that they don't die out, the way

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:48.280
[Amit Varma]: to do it is to allow commercialization of tigers, because then people will be incentivized

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.960
[Amit Varma]: to breed tigers, and therefore the species won't die out exactly as has happened with

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:55.240
[Amit Varma]: chickens and crocodiles elsewhere in the world, but not here.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:59.000
[Amit Varma]: And that is so counterintuitive, because your intuitive response when you think about how

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.520
[Amit Varma]: do I endanger a species is stop people from killing it.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:06.520
[Amit Varma]: But your answer is do the opposite, and they will thrive and you know, the difference between

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:07.520
[Amit Varma]: chicken and tigers.

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.520
[Guest]: So sorry, continue.

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.520
[Guest]: But I just had to share.

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.520
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:16.040
[Guest]: And to me, I mean, those are kind of my, in my intellectual journey, those were kind of,

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:19.920
[Guest]: you know, landmarks that how could I ask?

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.320
[Guest]: How could I think?

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:24.200
[Guest]: And I think this is where the demography, the population issue, and this issue also

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.200
[Guest]: fits in.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:30.640
[Guest]: That, that it's not in the numbers, in terms of population.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:36.320
[Guest]: And it's not in the scarcity in terms of tigers or chickens or crocodiles or whatever.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:43.000
[Guest]: That these are all constructs and outcomes of certain way of looking at things.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:49.840
[Guest]: And because of certain ways of looking at things, we construct our policies to fit that,

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.340
[Guest]: which may not be the whole story.

01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.800
[Guest]: And at the back of my mind, and this is where, this is where kind of, you know, the other

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:04.760
[Guest]: dimension plays in and where both Rand and Gandhi is quite important, which is what happens

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.760
[Guest]: when you impose?

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.200
[Guest]: You know, we think we impose because we know.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:14.800
[Guest]: What happens if we, if we are wrong, and we have imposed?

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:19.880
[Guest]: Emergency was a very good experience and a tragic one of what happened when somebody

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.960
[Guest]: believed in something and imposed it on others, and what was the cost?

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:29.480
[Guest]: You know, it was a human experience and a tragedy of enormous proportion, you know,

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:33.840
[Guest]: something comparable to, to, to what happened in some of the communist countries because

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.320
[Guest]: of the whims and fancies of their leaders.

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.280
[Guest]: That is where the ethics comes in.

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:46.780
[Guest]: That what do I really, even if I know, do I have the right to impose?

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.520
[Amit Varma]: What happens if I'm wrong?

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:52.080
[Guest]: And the impositions aren't just during the emergency, but all of our history, essentially.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.080
[Guest]: The mindset continues.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:32:00.320
[Guest]: It is this mindset that has impacted our policy on environment, on tigers or on everything.

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:04.880
[Guest]: The mindset is that, you know, that is where that we are looking at policy in a frame that

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:10.520
[Guest]: we have internalized without reflecting what impact or what's the relevance for it for

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.520
[Guest]: the public.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.760
[Guest]: Like you said about, about the Northeast, what the people wanted and what the, what

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.120
[Guest]: the funding was, the state funding was aimed at doing.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:25.800
[Guest]: So that gap, it's not just a gap, it's the mindset that makes us do that, which is where,

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:31.920
[Guest]: which is where carrying people along as Gandhi showed is so critical because we wouldn't

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:37.520
[Guest]: be able to carry people along if we persisted in, in, on that track for long.

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:42.080
[Guest]: I mean, that might be an initial, and we can see that we have so many campaigns on so many

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.640
[Guest]: social political issues, but what kind of a shelf life do they have?

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.960
[Guest]: You know, we need another campaign as if to overcome the current campaign.

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:54.800
[Guest]: Because the current campaign shelf life is over, so we need another drama to take it

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:59.640
[Guest]: forward to the, you know, take it, take the next, next campaign in order to keep the people

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.480
[Guest]: addicted to something.

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:10.860
[Guest]: So while we can keep doing it, but are we achieving anything meaningful or are we achieving

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:16.220
[Guest]: the kind of change that I'm sure most of us would agree on?

01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:22.920
[Guest]: And I think, I think, yeah, so that ethics part, and then the natural this thing was,

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:29.800
[Guest]: which I think we've discussed earlier too, which is many of us may agree on the ends.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.680
[Guest]: We need to look at the means.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:39.840
[Guest]: We need to look at the means and we cannot achieve our ends unless the means relate to

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.840
[Guest]: the, to the ends.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:47.680
[Guest]: And this is where even a non-believer, non-practitioner, non-temple grower, a beef-eating Hindu can

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:55.040
[Guest]: claim to be a Hindu, which I do, I have no reason yet to disown my legacy or my, yeah,

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.080
[Guest]: my legacy, my presence in the Hindu fold.

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:05.320
[Guest]: But I can completely relate, for instance, to the essence of Gita, you know, without

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.880
[Guest]: having any divinity in it.

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact…

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.920
[Amit Varma]: The central message of the Gita is that the end justifies the means.

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.200
[Guest]: It's exactly the opposite.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.120
[Guest]: The whole, yeah, it's exactly the opposite.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:19.680
[Guest]: It's the whole quest for finding the means that the end is whatever.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.120
[Amit Varma]: We agree that we have to win the war or whatever.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.760
[Amit Varma]: And the means is kill all your cousins.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:24.760
[Guest]: No.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:31.120
[Guest]: Why and how you do it, the whole discourse is that, that a God, those who believe in

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:38.320
[Guest]: divinity of Krishna, couldn't dictate or order or press a button.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.880
[Guest]: But he had to engage in such a dialogue at such a critical point in general to just convince

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:47.640
[Guest]: someone that this is why and this is how you should engage.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.640
[Guest]: To me, it is this process.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:49.640
[Guest]: That's the means.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.200
[Guest]: Not the specifics or the details.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.200
[Guest]: That's irrelevant.

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:59.880
[Guest]: It's this process of searching, of questioning continuously till you are convinced.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:04.480
[Guest]: Now, the conclusion at a particular point in time may turn out to be wrong.

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.920
[Guest]: Later on, you have to change.

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:06.920
[Guest]: But that's life always.

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:11.480
[Guest]: So, my reading of Gita is completely different and I think my reading of Gita is actually

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:17.520
[Guest]: quite consonant with quite a few people who have actually interpreted Gita from the original

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.960
[Guest]: because I am reading in Bengali or in English.

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:30.480
[Guest]: But people who read it in Sanskrit, I mean, I find this essence of action detached from

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:39.640
[Guest]: the outcome is possible only when you have the capacity in your mind that you have got

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:41.320
[Guest]: the means right.

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320
[Guest]: And then it's free for all.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'm not an expert on the Gita.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.320
[Guest]: Neither am I.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:49.760
[Amit Varma]: And there are things I admire greatly about the book, for example, you know, I think Lord

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.120
[Amit Varma]: Krishna would have made a great poker player in just his lesson of don't worry about the

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.840
[Amit Varma]: fruits of your action, just do the right thing, which is very, you know, non-results oriented,

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.160
[Amit Varma]: process oriented, lots to learn there for modern sportsmen also.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:06.040
[Amit Varma]: But then I look at, you know, what the Pandavas did, like our friend Mohit was pointing out

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:10.480
[Amit Varma]: last night at dinner that they killed almost all their main enemies by deception.

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:13.600
[Amit Varma]: I just feel that there's an issue there with the means, but that's a larger discussion

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:14.760
[Amit Varma]: and it's a great book on its own.

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.000
[Amit Varma]: I won't get into that.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.720
[Amit Varma]: I do want to talk about means and ends and Gandhi after the break.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:23.880
[Amit Varma]: But before the break, one more piece of context setting and then a joke that you might like

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.200
[Amit Varma]: and you must have heard.

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.920
[Amit Varma]: So the context setting is that I also want to double click on what you said earlier for

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:32.840
[Amit Varma]: the reader's benefit, that in the Western world, the consumption is high, the wealth

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:35.280
[Amit Varma]: is high and the air is clean.

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And this is like something that I remember is counterintuitive.

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.880
[Amit Varma]: And I first read about it in Beyond Lombok's book, The Skeptical Environmentalist when

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.200
[Amit Varma]: it came out 16 or 17 years ago.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.360
[Amit Varma]: Great book then, kind of outdated now, but do follow Beyond Lombok's recent writings

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.360
[Amit Varma]: if you can.

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:55.160
[Amit Varma]: The revelation there was that London at the end of the 19th century was possibly as polluted

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.720
[Amit Varma]: as Bombay is today or even Delhi is today.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:00.760
[Amit Varma]: All these great Western cities were incredibly populated.

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:05.560
[Amit Varma]: But there was like a sort of a bell curve of pollution that once you reached a certain

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:11.640
[Amit Varma]: level of economic growth and a certain level of wealth, these cities started becoming cleaner.

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:14.440
[Amit Varma]: The Kuznets curve in a sense, you could also apply that.

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:19.400
[Amit Varma]: And they started getting much, much cleaner because technology became better, people started

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:25.120
[Amit Varma]: applying ingenuity, citizens became more empowered and demanded cleaner air, combination of reasons

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.840
[Amit Varma]: and the wealth that enabled it.

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.120
[Amit Varma]: And the wealth that enabled it.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:35.080
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, a city like London today consumes much more than it used to, has many more people

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.080
[Amit Varma]: than it used to, and is much, much cleaner than it used to.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:44.000
[Guest]: And the last I heard was Thames, the water in the Thames is potable.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
[Guest]: Wow.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
[Guest]: Unbelievable.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:53.400
[Guest]: And that it happened, you know, 150 years Londoners and English literature has been

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:59.080
[Guest]: lamenting, you know, the fog, the famous Jack the Ripper and the London fog at the turn

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.360
[Guest]: of the last century.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:11.880
[Guest]: But post war, in about less than 20 years, things had changed so dramatically, you know,

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.600
[Guest]: and post colonization because London was no longer the imperial capital during that phase,

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.760
[Guest]: it lost most of its, almost all of its colonies, yet the city, and it's not just about London.

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.760
[Amit Varma]: So many other cities.

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:27.760
[Guest]: I mean, not just cities.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:34.480
[Guest]: England today has more trees standing and more wooded areas than a century or more ago.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.840
[Guest]: United States today has more trees standing and more wooded areas than a century ago.

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.840
[Guest]: How has it happened?

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:48.160
[Guest]: You know, so we need to, so to me, it is this relationship between the lived experience,

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.320
[Guest]: provided we are willing to open our eyes to see what has happened and then trying to figure

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:56.560
[Guest]: out how and why it has happened.

01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:00.880
[Guest]: So that we can see what are the lessons that can be drawn, because we don't have to, you

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:06.680
[Guest]: know, the Kuznets curve, actually the beauty of the Kuznets curve is because societies

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:12.880
[Guest]: that are developing later, like India is and many others, can leapfrog.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:18.000
[Guest]: So the peak of pollution, which the Western societies industrialized, the societies that

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:25.320
[Guest]: were industrializing at first, that level should not be, need not be reached by anyone

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320
[Guest]: who's following.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:32.560
[Guest]: So we should make that turn much quicker, provided we get the lessons and the perspectives

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.560
[Amit Varma]: right.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:34.560
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And then Steven Pinker has also written very eloquently about, you know, how we think the

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:41.840
[Amit Varma]: world is getting worse, but actually it is just such a much better place.

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And now the joke I promised you before we go to the break, and this has something to

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:48.560
[Amit Varma]: do with what you mentioned about how when you were a kid, you wouldn't eat chickens

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.880
[Amit Varma]: and you'd sometimes, you'd eat a lot of mutton and sometimes you'd eat ducks.

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Now ducks, as you know, the Hindi word for ducks is batak, right?

01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:00.960
[Amit Varma]: So there is this famous story about how Gyani Zayal Singh, when he was president of India,

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:06.280
[Amit Varma]: he was in England and the Queen of England took him on a walk around the, you know, Buckingham

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Palace or wherever the Royal Gardens are.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And there was a pond there and there were some beautiful ducks there.

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:15.160
[Amit Varma]: And Gyani Zayal Singh turned to the Queen and said, Madam, you have lovely buttocks.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.880
[Guest]: Of course, for a Bengali, that's not exactly the word we use for ducks.

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:20.880
[Amit Varma]: What's the word you use?

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:21.880
[Amit Varma]: Harsh.

01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:22.880
[Amit Varma]: Harsh.

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:23.880
[Guest]: But buttocks, I'm right, right?

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.880
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, in Hindi, that's what you'd say.

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:28.880
[Guest]: Delightful.

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:33.440
[Amit Varma]: But of course, I had the fish option too, being a Bengali, fish is our second special.

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.440
[Amit Varma]: March.

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440
[Amit Varma]: Great.

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.440
[Amit Varma]: So let's take a quick commercial break.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.960
[Amit Varma]: And on the other side of the break, we'll talk about means and ends, Gandhiji, forest

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:47.360
[Amit Varma]: rights and the importance of GPS.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.000
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog, India Uncut,

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.960
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:05.000
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.920
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.160
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:17.200
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons, and now it is time to revive it.

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.960
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:26.080
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.600

[Amit Varma]: So subscribe now for free.

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:51.480
[Amit Varma]: The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com.

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.480
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.280
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with my good friend, Varun Mitra about his life, his learnings and so on and

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.760
[Amit Varma]: so forth.

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:07.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, there's this book I read by Arnab Kling called The Three Languages of Politics.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:11.640
[Amit Varma]: And Kling's central premise there is that many of us when we discuss politics, we are

01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:14.400
[Amit Varma]: not talking to each other, we are talking past each other.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.040
[Amit Varma]: Like for example, he talks about how all three tribes and he's speaking of the three American

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.040
[Amit Varma]: tribes.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.280
[Amit Varma]: I'll start from different first principles.

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.920
[Amit Varma]: So for example, a libertarian will value freedom, a conservative will value tradition, and a

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.840
[Amit Varma]: more left liberal orientation will value equality.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.400
[Amit Varma]: And the point is, every argument then becomes a question of talking past each other.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.240
[Amit Varma]: Because both can be equally coherent and equally persuasive, but they're coming from different

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.380
[Amit Varma]: first principles, and they're not taking the other one into account.

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:49.560
[Amit Varma]: So one of the great lessons of that, therefore, is when we talk to other people, rather than

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.680
[Amit Varma]: talk from our own point of view that I am communicating what I know to be right, we

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:59.400
[Amit Varma]: have to understand where they are coming from and talk to them at that level, and so on

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.480
[Amit Varma]: and so forth, get into that kind of dialogue, which is something that increasingly you have

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.400
[Amit Varma]: also tried to do over the years.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:11.960
[Amit Varma]: Now what we see today on social media is that people harden themselves into firm positions

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:16.920
[Amit Varma]: like it's very intoxicating when you're young, you get on social media, you want to belong

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:20.520
[Amit Varma]: and you want to feel respected and you want to feel right.

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:27.120
[Amit Varma]: And so you join these little tribes, whatever they are, the bhakts, the voks, whatever.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.040
[Amit Varma]: And then within that tribe, then you constantly want to raise your status within that tribe.

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.560
[Amit Varma]: And the only way of doing that is number one, of course, you follow the party line and the

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.520
[Amit Varma]: dogmas at all points in time.

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.440
[Amit Varma]: But you also do it by attacking people on the other side, never addressing the argument,

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:46.160
[Amit Varma]: never getting into a dialogue, just insults and quote tweets and snark.

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:51.680
[Amit Varma]: And you also shit on people on your own side for failing purity tests within the tribe.

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:54.360
[Amit Varma]: And everyone gets hardened into position.

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Like I was discussing this with Abhinandan as well, that, you know, he and I are the

01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.000
[Amit Varma]: same age 47 and when we were 20, you know, we thought ridiculous things.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.200
[Amit Varma]: If he would have tweeted then we might well have felt committed to those positions and

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.040
[Amit Varma]: become that kind of person who thought that kind of thing.

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Instead of gradually having dialogues with people and learning from them and so on and

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:16.560
[Amit Varma]: so forth.

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:17.680
[Amit Varma]: What do you feel about this?

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:21.880
[Amit Varma]: Because in a sense, over the last five or six years, whatever conversations you and

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:27.680
[Amit Varma]: I have had, the one thread that I feel I can learn a lot from, from you, from the way that

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:32.200
[Amit Varma]: you think about it, is the importance of just dialogue, reaching out.

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.520
[Amit Varma]: The person who does not agree with you is not your enemy.

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:36.520
[Amit Varma]: She is not a bad person.

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.120
[Amit Varma]: You got to reach out, you got to sit down, you got to talk.

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:43.200
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about, you know, your thinking on this, how it's evolved and, you

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:48.240
[Amit Varma]: know, what to you is a way forward in these deeply polarized times at building bridges?

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:54.920
[Guest]: Yeah, again, like I said, you know, that this, this, I mean, I read Arnold Kling and I would

01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:01.320
[Guest]: say it's, it's a, it's a very common feature these days.

01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:11.360
[Guest]: And not just these days, for the last 10-15 years, that ideas become ideologies and ideologies

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.080
[Guest]: become identities.

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:22.120
[Guest]: And therefore, our questioning, if somebody questions my ideas, I can perhaps take it

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.000
[Guest]: to a little extent.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.240
[Guest]: If somebody questions my ideology, I become harder.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.920
[Guest]: And if it threatens my identity, it's impossible.

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's impossible.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.560
[Amit Varma]: And because one becomes the other, anyone who questions your ideas is almost, it's a

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.560
[Guest]: personal threat.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.280
[Guest]: Because ideas, you know, as long as it's abstract, you'd hold it, you know, like you'll be able

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:48.200
[Guest]: to tolerate a slight variation.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.360
[Guest]: Once it becomes ideology, which is almost like belief, these are your core principles,

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:57.620
[Guest]: as you, as one would say, then it's related, you're relating to its identity.

01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:01.400
[Guest]: And which is where, you know, which is where I think another thing, I'm probably rephrasing,

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:09.960
[Guest]: rephrasing Gandhi, that, that your political opponents are not enemies to be vanquished,

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.880
[Guest]: but critics or friends to be won over.

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:19.160
[Guest]: And that, and which he wrote even in his last days, that, that burned down everything that

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:21.160
[Guest]: I have written.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:26.320
[Guest]: If you want to really know what's my position on a particular thing, only read, if you want,

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.600
[Guest]: the latest thing, otherwise just look at my life.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:36.400
[Guest]: That you know, that a person who can change, and this is what ideology does, ideology,

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:43.720
[Guest]: once it gets linked to identity, it makes us, makes us blind.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:48.560
[Guest]: Because then anything that changes, if we change, like say, if we have a different perspective

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:52.040
[Guest]: from what we had five years or 10 years ago, then it's a threat.

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.440
[Guest]: We will not even acknowledge it.

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.440
[Guest]: And I think this is a struggle.

01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.440
[Guest]: I mean, all of us have gone through it.

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:04.360
[Guest]: I mean, and perhaps because I'm in, perhaps because of the context in which we all of

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:10.180
[Guest]: us are in terms of the polarization and the divisions, I mean, and because of my kind

01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:16.400
[Guest]: of instinctive, this thing that can we reconcile the so-called irreconcilable, you know, for

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.960
[Guest]: instance, economics and environment.

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:22.920
[Guest]: Can economic growth be reconciled with environmental cleanliness?

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:23.920
[Amit Varma]: And it actually is.

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:24.920
[Guest]: And it actually is.

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:27.320
[Guest]: And therefore, can I reconcile these differences?

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.520
[Guest]: And in that, from all in the last 20 years, what I've been seeing, the only instances

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:38.320
[Guest]: that I can think of, or have experienced, or have read, are of people who reached out.

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:41.160
[Guest]: That the connection was people first.

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:46.520
[Guest]: The second was, you know, then we can accept the ideological or intellectual differences

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:49.160
[Guest]: as something we can take in our strides.

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.160
[Guest]: Because we know.

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.720
[Guest]: And this we have seen.

01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:58.000
[Guest]: For instance, you know, we have seen in so many cases that once we establish that relationship

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.160
[Guest]: and this I particularly saw in Sharad Joshi's case as a personal experience, that I used

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:10.400
[Guest]: to wonder, because that was in the early, late 90s, early 2000s, that how has he collected

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.040
[Guest]: this motley group of farmers leaders, many of whom were not as intellectually pure as

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.840
[Guest]: I would like them to be.

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.400
[Guest]: And they were not even as pure as Sharad Joshi was.

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:26.000
[Guest]: But they worshipped Sharad Joshi.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.680
[Guest]: That's the connection.

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:34.040
[Guest]: That once you build the personal bond, you will be enormously flexible in terms of to

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:42.840
[Guest]: what extent you are going to be able to reconcile the intellectual or the policy differences

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:43.840
[Guest]: that one may have.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:47.240
[Guest]: Because that can come over time, over experience, etc, etc.

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.720
[Guest]: But the first thing is, you know, what you said at the beginning, like my teacher in

01:48:51.720 --> 01:49:00.640
[Guest]: my primary school in MP had, that she wanted to connect with me because I was an outsider,

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.360
[Guest]: because I came with so much handicap, no language, no local language.

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:17.920
[Guest]: You know that, that if we can build that into us, then we will be able to face this challenge

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:19.360
[Guest]: that we face today.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:27.200
[Guest]: Because this challenge is particularly getting exaggerated by the technology and the systems

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.880
[Guest]: that we are currently adopting.

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.600
[Guest]: It is suicidal that we have to connect and which is why going back to the people is so

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.600
[Guest]: critical.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:40.440
[Guest]: So, it seems that today with the technology, we could reach out to millions, perhaps your

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:46.320
[Guest]: podcast reaches out to millions and there are many programs, people who are reaching

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.560
[Guest]: out to millions.

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:53.920
[Guest]: But it's not helping in building a community in any meaningful sense.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:50:00.840
[Guest]: It's only at best, it's building an intellectual community and therefore, it's not being able

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:09.520
[Guest]: to bridge this or not bridge it, it's not being able to break this bond between identity

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.520
[Guest]: and ideology.

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.360
[Guest]: We need to figure out how to do that and I think the only way, the only experience, the

01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:20.600
[Guest]: only experience I can think of are from the people like Sharad Joshi or even to an extent

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:24.440
[Guest]: Archbhaini who are actually reaching out to people.

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:29.480
[Guest]: Doesn't matter how many you convince, it's not the conviction that winning over will

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.480
[Guest]: may happen later.

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.400
[Guest]: But if we first build that relationship, the human relationship, because after all, all

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:41.840
[Guest]: of us say that man is a social animal.

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:48.120
[Guest]: But we have transferred that society from the real life to the virtual life, which is

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:53.600
[Guest]: I think part of which is greatly creating this problem and this problem has now been

01:50:53.600 --> 01:51:01.160
[Guest]: kind of is going to get, my fear is that it may get much more serious because now across

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:13.200
[Guest]: the world, as a fallout of the pandemic, we are instilling a sense of fear for the other,

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:20.720
[Guest]: including my immediate neighbor and we are putting in place things which would make freedom

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:28.640
[Guest]: of assembly and association almost impossible.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:35.560
[Guest]: And this is a dream of anyone who is seeking power over others.

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:43.800
[Guest]: Because if people can't come together, can't share, can't experience each other, they are

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:47.120
[Guest]: going to be atomized even further.

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:48.120
[Guest]: Who gains?

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:54.480
[Guest]: Those who have certain degree of ability to control at least their network.

01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:57.480
[Guest]: And if they are dominant, there is no way to break it.

01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:02.040
[Guest]: So I think it is, and this is global, this has nothing to do with India or anything else.

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:03.760
[Guest]: This is a universal phenomenon.

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:07.360
[Guest]: To me, it's amazing, isn't it amazing?

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:14.200
[Guest]: Because 91 was India's liberalization, 90 was the collapse of the Soviet Union, 89 was

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:17.240
[Guest]: the Tiananmen Square in China.

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:25.960
[Guest]: From that to today, it seems it's the Chinese approach or policy or politics that have won

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:26.960
[Guest]: the world.

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:30.760
[Guest]: Whereas it was supposed to be the other way around.

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:35.680
[Guest]: You know, 89, the collapse of the Berlin Wall and all the rest, I mean, it was a sign that

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.920
[Guest]: the world is changing.

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:39.200
[Guest]: 91 followed immediately after.

01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:44.000
[Guest]: You know, so it was while none of us, I know I have been asking people who were involved

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:51.440
[Guest]: in 91 reforms, there's no one who could honestly say that they recognize what could be the

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:58.280
[Guest]: potential of this till about 10 years after 91.

01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:06.160
[Guest]: It is only going into the 2004 election that a political party like Vajpayee claimed India

01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:10.200
[Guest]: shining and tried to claim the legacy of liberalization.

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:14.640
[Guest]: No one since, no one after.

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:19.320
[Guest]: And in this process, in fact, I mean, I'm not so sure because I don't follow technology

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:24.920
[Guest]: as such, but there's something that I've been listening a lot, I mean, you must, I'm sure

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:28.160
[Guest]: you know him, I mean, know of him at least.

01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:29.160
[Guest]: Jonathan Haidt.

01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.400
[Guest]: You know, he is specifying a date, which is amazing, if it's true.

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.600
[Guest]: He is specifying 2014-15 or thereabouts as a turning point.

01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.640
[Guest]: And what's the turning point?

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:45.840
[Guest]: That like buttons on the social media.

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:50.360
[Amit Varma]: I think he talks about 2010-2011, he was a guest on a podcast I produced called Brave

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:55.400
[Amit Varma]: New World, which I linked from the show notes and he did a great episode there, which is

01:53:55.400 --> 01:54:01.200
[Amit Varma]: this quest for validation drives, hardens our position and drives us into these echo

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:05.680
[Amit Varma]: chambers in this much greater way and exacerbates the whole process and the Twitter retweet

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:09.880
[Amit Varma]: and the Facebook like are sort of a critical part of that.

01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:18.500
[Amit Varma]: And a few observations that, one, I think what often happens is that the more solidified

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:24.760
[Amit Varma]: our sense of identity, whether it is identity as something we are born into or whether it

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:29.720
[Amit Varma]: is a tribe we have chosen, the more solidified that sense, the more it separates us from

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:30.720
[Amit Varma]: others.

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:35.160
[Amit Varma]: The more it forces us to think of people in terms of the other.

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:39.000
[Amit Varma]: So you want these to be kind of more fluid.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.480
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, this is actually what I, you know, one of the reasons in my podcast, as

01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.760
[Amit Varma]: you've noticed in my episodes, I will often have this long personal conversation at the

01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:53.000
[Amit Varma]: start before I go on to whatever work I'm discussing is because I want to humanize a

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.320
[Amit Varma]: person because I don't just want it to be about a subject or a theme.

01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:01.940
[Amit Varma]: And when you humanize a person, listeners then become much more receptive.

01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:05.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, they may then disagree with the person, but the person is not an enemy.

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:07.160
[Amit Varma]: The person is not bad.

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:13.200
[Amit Varma]: And I think that openness to ideas and communication is so important and we've kind of lost that

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:19.120
[Amit Varma]: and that other, you know, you use the phrase atomized and one very shallow critique of

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:24.180
[Amit Varma]: say libertarianism, for example, though I no longer use labels or ascribe them to myself,

01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:29.500
[Amit Varma]: but one shallow critique of that kind of classical liberalism slash libertarianism is that thinking

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:32.400
[Amit Varma]: in terms of individuals atomizes you.

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:37.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's actually the other way around, because we are all for voluntary interaction and,

01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, all of that.

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:43.560
[Amit Varma]: So the richness of social interaction is very key to that.

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:48.520
[Amit Varma]: What I would say is the opposite thinking in terms of groups, and not individuals, that

01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:54.480
[Amit Varma]: is what can atomize you in the manner that you sort of described and that can, you know,

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:59.400
[Amit Varma]: instead of letting us express the multitudes that we contain, it will often force us into

01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:04.480
[Amit Varma]: certain other conceptions of ourselves, whether it's a conception of victimhood or a conception

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:10.040
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, intellectual superiority over others or whatever it is.

01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:12.220
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of dangerous.

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:16.720
[Amit Varma]: And you have said that we can fight this.

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:18.160
[Amit Varma]: And I don't know how.

01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm trying to imagine in my head.

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:23.920
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, how can we fight this?

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:31.880
[Guest]: I don't know if fight would be the right word to say this.

01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:32.880
[Amit Varma]: Fight the phenomenon.

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:33.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, the phenomenon.

01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:34.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:39.920
[Guest]: So the, yeah, that's where the problem is, because if the other side is identified, then

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:45.920
[Guest]: of course, you end up more like that you are ending up fighting with the person identity

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:47.640
[Guest]: rather than the ideas.

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:49.160
[Guest]: So that's always a challenge.

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:55.960
[Guest]: But I think to me, from everything that I've seen, experienced, read, tried to understand

01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:02.480
[Guest]: in particularly in the last 10 years, suggests that we have to reconnect.

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:05.880
[Guest]: And the pandemic has only confirmed that, that we have to reconnect, which means we

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.680
[Guest]: have to be physical.

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:18.760
[Guest]: You know, the atomization is not, like you said, it is atomization within the group.

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:24.480
[Guest]: You know, so which means that it is, we think we are being individualistic without realizing

01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:28.720
[Guest]: that we are part of this group, which is actually fueling us to be that kind of an individual.

01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.920
[Guest]: So which means, you know, a person could be like, say, for instance, the hippies of the

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:33.920
[Guest]: past.

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:37.560
[Guest]: They all thought that they were ultra individuals.

01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:40.600
[Guest]: But in a sense, in a way, in another way, looking at it another way, they are part of

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:42.360
[Guest]: a collective.

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.280
[Guest]: That collective had that feature.

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:51.960
[Guest]: So I think we need to figure out how do we, how do we look at and understand atomization

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:57.320
[Guest]: in the context of the invisible collective that we are all forming all around us.

01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:03.520
[Guest]: And those boundaries are becoming, like you said, are becoming solider by the day.

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:14.600
[Guest]: And therefore, I think is, at least personally, as a personal exercise, and perhaps also because

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:20.840
[Guest]: I'm not used to, I didn't get used to the Zoom and the online meetings, conferences,

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:21.840
[Guest]: etc.

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:27.600
[Guest]: Because I want to feel the energy of the people with whom I'm interacting in a group or in

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.600
[Guest]: a meeting.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.800
[Guest]: So it has never worked for me in the last 18 months.

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:36.080
[Guest]: But so that maybe I'm personally biased then.

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:40.360
[Guest]: But my, this thing is that we need to reconnect and reconnect physically.

01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:46.880
[Guest]: We need to reconnect in a manner which we haven't forgotten to do in the last 19, 20

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:50.400
[Guest]: or even 30 years, because with urbanization has come mobility.

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:58.880
[Guest]: With mobility has come a breakdown of a civic community and formation of professional communities

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:03.960
[Guest]: or business communities or things of which are segmented identities.

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:08.240
[Guest]: But not a civic identity, not a community identity, for instance, you know, just think

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.920
[Guest]: and this is something I realized in the last 10, 15 years.

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:19.280
[Guest]: Just think of my father, he was in politics, Bengal was extremely polarized, even at that

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:21.840
[Guest]: time in the 70s.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:27.160
[Guest]: In the 69, I think it was 69 or could have been 67, I don't remember now.

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:31.720
[Guest]: There was an election in Bengal, the Congress lost for the first time.

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:36.720
[Guest]: My father's candidate, I think lost, I don't even remember that because I was probably

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:40.440
[Guest]: you know, 67 or 69.

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:45.400
[Guest]: So the net result was that for the first time there was a coalition government in Bengal.

01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:50.800
[Guest]: But that election night is one of those terrifying moments that I have, that I've lived in

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:51.800
[Guest]: my memory.

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.200
[Guest]: You know, some of the childhood memories, so to say.

01:59:54.200 --> 02:00:02.320
[Guest]: For instance, one that lives is actually, yeah, is we have an old fashioned house, you

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:08.560
[Guest]: know, the traditional conventional house, which is kind of not an apartment, a house

02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:15.840
[Guest]: with big gates or doors, you know, solid wooden doors, which used to look at as a fortress.

02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:20.080
[Guest]: And which would look from inside and from the outside, it would look imposing gate and

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:24.040
[Guest]: imposing wall to block everything out.

02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:29.760
[Guest]: That gate broke down after my father's candidate or the party lost.

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:30.760
[Guest]: The party definitely lost.

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:34.880
[Guest]: I don't know whether, I don't remember whether my father's candidate lost, but the door broke

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:39.880
[Guest]: down because in the celebration that was happening outside, because the other side has won, the

02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:47.480
[Guest]: left has won, there were some who came and rammed a rickshaw or a thela of some kind,

02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:53.200
[Guest]: which virtually ramrod onto our gate and that gate with its iron bars, the wooden gate with

02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.200
[Guest]: its iron bars fell.

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:59.920
[Guest]: You know, we were shocked because, you know, that was one thing that we, that was a symbol

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.040
[Guest]: of our security in our home for, you know, for a child like us, that this is something

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.000
[Guest]: that this is where the home begins and everything is secure.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
[Guest]: That was a shock.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.880
[Guest]: And I have not forgotten that that noise and that it happened.

02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:15.880
[Guest]: And it was, it happened probably at 9.30, 10 o'clock, so relatively late because we

02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:17.480
[Guest]: had all had our dinner and all that.

02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:19.520
[Guest]: So we kind of shook up.

02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:24.840
[Guest]: But my father told me afterwards, much after that, that he could have been killed that

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:26.320
[Guest]: night.

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:34.520
[Guest]: But for the left or the CPM leader who lived just next door, literally assured him that

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.040
[Guest]: nothing will come, no harm will come to you and your family.

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.920
[Guest]: It's incredible.

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.720
[Guest]: Can we think of that today?

02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.760
[Guest]: Can we think of that today?

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.800
[Guest]: You know, here were two people who were, you know, there may have been five years age difference,

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:52.360
[Guest]: he may have been older or younger, whatever.

02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:57.520
[Guest]: They both fought a hard-fought election.

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.880
[Guest]: For the first time, Congress lost Bengal.

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:05.880
[Guest]: Our home was assaulted.

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:10.440
[Guest]: And this man said that nothing will, no harm will come to you.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.440
[Guest]: Can we think of that today?

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.440
[Guest]: Can we think of that?

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.680
[Guest]: Because my father told me he could have been murdered that night, that of course he told

02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:21.000
[Guest]: me 10 years later, that he could have been murdered that night.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.120
[Guest]: And which we can see, this is a common thing happening today.

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:29.360
[Guest]: How has it happened?

02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:35.800
[Guest]: Because their social bond with this neighbor, even for us, you know, I mean, long after

02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:41.760
[Guest]: all this, you know, my father got out of politics and he retired, we were still neighbors.

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:46.400
[Guest]: You know, every time I returned to Calcutta after my college or holidays or whatever,

02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.160
[Guest]: he would sit in his veranda and greet me.

02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:54.160
[Guest]: And sometimes give me something to eat or munch or whatever.

02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:59.600
[Guest]: Whereas in his house, you know, like in Calcutta, that was the fashion, the CPM slogans would

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:01.760
[Guest]: all be written.

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:05.360
[Guest]: And in our house, exactly the opposite.

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:09.920
[Guest]: That's my lived experience.

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:12.360
[Guest]: It's not impossible.

02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:20.400
[Guest]: It's because the two people had their social bonds predating or overcoming their ideology

02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:24.280
[Guest]: and identity.

02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:25.280
[Unknown]: We need to rebuild that.

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:26.280
[Guest]: That can't happen in the digital world.

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:30.760
[Guest]: That can never happen in the digital world, very rarely, I can't say never, very rarely.

02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:31.760
[Guest]: Because we are not meeting people.

02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:36.400
[Guest]: We are only meeting people or coming across people only in the dimension in which we want

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.400
[Guest]: to be.

02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:42.120
[Guest]: Not in the totality of our existence, because economics is not, you know, economics is not

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:49.000
[Guest]: even 5% of our existence or politics or any such, or hobby or any such thing.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.080
[Guest]: These are tiny fractions of our life.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:59.640
[Guest]: So physical meeting, I think, is primary and which is what I think we really must figure

02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.680
[Guest]: out how do we revive.

02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:06.760
[Guest]: You know, like I was just saying before we started, that what about the libraries that

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:07.760
[Guest]: we have?

02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:10.320
[Guest]: There used to be mohalla libraries.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:17.120
[Guest]: The libraries were not just books for information and now we can read on the net or on the computer.

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:21.440
[Guest]: There were also physical spaces for people to meet and chat and discuss things.

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:26.440
[Guest]: You know, they could read newspaper together, they could discuss a policy issue together

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:32.400
[Guest]: and all of us have seen that there is a huge difference when we behave and interact with

02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:39.520
[Guest]: somebody face to face, even when that somebody has a completely different perspective or

02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:45.760
[Guest]: philosophy or ideology or politics than us, which is a complete contrast to how we behave

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:51.360
[Guest]: when we are on the net, you know, in the virtual world.

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:56.080
[Guest]: One because we can hide our identity, so that only adds to the problem.

02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:01.760
[Guest]: But even if we have our identity, because we think that we don't know each other personally

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:08.400
[Guest]: and therefore we can say whatever we want, which we'll never do, you know, in our discussion

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:14.320
[Guest]: at a tea stall that was common and is still common in large parts of India.

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:18.560
[Guest]: We need to revive that because I think intellectually we are driving down a rabbit hole.

02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:22.920
[Amit Varma]: It's called the online disinhibition effect, what you just described and you know, I did

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:28.760
[Amit Varma]: an episode I keep going back to with Anshul Malhotra and I think one of the stories, if

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:32.360
[Amit Varma]: I remember correctly, she told in that and she of course wrote a book on partition and

02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:35.360
[Amit Varma]: people carrying the effects of partition over the other side.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:39.600
[Amit Varma]: And I don't remember whether we spoke about it in the episode or I read it in a book.

02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:45.440
[Amit Varma]: But I remember being struck by this description of a village somewhere in Western Pakistan,

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:49.520
[Amit Varma]: where there were Hindus and Muslims and they used to gather in the evening and listen to

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:54.760
[Amit Varma]: the radio for news in those pre partition days and try to figure out what's happening.

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:56.760
[Amit Varma]: And obviously those social bonds are very strong.

02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:59.480
[Amit Varma]: They're all neighbors, they live together in the same village.

02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:04.840
[Amit Varma]: But over time, as bad news starts coming, those bonds start getting shakier and shakier

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:06.200
[Amit Varma]: and shakier.

02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:13.400
[Amit Varma]: And my sense over a long time is that there is this difference between the abstract and

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:16.160
[Amit Varma]: the concrete and the world that we build in our head.

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:19.560
[Amit Varma]: Some things are abstract and some things are concrete, like Anshul would say that when

02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:24.720
[Amit Varma]: she would meet with families in Pakistan, because of their experiences, they would say,

02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:28.920
[Amit Varma]: Oh, Hindus are like this, Hindus are like that, but you are fine, you are not like that.

02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:33.120
[Amit Varma]: Because she is there in the concrete, they can see the physical person, but they're different.

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:36.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's one of the challenges that online everything becomes abstract.

02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:42.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if I think of all the dangerous things in the world today, they're abstract notions,

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.360
[Amit Varma]: nationalism, patriotism, the other, the purity of our culture, Sanskriti, all of this abstract

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:48.680
[Amit Varma]: shit is a problem.

02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:50.080
[Amit Varma]: It makes us hate each other.

02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:52.000
[Amit Varma]: But in person, we are not like that.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:57.560
[Amit Varma]: Even if you hold a different ideology, even if you hold a different ideology in person,

02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:58.560
[Amit Varma]: it's different.

02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.560
[Amit Varma]: It's not like that at all.

02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:02.840
[Amit Varma]: Like I'm reminded and this is a book I'll send you and you'll enjoy it.

02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:08.600
[Amit Varma]: There's a book called Think Again by Adam Grant, where he talks about how in 1983, this

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:13.160
[Amit Varma]: pianist called Darryl Davis goes to Maryland, and he performs there.

02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And he's an African American musician.

02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And there's a white gentleman in the audience who goes to him after the shows and says,

02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:19.880
[Amit Varma]: I really love that.

02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:20.880
[Amit Varma]: And they chat for a while.

02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:25.840
[Amit Varma]: And it turns out the white gentleman is from the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan, and they meet and

02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:30.760
[Amit Varma]: the white gentleman begins to realize that what he thought of in the abstract is very

02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:34.920
[Amit Varma]: different from what it is in the concrete, that here is this African American gentleman

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:39.640
[Amit Varma]: who's warm, cultured, intelligent, someone who can be a friend and they become friends.

02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:40.640
[Amit Varma]: And he leaves the KKK.

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:45.480
[Amit Varma]: But what he also does is over a period of time, he brings other members of the KKK to

02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:50.040
[Amit Varma]: see this performance by Darryl, and they become friends and some of them are senior people,

02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:51.280
[Amit Varma]: and they all leave.

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:54.360
[Amit Varma]: And it's like the collision of the concrete and the abstract.

02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:58.560
[Amit Varma]: And when I read this, I was wondering that in the modern world, how do we do this?

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:03.720
[Amit Varma]: Because one thing that is very real, and that you and I know, and we can say it explicitly

02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:06.800
[Amit Varma]: today, because people are expressing it explicitly today.

02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:11.360
[Amit Varma]: One thing that is very real is this anti-Muslim sentiment among so many Hindus.

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And I believe that at some level, this is abstract, wherever it comes from.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.160
[Amit Varma]: Maybe it comes from memories or stories of partition.

02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:20.480
[Amit Varma]: Maybe it comes from stereotypes of what they are like.

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:25.600
[Amit Varma]: But at some level, this is abstract and concrete encounters can change this.

02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:30.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, if you look at it, you can look at someone like a Modi and say he's an Islamophile,

02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:37.280
[Amit Varma]: because after all, the dress that he wears, the elegant churidhar kurtas are from there.

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:40.920
[Amit Varma]: And the food that we eat, the biryanis that we eat, or really any food, I mean, besides

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:44.520
[Amit Varma]: a baingan, I think basically everything else has come from outside, you know.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:49.280
[Amit Varma]: So to me, this is the puzzle that in this modern world, and something for the listeners

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:52.680
[Amit Varma]: to think about as well, because I don't have an answer.

02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:58.320
[Amit Varma]: But I think part of the solution has to be to help people engage more in the concrete

02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:01.320
[Amit Varma]: world, including with those they hate, and they consider the other.

02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.200
[Amit Varma]: And I think that that's the key.

02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:05.000
[Amit Varma]: And we need to have more of that happening.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.680
[Amit Varma]: And how do we do that?

02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:08.000
[Amit Varma]: And what are your sort of thoughts?

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:14.360
[Guest]: You know, I mean, one thing, I actually experienced it myself twice, I had an opportunity to visit

02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:21.920
[Guest]: Pakistan, and 10 years ago, 11, 12 years ago, I had an opportunity to visit Bangladesh.

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:29.080
[Guest]: It was amazing, the kind of warmth I felt in both places, irrespective of any difference.

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.200
[Guest]: Yet what's our policy?

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:32.200
[Guest]: Seal the borders.

02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:37.040
[Guest]: In fact, this is exactly why we should completely open the borders.

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:41.800
[Guest]: And for both reasons, for strategic reasons, as well as for social reasons.

02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:46.960
[Guest]: Social reasons, we'll build a bond, and for strategic reasons, then we'll have a much

02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:52.480
[Guest]: clearer flow of information to know what's happening and who's planning what.

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.680
[Guest]: Because we will be there and they will be here.

02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:03.120
[Guest]: So everyone, at least those at the decision-making points, would be much more concretely aware

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:10.080
[Guest]: that what is really being planned or proposed as an attack or whatever, and diffuse it much,

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:14.000
[Guest]: much before than otherwise, and there would be no social-political capital to do it.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.880
[Guest]: I mean, there would be social-political capital to diffuse it before, than to raise the social-political

02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:24.080
[Guest]: capital after an incident had happened in order to further the divide.

02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.720
[Guest]: So in both places, I was shocked, you know, because I was really surprised.

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.000
[Guest]: I had heard and read about it, like you read in the book, but I had no experience that,

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.200
[Guest]: you know, I mean, there are people who are Muslims who are my friends, whom I know, so

02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:38.200
[Guest]: I'm not looking at them as others.

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:44.320
[Guest]: But these were countries I went where I hardly knew anybody, you know, I went as a visitor.

02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:48.840
[Guest]: And I knew that I'm from India and I knew that our official relationship may not be

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:50.400
[Guest]: what is desired.

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:56.980
[Guest]: And I met a taxi driver in Bangladesh, in Dhaka, who told me that if we open the border,

02:10:56.980 --> 02:11:05.920
[Guest]: we could easily go and have this custom of, what do they say, pigeon flying.

02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:10.760
[Guest]: Because in that part of Bengal, it seems, there has been a long tradition of pigeon

02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:15.440
[Guest]: being sent from villages hundreds of kilometers away to the other side, and it's a kind

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:17.240
[Guest]: of a race and a social custom.

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:23.080
[Guest]: But today it can't be done, it can't be done properly, because the borders are sealed.

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.040
[Guest]: I was surprised that this guy has a, I mean, I had not even known, you know, I had read

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:31.400
[Guest]: that there used to be post office pigeons and things of that kind, but that's, you

02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:33.360
[Guest]: know, 200 years ago or more.

02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:38.040
[Guest]: But this guy was talking about it now, 10 years ago, that for him, that was a priority,

02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:39.920
[Guest]: that was his kind of interest.

02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:45.600
[Guest]: And if you open the border, he would be able to go easily and have a much freer, open competition

02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:50.000
[Guest]: in pigeon flying among people who have that interest on both sides.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:58.160
[Guest]: You know, so we can't even imagine at what level people are thinking, we can't even

02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:59.160
[Guest]: imagine.

02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:03.840
[Guest]: So this is where it brings us to our perspective of people, you know, which is where the identity,

02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:07.600
[Guest]: population and all this are linked, I believe.

02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:11.680
[Guest]: That how do we look at other people?

02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:16.840
[Guest]: Do we look at them as people or do we look at them only through the lens that we hold,

02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:19.360
[Guest]: because there's no cost attached to it?

02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:22.200
[Guest]: And the digital world has made it that much more easier, there's no cost attached to

02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:23.200
[Guest]: it.

02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:25.200
[Guest]: Physically, we'll never do that.

02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:33.800
[Guest]: So I think, you know, and one would have expected, which is probably one reason, till 1965 war,

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:36.400
[Guest]: the borders with Pakistan were open, literally.

02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.080
[Guest]: People could come and go as easily as anybody else.

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.680
[Guest]: 1965 changed that.

02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:50.480
[Guest]: And since we have only solidified and increased the height and capacity of those walls.

02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:56.480
[Guest]: Yet India had an official policy, which was kind of non-aligned, kind of tilted to the

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.680
[Guest]: Soviet, etc. as a kind of a geostrategic balance, whereas there were many more Indians who could

02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:05.280
[Guest]: go to US and the Western countries than the Soviet Union.

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:10.720
[Guest]: So what social capital was generated because of that interaction.

02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:16.920
[Guest]: The government of India may have a policy tilting towards whatever, but given a choice,

02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:21.360
[Guest]: most Indian students would prefer to go to the English-speaking world of the West than

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:24.640
[Guest]: to the Soviet Union of that era, right?

02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:27.840
[Guest]: Yeah, irrespective of the policy.

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:33.440
[Guest]: Today, we have actually played up this divide.

02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:35.240
[Guest]: And which is why I think we have to begin at home.

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:41.320
[Guest]: Every one of us have to figure out how do we interact with people physically in our

02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:47.080
[Guest]: own spaces, in our neighborhood, in our markets, with our thelawalas, you know, whoever.

02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:48.080
[Guest]: We need to relearn it.

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:49.080
[Guest]: We have forgotten.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:50.080
[Guest]: We need to relearn.

02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:51.080
[Guest]: There's no other way.

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:53.000
[Guest]: There's no other way.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:14:00.560
[Guest]: We cannot assume, we cannot give this blank space or the blank slate or believe that the

02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:06.920
[Guest]: digital technology with its capacity to reach out can help.

02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:10.760
[Guest]: Perhaps the algorithms, perhaps whatever it is, it's definitely not helping.

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:14.840
[Guest]: Like Hyde said, the likes button and the retweet buttons are making things different because

02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:17.040
[Guest]: we are looking at those counters.

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:21.400
[Guest]: We are not building the relationship, which is why we must, we must, and if you remember

02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:27.480
[Guest]: the Deolali meeting, that was one such attempt that urban and rural India, at least some

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:33.880
[Guest]: people, even a fraction of them, could come together to understand what's the perspective

02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.080
[Guest]: and who's coming from where.

02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:39.700
[Guest]: We don't have to win over anybody overnight.

02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:45.400
[Guest]: But we can win that trust, we can win, have that inner confidence that the other person

02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:49.520
[Guest]: is not there to be at my throat.

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:52.520
[Guest]: And then, of course, we can discuss all the other issues, for instance, you know, all

02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:55.000
[Guest]: the talk about farmers getting subsidized.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
[Guest]: It's actually the other way around.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
[Guest]: It's been so all these years.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:07.560
[Guest]: It's the farmers who are subsidizing the rest of the population, forget about the transfers.

02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:15.520
[Guest]: It is the rural sector, society and economy that is upholding 50% of the population.

02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:16.920
[Guest]: Who is subsidizing whom?

02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.040
[Guest]: 50% of the population is being subsidized by 15% of the GDP.

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:26.080
[Guest]: It's the, you know, it's the, what should I say, it's the broad shoulders of these farmers

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:29.880
[Guest]: who are holding 50% of India's population alive, keeping them alive.

02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.240
[Amit Varma]: Who's subsidizing whom?

02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:37.100
[Amit Varma]: I love this concept of Sharad Joshi ji called negative subsidy to find out what negative

02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:38.100
[Amit Varma]: subsidy means.

02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:43.400
[Amit Varma]: Listen to episode 86 of my show, you know, and I'd also say that there is in me the hope

02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:47.800
[Amit Varma]: that while okay, some of these problems are created by technology, but at the same time,

02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:50.520
[Amit Varma]: I think technology is a huge net positive.

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:51.960
[Amit Varma]: Maybe the way forward lies out of this.

02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:55.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, people are listening to you and me have this conversation because

02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:58.040
[Amit Varma]: of this technology and because of the internet.

02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:01.720
[Amit Varma]: So maybe there's some hope there and I share your experience of Pakistan in the sense I

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:04.600
[Amit Varma]: went there with India's cricket tour in 2006.

02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:09.400
[Amit Varma]: And I remember we landed up in Lahore and we had to buy some basic groceries and pencil

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:10.400
[Amit Varma]: cells and all that.

02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:12.140
[Amit Varma]: And we went to this nearby store.

02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:15.520
[Amit Varma]: And the moment the person realized that we are from India just refused to take money.

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:16.960
[Amit Varma]: And this is almost a cliche.

02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:23.360
[Amit Varma]: We thought of it as a cliche we've heard about and we saw it on that first day and again

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:25.740
[Amit Varma]: and again and again all through Pakistan.

02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And I remember being in Lahore and thinking that one, it's such a beautifully lit city

02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:31.480
[Amit Varma]: at night.

02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:35.080
[Amit Varma]: And I remember that the way it's lit up and Indian cities often aren't like that.

02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:40.200
[Amit Varma]: But I also remember how much it is like Delhi, you know, Lahore and Delhi are so much closer

02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:45.200
[Amit Varma]: together than say Delhi and Chennai, which could be separate countries, right?

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:47.640
[Amit Varma]: Again, it's a cliche Karachi being like Bombay.

02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:51.320
[Amit Varma]: But when I was in Karachi, it did kind of feel that way.

02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:55.020
[Amit Varma]: And that sense is there among the people like, you know, my friend Pranay Kottasane uses

02:16:55.020 --> 02:16:59.180
[Amit Varma]: the phrase, the military jihadi complex for the Pakistani state.

02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:03.220
[Amit Varma]: And the important thing to remember is that the Pakistani state or this military jihadi

02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:06.000
[Amit Varma]: complex is different from the Pakistani people.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And the Pakistani people are exactly like us, exactly like us, right?

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:14.040
[Amit Varma]: The difference is so minor that you know, the differences between Indian states is far

02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:15.040
[Amit Varma]: more.

02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:18.720
[Amit Varma]: And so I completely agree that, you know, people to people contact these kind of interactions

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:20.920
[Amit Varma]: are just a huge deal.

02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:26.840
[Amit Varma]: And which is why so many of these policies like we, you know, the military, the Pakistani

02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:31.000
[Amit Varma]: state and civil society are different things, they're at opposite ends.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.640
[Amit Varma]: And we think that when we stop, say, Pakistani cricketers from playing in the IPL, we think

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:39.720
[Amit Varma]: we are hitting out against the state, but actually we are helping the state, we're hitting

02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:41.280
[Guest]: out against civil society.

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:42.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:43.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:44.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:45.280
[Amit Varma]: And that just kind of...

02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:51.200
[Guest]: We know technology can surely help, but technology can help only if we have a perspective to

02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:54.600
[Guest]: use the technology in that manner.

02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:58.760
[Guest]: Maybe it's in the initial phase of technology, these were all new technologies, etc.

02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:02.600
[Guest]: I remember I come from a generation where we didn't have emails and how the emails came,

02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:08.520
[Guest]: I distinctly remember in the late, in the early 90s, how we had these, you know, yeah,

02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:12.960
[Guest]: kind of servers where we could have access only once or twice in a day at night to be

02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:17.480
[Guest]: able to connect to the, you know, to the telephone lines that we had, and all that.

02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:22.560
[Guest]: So technology can surely help and we have all seen and I'm sure you have too, that how

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:29.120
[Guest]: when the emails first came, groups were formed on the email groups, e-groups, and how they

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.800
[Guest]: used to be outbursts, you know, I mean, quite frequent outbursts among people who didn't

02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:34.800
[Amit Varma]: know...

02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:37.040
[Guest]: You and I have been in groups, yeah, like that, yeah.

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:41.760
[Guest]: But they were kind of limited because those groups could only reach up to, you know, a

02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:44.920
[Guest]: certain number 100, 200, whatever.

02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:49.080
[Guest]: But now it's completely public.

02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:52.880
[Guest]: And we are now fixed, you know, this is where, this is where it reminds me of Gandhi's that

02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:56.720
[Guest]: this thing, you know, that burned down everything that he's written.

02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:59.200
[Guest]: Forget what he has said in the past.

02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:03.160
[Guest]: If you want to find any meaning, think of what he has said on that issue in his latest

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.160
[Guest]: this thing.

02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:05.160
[Guest]: Because he's evolving.

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:06.160
[Guest]: He's not ashamed of change.

02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:07.160
[Guest]: Today, we are ashamed.

02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:09.080
[Amit Varma]: We are afraid of change, not even ashamed.

02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:11.360
[Guest]: That we will be accused of being hypocrites.

02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:12.360
[Guest]: Correct.

02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:14.880
[Guest]: Whereas that's what is growth all about.

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:19.000
[Guest]: Every day a tree is changing, you know, a tree is growing, new leaves are coming.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000
[Guest]: Old leaves are falling.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:28.800
[Guest]: So if we can't change, because we realize that that's necessary, that is what we, I

02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:29.800
[Guest]: mean, life is about change.

02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:31.800
[Guest]: So what are we afraid of?

02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:33.280
[Guest]: So it's not just shame.

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:34.520
[Guest]: I think it's a fear.

02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:42.080
[Guest]: To me, it's this fear because we lack fear because we lack that confidence in ourselves.

02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.360
[Guest]: Which to me, I think I was fortunate.

02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:44.360
[Guest]: I was really fortunate.

02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:47.560
[Guest]: This is the only thing I think I was lucky apart, you know, I don't think there was anything

02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:50.320
[Guest]: particular about my family or anything else.

02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:52.720
[Guest]: Many people have gone through exactly the same experience.

02:19:52.720 --> 02:20:01.200
[Guest]: The only difference was, as I see it, that I dabbled and ventured into domains that I

02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:05.280
[Guest]: had no particular expertise.

02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:07.440
[Guest]: I had no expertise.

02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:12.320
[Guest]: And therefore, I could ask that why couldn't there be more tigers as there were more chickens?

02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:15.880
[Amit Varma]: And that's a feature, not a bug, because no expertise means no dogmas either.

02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:16.880
[Guest]: Yeah, correct.

02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:17.880
[Guest]: No baggage.

02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:18.880
[Guest]: No baggage.

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:19.880
[Guest]: No intellectual baggage.

02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:20.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:21.880
[Guest]: We can ask.

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:22.880
[Guest]: We can be wrong.

02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:24.360
[Guest]: All species don't breed the same way.

02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:28.920
[Guest]: So all species may not be, it may not be possible to do it in the same way.

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:31.360
[Guest]: But it's like all trees don't grow the same way.

02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:35.160
[Guest]: All trees grow in different seasons, the flower in different seasons, crops are grown as per

02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:36.160
[Guest]: the season.

02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:37.160
[Guest]: So there's nothing extraordinary about it.

02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:39.440
[Guest]: So you've got to tell it to it.

02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:42.080
[Guest]: And which is what is the difference, as you said earlier, between the abstract and the

02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:43.080
[Guest]: concrete?

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:48.520
[Guest]: The concrete is always limited.

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:51.720
[Guest]: Abstraction is, you know, the sky is the limit.

02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:53.400
[Guest]: It's our imagination.

02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:58.240
[Guest]: The challenge I think is, and to me this is a beauty, to me, I really enjoy this, that

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:07.240
[Guest]: how do I reconcile the limitations of the concrete that I face today to the abstractions

02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:10.120
[Guest]: of my imagination that I would like to go tomorrow?

02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:11.120
[Guest]: How do I reconcile?

02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:15.440
[Guest]: I'm always thinking that how do I reconcile the two?

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:16.440
[Guest]: Because I like both.

02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:20.960
[Guest]: You know, I like the imagination, the abstract part of it, I like the concrete part of it,

02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:23.920
[Guest]: because that's the real world and that's probably my engineering and my, you know, like kind

02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:25.240
[Guest]: of concrete details.

02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:27.560
[Guest]: So how do I reconcile?

02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:34.640
[Guest]: And then I realized something, you know, that what's the difference between, in fact, just

02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:38.720
[Guest]: the other day I was talking to another friend, another old friend from our old Ayn Rand groups

02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:46.480
[Guest]: who just retired from IIT Delhi, that it's very customary or quite fashionable these

02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:53.320
[Guest]: days to say that Newton's laws have been overcome or Einstein proved their limitation and gone

02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:54.320
[Guest]: beyond.

02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:56.240
[Guest]: But has they?

02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:57.240
[Guest]: What is progress?

02:21:57.240 --> 02:22:02.160
[Guest]: You know, as Newton himself would say that he stood on the shoulders of giants and so

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:05.320
[Guest]: the current and the later generation stood on the shoulders of Newton and people like

02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:07.960
[Guest]: him at that time.

02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:10.360
[Guest]: Newton's laws are abstractions.

02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:18.000
[Guest]: There can't be an abstraction that is in concrete, because then there is no difference between

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:19.480
[Guest]: abstraction and concrete.

02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:24.920
[Guest]: He has idealized the concrete into the form of an abstraction and demonstrated it through

02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:27.280
[Guest]: the equation and through all the rest.

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:32.320
[Guest]: So the Newton's laws will continue to hold, irrespective of what the concrete is, but

02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:37.360
[Guest]: because the Newton's law is not explaining all the concretes, people will find different

02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:43.920
[Guest]: ways to figure out how to explain the new concrete or the new understanding of the concrete.

02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:48.920
[Guest]: The material sciences are changing, the electromagnetism, Einstein and all that is the quantum physics,

02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:54.680
[Guest]: they will try to explain it in somewhat a little better.

02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:59.160
[Guest]: So this gap between abstraction, you know, perhaps because I came from the physical sciences,

02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:03.480
[Guest]: this kind of interested me, that how do I understand this gap between what we call the

02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:09.880
[Guest]: laws or the principles of physics with actual engineering, which I did, because there was

02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:10.880
[Guest]: a huge gap.

02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:15.800
[Guest]: There is nothing in engineering that I can apply, where I can apply the laws of physics,

02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:20.840
[Guest]: none of the laws, because there will be efficiency losses, there are efficiency losses because

02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:24.640
[Guest]: of technological limitation, there are efficiency losses because of economic limitation, there

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:28.600
[Guest]: are efficiency losses because of lack of social awareness about that.

02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:32.840
[Guest]: Environment being a very good example, that people are more aware about environment so

02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:35.960
[Guest]: they are willing to put in more resources to figure out how to do it and they were trying

02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:39.960
[Guest]: to solve it, which wouldn't have been the case 10, 15, 20 years ago.

02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:48.720
[Guest]: Yeah, so to me, you know, to pit the two as two poles, I think is completely futile, completely

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:53.760
[Guest]: futile and which is which is something I realized, you know, something you mentioned earlier,

02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:54.760
[Unknown]: engineering mindset.

02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:55.760
[Guest]: Hike.

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:56.760
[Guest]: Yeah, that's hike.

02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:03.280
[Guest]: I, this is the thing that I really find myself lucky that I didn't fall into the dogmatic

02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:10.120
[Guest]: trap because I didn't come from any domain expertise and I read that essay of Hike, the

02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:16.840
[Guest]: knowledge one, where he actually identifies this problem as an engineering mindset and

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:18.960
[Guest]: everything else seems to follow.

02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:23.960
[Guest]: That I can solve the problem and therefore the other person becomes a jigsaw puzzle whom

02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:28.200
[Guest]: I can put wherever I want in order to solve the problem.

02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:31.720
[Guest]: And I don't, I'm not looking at the other person as an equal at all.

02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:35.080
[Amit Varma]: I link this essay of Hike, which is called the use of knowledge and society from the

02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:40.520
[Amit Varma]: show notes, which is just the greatest essay of the 20th century and so important, so fundamental.

02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.840
[Amit Varma]: So please read it.

02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:43.700
[Amit Varma]: But I'm going to read out something else now.

02:24:43.700 --> 02:24:47.260
[Amit Varma]: And this is sparked by, you know, I have this weird tendency that sometimes someone is speaking

02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:50.960
[Amit Varma]: to me and I'll think to myself that, wow, what a beautiful sentence.

02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:55.120
[Amit Varma]: And a little while back, you said that every day a tree is changing and it's such a lovely

02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:59.520
[Amit Varma]: sentence and it reminded me of this poem by Philip Larkin called The Trees.

02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:01.080
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just read that out for my listeners.

02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:02.080
[Guest]: Have you read it?

02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:03.840
[Amit Varma]: I think I have, but I don't remember it now.

02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:05.120
[Amit Varma]: I'll read it out.

02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:06.840
[Amit Varma]: The trees by Philip Larkin.

02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:10.120
[Amit Varma]: The trees are coming into leaf, like something almost being said.

02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:13.820
[Amit Varma]: The recent buds relax and spread, their greenness is a kind of grief.

02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:15.720
[Amit Varma]: Is it that they are born again and we grow old?

02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:17.000
[Amit Varma]: No, they die too.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.160
[Amit Varma]: Their yearly trick of looking new is written down in rings of grain.

02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.680
[Amit Varma]: And still the unresting castles thresh in full-grown thickness every May.

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:30.200
[Amit Varma]: Last year is dead, they seem to say, begin afresh, afresh, afresh.

02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:33.320
[Amit Varma]: And I love the phrase in this, like something almost being said, you know, trees coming

02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:36.160
[Amit Varma]: into leaf, just very beautiful.

02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:44.680
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to what you and I have spoken a lot about and argued about, which is Gandhi.

02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:45.680
[Amit Varma]: I find him fascinating.

02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:49.640
[Amit Varma]: I, you know, I did a two episode special on Gandhi with Ramchandra Guha.

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I've just read a bunch of books.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.960
[Amit Varma]: You can't read all his collected writings because there are a hundred volumes.

02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:56.400
[Amit Varma]: So they are all online.

02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:59.600
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, one should dip into them from time to time.

02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Just a fascinating, incredible man, one of those great figures of history and one who

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.280
[Amit Varma]: also contained multitudes.

02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:10.200
[Amit Varma]: And I don't want to go into detail with all my criticisms of him or all my praise for

02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:11.400
[Amit Varma]: him or whatever.

02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:15.800
[Amit Varma]: But over the years, increasingly, I find you talking more and more of Gandhi and what you

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:17.280
[Amit Varma]: have learned from him and so on.

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:23.960
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your perception of Gandhi, like, you know, when we grow up

02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:29.400
[Amit Varma]: in India, there's always this notion, you know, it's always Mahatma Gandhi, not Mohandas

02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Karamchand Gandhi.

02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:34.960
[Amit Varma]: The Mohandas to me is as interesting as Mahatma, but it's always Mahatma Gandhi.

02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:39.720
[Amit Varma]: And there's always that iconic figure of that old man wearing just one piece of cloth and

02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:41.600
[Amit Varma]: all of that in his old age.

02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:46.320
[Amit Varma]: But you read more about him and it becomes kind of richer and richer and you see the

02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:49.000
[Amit Varma]: limitations and you see the greatness.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.120
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about your love affair, as it were, with.

02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:59.120
[Guest]: Yeah, because as an engineer, perhaps at the back of my mind, I was looking for practical

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:04.360
[Guest]: ways to go beyond the intellectualization that I had been trapped into or had opted

02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:08.720
[Guest]: for for the first 25 years of my life.

02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:12.760
[Guest]: I mean, of the policy activism, advocacy, etc.

02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.640
[Guest]: And there's so limited, so few successes that I can count on.

02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:22.240
[Guest]: Not just successes because of me, but any kind of success.

02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:30.080
[Guest]: So my thing was that, how do we look at politics?

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:38.600
[Guest]: Because we particularly, I mean, perhaps more in your generation perhaps than mine, because

02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:42.560
[Guest]: I grew up during emergency, there was still an idealism about politics and change and

02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:45.320
[Guest]: the possibilities of politics.

02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.200
[Guest]: And that has clearly evaporated, like my own family experience shows from my father's experience

02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.600
[Guest]: in the late 60s.

02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:53.440
[Guest]: So that has clearly evaporated.

02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:57.840
[Guest]: Now, therefore, the question is, what is politics?

02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:07.320
[Guest]: Is it about politicizing an issue and therefore an instrument to go to battle with the other?

02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:15.120
[Guest]: Or is the essence of politics precisely as a platform to reconcile the differences that

02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.200
[Guest]: might arise in society?

02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:21.840
[Guest]: And therefore, if you look at it this way, then you find that the politics is starting

02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:24.480
[Guest]: from everyone's home.

02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:30.520
[Guest]: Every family has to kind of politically decide what's the priority to be given.

02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:34.840
[Guest]: Should you go for a movie to celebrate a birthday or should you have a pizza to celebrate a

02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:35.840
[Guest]: birthday?

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:40.080
[Guest]: You know, we are constantly negotiating and figuring out how to balance.

02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:41.080
[Guest]: That's politics.

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:44.600
[Guest]: That's the purpose of politics, right?

02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:51.080
[Guest]: And that kind of, you know, one kind of a breakthrough for me was when Gandhi in his

02:28:51.080 --> 02:29:05.280
[Guest]: autobiography talks of politics as his way to moksha, to meet his maker, which, you know,

02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:12.840
[Guest]: that means he was idealizing it to his conception of an ideal to the ultimate extent possible.

02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:17.360
[Guest]: That here was a practical man, you know, a completely down-to-earth man.

02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:19.120
[Guest]: He was not a theoretician.

02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:22.360
[Guest]: He hadn't written any of the books on philosophy as such.

02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:26.880
[Guest]: All of his letters and things were all on practical issues that he was grappling with,

02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.080
[Guest]: with all their complexities.

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:39.280
[Guest]: Yet he was projecting or aspiring to try to have a kind of politics that would reconcile,

02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:44.760
[Guest]: that is, go back to politics to its essence, to its original.

02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:49.120
[Guest]: That is, politics is a platform to reconcile differences, not to flag it.

02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:53.520
[Guest]: Because if you flag it, then it is, you know, like we have another saying that war is politics

02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:55.720
[Guest]: by another means.

02:29:55.720 --> 02:30:00.160
[Guest]: So we are at it now, virtually or literally.

02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:04.640
[Guest]: Therefore, to me, that was kind of reignited and which actually made me think about my

02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:07.640
[Guest]: father's experience, that he could have been killed.

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:11.400
[Guest]: You know, I hadn't thought about this in the 20 years since he told me.

02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:16.400
[Guest]: He is dead now almost 10 years.

02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:24.960
[Guest]: But it has come back in my mind because of this, that that is what politics was.

02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:33.320
[Guest]: So Gandhi underscored the relevance of politics in a manner I believe no one else has.

02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:39.640
[Guest]: No one else of the contemporaries or of the last century had put into practice a kind

02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:45.400
[Guest]: of politics that was incredible and he could do it because he could connect.

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:50.480
[Guest]: And he figured out how do I connect to me and which is what, you know, which kind of

02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:55.240
[Guest]: and the other thing that kind of brought me to it is because another one whom I probably

02:30:55.240 --> 02:31:00.840
[Guest]: not talked of as much, but whom I almost listen every day is Tagore.

02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:05.960
[Guest]: Being a Bengali, Rabindra Sangeet comes naturally to, I don't sing, but I love to listen.

02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:08.240
[Amit Varma]: You look like him also right now with your flowing white beard.

02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:10.640
[Guest]: Yeah, this is probably temporary, but yeah.

02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:20.560
[Guest]: So I found that he was a man, Tagore, who was so far ahead of his time.

02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:26.640
[Guest]: We are still grappling to understand how far he had been able to go.

02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:33.120
[Guest]: And like Atlas Shrug kind of had a major impact in my way of thinking, his novel, apart from

02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:37.280
[Guest]: his poetry, because poetry, it would be all Bengalis, but his novel, which is accessible

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:45.840
[Guest]: to all, one of his novels is perhaps the major political novel or the second one is Gora.

02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:52.440
[Guest]: You know, not the Home and the World, you know, which is well known, but Gora.

02:31:52.440 --> 02:32:01.160
[Guest]: Because it's amazing that what he depicted 125 years ago in that story, in the condition

02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:08.240
[Guest]: in which Bengal at that time in that great foment was, is amazing.

02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:13.920
[Guest]: And how he sought to break out or break down the boundaries.

02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:18.520
[Guest]: And he was trying to do it within his own community, that is the Brahmo, you know, because

02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:22.840
[Guest]: that was another sect he was born into and therefore he was probably much more familiar

02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:23.840
[Guest]: with it.

02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:26.800
[Guest]: He was trying to break it in his own.

02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:33.200
[Guest]: And this I saw reflected in the real, what should I say, discourse between Gandhi and

02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:40.760
[Guest]: Tagore on the issue of that earthquake or on the issue of Charkha and the rest, you

02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:44.080
[Guest]: know, the Swadeshi and yeah.

02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:50.160
[Guest]: That two people were looking at it quite differently, clearly.

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:55.080
[Guest]: I mean, they probably looked at it through their own perspectives, in their own context.

02:32:55.080 --> 02:33:03.840
[Guest]: But what to me was interesting was that that didn't create identities.

02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:08.240
[Guest]: That discourse actually made their bonds even stronger.

02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:16.120
[Guest]: So that when Tagore was nearing the end of his life, he sought to hand over the board

02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:22.280
[Guest]: of Shantiniketan to someone like Gandhi, that you be on the board to continue the legacy.

02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:28.520
[Guest]: This is exactly the same when Subhash Bose, whom we hear so much, Gandhi and Bose, Bose

02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:36.040
[Guest]: named one of his brigades on Gandhi and Nehru.

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:37.360
[Guest]: You know, we hear all the differences.

02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:44.320
[Guest]: This is in the last phase of Bose's life, last two, three years, that it is this man

02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:49.600
[Guest]: who called Gandhi the father of the nation, the Bapu, yeah.

02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:57.040
[Guest]: So we have so much of instances we can pick on to figure out how people are reconciled.

02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:00.120
[Guest]: And they were reconciled not because they had a new realization.

02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:05.440
[Guest]: They were reconciled because they had their bond from before.

02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:09.760
[Guest]: You know, so that relationship ensured that no matter their policy differences, political

02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:17.400
[Guest]: differences, they would still have a lever or a thread to connect.

02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:24.800
[Guest]: Because I can't think how such major differences as we seem to think they are today, were overcome

02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:32.160
[Guest]: so easily, so graciously, so amazingly, as these.

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:36.680
[Guest]: So the differences don't matter if you have the relationship, which is what we need to

02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:37.680
[Guest]: collect.

02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:42.040
[Guest]: Each one of us need to be able to make the relationship with our communities, which was

02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:46.080
[Guest]: a challenge with mobility itself, I mean, which is a challenge every time.

02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:52.960
[Guest]: Ambedkar warned about the problems of community in rural India, I mean, which is precisely

02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:56.680
[Guest]: a very similar kind of a challenge in another way perhaps.

02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:04.360
[Guest]: The same with the complete lack of community in ultra-mobile urban India, where in an apartment

02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:07.640
[Guest]: most neighbours may not know each other.

02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:09.560
[Guest]: So we need to figure out how to break that.

02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:11.000
[Guest]: How do we break that?

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:18.000
[Guest]: Whether technology helps, well, I welcome it, but it has to be technology neutral because

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:21.720
[Guest]: you know, no technology cuts both ways, nuclear energy, nuclear bomb.

02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:25.440
[Guest]: So technology would just be a tool in how we use it, how we think about it.

02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:27.440
[Guest]: We really need to figure out how do we break that.

02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:33.960
[Guest]: So in that sense, Gandhi to me as a practitioner showed me how something that was kind of in

02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:44.440
[Guest]: my mind, I had not kind of thought of it as concrete, made me make that shift.

02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:48.440
[Guest]: I mean, Tagore spoke about it, wrote about it, but those were abstracts, you know, that's

02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:53.560
[Guest]: a novel, after all, it's a novel, but Gandhi put it into practice.

02:35:53.560 --> 02:36:01.920
[Guest]: So I had an aunt who went to Nuwakhali with Gandhi, you know, at the height of all that.

02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:06.480
[Guest]: And I heard the story not from the aunt, but from her husband, who was a doctor, a British

02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:07.480
[Guest]: army doctor.

02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:13.160
[Guest]: He used to tell me that he told only one thing, that death before honour.

02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:18.360
[Guest]: So I had not understood what does it mean, you know, that he would always say that, that

02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:24.120
[Guest]: I told her that death before honour, that you are fine, you are free to go with Gandhi,

02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:31.320
[Guest]: but should any harm come to you, you should opt for death, then your honour.

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:38.040
[Guest]: Now that was a risk, which was obvious risk, which was an enormous risk, that a young girl

02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:44.680
[Guest]: like my aunt at that time in 1946 took, like many others, to be part of Gandhi's journey

02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:46.680
[Guest]: through Manuvakhali.

02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:48.760
[Guest]: Why?

02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:55.840
[Guest]: To be able to rebuild the literal connection, the physical connection, which was getting

02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:01.120
[Guest]: broken by the abstraction of the partition and the borders and the Hindu-Muslim and all

02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:02.120
[Guest]: the rest.

02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:06.920
[Guest]: Which is why, you know, a book that kind of really amazes me and when I read it, it kind

02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.080
[Guest]: of, I mean, still brings tears to my eyes, even though I didn't experience it myself,

02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:16.280
[Guest]: is The Miracle of Calcutta.

02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:20.000
[Guest]: You know, which Gandhi did and people, my grandfather, grandmother, I haven't seen

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:27.200
[Guest]: my grandfather, and my parents, would tell me how parts of Calcutta, including our own

02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:32.320
[Guest]: where we are, had bodies outside on the streets.

02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:37.240
[Guest]: Much more gross than what the Naxalite violence could, you know, because that was just a bullet

02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:40.880
[Guest]: and in some far out forest most of the time or in the prison.

02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:48.480
[Guest]: Most people wouldn't see it, but they saw it and saw the transformation.

02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:55.480
[Guest]: Because Gandhi had built that bond that could connect and therefore people could figure

02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:59.720
[Guest]: out a way to overcome.

02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:01.720
[Guest]: You know, we need to build that bond.

02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:07.520
[Guest]: So we can't expect a Gandhi to save us because Gandhi was not born.

02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:10.800
[Guest]: And even in a literal way, we can't expect a Gandhi to save us.

02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:11.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:12.800
[Guest]: Even in a literal way.

02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:19.320
[Guest]: So we have to figure out how somebody, anyone, any one of us, anybody, what lessons can we

02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:24.600
[Guest]: draw so that we try to avoid some of the horrors that might haunt us again.

02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:26.760
[Guest]: And it's a very realistic horror.

02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:31.920
[Guest]: It's a very realistic horror and because of the technology and the advances, like I think

02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:39.280
[Guest]: you mentioned in one of your episodes sometimes, I think, you know, the Rwanda radios.

02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:45.880
[Guest]: You know, that what kind of horror it was caused 20-30 years ago just by an old technology.

02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:46.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:47.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:48.880
[Guest]: So it can cause...

02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:54.800
[Guest]: So we have to be really, really conscious of the possibilities and therefore the alternative,

02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:57.280
[Guest]: that there is an alternative possible.

02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:02.080
[Guest]: And therefore, and Gandhi showed me this alternative in a concrete sense, in a way which my engineering

02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:09.120
[Guest]: mind could grasp much more concretely than the abstractions that I would have read from

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:13.320
[Guest]: Hayek or Rand or Tagore or anybody else.

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:18.640
[Guest]: So Julian Simon was that, but Julian Simon was concrete in a very narrow sense.

02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:22.320
[Guest]: You know, the environment and the relation to economics, etc.

02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:27.800
[Guest]: But Gandhi was all-encompassing and which is why I don't like to refer to Gandhi as

02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:32.600
[Guest]: the Mahatma or the Bapu or the father of the nation and all that because that only puts

02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:34.080
[Guest]: a distance between us.

02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:36.400
[Guest]: I don't want him to be on a pedestal.

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:41.840
[Guest]: I would not have approached Gandhi in this manner had I looked at him on the pedestal.

02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:49.040
[Guest]: I am looking at him as somebody I can argue, debate with and which I find, you know, which

02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:53.040
[Guest]: you find, not just me, I think everyone finds that when we go back to, you know, which is

02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:58.520
[Guest]: classically true for the epics, the reason epics survive in every culture is because

02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:01.880
[Guest]: they have a new meaning for every generation.

02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:05.280
[Guest]: You know, otherwise there is no reason epics would survive, whether it's Greek ones or

02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:06.280
[Guest]: Indian ones.

02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:10.560
[Guest]: There are books that survive and outlive precisely because of that.

02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:16.000
[Guest]: You know, people reinvent the meanings in it and that's nothing, that's completely

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:21.000
[Guest]: natural because that's part of our growing, part of our, you know, the life is about change.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.360
[Guest]: So those are the ways we change.

02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:29.040
[Guest]: So we read a book and think that's done and dusted, it's not, if it's done and dusted

02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:34.960
[Guest]: then it was not a book that was really worth looking at it or reading it more than once.

02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:39.840
[Guest]: But the books that are ideas that survive are never done and dusted, never done and

02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.080
[Guest]: dusted because you can find new meanings into it, which happens to me whenever I read Gora

02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:50.360
[Guest]: or whenever I read Rana or whenever I read Gandhi, that there's a new angle that I find

02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:53.320
[Guest]: and I look at them precisely because I have no dogma.

02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:55.840
[Guest]: I really don't have any dogma.

02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:02.600
[Guest]: I was not born into a Gandhian belief, like I was not born into a Tagorean belief, although

02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:10.080
[Guest]: partly because Calcutta and Bengal, Tagore is looming large, very large in our cultural

02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:13.000
[Guest]: space or mental space.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:19.200
[Guest]: But it's not because of dogma because I could, you know, I've not spent, since 1976, I've

02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:23.040
[Guest]: not spent perhaps a year at a stretch in Calcutta.

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:27.400
[Guest]: It's been a long time since I left, I passed my high school.

02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:34.720
[Guest]: I've studied outside, I've worked mostly outside, Calcutta has been a home and a visit.

02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:39.520
[Guest]: But I can still relate one, perhaps because the language which I did learn in my primary,

02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:44.760
[Guest]: so that's my mother tongues and I'm really proud that I can read two languages and I

02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:50.000
[Guest]: envy my wife who can manage, who can speak three, four, five languages in that sense

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:56.600
[Guest]: because I think multiple languages give us that extra enrichment, extra words and, you

02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:00.160
[Guest]: know, emotions that you can't connect maybe in one language.

02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:04.760
[Guest]: And this actually, you know, made me think another thing that I recently heard or this

02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:16.960
[Guest]: thing that is there something about monotheism that creates or that facilitates formation

02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:25.480
[Guest]: of identities that much more quickly because it's mono, that is the truth and that is the

02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:30.160
[Guest]: only truth and therefore the identity is there to defend that truth.

02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:32.160
[Guest]: And there is also a book.

02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:33.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:45.800
[Guest]: Whereas the polytheism of Hinduism is probably the reason why I can't think of any past,

02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:54.240
[Guest]: you know, any past war or what should I say, invasion of India where it was primarily because

02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:55.960
[Guest]: of religion.

02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:58.640
[Guest]: Religion came, rode on whatever they rode on.

02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:00.640
[Guest]: It was not religion.

02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:02.640
[Guest]: It was just power.

02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:08.080
[Guest]: Mohammed Ghori was invited into India to defeat another guy who was as Indian as anybody else.

02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:09.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:11.360
[Guest]: So, it was not, it was always power.

02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:16.760
[Guest]: Siraj-ud-Daulah lost the war because somebody else bought somebody else from his side.

02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:22.200
[Guest]: And if you look at it, isn't it amazing that three major, of the four major wars that the

02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:25.560
[Guest]: British fought, you know, the game-changing wars which happened literally in a day and

02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:35.440
[Guest]: changed history, Siraj-ud-Daulah in 1757, Tipu, 1799, 1857.

02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:38.440
[Guest]: In between, there was the Maratha War.

02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:41.440
[Guest]: Who were fighting whom?

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:47.880
[Guest]: You know, the crown didn't have even 100,000, you know, at its peak, the British Empire

02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:53.160
[Guest]: had 1,00,000 Englishmen or British or European in India.

02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:54.160
[Guest]: Who was fighting whom?

02:43:54.160 --> 02:44:02.080
[Guest]: You know, they were all typical political struggles where politics had broken down and

02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:07.840
[Guest]: war was, if politics breaks down, then the war is another form of politics.

02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:17.720
[Guest]: So, we really, I think, I think there is enormous capacity to reimagine because the blinkers

02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:18.720
[Guest]: are our own.

02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:20.720
[Guest]: Blinkers are our own.

02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:29.880
[Guest]: If we can just let our imagination fly, we might go here and there and everywhere, but

02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:33.040
[Guest]: we might find something much more meaningful.

02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:38.240
[Guest]: I think that's why change to me is something that we need to be able to absorb and accept.

02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:43.400
[Guest]: And monotheism, I am very fortunate that we are in a polytheistic society culture where

02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:47.160
[Guest]: truth are numerous from the beginning, from the origin.

02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:55.200
[Guest]: There is no one truth and that's what all the books, the Upanishads and the Gita, that's

02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:56.200
[Guest]: what they do.

02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:00.280
[Guest]: A debate, a constant dialogue to figure out what is the truth, how to get there.

02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:06.000
[Guest]: There is no assurance and the gap that you said earlier, that all the duplicities that

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.760
[Guest]: happen in war, that's the concrete.

02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:14.000
[Guest]: That is exactly the lack of efficiency, the gulf between laws of physics or the principles

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:17.960
[Guest]: of physics and actual application in engineering.

02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:18.960
[Guest]: So I'm not surprised by those gulfs.

02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:23.560
[Guest]: Those gulfs would be inevitably necessary because otherwise there's no way to go because

02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:26.440
[Guest]: you're concrete and otherwise you'll have to say that the concrete and the abstractions

02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:28.640
[Guest]: are the same.

02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:34.400
[Guest]: That can perhaps happen only when we are in that singularity where shunya has the potential

02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:35.400
[Guest]: to be everything.

02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:39.880
[Guest]: So it's a complete abstraction of that kind where the abstraction and the concrete would

02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:41.880
[Guest]: be all merged into one.

02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:45.720
[Guest]: Other than that, where would you merge it?

02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:52.320
[Guest]: I think that's huge, which is why I, as I said, I have not entered a temple for any

02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:57.960
[Guest]: religious purpose and most often for any purpose for decades now.

02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:05.520
[Guest]: The last time I remember, I went to this Akshardham that had just come up and some relatives wanted

02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:06.520
[Guest]: to visit.

02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:08.400
[Guest]: I couldn't enter that temple.

02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:09.760
[Guest]: But that had another reason.

02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:10.760
[Guest]: Why?

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:16.320
[Guest]: Because 20 years ago, that area was a slum, 30 years ago.

02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:23.840
[Guest]: Those guys' temple manufactured a claim because their guru was supposed to have sat

02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:26.640
[Guest]: on that and seen the Yamuna to build it.

02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:31.560
[Guest]: Therefore, the slum was moved away.

02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:32.560
[Guest]: And so I'm very glad.

02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:36.080
[Guest]: So I couldn't, I just couldn't, I thought this is something I cannot participate, buy

02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:40.760
[Guest]: the ticket and enter a place where I'll not be able to associate, identify at all for

02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:44.600
[Guest]: this practical reason, forget the religious beliefs.

02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:51.880
[Guest]: And then I'm very glad that somebody else could figure out how to build that, that another

02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:58.160
[Guest]: kind of, you know, the Asian Games Village 2010 in front of that temple.

02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:01.400
[Guest]: So that the Yamuna is now far away.

02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:02.400
[Guest]: We can't do that.

02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:03.400
[Guest]: We can't do that.

02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:10.840
[Guest]: We really must figure out how do we connect in a manner that will be completely secular.

02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:13.680
[Guest]: Secular not in the political policy sense.

02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:19.000
[Guest]: Secular in terms of the thinking sense that it doesn't matter what your beliefs are.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:22.680
[Guest]: We can still deal with each other.

02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:26.800
[Guest]: And deal with each other very productively, very fruitfully.

02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:29.920
[Guest]: Because there is no reason why our beliefs should clash just like laws of physics doesn't

02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:33.040
[Guest]: clash with engineering.

02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:36.440
[Amit Varma]: So a couple of observations and the second one, I guess, leading to a question of sorts

02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:40.520
[Amit Varma]: and the first observation is that, yeah, I mean, one way I think of Hinduism is kind

02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:42.440
[Amit Varma]: of as an open source religion.

02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:47.240
[Amit Varma]: Like I was chatting with my host in Delhi, our mutual friend Mohit yesterday or today

02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:49.420
[Amit Varma]: morning, in fact, before I came for this recording.

02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:53.840
[Amit Varma]: And he was looking at this book called On Lakshmi, on the Goddess Lakshmi by Devdutt

02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:54.840
[Amit Varma]: Patnaik.

02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:55.840
[Amit Varma]: And he showed me an image in that.

02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:59.960
[Amit Varma]: And in that image, Lakshmi is sort of kneeling at the feet of Vishnu.

02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:04.600
[Amit Varma]: And he said that he found that image very interesting because for him, it meant that

02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:09.280
[Amit Varma]: wealth should be used in the service of preservation, which is an interesting interpretation.

02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:13.760
[Amit Varma]: And I, of course, being my cynical self, told Mohit that you can make any interpretation

02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:16.360
[Amit Varma]: out of anything because millions of images, millions of gods.

02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:20.320
[Amit Varma]: But it's interesting that you have a religion with that openness, which is kind of open

02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:24.240
[Amit Varma]: source that you can, you know, bring the concerns of the present times into it.

02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:28.720
[Amit Varma]: And what fills me with a lot of dismay, I am also, of course, a non-believer, but born

02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:29.720
[Amit Varma]: a Hindu.

02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:34.680
[Amit Varma]: But what also fills me with dismay is that what we have in this political movement called

02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:40.880
[Amit Varma]: Hindutva over the last hundred years is an effort in a sense, explicitly or implicitly,

02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:46.280
[Amit Varma]: to homogenize Hinduism into one particular strand, a Brahmanical strand, in fact, a later

02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:47.280
[Amit Varma]: Brahmanical strand.

02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:51.760
[Amit Varma]: Like someone on Twitter just pointed out today, I forget who, that, you know, to think of

02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:54.600
[Amit Varma]: vegetarianism and Hinduism as Brahmanical is wrong.

02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:58.040
[Amit Varma]: It's actually later Brahmanical, because if you look at the Vedas, they're killing and

02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:59.040
[Amit Varma]: eating animals.

02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Including cows.

02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:01.520
[Amit Varma]: Including cows.

02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:07.080
[Amit Varma]: And this sort of homogenization of Hinduism into this one fixed thing, does it such a

02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:08.080
[Amit Varma]: disservice?

02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:13.560
[Amit Varma]: Like, I would say in a sense, if a Hindu is in danger, it is because of Hindutva.

02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:15.120
[Amit Varma]: Because it is reducing it down.

02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, non-believers like you and me could still possibly call ourselves Hindus.

02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:20.680
[Amit Varma]: I know you do.

02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:26.320
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, and because there's so much else other than all of this.

02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:32.760
[Guest]: It's actually a copycat, that this Hindutva is a product of one of the exports or the

02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:40.760
[Guest]: imports from the Western nationalism, that religious nationalism that came in.

02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:41.760
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:42.760
[Guest]: So this is exactly a copycat.

02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:47.160
[Guest]: It's a complete, I mean, what should I say, destruction of anything to do with the ideas

02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:50.320
[Guest]: of Hinduism that I would associate with.

02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:51.320
[Guest]: And I have no conflict.

02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:53.840
[Guest]: You know, just like I have no conflict with laws of physics, I have no conflict.

02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:54.840
[Guest]: I don't see any such conflict.

02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:58.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, I want to go back to Gandhi, reading about Gandhi, one of the things that strikes

02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:02.840
[Amit Varma]: you like a black swan event for various reasons within the Indian freedom movement.

02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:08.160
[Amit Varma]: And one of the ways in which he differs from everyone else is in his intellectual development.

02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:13.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Naipaul once referred to Gandhi as, quote, the least Indian of Indian leaders,

02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:14.480
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:19.760
[Amit Varma]: And all his early influences are from elsewhere, you know, learns about nonviolent non-cooperation

02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:21.320
[Amit Varma]: through Tolstoy's writing.

02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:26.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, he later finds validation of that in Thoreau, he, you know, looks at the Sermon

02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:32.580
[Amit Varma]: on the Mount as an inspiration, his distrust of machinery and the idealization of village

02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:34.280
[Amit Varma]: life come from John Ruskin.

02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:38.200
[Amit Varma]: All these influences are later, later he claims of Bhagavad Gita as an influence.

02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:41.720
[Amit Varma]: But to me, in a sense, it seems like a post facto thing.

02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:44.880
[Amit Varma]: And his intellectual development is not so much from reading books like all the other

02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:51.520
[Amit Varma]: great liberals or Gokhale's and the Ferocia Mehta's and Agarkar's and Ranade's and all of those.

02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:55.640
[Amit Varma]: They read widely, you know, they read the great, you know, Mill and Bentham and the

02:50:55.640 --> 02:50:59.320
[Amit Varma]: great liberal writers of the age, Adam Smith, they were steeped in the enlightenment to

02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:01.600
[Amit Varma]: a certain extent, and he wasn't.

02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:06.640
[Amit Varma]: And this led him to a lot of strange ideas, like, for example, and I once asked Ram Guha

02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:10.120
[Amit Varma]: about this, and I found his answer lovely, and I'll share it with you.

02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:15.720
[Amit Varma]: And I read out bits from his book Hind Swaraj, which of course, he wrote in 1911, 1912, when

02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:22.520
[Amit Varma]: he was on the ship back from South Africa to India, where he railed against, say, the

02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:23.520
[Amit Varma]: railways.

02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:28.520
[Amit Varma]: So for example, at one point, he said, quote, railways, lawyers and doctors have impoverished

02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:32.720
[Amit Varma]: the country so much that if we don't wake up in time, we should be ruined, stop quote.

02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:37.280
[Amit Varma]: In another place, he said that, quote, it is beyond dispute that railways propagate

02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:38.280
[Amit Varma]: evil, quote.

02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:41.680
[Amit Varma]: And he was against modern medicine, though, when he fell ill, he always took modern medicine,

02:51:41.680 --> 02:51:43.120
[Amit Varma]: but he railed against it.

02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:48.040
[Amit Varma]: He railed against lawyers, and all of that seemed to be completely against modernity.

02:51:48.040 --> 02:51:51.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so much so that when he came to India, and he shared his ideas with his

02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:57.120
[Amit Varma]: great hero, Gokhale, Gokhale actually told him that, boss, you're a little out of touch.

02:51:57.120 --> 02:52:01.640
[Amit Varma]: So don't enter politics actively now, you go around India for a year, see the country

02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:04.540
[Amit Varma]: for yourself, and only then enter.

02:52:04.540 --> 02:52:08.640
[Amit Varma]: And Gokhale died shortly afterwards, and Gandhi's bizarre response to that was to continue his

02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:12.760
[Amit Varma]: journey around the country quite correctly, but barefoot, because he thought that would

02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:14.200
[Amit Varma]: be a tribute to Gokhale.

02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:17.440
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, at a later point, there's this beautiful book called the Mahatma and the

02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:21.840
[Amit Varma]: Poet, which has those correspondence of Gandhi and Tagore.

02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:26.680
[Amit Varma]: And you see at points, you can sense that Tagore is also a little bit exasperated and

02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:29.360
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, gently chiding him and so on.

02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:31.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's just a lovely exchange.

02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:36.600
[Amit Varma]: So I asked Ram, when I spoke to him about Gandhi, after his biography was out, that

02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:37.600
[Amit Varma]: what do we make of this?

02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:39.600
[Amit Varma]: Like, I understand people are evolving.

02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:44.600
[Amit Varma]: But he wrote Hind Swaraj when he was in his 40s, mid 40s, you know, you'd expect a person

02:52:44.600 --> 02:52:46.480
[Amit Varma]: to have evolved beyond that stage.

02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:50.760
[Amit Varma]: And yet his ideas are very simplistic and muddy on these subjects.

02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:56.800
[Amit Varma]: But on a subject like Satyagraha, on certain subjects, his words are incredible.

02:52:56.800 --> 02:52:59.840
[Amit Varma]: They're inspiring, they're incredible, they contain deep truth.

02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:00.840
[Amit Varma]: Why is that?

02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And Ram's answer, which I know you'll agree with, was that when he experienced something,

02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:11.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, that deep knowledge he gained from experiencing it, from being a practitioner,

02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:15.160
[Amit Varma]: as you put it, brought great wisdom and great insight.

02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:19.320
[Amit Varma]: But when he hadn't experienced something and he knew it only in the abstract, you know,

02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:23.240
[Amit Varma]: like the good that railways can do or modern medicine, then he would rail against it and

02:53:23.240 --> 02:53:25.240
[Amit Varma]: you don't take his view seriously.

02:53:25.240 --> 02:53:28.360
[Amit Varma]: And to some extent, I guess at the end of his life, Gandhi must have figured this himself

02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:31.160
[Amit Varma]: and he said, burn all my books, you know.

02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, I'm rambling a bit, but it seems here that there are different ways of arriving

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:38.240
[Amit Varma]: at views of the world.

02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:42.280
[Amit Varma]: And one way is ivory tower intellectuals, we read our books, we get our ideas.

02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:47.160
[Amit Varma]: The other is from the grassroots bottom up way, like the farmers you and I met in Deolali.

02:53:47.160 --> 02:53:48.840
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps there is a mix of the two.

02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Perhaps people like me, people like you have certainly gone into that India.

02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:57.160
[Amit Varma]: And people like them also are very well read and they kind of find validation of their

02:53:57.160 --> 02:53:59.520
[Amit Varma]: lived experiences in these big ideas.

02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:01.240
[Amit Varma]: But Gandhi's way is very interesting.

02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:06.480
[Amit Varma]: He's learning kind of by immersing himself into doing things and it almost seems an accident

02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:07.480
[Amit Varma]: what emerges.

02:54:07.480 --> 02:54:12.660
[Amit Varma]: Like all his satyagrahas, basically, if you look at the proximate aims, they kind of failed.

02:54:12.660 --> 02:54:17.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, the last South Africa one had like a face saver kind of half success, but they

02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:19.480
[Amit Varma]: all kind of failed in their proximate aims.

02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:23.880
[Amit Varma]: The salt tax remained till 1946, the salt tax today is much higher.

02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:25.420
[Amit Varma]: So they all failed.

02:54:25.420 --> 02:54:31.560
[Amit Varma]: But what they succeeded in was by mobilizing the public imagination, by turning what was

02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:35.480
[Amit Varma]: a movement of elites into a movement that was a mass movement.

02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And you and I have discussed this before.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:40.140
[Amit Varma]: And I think it's kind of accidental and it's he got lucky.

02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:44.960
[Amit Varma]: And it's only in hindsight that we attribute political genius to it that, you know, this

02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:49.140
[Amit Varma]: was his vision and he made it happen and we put a teleological plan to it.

02:54:49.140 --> 02:54:52.480
[Amit Varma]: And it's actually irrelevant, which of us is correct on this one point, it's completely

02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:53.480
[Amit Varma]: irrelevant.

02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:54.480
[Amit Varma]: He did what he did.

02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:56.220
[Amit Varma]: And it was kind of incredible.

02:54:56.220 --> 02:55:01.520
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts on what I just said?

02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:10.360
[Guest]: We need a few sessions to discuss Gandhi for the reason that I'm not a Gandhi scholar.

02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:17.800
[Guest]: So I am relating to Gandhi through my own experiences, just like Gandhi evolved through

02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:19.520
[Guest]: his own experiences.

02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:23.720
[Guest]: So I'm kind of secondhand, but at least through him.

02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:41.160
[Guest]: So I mean, if I understand Gandhi, he literally believed in detached action.

02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:48.640
[Guest]: He created in his own life a kind of detachment, which we can only dream of, you know, so many

02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:53.040
[Guest]: of us, we try, we know so many bad things in us.

02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:56.960
[Guest]: We want to rectify it, you know, smoking or this, that or the other.

02:55:56.960 --> 02:55:59.240
[Guest]: What a struggle.

02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:01.200
[Guest]: What a struggle.

02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:06.280
[Guest]: Many of us give up and try again, some of us succeed, some of us don't.

02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:10.120
[Guest]: And that's true in very many aspects.

02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:12.720
[Guest]: And so it was with Gandhi.

02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:20.600
[Guest]: Yet once he set the goal, the focus was not on the goal at all.

02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:26.840
[Guest]: So the salt tax was not the goal at all, neither was India's independence.

02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:35.560
[Guest]: His transformation was that he crafted the identity of Indians as citizens, which hadn't

02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:41.320
[Guest]: happened then, before, which hasn't happened since.

02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:47.600
[Guest]: I mean, an amazing transformation that a society that lived without a state, literally, Indians,

02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:52.040
[Guest]: you know, Indians didn't depend on a state protection to remain Indians.

02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:56.920
[Guest]: The civilization of India survived for all these years, for the various factors that

02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:01.600
[Guest]: they were, but, and people can still relate to some common element, they can share the

02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:07.000
[Guest]: epics, etc., etc., but there was no political anchor to it.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:15.080
[Guest]: So here is a civilization that never in its history relied on a political anchor.

02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:21.480
[Guest]: Gandhi had this amazing challenge, incredible challenge, that to create a political identity,

02:57:21.480 --> 02:57:28.040
[Guest]: yet go far beyond that identity, which is why he was a nationalist leader, perhaps the

02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:34.960
[Guest]: only one I can think of, who didn't need history to justify himself.

02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:38.320
[Guest]: You know, do the right thing, exactly as the Gita would say, that figure out what's the

02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:42.200
[Guest]: right thing, stick to it, forget the goal, the goal would happen in its own due course

02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:45.000
[Guest]: because you don't have all the control over, you are not God.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.560
[Guest]: So you won't be able to deliver the goal as such if you claim it.

02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:52.960
[Guest]: So do, figure out what's the right thing to do, figure out how to do it, go about doing

02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:53.960
[Guest]: it.

02:57:53.960 --> 02:58:00.080
[Guest]: Which is why it led to such amazing experiences for Gandhi and he kept evolving.

02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:04.960
[Guest]: To me, it is this process that I find fascinating.

02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:13.640
[Guest]: Very few authors, including Rand, would acknowledge that evolution, Tagore did.

02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:16.560
[Guest]: Amazing!

02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:21.200
[Guest]: So to me, that correspondence is not about the conflict that they had in terms of ideology

02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:24.640
[Guest]: or ideas or principles or philosophy.

02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:30.280
[Guest]: It is that they were struggling, grappling, just like Krishna was trying to grapple or

02:58:30.280 --> 02:58:35.000
[Guest]: Arjuna was trying to grapple with Krishna and Krishna was trying to explain to Arjuna.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:42.680
[Guest]: You know, so to me, it is this process of engagement that is the most exciting part.

02:58:42.680 --> 02:58:46.760
[Guest]: To me, if you and I agree, we would have nothing to discuss.

02:58:46.760 --> 02:58:50.080
[Guest]: We would only discuss whom to bash up because that's the guy I don't agree on or we don't

02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:52.240
[Guest]: agree on.

02:58:52.240 --> 02:58:58.920
[Guest]: You know, literally or metaphorically, whichever way we think of how to gang up against other

02:58:58.920 --> 02:58:59.920
[Guest]: guy.

02:58:59.920 --> 02:59:05.560
[Guest]: But we can discuss precisely because there are threads, nuances that we are exploring.

02:59:05.560 --> 02:59:11.600
[Guest]: So I have no this thing about you disproving me because if you do, I'll thank you because

02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:15.720
[Guest]: it will give me a new insight into something that may not have come to me.

02:59:15.720 --> 02:59:20.240
[Guest]: And if you don't, that only reinforces by this thing that, okay, I'm on a right track

02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:22.520
[Guest]: and I presume that would be the same with you.

02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:23.520
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:24.520
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:25.520
[Guest]: So it is this process.

02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:26.520
[Guest]: This is the means.

02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:29.240
[Guest]: To me, this is the means.

02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:30.240
[Guest]: There is no other.

02:59:30.240 --> 02:59:31.240
[Guest]: The ends are irrelevant.

02:59:31.240 --> 02:59:37.760
[Guest]: Irrelevant in the sense that you can set it, wherever you are headed, but that's irrelevant.

02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:43.760
[Guest]: Which is why we cannot, you know, I mean, ends are necessary or it creates the drama.

02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:49.200
[Guest]: It creates the effect that had it not been for the salt tax and the salt movement, would

02:59:49.200 --> 02:59:54.200
[Guest]: millions have kind of gelled into such a movement?

02:59:54.200 --> 03:00:00.960
[Guest]: You know, so I'm sure the events do play a significant role, but they're not the whole

03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:01.960
[Guest]: story.

03:00:01.960 --> 03:00:02.960
[Guest]: They're only the starting point.

03:00:02.960 --> 03:00:11.440
[Guest]: They only help to set in motion a process which we should all aspire for.

03:00:11.440 --> 03:00:16.280
[Guest]: You know, so Gandhi and Tagore, and Tagore was of course much more of an intellectual,

03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:20.520
[Guest]: although he tried to be a practitioner in terms of his Shantiniketan efforts and all

03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:21.520
[Guest]: that.

03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:24.760
[Guest]: But Gandhi was a practitioner through and through, which is perhaps why I relate with

03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:28.760
[Guest]: him as an engineer, you know, even conceptually.

03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:33.920
[Guest]: That I'm looking at a problem as to how do, if this is a problem I'm facing, how do I

03:00:33.920 --> 03:00:36.040
[Guest]: come across and how do I, what do I take away?

03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:39.880
[Guest]: How do I improve upon it, et cetera, et cetera.

03:00:39.880 --> 03:00:41.760
[Guest]: He was constantly doing that.

03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:42.920
[Guest]: He was a practitioner.

03:00:42.920 --> 03:00:48.720
[Guest]: So I have no problem that he has differences with the philosophers and the principles,

03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:53.880
[Guest]: because those philosophers and the principles had a fraction of a reach in terms of how

03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:54.880
[Guest]: he connected.

03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:55.880
[Guest]: That's the practice.

03:00:55.880 --> 03:01:01.200
[Guest]: Tagore also did the same, but of course, much more intellectually, I mean, Tagore is much

03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:02.200
[Guest]: more intellectual.

03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:09.880
[Guest]: So to me, it is that both of them acknowledge this process of evolution, whereas what we

03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:15.000
[Guest]: have created today is that we want our icons to be born icons.

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:16.000
[Guest]: I think it'll be a dead end.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:17.000
[Guest]: I think it'll be a disaster.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:24.600
[Guest]: We'll all turn into fossils and rocks if we are born into what we are.

03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:28.080
[Amit Varma]: We will turn into fossils anyway, but for a while.

03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:29.080
[Guest]: For a while.

03:01:29.080 --> 03:01:30.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:31.080
[Guest]: At least you'll pass on the gene to the next one.

03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:32.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:36.280
[Guest]: So I think, I think to me, it is this process, which is why the poem that you read, you know,

03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:38.400
[Guest]: is the rebirth and the freshness of it.

03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:39.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:40.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:41.400
[Guest]: That's what makes life interesting.

03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:42.400
[Guest]: Otherwise we are all gone.

03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:48.280
[Guest]: You know, this actually, you know, to me, one way of, I mean, one thing that kind of

03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:53.160
[Guest]: fascinated me and I was telling some other friend just a few days ago, why don't we look

03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:54.160
[Guest]: at the sky?

03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:58.760
[Guest]: One is the pollution and all the rest, many of us in urban India can't.

03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:10.720
[Guest]: But look at the sky, the enormity of space and the insignificance of our tiny battles.

03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:17.720
[Guest]: You know, I really think we'd be a very enriched society if, if astronomy or things of that

03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:24.760
[Guest]: kind were built in as part of our education system.

03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:25.760
[Guest]: Look at the sky.

03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:26.760
[Guest]: Amazing.

03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:32.480
[Guest]: You know, whether you think of it created by a creator or not, I don't think it was

03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:33.480
[Guest]: a creator.

03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:34.480
[Guest]: You think it's a creator?

03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:35.480
[Guest]: That's fine.

03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:38.300
[Guest]: That debate won't get resolved immediately.

03:02:38.300 --> 03:02:42.480
[Guest]: But that difference would not, should not lead to the other differences in the practical

03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:43.480
[Guest]: world.

03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:47.600
[Guest]: Because the practical world differences are not because of that difference, which is why

03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:54.040
[Guest]: you know, the thing that kind of, another from Gandhi's own life, thing that made me

03:02:54.040 --> 03:03:00.960
[Guest]: completely rethink Gandhi was when I began to, at least in my perspective, when I began

03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:09.240
[Guest]: to ask how and why did Gandhi change from God is truth, he was a believer from his beginning

03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:15.360
[Guest]: and it's not true that Gandhi was only influenced by the West, the philosophers of Tolstoy and

03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:22.160
[Guest]: Thoreau and things like that, his Jain and his Vaishnav teachings in India, which was

03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:26.360
[Guest]: predating his, played a huge role in terms of what he was.

03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:35.340
[Guest]: But how a man who hardly ever went into a temple, yet claimed to be spiritual and prayed

03:03:35.340 --> 03:03:48.680
[Guest]: every day, twice a day at least, shifted from God is truth to truth is God.

03:03:48.680 --> 03:03:57.360
[Guest]: To me, this was an eye-opener and which actually made me realise or accept as of now at least

03:03:57.360 --> 03:03:59.280
[Guest]: that I have no conflict with Hinduism.

03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:03.600
[Guest]: Even though I'm a non-believer, I'm a non-practitioner, I have no beliefs, I have no customs that

03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:07.320
[Guest]: I would follow.

03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:11.120
[Guest]: The only time I would follow custom is only because the family and the society around

03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:13.040
[Guest]: me wants me to adopt a particular one.

03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:16.480
[Guest]: I don't want a confrontation on that because that's a practical thing, that's not a

03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:18.640
[Guest]: principled issue.

03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:21.640
[Guest]: I have no prohibition.

03:04:21.640 --> 03:04:30.400
[Guest]: To me, this was the starting point of understanding why.

03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:35.640
[Guest]: That if you say God is truth, then firstly you'll have to believe that there is a God

03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:41.760
[Guest]: and then there is a question of whose God, which God, you know, Shiva or Vishnu or the

03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:45.680
[Guest]: Christ or Mohammed or the flying spaghetti monster.

03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:46.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:04:46.680 --> 03:04:49.880
[Guest]: So, you have to debate all that.

03:04:49.880 --> 03:04:58.200
[Guest]: But truth is God is that process transition from the end, where you are giving the end

03:04:58.200 --> 03:05:02.160
[Guest]: and saying that truth is a way to God, you are now reversing it.

03:05:02.160 --> 03:05:03.840
[Guest]: You know, you don't have the end.

03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:09.600
[Guest]: You have the truth and then it leads to wherever the end is God, no matter what that thing

03:05:09.600 --> 03:05:13.640
[Guest]: might be.

03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:25.280
[Guest]: And I believe this actually can help us understand why Gandhi said many of his anti-technology

03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:29.680
[Guest]: things and why he said it.

03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:33.880
[Guest]: Because as a practitioner, we must always look at the context in which he is saying

03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:34.880
[Guest]: or doing things.

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:37.120
[Guest]: His is not a theoretical journey.

03:05:37.120 --> 03:05:41.720
[Guest]: He is not looking for a beautiful theoretical construct that physicists and mathematicians

03:05:41.720 --> 03:05:44.440
[Guest]: look for, you know, symmetry and beauty and all the rest.

03:05:44.440 --> 03:05:45.440
[Guest]: He was not looking at all that.

03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:54.680
[Guest]: He was looking at hard ground realities, which meant that this transition enabled him to

03:05:54.680 --> 03:06:03.600
[Guest]: relate to scientists, relate to philosophers, relate to atheists and relate to believers

03:06:03.600 --> 03:06:04.600
[Guest]: without…

03:06:04.600 --> 03:06:12.080
[Guest]: Have you ever seen a picture of Gandhi entering a temple or sitting before a deity?

03:06:12.080 --> 03:06:16.840
[Guest]: And of course, one section of Hindutva Brigade disowned him, which is how he got killed or

03:06:16.840 --> 03:06:17.840
[Amit Varma]: murdered.

03:06:17.840 --> 03:06:18.840
[Amit Varma]: But he was close to another section.

03:06:18.840 --> 03:06:21.640
[Amit Varma]: In fact, he defended the Varna system at a different point in time.

03:06:21.640 --> 03:06:22.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:23.640
[Amit Varma]: So, that's the part of the evolution.

03:06:23.640 --> 03:06:25.720
[Guest]: That's the part of the evolution.

03:06:25.720 --> 03:06:26.720
[Guest]: That we need to…

03:06:26.720 --> 03:06:32.800
[Guest]: Which is why, you know, otherwise we are expecting Gandhi to be born a Mahatma, which is the

03:06:32.800 --> 03:06:35.040
[Guest]: one reason why he said that discard Mahatma.

03:06:35.040 --> 03:06:41.320
[Guest]: In fact, that was one of his absolute rules in his ashrams, that no one should refer to

03:06:41.320 --> 03:06:42.320
[Guest]: him as a Mahatma.

03:06:42.320 --> 03:06:46.760
[Guest]: So, that's why I don't look at Gandhi as a Mahatma, Bapu, father of the nation or

03:06:46.760 --> 03:06:49.640
[Guest]: anything of that kind.

03:06:49.640 --> 03:06:54.640
[Guest]: I look at him as a person who actually lived in flesh and blood and who actually tried

03:06:54.640 --> 03:07:00.840
[Guest]: to do things in practice, which is probably I can relate because I didn't come up through

03:07:00.840 --> 03:07:01.840
[Guest]: the intellectual route.

03:07:01.840 --> 03:07:06.640
[Guest]: You know, I mean, all my exposures were because I was trying to relate in terms of my lived

03:07:06.640 --> 03:07:07.640
[Guest]: experience.

03:07:07.640 --> 03:07:11.960
[Guest]: So, I didn't come through the intellectual route, which I think is very critical to understand

03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:12.960
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi.

03:07:12.960 --> 03:07:17.800
[Amit Varma]: And what I also think of it, and the reason I won't litigate this too much, is that

03:07:17.800 --> 03:07:22.400
[Amit Varma]: I have increasingly come to believe that the biographical details of the life of a dead

03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:24.840
[Amit Varma]: man are kind of irrelevant.

03:07:24.840 --> 03:07:28.480
[Amit Varma]: They've left impacts on the world in different ways.

03:07:28.480 --> 03:07:30.800
[Amit Varma]: And those impacts are important, especially their ideas.

03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:35.040
[Amit Varma]: So we should debate their ideas and discuss their ideas and what we learn from that.

03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:40.280
[Amit Varma]: But the biographical details is something useful served by going into it because a guy

03:07:40.280 --> 03:07:41.920
[Amit Varma]: is dead and the guy should be dead.

03:07:41.920 --> 03:07:47.960
[Amit Varma]: Like his ideas in Hind Swaraj are kind of ridiculous, you know, his ideas on caste also

03:07:47.960 --> 03:07:49.860
[Amit Varma]: evolve in strange ways.

03:07:49.860 --> 03:07:54.720
[Amit Varma]: In the last decade of his life, he's completely lost it with the kind of experiments that

03:07:54.720 --> 03:07:59.680
[Amit Varma]: he does like sleeping naked with his 17 year old grandniece, Manu, you know, all the other

03:07:59.680 --> 03:08:03.200
[Amit Varma]: leaders of the movement kind of like, you know, what the fuck, what's wrong with this

03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:04.320
[Amit Varma]: guy.

03:08:04.320 --> 03:08:06.120
[Amit Varma]: But I think at that level, that's irrelevant.

03:08:06.120 --> 03:08:11.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, in certain ways, he was a great man in certain ways, he was exactly the opposite.

03:08:11.520 --> 03:08:16.280
[Amit Varma]: And but what we are left with is his ideas and the learnings that we can take from that.

03:08:16.280 --> 03:08:20.600
[Amit Varma]: And the subject of noticing sentences, I love the sentence of yours, why don't we look at

03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:21.600
[Amit Varma]: the sky?

03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:23.080
[Amit Varma]: That's such a beautiful sentence.

03:08:23.080 --> 03:08:28.040
[Amit Varma]: And I think more of us would benefit from a looking at the sky and be talking to the

03:08:28.040 --> 03:08:33.000
[Amit Varma]: person next to us, instead of being observed in our smartphones all the time and just being

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:36.040
[Amit Varma]: sort of in that abstract kind of world.

03:08:36.040 --> 03:08:41.160
[Amit Varma]: Let me sort of in the context of the current time and a debate that you and I have had,

03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:45.300
[Amit Varma]: let me, you know, talk about something that we both agree on, that the end does not justify

03:08:45.300 --> 03:08:46.300
[Amit Varma]: the means, right?

03:08:46.300 --> 03:08:51.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, how I often think of it in the context of the state is that look, I'm against coercion.

03:08:51.800 --> 03:08:53.360
[Amit Varma]: Consent is everything to me.

03:08:53.360 --> 03:08:59.600
[Amit Varma]: At the same time, I realize that the existence of the state is necessary to protect our rights.

03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:03.240
[Amit Varma]: You need a state with a monopoly on violence to protect these individual rights with you

03:09:03.240 --> 03:09:04.740
[Amit Varma]: and I hold so dear.

03:09:04.740 --> 03:09:10.840
[Amit Varma]: But the existence of the state itself implies, as Gandhi also pointed out, implies a certain

03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:15.560
[Amit Varma]: base degree of violence, because to protect our rights, you have to first infringe our

03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:20.000
[Amit Varma]: rights in terms of the state existing, it exists on our taxes, and there is coercion

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:24.400
[Amit Varma]: involved and the very notion of the monopoly of violence is exactly that.

03:09:24.400 --> 03:09:27.960
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, my thinking always has been that I'm not going to be an anarchist and

03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:32.400
[Amit Varma]: say there should be no state, because society would evolve towards having a state of some

03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:36.560
[Amit Varma]: sort, even if there wasn't one in, you know, in a perfect condition.

03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:40.800
[Amit Varma]: But I'm always conscious that as I wrote a column, you know, as is the headline of a

03:09:40.800 --> 03:09:44.080
[Amit Varma]: column I once wrote that every act of government is an act of violence.

03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:47.680
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, whenever we think of the state doing something, we have to acknowledge the

03:09:47.680 --> 03:09:48.680
[Amit Varma]: cost.

03:09:48.680 --> 03:09:52.400
[Amit Varma]: We can't pretend that there is no cost, that government money is unlimited or the state

03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:54.800
[Amit Varma]: can do whatever to solve this problem.

03:09:54.800 --> 03:09:59.080
[Amit Varma]: Everything that it does has a cost and we need to kind of acknowledge the cost.

03:09:59.080 --> 03:10:03.640
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, there needs to be a really high bar on what the state should do.

03:10:03.640 --> 03:10:06.920
[Amit Varma]: Because with everything it does in some way or the other, it is infringing on our freedom

03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:08.080
[Amit Varma]: as citizens.

03:10:08.080 --> 03:10:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And I would say that a justifiable intervention of the state would therefore come in protecting

03:10:12.680 --> 03:10:14.400
[Amit Varma]: our rights and protecting our lives.

03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:15.400
[Amit Varma]: Now,

03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:19.760
[Guest]: I think I'll just add, you know, it's not the economic cost.

03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:20.760
[Guest]: That's a marginal, it's a moral cost.

03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:21.760
[Guest]: It's a coercion.

03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:22.760
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a coercion.

03:10:22.760 --> 03:10:28.840
[Guest]: And Gandhi actually said it in another form, that every action of the state is manifestation

03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:29.840
[Unknown]: of violence.

03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:30.840
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:36.080
[Guest]: And it's that violence that needs to be restrained because we need the state, but only need it

03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:38.840
[Guest]: to that limited degree and not beyond.

03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:43.040
[Guest]: Which is why, and this is something is very new, I mean, you know, and maybe we'll have

03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:46.800
[Guest]: another occasion to discuss this, this distinction that Gandhi drew.

03:10:46.800 --> 03:10:52.520
[Guest]: And I think there has been very little understanding or discourse on that, that Gandhi rarely spoke

03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:53.520
[Guest]: of rights.

03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:57.760
[Guest]: He was speaking of duties.

03:10:57.760 --> 03:11:01.000
[Guest]: For the last three or four hundred years, we have been talking of rights.

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:02.000
[Guest]: What's the difference?

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:06.720
[Guest]: And the way I see it, and like I said, I'm not an academic coming from that world, as

03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:16.640
[Guest]: a practitioner as I see it, rights are our relationship with each other, governing our

03:11:16.640 --> 03:11:24.920
[Guest]: relationship with each other, enforced through the coercive power of the state or the arbitration

03:11:24.920 --> 03:11:28.880
[Guest]: power of the state, the judiciary.

03:11:28.880 --> 03:11:33.760
[Guest]: That of course depends on whether the state is efficient and capable and even wants to

03:11:33.760 --> 03:11:36.640
[Guest]: to do that kind of activity.

03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:44.840
[Guest]: Second, duties is our own, it's our commitment to ourselves.

03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:47.220
[Guest]: That's duty.

03:11:47.220 --> 03:11:51.360
[Guest]: Which means that irrespective of what the rights are, and which is what Gandhi had,

03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:55.080
[Guest]: in fact just last night I was reading something because I was looking at something and I suddenly

03:11:55.080 --> 03:12:00.680
[Guest]: came across, I think Gandhi had an exchange with HG Wales regarding these rights and duties.

03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:04.680
[Guest]: And then I think somebody else wrote to him about this Universal Declaration of Human

03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:10.600
[Guest]: Rights, which of course happened a few months after Gandhi passed away, he died in January,

03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:13.680
[Guest]: that probably happened later, but the same year.

03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:15.600
[Guest]: And Gandhi had the same point.

03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:20.520
[Guest]: And this is something that's kind of coming from, say, my first introduction to this kind

03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:25.080
[Guest]: of social science was through Ayn Rand, and therefore the focus was on rights.

03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:30.000
[Guest]: And then my experience through many activities, farmers, elsewhere, where property rights

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:35.600
[Guest]: became a key component of our frame.

03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:39.440
[Guest]: But it was rights.

03:12:39.440 --> 03:12:43.360
[Guest]: And Indira Gandhi introduced duties into the constitution and therefore it became a problem

03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:48.200
[Guest]: because you are trying to institutionalize duties.

03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:52.000
[Guest]: Duties cannot be institutionalized because it's our own, which you can see daily on the

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:54.440
[Guest]: streets of anywhere, village to cities.

03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:59.440
[Guest]: Why do most people, you know, anyone could, any two, five people could gang up against

03:12:59.440 --> 03:13:03.960
[Guest]: one and snatch away the mobile or the money or whatever, whatever, just beat him up for

03:13:03.960 --> 03:13:04.960
[Guest]: fun.

03:13:04.960 --> 03:13:11.480
[Guest]: 99.99% of the time you don't see that kind of things happening.

03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:22.400
[Guest]: The poorest of the poor in India would not, 99.999% of the time, throw a stone at a Mercedes

03:13:22.400 --> 03:13:26.200
[Guest]: just because the Mercedes is passing by.

03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:27.200
[Guest]: That's duty.

03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:34.000
[Guest]: It's not conscious, it's ingrained that we perform duties because we believe that's

03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:37.440
[Guest]: the right thing to do, which cannot be enforced by law.

03:13:37.440 --> 03:13:42.760
[Guest]: And therefore, Indira Gandhi did a great disservice by doing this duty business into the constitution

03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:49.160
[Guest]: and which has meant that we have now, what should I say, rightized our duties.

03:13:49.160 --> 03:13:55.800
[Guest]: Which means, you know, all the positive rights, etc. has been passed off as rights because

03:13:55.800 --> 03:13:57.680
[Amit Varma]: we've given up on duties.

03:13:57.680 --> 03:13:59.720
[Amit Varma]: So let me kind of push back on that.

03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:04.240
[Amit Varma]: Like first, I find that Gandhi's thinking on this particular subject is incoherent and

03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:08.320
[Amit Varma]: we can go into that in detail later, but I think there's a category error in talking

03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:14.360
[Amit Varma]: of rights and duties like this, in the sense that I think, like, first of all, rights are

03:14:14.360 --> 03:14:15.360
[Amit Varma]: fundamental.

03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:16.800
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, what does it mean to be a citizen?

03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:18.640
[Amit Varma]: What does it mean to be an individual?

03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:23.000
[Amit Varma]: Rights are central to the way I think about our relationships with each other.

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:27.860
[Amit Varma]: But rights and duties exist in separate domains, except for the duty, you could say we have

03:14:27.860 --> 03:14:29.960
[Amit Varma]: to not infringe the rights of others.

03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:34.360
[Amit Varma]: And if you phrase it like that, in that particular sense, that one duty is something that is

03:14:34.360 --> 03:14:35.640
[Amit Varma]: connected to rights.

03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:40.280
[Amit Varma]: But other duties, like you correctly said, I think come about from the voluntary actions

03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:43.920
[Amit Varma]: of individuals, you know, and therefore cannot be coerced by the state.

03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:47.820
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, Indira Gandhi got it completely wrong over there, along with many other things

03:14:47.820 --> 03:14:48.820
[Amit Varma]: she got wrong.

03:14:48.820 --> 03:14:53.620
[Amit Varma]: So for example, I might have a duty towards you that Borun is in his 60s, let me not keep

03:14:53.620 --> 03:14:55.000
[Amit Varma]: him talking for more than five hours.

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:56.460
[Amit Varma]: And that might be my duty.

03:14:56.460 --> 03:15:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And you might have a duty towards me that, you know, Amit has come all the way to Delhi

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:03.360
[Amit Varma]: to call me for a podcast, we'll talk for seven hours, I'll give him what he wants.

03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:04.920
[Amit Varma]: But these are voluntary actions.

03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:08.620
[Amit Varma]: These are things that we feel and like you correctly said, a lot of what is so beautiful

03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:13.280
[Amit Varma]: about social interactions is this sense of duty towards our fellow citizens where we

03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:17.920
[Amit Varma]: are helping strangers without needing to and, you know, looking after others and all of

03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:18.920
[Amit Varma]: that.

03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:19.920
[Amit Varma]: Even within families.

03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:21.320
[Amit Varma]: Even within families.

03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:22.680
[Amit Varma]: And rights are in a separate domain.

03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:28.320
[Guest]: I think rights are like a hygiene factor, I think, I mean, this may not be the whole

03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:29.560
[Guest]: story.

03:15:29.560 --> 03:15:37.120
[Guest]: Because firstly, and historically, societies have existed predating rights.

03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:41.280
[Amit Varma]: And if rights are defined just by the states, then there is a problem.

03:15:41.280 --> 03:15:42.280
[Amit Varma]: No, but they're not.

03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:47.520
[Amit Varma]: I agree that rights exist before the state, except that we implicitly recognize each other's

03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:48.520
[Amit Varma]: rights.

03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:49.520
[Amit Varma]: Some duties emerge from that.

03:15:49.520 --> 03:15:50.520
[Guest]: Some.

03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:54.640
[Guest]: And, you know, this is, in a way, semantic.

03:15:54.640 --> 03:16:06.320
[Guest]: But I think it is important that it is because we recognize our fundamental duty to ourselves,

03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:11.560
[Guest]: we begin to recognize what is the basis of our relationship with somebody else.

03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:14.840
[Guest]: Because we look at that person as our equal.

03:16:14.840 --> 03:16:22.080
[Guest]: And it's only in the interaction phase, in some form, in some specific spheres, that

03:16:22.080 --> 03:16:23.480
[Guest]: the issue of rights might come in.

03:16:23.480 --> 03:16:30.640
[Guest]: Otherwise, 95% of the time, we are all functioning in our domains of duties, not in the domains

03:16:30.640 --> 03:16:31.760
[Guest]: of rights.

03:16:31.760 --> 03:16:32.760
[Amit Varma]: Because just think of it.

03:16:32.760 --> 03:16:38.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but, Varun, those domains of duties emerge from our implicit understanding of

03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:39.560
[Amit Varma]: rights.

03:16:39.560 --> 03:16:42.840
[Amit Varma]: For example, it is my duty that if I disagree with you, and I suddenly feel violent, it

03:16:42.840 --> 03:16:45.200
[Amit Varma]: is my duty not to slap you, right?

03:16:45.200 --> 03:16:49.240
[Amit Varma]: But that duty emerges because I understand your rights and my rights, and that I would

03:16:49.240 --> 03:16:51.400
[Amit Varma]: be infringing on your rights by slapping you.

03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:52.880
[Guest]: But maybe it's kind of...

03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:55.300
[Guest]: No, I think it doesn't end there.

03:16:55.300 --> 03:16:59.680
[Guest]: Because if you do slap me, then I can invoke the state to say that, arbitrate and figure

03:16:59.680 --> 03:17:01.760
[Guest]: out whether this is right, wrong, etc, etc.

03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:08.200
[Guest]: And therefore, the rights, while we say it is inalienable, but in a strict sense, it

03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:13.880
[Guest]: is dependent on that somebody, ultimately, who's willing and able to do it in a manner

03:17:13.880 --> 03:17:15.640
[Guest]: which is just and proper.

03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:16.640
[Guest]: Which is...

03:17:16.640 --> 03:17:17.680
[Guest]: Which is true.

03:17:17.680 --> 03:17:18.880
[Guest]: But which is not the whole story.

03:17:18.880 --> 03:17:22.160
[Guest]: Because 95% of our interactions are not based on our...

03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but you're not disagreeing with me.

03:17:24.240 --> 03:17:25.240
[Guest]: No, I'm not disagreeing.

03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:27.000
[Guest]: I'm not disagreeing at all.

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:31.320
[Guest]: I'm only saying that we should not categorize it as either or.

03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:32.320
[Guest]: That's what I'm saying.

03:17:32.320 --> 03:17:34.320
[Guest]: That is the relationship between the two.

03:17:34.320 --> 03:17:35.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm saying there's no dichotomy.

03:17:35.720 --> 03:17:40.640
[Amit Varma]: I'm saying that it's a category error, because rights sort of depend on the state and they

03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:44.840
[Amit Varma]: need to be kind of, you know, formally spelt out and all of that.

03:17:44.840 --> 03:17:50.280
[Amit Varma]: And duties emerge within society from this incredibly rich web of personal interactions.

03:17:50.280 --> 03:17:55.080
[Amit Varma]: But the question that I was coming to, is that therefore, I think, because of the way

03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:59.520
[Amit Varma]: that I see it, that, of course, coercion is bad, but you need a limited amount of coercion

03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:03.600
[Amit Varma]: to protect everybody's rights and make sure that there isn't only coercion.

03:18:03.600 --> 03:18:06.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of to me what I call the liberal paradox.

03:18:06.560 --> 03:18:12.520
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we need to litigate very closely what a state should do and what a state should

03:18:12.520 --> 03:18:13.520
[Amit Varma]: not do.

03:18:13.520 --> 03:18:16.280
[Amit Varma]: Because everything a state does is a violent act in its end.

03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:21.000
[Amit Varma]: So whatever, wherever you invoke the use of the state, you have to be very clear about

03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:22.920
[Amit Varma]: why you are doing it.

03:18:22.920 --> 03:18:28.280
[Amit Varma]: And this is where you and I kind of disagreed, where at the start of COVID, I felt that in

03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:33.840
[Amit Varma]: such a massive crisis, that the blunt tool of a lockdown at that time, you know, today,

03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:36.480
[Amit Varma]: we can look back on how the lockdown was done really badly.

03:18:36.480 --> 03:18:39.720
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, a lockdown at a different point in time is a different matter.

03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:45.760
[Amit Varma]: And a lockdown is a coercive tool that states will misuse inevitably in, like I heard recently,

03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:49.560
[Amit Varma]: because of the Delhi fog, somebody was musing about how Delhi should have a lockdown.

03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:50.560
[Amit Varma]: Inevitable.

03:18:50.560 --> 03:18:51.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:18:51.560 --> 03:18:52.560
[Amit Varma]: Which is absolute nonsense.

03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:53.560
[Amit Varma]: And on all those matters, I agree with you.

03:18:53.560 --> 03:18:57.680
[Amit Varma]: But when the lockdown was first called, I think in an idealized sense, there is a moment

03:18:57.680 --> 03:18:59.880
[Amit Varma]: where a lockdown may be necessary.

03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:03.760
[Amit Varma]: I understand it's an infringement on our rights and no one defends those more than me.

03:19:03.760 --> 03:19:08.600
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, the duty of the state is to protect the lives of its citizens.

03:19:08.600 --> 03:19:11.720
[Amit Varma]: And this seemed to be the edge case where that would be the case.

03:19:11.720 --> 03:19:15.720
[Amit Varma]: But you, on the other hand, took this principle stand that no, lockdowns are wrong, period.

03:19:15.720 --> 03:19:19.800
[Guest]: No, no, no, I didn't take a principle stand on lockdown.

03:19:19.800 --> 03:19:25.040
[Guest]: This thing was that we are not ending up normalizing another expansion of the state.

03:19:25.040 --> 03:19:28.560
[Guest]: And that would come to haunt us as it has.

03:19:28.560 --> 03:19:32.080
[Guest]: The Delhi may have a lockdown now and now we can have a, now, it's not an India phenomenon

03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:33.920
[Guest]: at all.

03:19:33.920 --> 03:19:39.280
[Guest]: China and the Chinese party have won the war as of now.

03:19:39.280 --> 03:19:43.640
[Guest]: Every government is aspiring to wield that kind of authority over their people.

03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:45.440
[Guest]: We have normalized it.

03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:46.880
[Guest]: That to me, no, lockdown is secondary.

03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:47.880
[Guest]: The pandemic will come and go.

03:19:47.880 --> 03:19:49.560
[Guest]: It has happened before, it will happen again.

03:19:49.560 --> 03:19:50.600
[Guest]: That all is secondary.

03:19:50.600 --> 03:19:57.960
[Guest]: And secondly, incidentally, there was no manual, including WHO's, which called for lockdown

03:19:57.960 --> 03:20:00.320
[Guest]: in case of epidemics and pandemics.

03:20:00.320 --> 03:20:01.320
[Guest]: So that's aside.

03:20:01.320 --> 03:20:07.520
[Guest]: You know, it shows, to me, it shows it's not the lockdown, this will pass.

03:20:07.520 --> 03:20:15.800
[Guest]: It is how we were just waiting, that as a society, not just our leaders, as a society

03:20:15.800 --> 03:20:22.000
[Guest]: we were all waiting for an opportunity to allow the state to expand itself.

03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:26.160
[Guest]: And that it has happened in the freest of the free countries.

03:20:26.160 --> 03:20:30.520
[Guest]: To me, that is incredible.

03:20:30.520 --> 03:20:37.520
[Guest]: And that, this is going to now lead to a kind of internal divisions, which didn't exist

03:20:37.520 --> 03:20:38.520
[Guest]: a few years ago.

03:20:38.520 --> 03:20:44.360
[Guest]: So to me, this is, I mean, the cost of this in societal terms, forget the health, I mean,

03:20:44.360 --> 03:20:47.960
[Guest]: yes, some people, I mean, we have in one crore people die in India every year.

03:20:47.960 --> 03:20:50.080
[Guest]: So there will be a few people dying extra.

03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:53.120
[Guest]: That might be me, that might be you, that might be somebody, I mean, we have lost two

03:20:53.120 --> 03:20:58.440
[Guest]: members of our family, one due to COVID, one non-COVID, but that we all take it that this

03:20:58.440 --> 03:20:59.600
[Guest]: is going to happen.

03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:06.800
[Guest]: But to me, this cost, because we have no conception today what is a state.

03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:10.840
[Guest]: And this has been normalized not overnight, not because China did it and we copycatted

03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:11.840
[Guest]: China.

03:21:11.840 --> 03:21:16.800
[Guest]: It has been happening for the last 50 years, 60 years, since the end of the Second World

03:21:16.800 --> 03:21:17.800
[Guest]: War.

03:21:17.800 --> 03:21:21.320
[Guest]: Second World War was fought against the Nazis, the National Socialists.

03:21:21.320 --> 03:21:25.720
[Guest]: After that, Britain had its National Health Service.

03:21:25.720 --> 03:21:31.400
[Guest]: Now we can say that we can expand the state, but every time we are expanding the scope

03:21:31.400 --> 03:21:36.800
[Guest]: of the state, we are completely forgetting that we have also normalized one extra bit

03:21:36.800 --> 03:21:38.320
[Guest]: of violence.

03:21:38.320 --> 03:21:39.320
[Guest]: And there is no pullback.

03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:44.200
[Guest]: I am not seeing any pullback, there were accidental pullbacks, like in 89, as we can see now,

03:21:44.200 --> 03:21:48.400
[Guest]: the collapse of the Berlin Wall and everyone was so elated that the wall has gone and therefore

03:21:48.400 --> 03:21:50.120
[Guest]: new dawn of freedom, etc.

03:21:50.120 --> 03:21:51.120
[Guest]: But it wasn't.

03:21:51.120 --> 03:21:59.840
[Guest]: 91 to me is another great example, that 91 liberalization in India was state-driven.

03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:04.280
[Guest]: And today, it's the curtsy of the state which is reversing it.

03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:13.440
[Guest]: So we have completely disconnected our values and morality and duty from the kind of instrument

03:22:13.440 --> 03:22:14.440
[Guest]: that we are willing to wield.

03:22:14.440 --> 03:22:15.440
[Guest]: This is hugely costly.

03:22:15.440 --> 03:22:20.360
[Amit Varma]: I'll make a couple of observations and I'll come to a question.

03:22:20.360 --> 03:22:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Observation one is that of course I agree with you that any power that the state takes,

03:22:24.240 --> 03:22:25.240
[Amit Varma]: it never holds it back.

03:22:25.240 --> 03:22:29.400
[Amit Varma]: It's extremely rare, like you pointed out, and therefore it's a problem and it's something

03:22:29.400 --> 03:22:34.400
[Amit Varma]: that we should fight as Thomas Jefferson famously said that, you know, we can't take liberty

03:22:34.400 --> 03:22:35.400
[Amit Varma]: for granted.

03:22:35.400 --> 03:22:37.920
[Amit Varma]: It requires eternal vigilance, in his memorable phrase.

03:22:37.920 --> 03:22:41.880
[Guest]: His phrase was refreshed by the blood of...

03:22:41.880 --> 03:22:43.240
[Guest]: So I'll make my next...

03:22:43.240 --> 03:22:44.760
[Guest]: Eternal vigilance was Acton.

03:22:44.760 --> 03:22:47.680
[Amit Varma]: No, eternal vigilance wasn't Acton, it was Jefferson.

03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:48.680
[Amit Varma]: Acton.

03:22:48.680 --> 03:22:49.680
[Amit Varma]: Okay, whatever.

03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:55.080
[Amit Varma]: We'll leave this in the recording so one of us, possibly me, can be proved to be wrong.

03:22:55.080 --> 03:22:56.840
[Amit Varma]: There's no shame in that.

03:22:56.840 --> 03:23:02.240
[Amit Varma]: My second observation is this, that we can evaluate an action by the right thing or the

03:23:02.240 --> 03:23:05.360
[Amit Varma]: right or wrong thing to do through two lenses.

03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:09.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, one is a moral lens, a deontological lens, but to cut away the jargon, the moral

03:23:09.720 --> 03:23:13.880
[Amit Varma]: lens that if we agree coercion is immoral, then if something involves coercion, it is

03:23:13.880 --> 03:23:15.160
[Amit Varma]: wrong period.

03:23:15.160 --> 03:23:19.200
[Amit Varma]: The other which comes into play when you think about what the state should do, where it is

03:23:19.200 --> 03:23:24.360
[Amit Varma]: justified in using coercion, is a utilitarian lens where you say that, you know, the end

03:23:24.360 --> 03:23:28.560
[Amit Varma]: makes it worth it, etc, etc.

03:23:28.560 --> 03:23:33.360
[Amit Varma]: And I am extremely suspicious of utilitarianism because of the Hayek's knowledge problem that

03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:36.160
[Amit Varma]: you can never actually know the outcome of anything.

03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:39.840
[Amit Varma]: And whenever you project a particular outcome while designing a policy, all your biases

03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:42.680
[Amit Varma]: will come into play and your ignorance will come into play.

03:23:42.680 --> 03:23:46.760
[Amit Varma]: And we should be wary of utilitarianism because you might get locked in, you might get locked

03:23:46.760 --> 03:23:47.760
[Amit Varma]: in.

03:23:47.760 --> 03:23:53.240
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, when the lockdown was called, it was called on a utilitarian calculation

03:23:53.240 --> 03:23:55.440
[Amit Varma]: that something really bad may happen.

03:23:55.440 --> 03:23:57.240
[Amit Varma]: And of course, this is also bad.

03:23:57.240 --> 03:24:00.000
[Amit Varma]: But we got to do this, we got to choose this over the other.

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:03.040
[Amit Varma]: Now my question to you is, let's take a thought experiment.

03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:07.900
[Amit Varma]: Now COVID, we were in a fog of information, then we understand it a little better now.

03:24:07.900 --> 03:24:13.440
[Amit Varma]: But let's say that there was a pandemic, which had, let's say an R, which is how many person

03:24:13.440 --> 03:24:18.360
[Amit Varma]: an average person spreads it to, an R of three, which is very high, and a fatality rate of

03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:20.960
[Amit Varma]: 50%, which is also very high.

03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:22.260
[Amit Varma]: Would you then call a lockdown?

03:24:22.260 --> 03:24:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Is there any rate at which you would say a lockdown is justified?

03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:30.280
[Amit Varma]: Like what if mathematically, it was inevitable, that if we don't call a lockdown, everybody

03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:31.920
[Amit Varma]: will at some point die?

03:24:31.920 --> 03:24:34.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, at what point do you say that a lockdown is justified?

03:24:34.640 --> 03:24:38.800
[Amit Varma]: To me, this is a thought experiment.

03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:44.540
[Guest]: I look at it beyond the pandemic.

03:24:44.540 --> 03:24:48.760
[Guest]: One reason being that something has been with me for much longer than the pandemic is very

03:24:48.760 --> 03:24:49.760
[Guest]: new.

03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:53.120
[Guest]: So the knowledge problem is much greater.

03:24:53.120 --> 03:24:56.080
[Guest]: But in my thought experiment, I've laid it out.

03:24:56.080 --> 03:25:01.500
[Guest]: To me, I'm using an analogy to hopefully to get to that.

03:25:01.500 --> 03:25:05.880
[Guest]: That Newton's third law, you know, very famous school students know it, you know, action

03:25:05.880 --> 03:25:11.080
[Guest]: reaction, politicians use it, whatever.

03:25:11.080 --> 03:25:19.720
[Guest]: But does it actually, has there been any engineer who's been able to craft that law into action?

03:25:19.720 --> 03:25:22.200
[Guest]: Even nature has not.

03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:25.560
[Guest]: Okay, I'm an art student, I'm very ignorant, what is that law?

03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:30.240
[Guest]: That is, you know, every action would have an equal reaction, condition that there is

03:25:30.240 --> 03:25:31.240
[Guest]: no friction.

03:25:31.240 --> 03:25:32.240
[Guest]: Right?

03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:36.160
[Guest]: So, the two balls, two planets, two stars will come and go, come and go, bounce each

03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:39.920
[Guest]: other indefinitely, because there's no friction.

03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:40.920
[Guest]: Right?

03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:41.920
[Guest]: That's the law.

03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:43.840
[Guest]: That's true.

03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:47.800
[Guest]: Provided those conditions apply.

03:25:47.800 --> 03:25:54.640
[Guest]: And even nature, you know, the ultimate reality as far as we can conceive it, even nature

03:25:54.640 --> 03:26:03.720
[Guest]: hasn't been able to create that ideal situation ever, which is why truth is a pursuit.

03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:07.640
[Guest]: These challenges will come, pandemic, lockdown, whatever, whatever.

03:26:07.640 --> 03:26:13.280
[Guest]: The question is, are we recognizing where we might err and therefore figuring out from

03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:15.760
[Guest]: the beginning that how to hold the line?

03:26:15.760 --> 03:26:22.960
[Guest]: Otherwise, I can document from 1947 or 46 or whatever, when the Second World War ended,

03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:29.360
[Guest]: the whole world, not just China and the Soviet Union and all the rest, whole world has incrementally

03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:33.600
[Guest]: moved towards enhancing the state and normalizing violence.

03:26:33.600 --> 03:26:41.320
[Guest]: Now the violence is, you know, I agree with Steven Pinker, that the physical form of violence,

03:26:41.320 --> 03:26:44.760
[Guest]: you know, may have decreased, which is true.

03:26:44.760 --> 03:26:49.960
[Guest]: But the coercive form of violence hasn't, it has expanded all around, which to me, you

03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:53.800
[Guest]: know, it is not because we don't need to do, there could be circumstances where we need

03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:55.560
[Guest]: exceptions and we need to figure out.

03:26:55.560 --> 03:27:01.560
[Guest]: But if we lose that line, which we have, the whole world seems to have lost that line,

03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:05.920
[Guest]: that where is that line where we are going to, at least a recognition of that line.

03:27:05.920 --> 03:27:07.600
[Guest]: Today, it is a blank check.

03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:14.440
[Guest]: All of us expect in the name of our rights, that let's take a claim, the state will deliver.

03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:18.560
[Guest]: If we have the numbers, if we have the votes, we can get to whatever.

03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:23.960
[Guest]: To me, that line has become invisible.

03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:27.640
[Guest]: In fact, even in our imagination, is a huge cost.

03:27:27.640 --> 03:27:28.640
[Amit Varma]: So here's the thing.

03:27:28.640 --> 03:27:29.640
[Amit Varma]: I agree with that.

03:27:29.640 --> 03:27:34.800
[Amit Varma]: I agree with that so strongly that I will urge listeners to rewind this as it were and

03:27:34.800 --> 03:27:37.040
[Amit Varma]: listen to what you just said one more time.

03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:38.480
[Amit Varma]: That strongly I agree with it.

03:27:38.480 --> 03:27:42.160
[Amit Varma]: But you're not answering the question and the question to me is important because, you

03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:45.960
[Amit Varma]: know, the recognition that there is a state is a recognition that there are exceptions.

03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:51.000
[Amit Varma]: So going back to the thought experiment, you know, at what point would you say a lockdown

03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:52.000
[Amit Varma]: is justified?

03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:53.000
[Amit Varma]: Where do you draw the line?

03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.840
[Amit Varma]: You said about holding the line against state overreach.

03:27:55.840 --> 03:28:00.280
[Amit Varma]: What I have increasingly seen is that, you know, you and I are thinking this out, we

03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:02.680
[Amit Varma]: are thrashing it out, we're looking at all the different angles.

03:28:02.680 --> 03:28:05.920
[Amit Varma]: In this particular case, I recognize that there are trade-offs, that whatever a government

03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:09.480
[Amit Varma]: is to do, the costs are seen and the benefits are unseen.

03:28:09.480 --> 03:28:12.400
[Amit Varma]: You can't see the lives you save, you can see the lives that go, whether you call a

03:28:12.400 --> 03:28:14.120
[Amit Varma]: lockdown or the other way around.

03:28:14.120 --> 03:28:18.120
[Amit Varma]: But the positions many people took on this depends on which tribe they are from.

03:28:18.120 --> 03:28:21.720
[Amit Varma]: So Trump did not call a lockdown, so people are anti-lockdown there on the right.

03:28:21.720 --> 03:28:25.000
[Amit Varma]: But here on the right, Modi called a lockdown, so people were pro-lockdown.

03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:26.820
[Amit Varma]: And these positions are kind of hardened.

03:28:26.820 --> 03:28:31.640
[Amit Varma]: But I'm just trying to figure it out on my own because I still think we don't have enough

03:28:31.640 --> 03:28:36.880
[Amit Varma]: knowledge on whether a lockdown and what extent of lockdown was the right decision then, though

03:28:36.880 --> 03:28:40.480
[Amit Varma]: at that time it seemed sensible to me, given the fog of knowledge.

03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:44.640
[Amit Varma]: But I would say that there are some circumstances when a lockdown is necessary and some when

03:28:44.640 --> 03:28:46.400
[Amit Varma]: they're absolutely not.

03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:48.400
[Amit Varma]: So is that something that you agree with?

03:28:48.400 --> 03:28:53.400
[Amit Varma]: Is there a condition in which you would say, if the R is 3 and if we know that 50 lakh

03:28:53.400 --> 03:28:57.720
[Amit Varma]: people will die, 5 crore people will die, whatever the number is, at what point do you

03:28:57.720 --> 03:28:59.680
[Amit Varma]: say that lockdown is necessary?

03:28:59.680 --> 03:29:03.000
[Guest]: Would you ever say that?

03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:09.560
[Guest]: You know, as an engineer, as a trained engineer, I mean my education is engineering.

03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:11.600
[Guest]: I get the knowledge problem, don't bring that up.

03:29:11.600 --> 03:29:12.600
[Guest]: No, not the knowledge problem.

03:29:12.600 --> 03:29:13.600
[Guest]: This is an experiment.

03:29:13.600 --> 03:29:14.600
[Guest]: Not the knowledge problem.

03:29:14.600 --> 03:29:15.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:29:15.600 --> 03:29:24.360
[Guest]: It's the lack of even recognition in our imagination that what is the nature of the problem.

03:29:24.360 --> 03:29:29.320
[Guest]: That you know, it's like, it's like what you said, you know, the wars might happen, some

03:29:29.320 --> 03:29:34.080
[Guest]: people may cheat, Ramayana Mahabharata, the war would be fought, not in an ideal situation

03:29:34.080 --> 03:29:36.080
[Guest]: because the concretes are never ideal.

03:29:36.080 --> 03:29:41.080
[Guest]: So there could be situations where people may do lockdown, people may not do lockdown.

03:29:41.080 --> 03:29:43.160
[Guest]: But to me, that's not the point.

03:29:43.160 --> 03:29:46.640
[Guest]: The point is, firstly, what's the process through which we are going to arrive at that

03:29:46.640 --> 03:29:52.760
[Guest]: kind of a conclusion and more drastically, and which is what modern politics and particularly

03:29:52.760 --> 03:29:59.880
[Guest]: Gandhian politics should teach us, that have we, did we prepare the ground, that is the

03:29:59.880 --> 03:30:06.120
[Guest]: popular awareness and the participation in the process, so that there is a deepening

03:30:06.120 --> 03:30:09.760
[Guest]: of awareness about where the line is, so that it can be pulled back.

03:30:09.760 --> 03:30:14.760
[Guest]: So if we have not done all that, then to me, if you do this, we are on a downhill.

03:30:14.760 --> 03:30:19.320
[Amit Varma]: Bhai, I agree with all that, but you're giving abstract answers to a concrete question.

03:30:19.320 --> 03:30:23.760
[Guest]: I wouldn't do that, if you want to really ask me, ask me personally, you would never

03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:24.760
[Amit Varma]: have a lockdown.

03:30:24.760 --> 03:30:25.760
[Amit Varma]: I would never have a lockdown.

03:30:25.760 --> 03:30:26.760
[Amit Varma]: Never.

03:30:26.760 --> 03:30:27.760
[Guest]: Even if everyone is guaranteed to die.

03:30:27.760 --> 03:30:34.440
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, because even I will die, but I would not impose, I would not try to impose

03:30:34.440 --> 03:30:40.560
[Guest]: my will without first ensuring that there is firstly, I know the knowledge problem has

03:30:40.560 --> 03:30:42.800
[Guest]: been overcome to the extent it can be overcome.

03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:49.920
[Guest]: And secondly, that the wider society in which I am one, is in sync with and realizing the

03:30:49.920 --> 03:30:50.920
[Guest]: consequences.

03:30:50.920 --> 03:30:56.240
[Guest]: To me, can there be a greater this thing we all laugh at now, you know, it's quite common

03:30:56.240 --> 03:30:59.720
[Guest]: now to laugh at Francis Fukuyama because of end of history.

03:30:59.720 --> 03:31:00.720
[Guest]: Which is misinterpreted.

03:31:00.720 --> 03:31:01.720
[Guest]: He never said that.

03:31:01.720 --> 03:31:02.720
[Guest]: Yeah, he never said that.

03:31:02.720 --> 03:31:03.720
[Guest]: He's a great, great, great.

03:31:03.720 --> 03:31:04.720
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

03:31:04.720 --> 03:31:07.360
[Guest]: He's a very, I mean, a deep thinker.

03:31:07.360 --> 03:31:14.480
[Guest]: I mean, one has to, so this is a misinterpretation, just like I believe you partly misinterpreted

03:31:14.480 --> 03:31:16.120
[Guest]: Gandhi, Him Swaraj and all the rest.

03:31:16.120 --> 03:31:17.320
[Guest]: We can have another discussion on that.

03:31:17.320 --> 03:31:18.320
[Guest]: I don't want to go into that.

03:31:18.320 --> 03:31:21.880
[Guest]: Or people can read Him Swaraj for themselves and read his work.

03:31:21.880 --> 03:31:22.880
[Guest]: It's a short book.

03:31:22.880 --> 03:31:24.640
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a short book.

03:31:24.640 --> 03:31:29.760
[Guest]: And like I did, it will, it is likely, and at least for me, it'll, it'll give you new

03:31:29.760 --> 03:31:32.440
[Guest]: meanings from what he's saying.

03:31:32.440 --> 03:31:36.800
[Guest]: So we can, we can discuss that separately, because then it's a bit more compromise.

03:31:36.800 --> 03:31:42.480
[Guest]: Next thing is that as, and this is what gets me to the early points that I was saying about

03:31:42.480 --> 03:31:45.680
[Guest]: public and the policy.

03:31:45.680 --> 03:31:53.480
[Guest]: If we are not going to engage with the public to make them realize the implications, make

03:31:53.480 --> 03:31:58.200
[Guest]: the whole society aware of the implications of what's going to happen, we are digging

03:31:58.200 --> 03:32:01.200
[Guest]: our grave.

03:32:01.200 --> 03:32:08.840
[Guest]: Gandhi's single biggest success or his effort was focused on raising this sensibility among

03:32:08.840 --> 03:32:12.360
[Guest]: the people.

03:32:12.360 --> 03:32:15.480
[Guest]: Everything else to me is secondary.

03:32:15.480 --> 03:32:22.200
[Guest]: We today have outsourced citizenship, literally.

03:32:22.200 --> 03:32:24.960
[Guest]: We expect somebody else to take care of everything that we want.

03:32:24.960 --> 03:32:26.800
[Amit Varma]: That's a lovely phrase, outsourced citizenship.

03:32:26.800 --> 03:32:27.800
[Guest]: Yeah, we have.

03:32:27.800 --> 03:32:31.180
[Guest]: And it's a tragedy, it's going to cost us.

03:32:31.180 --> 03:32:35.880
[Guest]: And this policy, in this approach, you know, that is why means become so important.

03:32:35.880 --> 03:32:40.360
[Guest]: Because we have ignored the means through which we have arrived at that conclusion,

03:32:40.360 --> 03:32:41.360
[Guest]: we have dug our grave.

03:32:41.360 --> 03:32:44.560
[Guest]: It'll be a Herculean challenge trying to come out of it.

03:32:44.560 --> 03:32:49.680
[Guest]: Because in the last 100, 150 years, the society, because, and you know, this is a distinction

03:32:49.680 --> 03:32:53.160
[Guest]: I recently realized, I had read about it, but I had not really realized it.

03:32:53.160 --> 03:32:57.360
[Guest]: I don't know if I had shared it with you earlier.

03:32:57.360 --> 03:33:03.800
[Guest]: What we are confronting today is a bottom-up totalitarianism, not a top-down authoritarianism.

03:33:03.800 --> 03:33:04.800
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

03:33:04.800 --> 03:33:05.800
[Guest]: That's a very good phrase.

03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:06.800
[Guest]: Bottom-up.

03:33:06.800 --> 03:33:07.800
[Guest]: It's not my phrase.

03:33:07.800 --> 03:33:12.760
[Guest]: I think Hyde or somebody else, I listened to it and I've been re-listening and rethinking

03:33:12.760 --> 03:33:13.760
[Guest]: this.

03:33:13.760 --> 03:33:16.320
[Guest]: And it's true.

03:33:16.320 --> 03:33:20.960
[Guest]: Authoritarians can collapse, either because of counter-revolution, coup, palace coup,

03:33:20.960 --> 03:33:24.560
[Guest]: people revolution, whatever, whatever.

03:33:24.560 --> 03:33:26.200
[Guest]: Totalitarians don't collapse.

03:33:26.200 --> 03:33:31.440
[Guest]: If they collapse, or when they do, they take the whole society down.

03:33:31.440 --> 03:33:36.240
[Guest]: Hitler was one of only the latest, or the recent, and the most memorable, tragic example

03:33:36.240 --> 03:33:37.800
[Guest]: of that.

03:33:37.800 --> 03:33:41.120
[Guest]: Because the support base is not coming from the willpower of the leader, no matter what

03:33:41.120 --> 03:33:42.120
[Amit Varma]: he claims.

03:33:42.120 --> 03:33:44.280
[Amit Varma]: The demand is providing the supply.

03:33:44.280 --> 03:33:45.280
[Guest]: Correct.

03:33:45.280 --> 03:33:47.040
[Guest]: Which is why we need to prepare the ground.

03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:50.200
[Guest]: Which is why I tried to shift from policy to public.

03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:53.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's one place where Gandhi was spot on, where I absolutely agree with him.

03:33:53.800 --> 03:33:54.800
[Amit Varma]: Spot on.

03:33:54.800 --> 03:33:55.800
[Amit Varma]: Completely.

03:33:55.800 --> 03:33:56.800
[Guest]: It has to be bottom-up.

03:33:56.800 --> 03:34:02.520
[Guest]: And that is the power of today's modern totalitarianism, and you can see it everywhere.

03:34:02.520 --> 03:34:07.560
[Guest]: Every society is now going through it, including the so-called free world of the West.

03:34:07.560 --> 03:34:13.200
[Guest]: It's amazing how quickly they've adapted to this new normal.

03:34:13.200 --> 03:34:16.280
[Guest]: Each side, and which is why we need to rethink politics.

03:34:16.280 --> 03:34:21.160
[Guest]: Because this is happening in public eye, through the political process, because the political

03:34:21.160 --> 03:34:27.720
[Guest]: process is increasingly geared to capitalizing on the us versus them, rather than political

03:34:27.720 --> 03:34:31.960
[Guest]: process as it happens in a family, that you figure out what dispute to resolve, how much

03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:37.120
[Guest]: resource to allocation, within a certain modicum of force, or authority of parents, and certain

03:34:37.120 --> 03:34:38.120
[Guest]: modicum of negotiation.

03:34:38.120 --> 03:34:42.680
[Guest]: You know, you may say that this weekend we'll go, you'll buy a book, next weekend you'll

03:34:42.680 --> 03:34:43.680
[Guest]: go to a movie.

03:34:43.680 --> 03:34:45.880
[Guest]: You do all such juggling act.

03:34:45.880 --> 03:34:51.440
[Guest]: You know, so we shift our priorities, preferences, from the immediate to the next, etc. etc.

03:34:51.440 --> 03:34:54.440
[Guest]: We do it all the time.

03:34:54.440 --> 03:34:55.440
[Guest]: To me, this is fundamental.

03:34:55.440 --> 03:34:57.000
[Guest]: We are digging our own grave.

03:34:57.000 --> 03:34:59.320
[Guest]: We are digging our own grave.

03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:04.360
[Guest]: So without that context, which is why engineering to me, this wouldn't have come to me, had

03:35:04.360 --> 03:35:08.520
[Guest]: I not been rethinking Newton's third law, or any law for that matter.

03:35:08.520 --> 03:35:10.520
[Guest]: Because third law is the most common way of rethinking that.

03:35:10.520 --> 03:35:12.920
[Guest]: You know, for instance, we are sitting in a room.

03:35:12.920 --> 03:35:15.160
[Guest]: This room is perhaps 10 feet.

03:35:15.160 --> 03:35:16.160
[Amit Varma]: I don't know.

03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:17.160
[Amit Varma]: Whatever.

03:35:17.160 --> 03:35:18.160
[Guest]: Whatever.

03:35:18.160 --> 03:35:21.280
[Guest]: Can we measure it to its ultimate precision?

03:35:21.280 --> 03:35:23.920
[Guest]: We can't.

03:35:23.920 --> 03:35:28.520
[Guest]: We measure it only to the context to which it is necessary.

03:35:28.520 --> 03:35:31.480
[Guest]: You know, so the concrete architect would have needed something else.

03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:35.000
[Guest]: The old-time stone architecture would have needed something else.

03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:38.840
[Guest]: The modern architecture, which might be whatever, titanium or whatever, whatever, would have

03:35:38.840 --> 03:35:39.840
[Guest]: something else.

03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:40.840
[Unknown]: Yeah.

03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:48.600
[Guest]: To us, to me, what is important is the process through which you are arriving at, and realizing

03:35:48.600 --> 03:35:51.920
[Guest]: the context in its totality.

03:35:51.920 --> 03:35:57.800
[Guest]: That what is economically, politically, socially, technologically viable, and what is going

03:35:57.800 --> 03:36:01.280
[Guest]: to be carried at the fallout.

03:36:01.280 --> 03:36:07.120
[Guest]: To me, you know, to me, in fact, just last night, I think I wrote to a friend, because

03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:11.920
[Guest]: I have most of my engagement interactions personally, which is why I am not in most

03:36:11.920 --> 03:36:16.240
[Guest]: social media groups, because I like to talk to people, I am talking to you, I talk to

03:36:16.240 --> 03:36:17.240
[Guest]: people personally.

03:36:17.240 --> 03:36:27.120
[Guest]: So, I just wrote to her last night, actually, that this is a major challenge, to me it's

03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:33.640
[Guest]: probably the number one challenge, that we are unable to figure out that the line is

03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:34.640
[Guest]: even necessary.

03:36:34.640 --> 03:36:40.400
[Guest]: Forget holding the line, we have completely surrendered that, which is why I said surrendered

03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:45.240
[Guest]: our citizenship, because we the people are to be the sovereign.

03:36:45.240 --> 03:36:48.960
[Guest]: Somebody else is claiming sovereignty, and you look at the other side, that sovereignty,

03:36:48.960 --> 03:36:56.680
[Guest]: whether it is democratic, authoritarian, whatever, that sovereignty of the top is always temporary.

03:36:56.680 --> 03:36:57.880
[Guest]: Why?

03:36:57.880 --> 03:37:01.560
[Guest]: Because either there will be an electoral change, or there will be a biological change,

03:37:01.560 --> 03:37:05.680
[Guest]: that the person at the top will go at one point or the other, and even a natural death.

03:37:05.680 --> 03:37:10.920
[Guest]: Some totalitarians have died that way, you know, Tito, for instance, he died that way

03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:15.040
[Guest]: and he took the whole society with him in Yugoslavia.

03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:23.560
[Guest]: Therefore, that change would be completely outside control, which is why Gandhi's rephrasing

03:37:23.560 --> 03:37:34.880
[Guest]: of politics, and which I came, because between 1989, when V.P. Singh won, till today, most

03:37:34.880 --> 03:37:41.440
[Guest]: of the time, I'll be extremely apprehensive about what we think of politics as such, what

03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:44.640
[Guest]: we generally think of politics.

03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:50.160
[Guest]: But last 5-6 years, because I was rethinking Gandhi as a practitioner, because politics

03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:56.000
[Guest]: is the art of the possible, the practitioner, it's not a theoretical field.

03:37:56.000 --> 03:38:00.640
[Guest]: And that field requires engagement with people.

03:38:00.640 --> 03:38:04.520
[Guest]: That's what Gandhi kind of, you know, I mean, I won't say that this is my final position

03:38:04.520 --> 03:38:08.520
[Guest]: because I can change again if I realise something different.

03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:17.680
[Guest]: But as I stand today, as citizens, our primary responsibility is, or duty, is to reclaim

03:38:17.680 --> 03:38:26.080
[Guest]: our citizenship, which we cannot do if we don't even imagine that there is such a line.

03:38:26.080 --> 03:38:32.120
[Guest]: Today, the social sciences and the physical sciences and now the biological sciences all

03:38:32.120 --> 03:38:35.880
[Guest]: have converged on giving up the line, which is why a right-wing, left-wing, everybody

03:38:35.880 --> 03:38:41.480
[Guest]: can have a lockdown without a bother, because it doesn't exist in popular imagination.

03:38:41.480 --> 03:38:42.480
[Guest]: That's the price.

03:38:42.480 --> 03:38:48.080
[Guest]: Therefore, do whatever, you know, like Krishna, I mean, go to war, do whatever, at some point

03:38:48.080 --> 03:38:51.400
[Guest]: a time might come when a war might be necessary.

03:38:51.400 --> 03:38:53.880
[Guest]: But remember the line.

03:38:53.880 --> 03:38:54.880
[Guest]: Why is it necessary?

03:38:54.880 --> 03:38:58.760
[Guest]: Otherwise, we are sacrificing ourselves, which we are.

03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:05.560
[Guest]: The whole world is sacrificing citizenship and self-sovereignty over all this rest that

03:39:05.560 --> 03:39:06.560
[Guest]: has happened.

03:39:06.560 --> 03:39:07.920
[Guest]: It's a tragedy.

03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:12.480
[Guest]: So in this sense, in the political sense, Gatni has been an eye-opener for me in the

03:39:12.480 --> 03:39:13.480
[Guest]: last 5-6 years.

03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:18.080
[Guest]: Because I had no clue, you know, like most Indians, I'd said, like including coming from

03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:22.160
[Guest]: a political family, that this has degenerated, this, that, and the other.

03:39:22.160 --> 03:39:28.360
[Guest]: But this degeneration is not a kind of a, you know, a black magic by somebody else who

03:39:28.360 --> 03:39:32.920
[Guest]: is kind of a magician, or a witch.

03:39:32.920 --> 03:39:34.720
[Amit Varma]: So let me ask you a question.

03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:36.840
[Amit Varma]: You've travelled a lot across the country.

03:39:36.840 --> 03:39:37.840
[Amit Varma]: You meet people.

03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Is that what you do?

03:39:38.840 --> 03:39:39.840
[Guest]: You meet people more than anyone?

03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:40.840
[Guest]: I try to.

03:39:40.840 --> 03:39:41.840
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:47.800
[Amit Varma]: So, like, my sense of what has happened recently is that Indian society was a, always illiberal,

03:39:47.800 --> 03:39:51.480
[Amit Varma]: though there are threads of liberality, because anything you say about India, the opposite

03:39:51.480 --> 03:39:52.680
[Amit Varma]: is also true.

03:39:52.680 --> 03:39:55.420
[Amit Varma]: But there was an illiberal strain.

03:39:55.420 --> 03:39:59.400
[Amit Varma]: There was also this kind of bigoted Hindutva kind of strain.

03:39:59.400 --> 03:40:02.480
[Amit Varma]: And of course, we contain multitudes, but these strains were there.

03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:04.560
[Amit Varma]: And these strains were never acknowledged.

03:40:04.560 --> 03:40:06.080
[Amit Varma]: They were never worked upon.

03:40:06.080 --> 03:40:07.440
[Amit Varma]: And now they've become dominant.

03:40:07.440 --> 03:40:10.280
[Amit Varma]: In a way, politics has caught up with society.

03:40:10.280 --> 03:40:16.840
[Amit Varma]: And I love the phrase bottom-up totalitarianism, because what I see as happening is that I

03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:21.640
[Amit Varma]: think this movement is really driven from the bottom at this moment in time, that if

03:40:21.640 --> 03:40:23.640
[Amit Varma]: Modi wasn't there, somebody else would be there.

03:40:23.640 --> 03:40:25.640
[Amit Varma]: I think it has nothing to do with Modi or Hindutva.

03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:27.640
[Amit Varma]: It's global, mostly.

03:40:27.640 --> 03:40:28.640
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

03:40:28.640 --> 03:40:33.380
[Amit Varma]: But I'm talking in the context of India, that this is driven, this specific strain, this

03:40:33.380 --> 03:40:39.400
[Amit Varma]: anti-Muslim nature and all of that, whatever is happening, this harkening back to a supposed

03:40:39.400 --> 03:40:44.360
[Amit Varma]: monolithic tradition and that people should wear bindis and all this should happen, which

03:40:44.360 --> 03:40:45.840
[Amit Varma]: is very disturbing to me.

03:40:45.840 --> 03:40:47.480
[Amit Varma]: And I think all of this is coming bottom-up.

03:40:47.480 --> 03:40:51.760
[Amit Varma]: I see it very clearly, you know, Modi and Shah did not cause it.

03:40:51.760 --> 03:40:53.080
[Amit Varma]: The BJP did not cause it.

03:40:53.080 --> 03:40:56.360
[Amit Varma]: And they're riding a tiger which they cannot control.

03:40:56.360 --> 03:40:59.360
[Amit Varma]: They cannot get off.

03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:00.360
[Amit Varma]: And it is what it is.

03:41:00.360 --> 03:41:01.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's going to continue for a while.

03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:07.120
[Amit Varma]: Now you actually meet people, you're not an ivory tower intellectual, as to some extent

03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:08.120
[Guest]: I am.

03:41:08.120 --> 03:41:10.360
[Amit Varma]: At least to an extent I try to, I don't know.

03:41:10.360 --> 03:41:11.920
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense?

03:41:11.920 --> 03:41:15.880
[Amit Varma]: Like my pessimistic sense is that this is who we are, this is what was supposed to happen.

03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:19.040
[Amit Varma]: My optimistic sense is that, listen, we contain multitudes.

03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:24.160
[Amit Varma]: The guy who hates Muslims may also want prosperity for other reasons.

03:41:24.160 --> 03:41:28.400
[Amit Varma]: He may want his kids to go to a good school, he may want a job when his kids grow up.

03:41:28.400 --> 03:41:32.640
[Amit Varma]: He may want a biryani made in a Muslim kitchen.

03:41:32.640 --> 03:41:36.160
[Amit Varma]: So there are multitudes and maybe there is hope in appealing to some other, the better

03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:39.080
[Amit Varma]: angels of their natures, as Pinker might put it.

03:41:39.080 --> 03:41:40.640
[Amit Varma]: And I don't know if that's fruitless optimism.

03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:44.560
[Amit Varma]: So you go out there, you meet people, beyond the bias of your optimism, because I know

03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:48.200
[Amit Varma]: that you have an optimism bias, you believe that the world can be changed like Gandhi

03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:49.200
[Amit Varma]: did.

03:41:49.200 --> 03:41:52.800
[Amit Varma]: Beyond that, if you were to sit back and think about it, what is your sense?

03:41:52.800 --> 03:41:53.800
[Amit Varma]: Should we be hopeful?

03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:58.440
[Guest]: I mean, is there anything, any alternative to hope?

03:41:58.440 --> 03:41:59.440
[Amit Varma]: That's a wrong question.

03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:00.840
[Amit Varma]: Is there a reason for us to be hopeful?

03:42:00.840 --> 03:42:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Like rationally, my brain tells me that no, it's going to get much worse.

03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:10.280
[Guest]: I think it depends on whether we think something can be done.

03:42:10.280 --> 03:42:18.080
[Guest]: More importantly, it is the responsibility of each of us to try to do something.

03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:24.760
[Guest]: To me, that is the bottom line, because the outcome, we can't be sure, obviously.

03:42:24.760 --> 03:42:32.280
[Guest]: But the process of participation and the process of engagement, that we can be.

03:42:32.280 --> 03:42:38.400
[Guest]: The question is whether we think it is useful, you know, useful in the sense of that it may

03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:45.200
[Guest]: initiate or sow the seeds of change at some point at least, or if we give up and say that

03:42:45.200 --> 03:42:47.800
[Guest]: this is a downhill that we are headed.

03:42:47.800 --> 03:42:51.680
[Guest]: So I mean, to me, since I don't know whether I'll of course become extinct, but I don't

03:42:51.680 --> 03:42:54.680
[Guest]: know whether the species will be extinct and what time frame, etc, etc.

03:42:54.680 --> 03:42:59.360
[Guest]: So to me, I mean, there's no alternative but to explore whatever options you have.

03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:01.080
[Amit Varma]: My question is not about what we should do.

03:43:01.080 --> 03:43:05.680
[Amit Varma]: I think both of us, in a sense, take a Lord Krishna approach to this that we can't control

03:43:05.680 --> 03:43:06.680
[Amit Varma]: the outcome.

03:43:06.680 --> 03:43:08.080
[Amit Varma]: We're going to do what we're going to do.

03:43:08.080 --> 03:43:12.000
[Guest]: You know, and I think we should do what we think is the right thing to do.

03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:13.720
[Amit Varma]: My question is about the ground reality.

03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:16.720
[Guest]: Yeah, but the ground reality is us.

03:43:16.720 --> 03:43:17.720
[Guest]: You know, isn't it amazing?

03:43:17.720 --> 03:43:18.720
[Guest]: I'm really surprised.

03:43:18.720 --> 03:43:23.080
[Guest]: I had never experienced it because we had never seen it this way.

03:43:23.080 --> 03:43:34.280
[Guest]: That in my kind of environment, social circles, Hindutva was not imagined.

03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:40.960
[Guest]: Yet it has become so apparent, it may not be dominant yet, but it has become or maybe

03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:50.440
[Guest]: it's even retreating at some places, but it had captured an imagination of a section.

03:43:50.440 --> 03:43:57.880
[Guest]: Which is why, apart and it got reflected in real life, that apart from our dual identity

03:43:57.880 --> 03:44:04.040
[Guest]: in the real world versus the virtual world, the impact was that in real world, even many

03:44:04.040 --> 03:44:11.640
[Guest]: families had a difficult problem having dinner together because the fear of raising issues

03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:13.640
[Amit Varma]: that might blow up.

03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:16.720
[Amit Varma]: Mummy, why didn't you wear a bindi today?

03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:17.720
[Guest]: It might blow up.

03:44:17.720 --> 03:44:21.680
[Guest]: So, that to me is a problem, a huge problem.

03:44:21.680 --> 03:44:30.480
[Guest]: Which means that we are losing the essence of the social dimension of human civilization.

03:44:30.480 --> 03:44:34.920
[Guest]: And that social dimension which has evolved through millions of years, you know, at least

03:44:34.920 --> 03:44:44.120
[Guest]: 2-3 million years since the human race came about, was physical.

03:44:44.120 --> 03:44:48.840
[Guest]: You know, one could be a Shakuni to hide the intention and try to manage, etc, etc.

03:44:48.840 --> 03:44:54.400
[Guest]: But it was just a matter of time before people figured out that this is a Shakuni.

03:44:54.400 --> 03:44:58.640
[Guest]: Because the interactions were physical, the costs and the benefits were enjoyed in a real

03:44:58.640 --> 03:45:06.600
[Guest]: sense, which is what I'm saying that, I mean, apart from all the intellectualization, and

03:45:06.600 --> 03:45:13.560
[Guest]: I know, I mean, I'll not even make a scratch the surface of it, even if I try my best,

03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:21.000
[Guest]: that our first obligation to ourselves and of our kind, that is mankind, society, is

03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:27.400
[Guest]: to reach out, to engage, to re-establish the legitimacy of reaching out and therefore the

03:45:27.400 --> 03:45:30.480
[Guest]: legitimacy of the diversity.

03:45:30.480 --> 03:45:37.480
[Guest]: Because our interactions are always very narrow, we are not, you know, like, we have biryani

03:45:37.480 --> 03:45:38.480
[Guest]: once a month.

03:45:38.480 --> 03:45:40.480
[Guest]: So our interaction is very narrow.

03:45:40.480 --> 03:45:42.480
[Guest]: So should that be the defining criteria?

03:45:42.480 --> 03:45:48.960
[Guest]: You know, so this wall that we have built, this boundary that you said a little earlier,

03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:52.600
[Guest]: is in our mind.

03:45:52.600 --> 03:45:58.680
[Guest]: Which is why to me, it's really, you know, even now, I mean, whenever I went to Jalgaon

03:45:58.680 --> 03:46:05.000
[Guest]: last month, and that was an interior area, therefore you could see the sky so brilliantly.

03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:09.560
[Guest]: Occasionally, even you could see meteors and the satellites moving.

03:46:09.560 --> 03:46:13.920
[Guest]: And you could distinguish that which is a satellite and which is a meteor.

03:46:13.920 --> 03:46:20.080
[Guest]: You know, to me, this is, you know, I mean, this is probably my most optimistic sense,

03:46:20.080 --> 03:46:26.000
[Guest]: that look at the sky and the things might begin to shift because it will give us a perspective,

03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:28.200
[Guest]: because we can all look at the sky.

03:46:28.200 --> 03:46:38.720
[Guest]: But other than that, I think it is our obligation, our duty to reach out if we accept that man

03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:44.160
[Guest]: is a social animal in the society and the state is only a small part of that society

03:46:44.160 --> 03:46:48.840
[Guest]: and evolved at a particular time and kept crashing every few generations.

03:46:48.840 --> 03:46:54.960
[Guest]: So the state part of it, to me, is secondary, necessary, evil, whatever way we want to look

03:46:54.960 --> 03:46:55.960
[Guest]: at it.

03:46:55.960 --> 03:47:02.600
[Guest]: But unless we as people, we as individuals, we as community, we as society are unable

03:47:02.600 --> 03:47:11.360
[Guest]: to realize and recognize the necessity of that line, that where coercion and violence

03:47:11.360 --> 03:47:18.080
[Guest]: will begin and how will we restrain it, we are onto the cannibalistic path.

03:47:18.080 --> 03:47:22.680
[Guest]: It's just a matter of time because we are swallowed, which is why bottom-up totalitarianism

03:47:22.680 --> 03:47:26.040
[Guest]: swallows up the followers and the leaders.

03:47:26.040 --> 03:47:27.440
[Guest]: And it's not just with Hitler.

03:47:27.440 --> 03:47:28.440
[Guest]: Think of the French Revolution.

03:47:28.440 --> 03:47:30.880
[Amit Varma]: It's only colorful, cannibalistic path.

03:47:30.880 --> 03:47:37.120
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, isn't it amazing that the French Revolution consumed its own leaders?

03:47:37.120 --> 03:47:44.080
[Guest]: You know, so graphically, the guillotine not just consumed the king, it consumed them.

03:47:44.080 --> 03:47:45.080
[Amit Varma]: Inevitably.

03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:48.440
[Amit Varma]: I feel like I've been asking you the question, how bad are things and you keep answering

03:47:48.440 --> 03:47:54.000
[Amit Varma]: with we can change it, but which is, of course, inspirational.

03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:56.320
[Guest]: So I don't think we can change it.

03:47:56.320 --> 03:48:01.720
[Guest]: I think, as I said, we got to do what we got to do, is there an option?

03:48:01.720 --> 03:48:02.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:48:02.720 --> 03:48:04.200
[Amit Varma]: Because I don't know whether things will change.

03:48:04.200 --> 03:48:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

03:48:05.200 --> 03:48:10.120
[Amit Varma]: So my final question, and this is based on the work that you did with those tribals for

03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:14.440
[Amit Varma]: forest rights, which you alluded to earlier, and which is in fact documented in this superb

03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:19.400
[Amit Varma]: documentary called India Awakes, which I will link from the show notes.

03:48:19.400 --> 03:48:24.240
[Amit Varma]: And I'll give a CliffsNotes version of it for my listeners, that Barun was essentially

03:48:24.240 --> 03:48:26.440
[Amit Varma]: part of a group of excellent people.

03:48:26.440 --> 03:48:29.720
[Guest]: He was more an observer and a narrator rather than an actual doer.

03:48:29.720 --> 03:48:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Correct.

03:48:30.720 --> 03:48:34.400
[Amit Varma]: But he was part of the, and he will, of course, downplay his role, but he was part of this

03:48:34.400 --> 03:48:38.160
[Amit Varma]: movement with some excellent people and they were trying to get, you know, property rights

03:48:38.160 --> 03:48:43.080
[Amit Varma]: for tribals because property rights is really at the core of so much that he and I believe

03:48:43.080 --> 03:48:46.560
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps we can someday do a separate episode on that.

03:48:46.560 --> 03:48:52.480
[Amit Varma]: And the problem was proving that these people stayed in these particular lands over which

03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:53.720
[Amit Varma]: they wanted property rights.

03:48:53.720 --> 03:48:55.240
[Amit Varma]: Now there is no paperwork, there's nothing.

03:48:55.240 --> 03:48:58.720
[Amit Varma]: How do you prove a thing like that to the government?

03:48:58.720 --> 03:49:04.520
[Amit Varma]: And what Barun and his fellow travelers did was they use Google Earth data to go back

03:49:04.520 --> 03:49:09.320
[Amit Varma]: 15, 20 years, whatever, and actually prove from the data that these people had actually

03:49:09.320 --> 03:49:13.360
[Amit Varma]: lived in and occupied these lands for a specific period of time.

03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:18.240
[Amit Varma]: And this data was so convincing that the government eventually allowed property rights to these

03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:19.240
[Amit Varma]: tribals.

03:49:19.240 --> 03:49:23.160
[Amit Varma]: And then the most interesting part of the story, which comes in the postscript, which

03:49:23.160 --> 03:49:27.280
[Amit Varma]: when you told me I was, I was just knocked off by it, is that for the first time in their

03:49:27.280 --> 03:49:32.160
[Amit Varma]: lives, when they built houses now, they built toilets within those houses because they had

03:49:32.160 --> 03:49:36.080
[Amit Varma]: that sense of permanence that they may not have to move tomorrow.

03:49:36.080 --> 03:49:41.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, just such a sharp example of how incentives can work.

03:49:41.320 --> 03:49:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And when I look at that, it's it seems to me remarkable that tribals who are asserting

03:49:49.440 --> 03:49:55.040
[Amit Varma]: the right over a land rightfully, which where they've lived for hundreds of years, should

03:49:55.040 --> 03:49:59.200
[Amit Varma]: be able to do so with a technology that is so recent.

03:49:59.200 --> 03:50:03.280
[Amit Varma]: And it must have taken such a mental shift on all your parts to even suddenly realize

03:50:03.280 --> 03:50:08.200
[Amit Varma]: that yes, we can use Google Earth data to actually prove all of this and kind of make

03:50:08.200 --> 03:50:09.340
[Amit Varma]: it happen.

03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:12.920
[Amit Varma]: What was that moment like when that realization happens and it all works out?

03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:17.160
[Guest]: Because I think it happened somewhat differently in a sense that I was an outsider.

03:50:17.160 --> 03:50:18.160
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

03:50:18.160 --> 03:50:24.280
[Guest]: Archvaini in Gujarat had been working in the tribal pockets for decades.

03:50:24.280 --> 03:50:28.760
[Guest]: And they have been primarily there initially, they worked a lot on the displacement issue

03:50:28.760 --> 03:50:33.280
[Guest]: rehabilitation after the dam, the Narmada Dam.

03:50:33.280 --> 03:50:37.440
[Guest]: So they had roots in the communities in which they worked.

03:50:37.440 --> 03:50:42.640
[Guest]: And they were part of the movement which I observed from the sidelines, which tried to

03:50:42.640 --> 03:50:49.800
[Guest]: enact the Forest Rights Act, which would recognize the rights of the communities that live there.

03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:53.640
[Guest]: Then the question came, okay, we recognize it in the abstract.

03:50:53.640 --> 03:50:56.720
[Guest]: How do we define it in concrete?

03:50:56.720 --> 03:51:02.520
[Guest]: You know, how do you know that my arm is not reaching your nose?

03:51:02.520 --> 03:51:13.060
[Guest]: And there I think it was Ambrish Mehta, who is one of the core of the Archvaini, looking

03:51:13.060 --> 03:51:19.600
[Guest]: at how to get that and that was almost coincided, it was a coincidence again, that Google Earth

03:51:19.600 --> 03:51:21.640
[Guest]: was beginning to come on.

03:51:21.640 --> 03:51:27.160
[Guest]: You know, second half of, you know, after 2006-7-8, Google map was just beginning to

03:51:27.160 --> 03:51:32.640
[Guest]: appear and we could give and then what happened was that archival maps, that is, Google was

03:51:32.640 --> 03:51:36.720
[Guest]: also trying to put up as, you know, going back as much as they could, because initially

03:51:36.720 --> 03:51:39.880
[Guest]: the maps were all the later ones that they had.

03:51:39.880 --> 03:51:47.840
[Guest]: So they went back and that kind of made Ambrish realize first that if we could get maps of

03:51:47.840 --> 03:51:53.240
[Guest]: 2000, I mean these images, they were not maps actually, these satellite images from 2004-5-6

03:51:53.240 --> 03:52:00.040
[Guest]: etc., you might have a much more granular picture of, because a right would have to be determined

03:52:00.040 --> 03:52:01.040
[Guest]: on the ground.

03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:03.240
[Guest]: So it's a concrete thing, it's not an abstract thing, freedom of speech.

03:52:03.240 --> 03:52:04.240
[Guest]: You know, it's a concrete thing.

03:52:04.240 --> 03:52:06.240
[Guest]: So it has to be determined.

03:52:06.240 --> 03:52:08.600
[Guest]: How will we determine?

03:52:08.600 --> 03:52:12.320
[Guest]: One is you determine culture etc., which is provision is there, you know, the elders agree

03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:13.320
[Guest]: etc.

03:52:13.320 --> 03:52:16.280
[Guest]: But the state would typically say that there is an interest in all of you to agree among

03:52:16.280 --> 03:52:17.440
[Guest]: each other to claim this.

03:52:17.440 --> 03:52:23.000
[Guest]: So this was Ambrish's, I mean, and to me, I was technologically novice, in fact, one

03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:28.720
[Guest]: of my first trips during this period when I went to Gujarat to see actually this, that

03:52:28.720 --> 03:52:33.400
[Guest]: the first time I realized that I had another phone at that time, the Nokia, that it had

03:52:33.400 --> 03:52:39.600
[Guest]: a GPS in it and a neighbor who was traveling in the train showed me how to use it because

03:52:39.600 --> 03:52:44.960
[Guest]: I had never even known what a GPS was, even in my own phone, because I never needed to

03:52:44.960 --> 03:52:45.960
[Guest]: use it.

03:52:45.960 --> 03:52:49.480
[Guest]: I had a Google map that I'll use to come to this recording studio, looking at the map.

03:52:49.480 --> 03:52:51.840
[Guest]: Yeah, so there was nothing.

03:52:51.840 --> 03:52:58.760
[Guest]: So firstly, that was first step that I think Ambrish did, figured that the Google map particularly

03:52:58.760 --> 03:53:03.960
[Guest]: going back and so he actually corresponded with Google, seeking that, please see if you

03:53:03.960 --> 03:53:08.480
[Guest]: can provide maps going back.

03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:10.200
[Guest]: So that was one step.

03:53:10.200 --> 03:53:14.400
[Guest]: Then the question was, the maps themselves are not sufficient.

03:53:14.400 --> 03:53:18.480
[Guest]: Because how do you know what you are seeing on the map is actually the place or what we

03:53:18.480 --> 03:53:21.640
[Guest]: see on the image is actually the village that you are in.

03:53:21.640 --> 03:53:26.360
[Guest]: So that's where the GPS came in and that was another kind of technological coincidence

03:53:26.360 --> 03:53:31.600
[Guest]: that the availability and the applicability and access to GPS kept increasing, first through

03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:36.040
[Guest]: the phones and then through the, through handheld simple devices, which are pretty low cost

03:53:36.040 --> 03:53:42.800
[Guest]: and with a degree of accuracy that you can tolerate.

03:53:42.800 --> 03:53:48.560
[Guest]: That then gave this idea that this can be done, that you would know what place where,

03:53:48.560 --> 03:53:51.960
[Guest]: because image doesn't tell you that is exactly what you are seeing or where you are.

03:53:51.960 --> 03:53:55.560
[Guest]: So those two correlations you can make that this is where you are and that's the image

03:53:55.560 --> 03:53:59.560
[Guest]: of the place you are seeing.

03:53:59.560 --> 03:54:05.880
[Guest]: My surprise was not so much the technological change because technological change we have

03:54:05.880 --> 03:54:09.160
[Guest]: seen, I grew up in an area where at a time when there was no telephone.

03:54:09.160 --> 03:54:13.960
[Guest]: I mean, yeah, literally, I waited five, four years in Delhi waiting for a landline connection.

03:54:13.960 --> 03:54:19.040
[Guest]: So I have spent that time so that technological change doesn't surprise me as much.

03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:24.640
[Guest]: What surprised me was that in one of our first visit when I went with Ambrish and Drupty

03:54:24.640 --> 03:54:30.920
[Guest]: and others, that's why I need to go to their field and see this, was the ease with which

03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:37.840
[Guest]: a semi-literate person could understand what was being sought and figure out why and how

03:54:37.840 --> 03:54:43.360
[Guest]: to operate that GPS.

03:54:43.360 --> 03:54:50.040
[Guest]: That to me was a surprise because here was I, say 15, 10, 12 years ago, an engineering

03:54:50.040 --> 03:54:58.440
[Guest]: graduate, had no idea what GPS was and here were people who many of whom at that time

03:54:58.440 --> 03:55:03.840
[Guest]: didn't even have mobiles and the mobiles were that old type, you know, the button type,

03:55:03.840 --> 03:55:07.960
[Guest]: not these feature phones as they call it.

03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:09.480
[Guest]: So some of them had that.

03:55:09.480 --> 03:55:10.480
[Guest]: Connectivity was extremely poor.

03:55:10.480 --> 03:55:13.760
[Guest]: You had to go to a hilltop to get connectivity.

03:55:13.760 --> 03:55:20.900
[Guest]: But they could relate and I began to realize, I began to experience what Hayek was talking

03:55:20.900 --> 03:55:24.240
[Guest]: about discrete and dispersed information.

03:55:24.240 --> 03:55:28.880
[Guest]: That people living on the ground know their community and their terrain like the back

03:55:28.880 --> 03:55:34.920
[Guest]: of their hand, which I sitting anywhere else or anybody else sitting somewhere else would

03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:35.920
[Guest]: never know.

03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:39.080
[Guest]: So they already know what they have.

03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:42.400
[Guest]: The question only is to figure out through technology so that other people who do not

03:55:42.400 --> 03:55:46.120
[Guest]: know can figure out that this is really true.

03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:50.160
[Guest]: So they took it like fish in water, as they say.

03:55:50.160 --> 03:55:56.600
[Guest]: That surprised me, really surprised me and since then Ambrish and Archvaini, Drupty and

03:55:56.600 --> 03:56:04.520
[Guest]: others have reached hundreds of villages primarily in Gujarat to train people, local community

03:56:04.520 --> 03:56:05.800
[Guest]: to undertake it.

03:56:05.800 --> 03:56:07.840
[Guest]: So that, you know, it is lived experience.

03:56:07.840 --> 03:56:13.240
[Guest]: The strength of this movement in their part of India is precisely because the ownership

03:56:13.240 --> 03:56:18.920
[Guest]: is claimed not by Archvaini as such, but by the people themselves because they have figured

03:56:18.920 --> 03:56:22.840
[Guest]: out, they have understood what is being sought and how and how they can, you know.

03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:25.440
[Guest]: So they are participating in the process.

03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:29.680
[Guest]: That brings me to the point that we had been discussing for last two hours.

03:56:29.680 --> 03:56:32.880
[Guest]: The focus on the process, the focus on the public.

03:56:32.880 --> 03:56:38.360
[Guest]: I didn't realize it as much as I am talking now, but I realized that the people can do

03:56:38.360 --> 03:56:39.360
[Guest]: it.

03:56:39.360 --> 03:56:44.120
[Guest]: I mean, it's amazing how much people can do without their formal education, which kind

03:56:44.120 --> 03:56:49.040
[Guest]: of reinforce something that I've been telling my liberal, libertarian friends for years,

03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:55.200
[Guest]: that we are barking up the wrong tree by saying that we need awareness and education.

03:56:55.200 --> 03:56:57.440
[Guest]: It has to be put in the context.

03:56:57.440 --> 03:57:03.160
[Guest]: You know, lived experience of people where those awareness and education could help.

03:57:03.160 --> 03:57:07.080
[Guest]: This was a demonstration of that in my own lifetime.

03:57:07.080 --> 03:57:08.080
[Guest]: So I know.

03:57:08.080 --> 03:57:11.640
[Guest]: So, I mean, what they achieved and how they did it to me is a phenomenal learning for

03:57:11.640 --> 03:57:15.000
[Guest]: me because I had no idea that this could happen.

03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:18.680
[Guest]: You know, property rights to me was an abstraction.

03:57:18.680 --> 03:57:21.320
[Guest]: For them it was life and death.

03:57:21.320 --> 03:57:25.160
[Guest]: So who has an incentive to grasp it?

03:57:25.160 --> 03:57:26.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:57:26.160 --> 03:57:29.880
[Guest]: So what this, I mean, of course, there are a lot of limitations.

03:57:29.880 --> 03:57:34.560
[Guest]: They have had to fight legal cases and it has gone on for 10 years till it's been going

03:57:34.560 --> 03:57:37.360
[Guest]: on the way the Indian system works.

03:57:37.360 --> 03:57:39.560
[Guest]: But to me, this just provides a glimpse.

03:57:39.560 --> 03:57:45.120
[Guest]: Just like Sharad Joshi's movement in 2000 provided a glimpse of what's possible when

03:57:45.120 --> 03:57:51.800
[Guest]: you are able to connect with people on terrains or figuratively, terrains in which it matters

03:57:51.800 --> 03:57:52.800
[Guest]: to them.

03:57:52.800 --> 03:57:58.320
[Guest]: So it kind of opened my eyes, actually concretized what I was abstracting.

03:57:58.320 --> 03:58:02.520
[Guest]: You know, like high discrete dispersed information, etc. was abstracting.

03:58:02.520 --> 03:58:03.520
[Guest]: But here I was concretizing.

03:58:03.520 --> 03:58:06.480
[Guest]: So to me, it was, I mean, it transformed my life.

03:58:06.480 --> 03:58:12.480
[Guest]: Forget about the, you know, Amrish and all are still at it, trying to change the community

03:58:12.480 --> 03:58:15.160
[Guest]: and get some benefits.

03:58:15.160 --> 03:58:18.320
[Guest]: And secondly, the consequence was not just the toilet.

03:58:18.320 --> 03:58:22.840
[Guest]: That came later or perhaps together.

03:58:22.840 --> 03:58:28.880
[Guest]: The main consequence, which to me was the sense of dignity.

03:58:28.880 --> 03:58:34.680
[Guest]: That here were people who were beginning to climb the ladder of citizenship.

03:58:34.680 --> 03:58:38.360
[Guest]: That they are equal partners as citizens of this country.

03:58:38.360 --> 03:58:42.400
[Guest]: To me, there can't be anything, no substitute for that.

03:58:42.400 --> 03:58:43.400
[Guest]: The rights are no rights.

03:58:43.400 --> 03:58:44.400
[Guest]: To me, it's phenomenal.

03:58:44.400 --> 03:58:48.840
[Guest]: You know, people said that, that, you know, in fact, one example, almost 10 years ago

03:58:48.840 --> 03:58:56.160
[Guest]: now or maybe around, may not be 10, is not 10, probably 2013, 14, 15, whatever.

03:58:56.160 --> 03:59:00.840
[Guest]: In one place, we had gone to a village, you know, so Trupti Amrish, Arch Vaini had organized

03:59:00.840 --> 03:59:05.040
[Guest]: a meeting and I had gone just like so many others have been, just to see what people

03:59:05.040 --> 03:59:08.760
[Guest]: think and believe and act.

03:59:08.760 --> 03:59:12.360
[Guest]: So one man was narrating his story.

03:59:12.360 --> 03:59:17.480
[Guest]: And this is one of those moments from the ground that I'll probably never forget.

03:59:17.480 --> 03:59:19.480
[Guest]: One middle-aged man narrating his story.

03:59:19.480 --> 03:59:23.800
[Guest]: He told about all this map, application, this, that and the other, rejection, reapplication,

03:59:23.800 --> 03:59:24.800
[Guest]: review and all that.

03:59:24.800 --> 03:59:31.680
[Guest]: But to me, what remains is not all that, is that he said, previously when we used to go

03:59:31.680 --> 03:59:36.400
[Guest]: to a government office, whichever, Tassilda or Panchayat or whatever, they would never

03:59:36.400 --> 03:59:39.040
[Guest]: even ask us to sit down.

03:59:39.040 --> 03:59:45.800
[Guest]: Today, they ask us to sit down and sometimes even offer us a glass of water.

03:59:45.800 --> 03:59:50.680
[Guest]: That to me was eye-opening.

03:59:50.680 --> 03:59:52.880
[Guest]: That's what citizenship is.

03:59:52.880 --> 03:59:55.280
[Guest]: That's what citizenship can be.

03:59:55.280 --> 03:59:56.280
[Guest]: That's what we need to reclaim.

03:59:56.280 --> 03:59:57.280
[Guest]: There's no substitute.

03:59:57.280 --> 03:59:59.920
[Guest]: There is no substitute.

03:59:59.920 --> 04:00:07.760
[Guest]: I would never have realized what is citizenship about and the significance of the process

04:00:07.760 --> 04:00:14.920
[Guest]: unless I had actually experienced it and I still didn't grasp it till I began to focus,

04:00:14.920 --> 04:00:17.560
[Guest]: you know, that's where Gandhi comes in as a practitioner because he was providing a

04:00:17.560 --> 04:00:26.280
[Guest]: broader frame for practices and participation because that's what he is all about.

04:00:26.280 --> 04:00:33.480
[Guest]: How to stimulate a process through participation.

04:00:33.480 --> 04:00:37.440
[Guest]: So to me, this was a personal experience and therefore I can relate to Gandhi in a manner

04:00:37.440 --> 04:00:39.920
[Guest]: that I am talking to you sitting across.

04:00:39.920 --> 04:00:44.480
[Guest]: I am not looking at him as a Mahatma or a Bapu or a pedestal and all the rest.

04:00:44.480 --> 04:00:49.320
[Guest]: I am looking at him as an illustration on a macro scale, at a scale perhaps the world

04:00:49.320 --> 04:00:52.120
[Guest]: had never seen before or since.

04:00:52.120 --> 04:01:00.040
[Guest]: What I was experiencing at the tiniest village among three, four hundred people.

04:01:00.040 --> 04:01:04.760
[Guest]: So this connection, this was not a puzzle that fell in place at that time.

04:01:04.760 --> 04:01:11.560
[Guest]: This is filling in place as I am traveling my journey and which is what makes me look

04:01:11.560 --> 04:01:16.640
[Guest]: back at Gandhi so many times, particularly when I am facing practical challenges that

04:01:16.640 --> 04:01:19.320
[Guest]: how will we overcome because I experienced it.

04:01:19.320 --> 04:01:22.640
[Guest]: So Archabaini's work in that regard, you know, I was only a narrator.

04:01:22.640 --> 04:01:27.720
[Guest]: My involvement is tertiary, which is true because what can I do from Delhi?

04:01:27.720 --> 04:01:33.280
[Guest]: I don't even speak the language and I had no funding as such to help.

04:01:33.280 --> 04:01:37.880
[Guest]: But whatever little we could, to me, this learning that I learned from those few years

04:01:37.880 --> 04:01:44.320
[Guest]: that I was closely following this process, to me has been amazing.

04:01:44.320 --> 04:01:50.240
[Guest]: That property rights is not a question of abstractions, you know, that it is our right.

04:01:50.240 --> 04:01:59.520
[Guest]: We should be, the people should have the capacity to do their duty in order to claim that right.

04:01:59.520 --> 04:02:03.640
[Amit Varma]: And I find this story inspiring for a number of reasons and reason number one is you see

04:02:03.640 --> 04:02:09.840
[Amit Varma]: after centuries, a group of people getting empowered with agency and with dignity, as

04:02:09.840 --> 04:02:10.840
[Amit Varma]: you've pointed out.

04:02:10.840 --> 04:02:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And what I also find inspiring and which makes me hopeful for the future is that a modern

04:02:15.120 --> 04:02:19.360
[Amit Varma]: technology, which Gandhi would probably have scoffed at, had it existed at the time of

04:02:19.360 --> 04:02:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Ind Swaraj, plays a big part in empowering these individuals.

04:02:24.000 --> 04:02:27.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's, in fact, one of the hopes I have for the future that, you know, technology

04:02:27.760 --> 04:02:32.080
[Amit Varma]: in strange and unexpected ways continues to empower individuals.

04:02:32.080 --> 04:02:37.080
[Amit Varma]: Who knows, I mean, that could progress liberalism far more than everything else, right?

04:02:37.080 --> 04:02:42.920
[Guest]: Gandhi's opposition to so-called technology and modernity was not because of technology

04:02:42.920 --> 04:02:44.480
[Guest]: as such.

04:02:44.480 --> 04:02:51.880
[Guest]: It was because the technology was enabling to erase the line that he wanted to hold.

04:02:51.880 --> 04:02:56.560
[Amit Varma]: That imperialism followed on the heels of liberalism and the technological expansion.

04:02:56.560 --> 04:02:59.760
[Amit Varma]: Bhai, modern medicine mein kya line ho raha hai?

04:02:59.760 --> 04:03:00.760
[Guest]: No, no.

04:03:00.760 --> 04:03:01.760
[Guest]: Modern medicine is secondary.

04:03:01.760 --> 04:03:03.920
[Guest]: That's what, this is not a specific thing.

04:03:03.920 --> 04:03:08.760
[Guest]: Specific is that he was a person who experimented with all kinds.

04:03:08.760 --> 04:03:13.320
[Guest]: And I recently heard an episode on Tagore, where exactly the same thing.

04:03:13.320 --> 04:03:18.000
[Guest]: He was experimenting with his diet as a fad, as everybody told him, a new guy told him

04:03:18.000 --> 04:03:19.000
[Guest]: something.

04:03:19.000 --> 04:03:20.000
[Guest]: He was experimenting.

04:03:20.000 --> 04:03:21.000
[Guest]: He's free to do that.

04:03:21.000 --> 04:03:22.000
[Guest]: That's not the point at all.

04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:27.960
[Guest]: The point is, he was a man who was capable of shifting, being a true believer, a genuine

04:03:27.960 --> 04:03:34.000
[Guest]: believer who prayed twice a day at least, shifting from God is truth to truth is God.

04:03:34.000 --> 04:03:39.080
[Guest]: I can't think of a more powerful statement than his commitment to science and his progress

04:03:39.080 --> 04:03:40.280
[Guest]: and to everything else.

04:03:40.280 --> 04:03:44.600
[Guest]: Because by that statement, in my view, he was trying to hold the line.

04:03:44.600 --> 04:03:48.120
[Guest]: And we have failed to hold the line, which is why technology is coming to consume us.

04:03:48.120 --> 04:03:51.800
[Amit Varma]: We may have failed to hold the line, but, Barun, I believe that we are also capable

04:03:51.800 --> 04:03:56.400
[Amit Varma]: of shifting from this recording studio to a restaurant where we shall have a hearty

04:03:56.400 --> 04:03:59.280
[Amit Varma]: and wholesome lunch right now.

04:03:59.280 --> 04:04:01.960
[Amit Varma]: So I need to thank you profusely once again.

04:04:01.960 --> 04:04:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for your time and your insights.

04:04:04.440 --> 04:04:07.920
[Amit Varma]: And for talking to me because every time I speak to you, even when I disagree, as I did

04:04:07.920 --> 04:04:12.060
[Amit Varma]: so many times today, I feel that you've given me so much to think about.

04:04:12.060 --> 04:04:13.060
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

04:04:13.060 --> 04:04:14.060
[Guest]: Thank you.

04:04:14.060 --> 04:04:15.060
[Guest]: I mean, I'm looking at it.

04:04:15.060 --> 04:04:18.240
[Guest]: What will I take back so that I can take the next step tomorrow?

04:04:18.240 --> 04:04:19.240
[Guest]: Thanks a lot.

04:04:19.240 --> 04:04:23.920
[Guest]: It's always a pleasure chatting with you and the most undistinguished guest you have ever

04:04:23.920 --> 04:04:24.920
[Amit Varma]: had.

04:04:24.920 --> 04:04:25.920
[Amit Varma]: Are you kidding me?

04:04:25.920 --> 04:04:33.080
[Amit Varma]: Listeners, kindly tag him and tell him he's not the most undistinguished guest.

04:04:33.080 --> 04:04:36.480
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to this episode, you can follow Barun on Twitter, even though

04:04:36.480 --> 04:04:40.000
[Amit Varma]: he isn't very active there because he's out on the ground, but you can follow him on Twitter

04:04:40.000 --> 04:04:41.680
