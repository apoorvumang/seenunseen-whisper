00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.840
[Amit Varma]: why do voters tolerate this?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.280
[Amit Varma]: The chief reason for this is what Public choice economists call Rational ignorance.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.840
[Amit Varma]: These economic matters are complicated and take a lot of time to understand,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.840
[Amit Varma]: now most voters know that no election is won by just one vote,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.040
[Amit Varma]: so their single vote probably won't make a difference either.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.680
[Amit Varma]: This being the case, why put in the hard work to understand complex economic issues?

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.960
[Amit Varma]: This ignorance is perfectly rational.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.920
[Amit Varma]: So who do we blame for the state of our nation if we can't even blame ourselves?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.400
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.400
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.560
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadwa.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.240
[Amit Varma]: In this week's episode, we are going to be talking about infrastructure, leasing and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.560
[Amit Varma]: financial services, also known as IL&FS, which is surely the most ungainly acronym ever.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.400
[Amit Varma]: IL and FS. I mean, WTF, dude.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.400
[Amit Varma]: Cribs apart, IL&FS is a very interesting company because it is not a public sector unit,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.240
[Amit Varma]: nor is it quite private sector.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: The same bad incentives that apply to government owned companies apply to IL&FS.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.560
[Amit Varma]: And while there is taxpayers money involved, it is in indirect, insidious ways.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.800
[Amit Varma]: More than anything, the failure of IL&FS exposes fundamental faults in our system of government

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.240
[Amit Varma]: and in our financial systems.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.280
[Amit Varma]: My guests today to talk about this are Vivek Kaul and Ashutosh Dattar.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.560
[Amit Varma]: Vivek is perhaps India's best known economic journalist, and his speciality is simplifying

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.320
[Amit Varma]: the complexities of economics and finance for the common layman.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.080
[Amit Varma]: He is also the author of the much acclaimed Easy Money Trilogy out now on Harper Collins.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.080
[Amit Varma]: Ashutosh is a Thane based economist I've come to admire recently for his depth of thinking,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.960
[Amit Varma]: and he's been writing regularly for the site I edit, Pragati, at thinkpragati.com.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.800
[Amit Varma]: Before I begin my conversation with them, though, a quick commercial break.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.600
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.760
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.880
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.360
[Amit Varma]: Head on over to Indiancolors.com.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.680
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.240
[Amit Varma]: best artists in India and adapts them into objects of everyday use.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.880
[Amit Varma]: These include wearable art like stoles and shrugs, home decor like cushion covers and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.520
[Amit Varma]: table runners, and accessories like tote bags.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.240
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.080
[Amit Varma]: and artists get royalties on sales, just like authors do.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.160
[Amit Varma]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products, including fridge magnets

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.560
[Amit Varma]: with some stunning motifs, and salad bowls and platters made of mango wood.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.440
[Amit Varma]: Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vazvo x Vazvo, Brinda Miller, Dilip

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.080
[Amit Varma]: Sharma, Shruti Nelson, and Pradeep Mishra.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.680
[Amit Varma]: They accept bulk orders for corporate and festival gifting, but even if you want to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.000
[Amit Varma]: buy just for yourself or a friend, head on over to Indiancolors.com.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.760
[Amit Varma]: That's colors with an O-U.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.280
[Amit Varma]: And if you want a 20% discount, apply the code IVM20.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.440
[Amit Varma]: That's IVM for IVM Podcast.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.200
[Amit Varma]: IVM20 for a 20% discount at Indiancolors.com.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.720
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, Ashutosh, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Thanks, Amit.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.800
[Amit Varma]: Thanks, Amit.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Ashutosh, let me start by asking you that before we even get into what ILNFS is, and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.000
[Amit Varma]: to be honest, I didn't know what it was until this whole crisis broke.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Can you tell me a little bit about what are NBFCs?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.160
[Amit Varma]: Like ILNFS is basically a non banking financial company.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.120
[Amit Varma]: What are these and why are they required?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.560
[Guest 2]: So, technically speaking, any company which is not a bank, but has half of its assets

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.680
[Guest 2]: in financial assets, which could be shares, debentures, bonds, whatever, and half of its

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.160
[Guest 2]: income that comes from financial sort of interest or dividend becomes an NBFC and requires RBI

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.400
[Guest 2]: licensing permission to operate.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.040
[Guest 2]: And that effectively covers your mortgage companies like HDFC, covers your insurance

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.840
[Guest 2]: companies, mutual funds, stock exchanges, mortgage guarantee companies, as well as things

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.680
[Guest 2]: like ILNFS.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.440
[Guest 2]: Even in the company which is formed just to invest in shares without any public deposit

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.960
[Guest 2]: technically becomes an NBFC.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.040
[Guest 2]: So, anything which does invest in financial assets and has financial income principally,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.280
[Guest 2]: but is not a bank becomes an NBFC.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.480
[Amit Varma]: So that's a definition of it.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, one of the points that you'd made earlier in our conversation before this was that NBFCs

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.960
[Amit Varma]: like ILNFS essentially also indicate that there's a problem with the regulatory environment

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.960
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that, you know, banks are over regulated.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040
[Amit Varma]: That is why in some cases, companies like this become necessary.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.920
[Amit Varma]: And then there are spin off consequences of that and so on and so forth.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.520
[Guest 2]: Can you elaborate a bit on that?

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.360
[Guest 2]: So, banking in India is very highly regulated and sort of considered to be the case because

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.160
[Guest 2]: banks take deposits from public and hence as an investor protection deposit protection

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.960
[Guest 2]: modes, the restrictions on how many branches a bank can open, where it can invest, how

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.760
[Guest 2]: much it should lend to what categories, how should it recognize income, what is the capital

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.040
[Guest 2]: that it should have and so on.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.520
[Guest 2]: And that sort of reduces the flexibility and innovation that banking can have.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.640
[Guest 2]: And as a tool to offset some of that, a category of lending institution, which are primarily

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.520
[Guest 2]: into lending, not so much into deposits, although many of them take deposits, but primarily

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.080
[Guest 2]: into lending is a class of companies called as NBFCs were created.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.240
[Guest 2]: So, NBFCs effectively do all kinds of lending that a bank does.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.920
[Guest 2]: It's just that they're not subject to as tight a regulation as banks are.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.680
[Guest 2]: And that gives them dynamism.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.480
[Guest 2]: So, we've seen number of NBFCs increase in the last few years because that is not the

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.520
[Guest 2]: case with banks.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.120
[Guest 2]: And that also has some consequences because of lesser regulation like what we're seeing

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.680
[Guest 2]: with IRNF.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.640
[Amit Varma]: So, essentially what happens is that one of the function of banks because banks are too

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.520
[Amit Varma]: regulated to perform it in innovative ways is then farmed off and done by NBFCs, which

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.040
[Amit Varma]: are not as regulated as that.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.440
[Guest 2]: Yes.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.960
[Guest 2]: And sort of the irony of it is that many banks themselves have their own NBFCs.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.000
[Unknown]: In fact, we'll just skip that.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.520
[Guest 2]: So, that's the regulatory arbitrage that you get into.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.760
[Guest 1]: What's regulatory arbitrage?

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:03.760
[Guest 1]: So, it's like, you know, if you make a comparison to with the United States, and you look at

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.760
[Guest 1]: what happened before the financial crisis of 2008.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.920
[Guest 1]: So, a lot of these home loans, which were being given out were subprime loans.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.440
[Guest 1]: And these are not banks, you know, per se, which were sort of going banks were giving

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.560
[Guest 1]: subprime loans, but there were other companies and other financial institutions.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.760
[Amit Varma]: Fannie and Freddie and so on.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.360
[Amit Varma]: No, Fannie is a different thing altogether.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.200
[Guest 1]: There were these home mortgage companies, and they were essentially, you know, what

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.920
[Guest 1]: is referred to as shadow banking.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.840
[Guest 1]: So, they do everything that a bank does, but the regulations governing them are, you know,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.200
[Guest 1]: slightly loose.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.360
[Guest 1]: So, they can do stuff which a bank cannot, you know, if you look at the US, a lot of

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.440
[Guest 1]: the, you know, financial institutions, which got into trouble, were basically not really

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.600
[Guest 1]: banks, I mean, you know, the Lehman Brothers of the world.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.880
[Guest 1]: So, if you also look at banks, which got into trouble, you know, banks like Citigroup, it

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.480
[Guest 1]: was because of lending that they carried out through the shadow banking institutions.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.800
[Amit Varma]: So, is it the case that banks are overregulated or NBFCs are under regulated?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.920
[Guest 2]: What is the problem here?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.640
[Guest 2]: I think the problem is that banks are overregulated.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.560
[Guest 2]: I mean, to give you one example of how the arbitrage works, a bank is required to open

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.920
[Guest 2]: 25% of its branches in rural unbanked areas.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.720
[Guest 2]: Now, that if I'm a bank that restricts my flexibility, so have 100% subsidiary, which

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.680
[Guest 2]: is an NBFC, and I can carry out lending activities in that without subject to those regulations.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.840
[Guest 2]: So, in a sense, I'm trying to form a subsidiary to escape some of the tighter regulations

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.520
[Guest 2]: that the RBI has imposed on me and as a sort of via media, but that has cost because sort

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.280
[Guest 2]: of essentially you are trying to deal with friction.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.320
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:52.560
[Amit Varma]: And also then NBFCs, when banks open an NBFC, there seems to be a kind of legalized jogar

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.800
[Amit Varma]: to get away from a regulatory environment.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.600
[Amit Varma]: But I think, I think Vivek, isn't the, you're also sort of making the point that it is also

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.600
[Amit Varma]: true that NBFCs are under regulated.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.400
[Amit Varma]: Is that what you're saying?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.800
[Guest 1]: I mean, to some extent, yes, I'll give you a very simple example.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.240
[Guest 1]: And this is not really so much about regulation, but as to how, you know, regulators operate.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.720
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:22.080
[Guest 1]: So take a look at RBI, Reserve Bank of India, which essentially regulates banks in India.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.840
[Guest 1]: Now, every week, every month, every 15 days, RBI releases some data pertaining to banks.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.120
[Guest 1]: OK, and if you look at that data, you know, it is very detailed.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.520
[Guest 1]: I mean, there is still scope for improvement, but the amount of data that RBI releases on

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.680
[Guest 1]: banks is pretty good.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:48.800
[Guest 1]: Now, take the example of housing finance companies, which are NBFCs and which are regulated by

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.080
[Guest 1]: the National Housing Bank, which is 100% subsidiary of the RBI.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.920
[Guest 1]: Try getting data on, you know, housing finance companies, agglomerated data.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.360
[Guest 1]: You can obviously get, you know, data for HDFC or, you know, Tata Home Finance and stuff

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:03.920
[Guest 1]: like that.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.160
[Guest 1]: But agglomerated data for housing finance companies is simply not available.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.200
[Guest 1]: The data that you get is two to three years old.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.080
[Guest 1]: So how do you track as to what is happening in that sector at an agglomerated level?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.840
[Guest 1]: So the issue with that issue is also what this tells us is that at some level, the National

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.320
[Guest 1]: Housing Bank is also not really, you know, up to the mark as RBI is.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you know, when we talk about regulation, we obviously think about government regulation,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.480
[Amit Varma]: but the most effective and really the only legit form of regulation, and in my opinion,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.640
[Amit Varma]: is a regulation that customers do and that stakeholders do and it comes from them.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.680
[Amit Varma]: And as you're pointing out, Vivek, to do that, they need information and enough scrutiny.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.520
[Guest 1]: And in this case, what is happening is that that scrutiny isn't there because the data

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.080
[Guest 1]: isn't there.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.320
[Guest 1]: Yes, so I'll just sort of take a detour.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.400
[Guest 1]: And this is something that the Business India magazine wrote about ILNFS.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.920
[Guest 1]: And it's very interesting because, you know, what they say here is, every time Business

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.280
[Guest 1]: India approached the institution, which is ILNFS for a story, it was thwarted by the

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.360
[Guest 1]: then chairman Ravi Parthasarathy.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.000
[Guest 1]: His stock reply was, we are not a listed company, we're not obliged to talk to anyone, and they're

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.160
[Guest 1]: not accountable to anyone but our shareholders.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.920
[Guest 1]: So the point...

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And those shareholders include government institutions like LIC, so they're accountable

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.080
[Guest 1]: to us in a sense.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:34.640
[Guest 1]: See, it is because, and then the contradiction is if you go to the ILNFS website, and it's

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.760
[Guest 1]: stated there that ILNFS as a systematically important, systematically important, non-deposit

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.840
[Guest 1]: accepting, core investment company registered with the RBI, currently lends and invests

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.240
[Guest 1]: in ILNFS group companies.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.360
[Guest 1]: But the point is, if you're systematically important, you need to be open to scrutiny.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and especially if there is taxpayers money, which is invested in you, which is

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.920
[Amit Varma]: certainly heavily the case with ILNFS even before this ludicrous bailout, then there

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.600
[Amit Varma]: has to be accountability and we have to know.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.440
[Amit Varma]: But you know, before I get into ILNFS and all that, I'd like you guys to demystify banking

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.560
[Amit Varma]: itself for me.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.080
[Amit Varma]: How does a bank operate?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, what are you lending?

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.200
[Amit Varma]: What is leverage?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.960
[Amit Varma]: How does it all work?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm saying this because a lot of our listeners may not exactly know how the banking system

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.680
[Amit Varma]: works to begin with.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.520
[Amit Varma]: And then what are the pressures on it?

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And then what are the incentives that banks operate under?

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.640
[Guest 2]: So can you demystify that for me?

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.960
[Guest 2]: So in a nutshell, what a bank essentially does is starts off with some amount of capital

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.440
[Guest 2]: that its shareholders put into it.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.920
[Guest 2]: And based on that capital, it takes deposits from people like you and me, and then lends

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.360
[Guest 2]: the consolidated money to people who need credit.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.240
[Guest 2]: And because banks typically will have much higher leverage ratio than a normal manufacturing

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.560
[Guest 2]: company, banks are inherently subject to higher regulation, not just in India, subject to

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.160
[Guest 2]: higher regulation globally.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.160
[Guest 2]: Leverage ratio.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.040
[Guest 2]: So what will happen typically is that if the shareholders of a bank put in 100 rupees of

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.880
[Guest 2]: their capital, a bank might have 900 rupees of deposits.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.880
[Guest 1]: So in a sense, the balance sheet size is...

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.880
[Guest 1]: In fact, it will be much more than that.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.880
[Guest 1]: It will be much more than that in case of India.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:17.560
[Guest 1]: In banks, if you look at globally, typically the capital tends to be around 5% of their

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.560
[Guest 1]: liabilities.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.200
[Guest 1]: So if you look at the leverage, it would be at least around 20 times.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.440
[Guest 1]: And we're not talking about the, you know, the capital adequacy ratio here, because that

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.320
[Guest 1]: we go into a different domain.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.360
[Guest 1]: Because for a lot of lending, you don't need to have capital.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.480
[Amit Varma]: So what you're basically saying is that if depositors to a bank who are depositing their

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.400
[Amit Varma]: money deposits, say 5 rupees with the bank, the bank can then at a leverage ratio of 20,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.400
[Guest 2]: they can lend...

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400
[Guest 2]: No, no, no.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400
[Guest 2]: If a shareholder puts in...

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.040
[Guest 2]: So if a bank starts with 100 rupees of money from its shareholder, it will have something

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.320
[Guest 2]: like 19, sort of 1900 rupees of deposits.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.760
[Guest 2]: So the total sum that it has to lend becomes 2000 rupees.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.080
[Guest 2]: But as the owned money that the bank that has is only 100 rupees.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.580
[Guest 2]: So the assets can be 2000 rupees, but the equity is only 100 rupees.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:11.000
[Guest 2]: And when you sort of go back to say a manufacturing firm or a telecom firm, typically or a cement

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.720
[Guest 2]: company people say 2 is to 1, debt equity is sort of the standard.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.880
[Guest 2]: So 100 rupees of owned funds, 200 rupees of borrowings.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.960
[Guest 2]: And here we are talking about 20x.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.800
[Amit Varma]: So basically, if there's 100 rupees of their own capital and 1900 of depositors' capitals,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.920
[Amit Varma]: and let's say then they lend 1800 out, and depositors take their money away and they're

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.200
[Amit Varma]: left only with 100.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.400
[Amit Varma]: That's when you have a crisis.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.360
[Guest 2]: That's when you have a crisis.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.320
[Guest 2]: So the assumption in banking essentially is that depositors will not come in mass to demand

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.320
[Guest 1]: their money.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.320
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.360
[Guest 1]: That's the fractionalism of banking as we call it.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:50.200
[Guest 1]: And it rests on a very thin assumption that everyone will not demand their money at the

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200
[Guest 1]: same time.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.200
[Guest 2]: And that assumption gets tested during times of stress like what with ILFS.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.800
[Guest 2]: And if nobody's willing to roll over their liabilities and people ask that please repay

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.440
[Guest 2]: my money, then how do you raise money on the asset side to pay back to people from whom

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.440
[Guest 2]: you borrowed?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440
[Amit Varma]: Essentially, that's the ILFS.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.240
[Amit Varma]: So now, let's say an NBFC which only does loans and doesn't take deposits, they only have

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.600
[Amit Varma]: their own capital.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.960
[Amit Varma]: So are they lending only that?

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.960
[Guest 2]: What are they lending?

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.640
[Guest 2]: They will borrow money from mutual funds, from insurance companies, from other banks.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.640
[Guest 2]: So banks are an important source of lending, source of funds to the NBFCs.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.920
[Guest 2]: So about 40-45% of the borrowings of NBFCs come from banks.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.020
[Guest 2]: So in a sense, banks take deposits from people like you and me, lend to NBFCs, NBFCs online

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:39.280
[Guest 2]: lend it to people for mortgages, for cars or for SMEs, for working capital, etc.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.440
[Guest 2]: And money that we put in mutual funds other than inequities, part of it again flows back

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.840
[Guest 2]: to NBFC.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.680
[Guest 2]: So in a sense, the difference that is used in common parlance is that NBFCs are wholesale

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:56.280
[Guest 2]: funded because the people who give them loans are bulk institutions, whereas banks are generally

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.680
[Guest 2]: retail funded where the ticket size might be 1 lakh 50,000, etc.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.880
[Guest 2]: Whereas in case of NBFCs, the ticket size tends to be 100 crores, 500 crores, etc.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest 2]: So that's the difference.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.880
[Guest 2]: But they also have loans, but they will have slightly lower leverage ratio because they

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.680
[Amit Varma]: have higher capital requirement.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.680
[Amit Varma]: And how are the incentives different for them?

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.760
[Amit Varma]: As in, you know, any private company, let's say any company operates under incentives,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.000
[Amit Varma]: which if they don't give a certain return to their shareholders, they're in trouble,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
[Amit Varma]: they're accountable.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.280
[Amit Varma]: If they're a public company, their stock price goes down if their balance sheet isn't good.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.040
[Amit Varma]: So in a private company, for example, the way the incentives work is that you have to

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.040
[Amit Varma]: satisfy those requirements.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.720
[Amit Varma]: And the incentives are by and large good.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.160
[Amit Varma]: In a public sector company, those don't matter because the employees are not held accountable.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.880
[Amit Varma]: It's taxpayers money, you know, the taxpayer will bail you out.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.680
[Amit Varma]: So which is why you have, you know, public sector companies are run much worse than private

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680
[Amit Varma]: sector companies.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.960
[Amit Varma]: But just in terms of the difference in general between banks and NBFCs, forgetting the private

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.960
[Amit Varma]: public aspect of it, because banks are much more regulated, are there differences in the

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.760
[Amit Varma]: incentives at play which affect how they operate?

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.480
[Guest 2]: No, the incentives would roughly be the same.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.480
[Guest 2]: Same.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.880
[Guest 2]: So the management gets compensated based on either the stock price or the profits that

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.760
[Guest 2]: the company reports.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.040
[Guest 2]: And the employees sort of would have their companies would have their own internal.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.640
[Amit Varma]: But the question of who's holding them accountable would depend on whether the ownership pattern,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.120
[Amit Varma]: whether it's private or public or?

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120
[Guest 2]: Yes.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.160
[Guest 2]: So you have public sector NBFCs, which haven't done as well as and sort of which sort of

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.240
[Guest 2]: mirror the state that the public sector banks have.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.720
[Guest 2]: And your private sector NBFCs, which, which is also I mean, even in banks, you know, you

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.120
[Guest 2]: have banks, you have mixed I mean, you have corporate banks, which are in trouble.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.520
[Guest 2]: And you have some NBFCs, which are in trouble and some NBFCs which are doing well.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.760
[Guest 2]: So it's essentially a mixed, mixed bag.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.960
[Guest 2]: But in general, what holds true in banking that public sector banks are doing worse off

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.960
[Guest 2]: than private sector banks would hold true in NBFCs also.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.680
[Amit Varma]: So Vivek, tell me about ILNFS and what is it?

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.200
[Amit Varma]: What kind of NBFC is it?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:57.800
[Guest 1]: And so as I said, you know, it's a systematically important non deposit accepting core investment

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800
[Guest 1]: company.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.040
[Guest 1]: And it basically lends and invests in its group companies.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.280
[Amit Varma]: Is it a private company or a public company?

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.160
[Guest 1]: Oh, what would you it's not listed?

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.800
[Amit Varma]: It's not listed, but in the sense, is it private sector?

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:19.560
[Guest 1]: It's quasi government to the extent that 25% is owned by LIC.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:26.240
[Guest 1]: Then you have State Bank of India with around 6.9% or 7% Central Bank of India also owns.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.920
[Guest 1]: So roughly around 40% of ILNFS is owned by, you know, government institutions.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.880
[Guest 1]: But then it's not I don't think it's a you cannot call it out and out government company.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.000
[Guest 1]: You can call it a quasi government company.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
[Guest 1]: Yes.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't think it's an out and out.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.680
[Amit Varma]: In the sense it's not owned by the company, but these public sector institutions are major

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.960
[Guest 1]: investors in it as are private.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:56.680
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I mean, the second largest owner is a Japanese company, Oryx Corporation.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.640
[Guest 1]: HDFC has a large amount of stake and very, very interestingly, the third largest shareholder

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.600
[Guest 1]: in ILNFS are its employees.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.160
[Guest 1]: Oh, okay.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.360
[Guest 1]: Which is something that's not very well known.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:16.400
[Guest 1]: So basically, what that means is that as the company has grown, ESOPs have been a major

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:22.880
[Guest 1]: incentive which has been offered to their employees.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.400
[Guest 1]: So yeah, so it's basically a, you know, it's a conduit which sort of, you know, raises

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.400
[Guest 1]: money and invests in its subsidiaries.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.840
[Amit Varma]: If it's not publicly listed, how do the ESOPs work?

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840
[Amit Varma]: So I wouldn't know exactly what they are structuring.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.400
[Amit Varma]: Like they get dividends on their shares or something.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.000
[Guest 2]: No, but what some companies do, for example, is that they will have a sort of a periodic

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.300
[Guest 2]: valuation done of their shares and employees can exercise based on that.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.720
[Guest 2]: Some companies have a fixed multiple of profits to which the share prices are pegged.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.720
[Guest 2]: So it becomes a notional sort of an ESOP.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.960
[Guest 2]: So there are structures which work around the problem of not.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.240
[Guest 1]: Or you know, there is a hope that one day they'll get listed in.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.680
[Guest 2]: Or use a market valuation that on an average, NBFCs trade at whatever, 10 times earnings

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.600
[Guest 2]: or 5 times book value and you sort of apply the same multiple and derive a notional.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.840
[Guest 1]: So something of that sort would be done.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.600
[Guest 1]: No, but the interesting thing is that three of their subsidiaries are listed.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:20.640
[Guest 1]: ILNFS itself is not listed, but ILNFS Engineering and Construction, which used to be formerly

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.720
[Guest 1]: Mytas, the opposite of Satyam, the real estate.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.320
[Amit Varma]: They were owned by Ramalinga Raju basically and these guys took over after that thing

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.320
[Amit Varma]: happened.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.280
[Guest 1]: And ILNFS Transportation Networks and ILNFS Financial Services.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:39.120
[Guest 1]: So the company basically has around 169 group companies, which operate in a wide variety

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.500
[Guest 1]: of businesses and which is why, you know, someone I think, Andy Mukherjee had a piece

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:50.880
[Guest 1]: where he called ILNFS a Hydra-headed monster.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.160
[Guest 1]: And you know, the funny thing is the government has superseded the old board and gotten in

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.160
[Guest 1]: a new board.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.960
[Guest 1]: And this new board has to come up with a proposal, you know, by the end of this month.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.200
[Guest 1]: But you know, I mean, how will these guys figure out, you know, what 169 group companies

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.680
[Guest 1]: have been up to in such a short period of time?

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.360
[Guest 1]: And there isn't enough publicly available information about all these companies and

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.960
[Guest 1]: you know, what they really do.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.480
[Amit Varma]: And Samar Srivastava wrote a piece for Forbes, where he quoted a fund manager as saying that

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.080
[Amit Varma]: this is a debt Ponzi scheme.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080
[Guest 1]: It's a debt Ponzi scheme.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.440
[Guest 1]: So basically, what Samar wrote was that, you know, ILNFS itself raises money and then it

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.440
[Guest 1]: invests in equity in its group companies and on the basis of that equity, the group companies

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.600
[Guest 1]: raise more debt.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.120
[Guest 1]: So which is, you know, visible if you look at ILNFS's balance sheet, the leverage, you

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:53.480
[Guest 1]: know, the debt is to equity ratio has essentially gone up from around 7.7 in 2013-14 to around

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.400
[Guest 1]: 16.8 in 2017-18.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:03.040
[Guest 1]: So you know, which basically means that the debt has grown at a much faster pace than

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040
[Guest 1]: their equity.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:10.040
[Guest 1]: So at some level, it also means that, you know, they've been raising new debt to pay

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.400
[Guest 1]: off old debt, which is why it you know, which is why that fund manager says that it's a

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.400
[Amit Varma]: debt Ponzi scheme.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.120
[Amit Varma]: And you know, part of what could be making that happen is that from my understanding

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.720
[Amit Varma]: of it, if you can elaborate on that, is that they're taking short term debt for long term

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.280
[Guest 2]: investments because they do a lot of infrastructure investment.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:36.080
[Guest 2]: So I think the bigger problem with ILNFS more than that, I think, as you mentioned, is that

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.720
[Guest 2]: there isn't enough information available in public.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:44.120
[Guest 2]: So the things that ILNFS does are things that a lot of other companies do.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:50.040
[Guest 2]: There are large companies which do contracting, own assets, have a financing subsidiary, which

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.040
[Guest 2]: does loans.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.720
[Guest 2]: So there are companies which do that, but most of them are listed.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.240
[Guest 2]: So in a sense, every quarter, they're subject to scrutiny, what has been your cash flow,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.520
[Guest 2]: what is your debt, that project that you took there, you had a, there were delays, what

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.040
[Guest 2]: is the progress, that scrutiny is something that ILNFS was not subject to.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.640
[Amit Varma]: And that scrutiny itself changes the incentives, you're less likely to behave in a proper way

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640
[Guest 1]: when there is.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.640
[Guest 1]: So if you look at, you know, I was just looking at the annual report yesterday, and I'll read

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.880
[Guest 1]: out names of a few companies, so which will itself tell you as to the wide variety of

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.160
[Guest 1]: businesses they are in.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.640
[Guest 1]: So there is one company called Noida toll bridge company.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:31.280
[Guest 1]: There is one called ILNFS solar power, ILNFS energy.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:38.600
[Guest 1]: Then there is something called North Karnataka Expressway, Hazaribagh Ranchi Expressway, Muradabad

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.920
[Guest 1]: Bareilly Expressway.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.920
[Guest 1]: So obviously, you know, a lot of it is infrastructure based, but a lot of it is not infrastructure

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.920
[Guest 1]: based also.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.960
[Guest 1]: And you know, infrastructure based also they are into a wide variety of things.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.760
[Guest 1]: So they maintain these expressways, they run toll companies.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:04.700
[Guest 1]: They also are into what is known as, you know, BOT built on transfer contracts.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.880
[Guest 1]: So they're just into so many things that it's, you know, and given the fact that very little

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.280
[Guest 1]: information is publicly available.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:18.200
[Guest 1]: So you start wondering as to, you know, what exactly will this new board be able to achieve.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.160
[Guest 1]: Now if you look at Satyam, you know, when Satyam was taken over by the government, it

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.240
[Guest 1]: was an easy decision because okay, fine, you know, this is ultimately Satyam was an information

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240
[Guest 1]: technology company.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.920
[Guest 1]: They had, you know, Ramalinga Raju had some, you know, he was punting on real estate as

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.480
[Guest 1]: well on the side.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:40.800
[Guest 1]: So it was inherently a simple decision to sell off Satyam to the Mahindras and the problem

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.960
[Guest 1]: was solved.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.520
[Guest 1]: And then the Mahindras sorted out, you know, the problems would have been in Satyam.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:52.200
[Guest 1]: Now in this case, given that you have so many of these companies, it will be very, very

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:58.040
[Guest 1]: difficult, you know, if to sort of sell them off one by one.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.080
[Guest 1]: And even if you want to sell them off, you know, a lot of these companies where some

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.960
[Guest 1]: information is available, do not really have a business model anymore.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.160
[Guest 1]: So if you look at this Noida toll bridge company, it doesn't collect any toll.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.200
[Amit Varma]: Its business model was to collect toll, but then the court ruled against it.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.160
[Guest 1]: So they don't collect any toll.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.640
[Guest 1]: Now, if you look at solar power and energy companies, renewable energy is not in a great

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.640
[Guest 1]: shape right now.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.240
[Guest 1]: So similarly, they have these, you know, problems all over.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.040
[Guest 2]: So can I sort of run into the problem of speed, which will compromise on value, right?

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.800
[Amit Varma]: And then you have the incentives of the new board in place, just to sort of take a step

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.280
[Amit Varma]: back, I'm trying to figure this out.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.800
[Amit Varma]: Is this kind of structure normal, where ILFS has all the subsidiary companies.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.080
[Amit Varma]: So what it seems to me as a layman is that every time they have a project, like say building

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.280
[Amit Varma]: a toll bridge in Noida, they'll form a subsidiary for that and they'll lend to that subsidiary

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.520
[Amit Varma]: or invest to that subsidy taking loans themselves.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.320
[Amit Varma]: So they themselves are just like a managing company of a whole bunch of subsidiaries,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:04.080
[Amit Varma]: who all then operate in silos, and who are all except the publicly listed ones you mentioned,

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.280
[Amit Varma]: equally unaccountable because ILFS itself is unaccountable.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.800
[Guest 2]: So in infrastructure, you generally see that every individual project becomes a separate

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.400
[Guest 2]: subsidiary, STV as they call it.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.920
[Guest 2]: So in a sense, that particular financing and business model is not unheard of, you will

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920
[Amit Varma]: see pretty much every...

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.880
[Amit Varma]: Why is it necessary though?

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.640
[Guest 2]: Because it sort of you minimize the risk of that project and sort of don't expose the

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.440
[Guest 2]: other parts of the business to that.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:31.080
[Guest 2]: So that is not, what is unique for ILFS is that the parent company is so non transparent.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.600
[Guest 2]: So what happened is that in two years back, SEBI mandated that every company which has

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.760
[Guest 2]: listed debt instruments should also disclose half yearly financial statements.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.040
[Guest 2]: Now, so ILFS does disclose that.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:48.280
[Guest 2]: So every half an year, so we have last four or five times, half yearly September and March

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.240
[Guest 2]: statements, but A, those are not at a group level.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.560
[Guest 2]: So the debt that you will see on that is just 10 or 15,000 crores, which is like not even

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.680
[Guest 2]: 20% of the group level debt.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.440
[Guest 2]: And it's just a sort of a one page summary statement, which doesn't give you anything.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.240
[Guest 2]: So in a sense, there was an acknowledgement on the part of regulators that there is a

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.000
[Guest 2]: problem here that you have big companies which are not listed, and they have systemic issues

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.640
[Guest 2]: if there is some and so information should be available.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.360
[Guest 2]: The solution that they've come up with is half hearted and half big solution.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.360
[Amit Varma]: We'll come to the solution later.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.280
[Guest 1]: But I just want to make another point.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.680
[Guest 1]: See, you know, while I mean, and I'm really not an expert on this.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.080
[Guest 1]: And so I'm sort of, you know, guessing an answer here.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.280
[Guest 1]: And I'd like you to correct me if I'm wrong.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.560
[Guest 1]: So basically, you know, from I was doing a little digging yesterday.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:42.520
[Guest 1]: And what I realized was that while you know, the idea of spinning off a company might be

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:48.280
[Guest 1]: fairly common in infrastructure, but ILNFS, whenever it sort of spun off a company, the

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:53.240
[Guest 1]: total amount of equity that it invested in that company was very, very low.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.080
[Guest 1]: So they had very little, you know, at the cost of saying skin in the game, you know.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:04.160
[Guest 1]: So if you look at, you know, the biggest company is the is ILNFS, transportation networks limited,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.880
[Guest 1]: okay, it has a, it has assets of around 47,000 crore, which is like around, I would say around

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.360
[Guest 1]: 40% of the overall assets of ILNFS.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:19.800
[Guest 1]: Now, it has the company has, you know, even though the assets are at 47,000 crore, the

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.960
[Guest 1]: equity is just 328 crores.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:28.480
[Guest 1]: So it's, it's, you know, the, obviously, the amount of leverage that they're playing around

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.080
[Guest 1]: with is very, very high.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:38.480
[Guest 1]: Even in in this other company, which is Mitas, formerly Mitas, that equity is now a negative

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.360
[Guest 1]: 139 crore, whereas the debt is close to 2100 crore.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360
[Amit Varma]: What does that mean when you say that?

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.600
[Guest 1]: It basically means that equity is negative essentially means they've made losses over

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.840
[Guest 1]: the years, okay, and their entire capital and retained profits has been wiped off.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.080
[Guest 2]: So now they're basically bankrupt.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.960
[Guest 2]: There's only upside for them if things turn around, but there's no downside because they

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.640
[Guest 2]: don't have any more of their own money that's invested.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.200
[Amit Varma]: So it's upside but no downside.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful situation.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.320
[Amit Varma]: So I just want to go back to that accountability question.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:13.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, yeah, of course, you want regulators to kind of do something, but is the core problem

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.160
[Amit Varma]: here also the ownership?

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.160
[Amit Varma]: Like for example, if the three of us own a company, right, who will keep it accountable,

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.840
[Amit Varma]: no matter what the regulations in place might be, even if there are no regulations in place,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.400
[Amit Varma]: the three of us will keep it accountable by demanding regular statements because our interests

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400
[Amit Varma]: are at play.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, ILFS is owned partly by these public sector companies.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.880
[Amit Varma]: And you'd imagine those stakeholders would keep them accountable as any stakeholder should.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.040
[Guest 1]: So is that part of the problem?

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.680
[Guest 1]: It's a classic case of a principal agent problem, so which you can explain to our readers.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680
[Amit Varma]: Right, right.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, a principal agent problem is if I hire you to do something, there's an information

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.000
[Amit Varma]: asymmetry and how do I know you're actually doing it and blah, blah, blah, but that's

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
[Guest 2]: a kind of a different problem.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
[Guest 2]: No, not really.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
[Guest 2]: See, if you look at it,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.440
[Guest 2]: I think this is a bigger problem across all sort of in terms of the corporate structure

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.440
[Guest 2]: itself.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.440
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:05.640
[Guest 2]: So the way regulators approach financial companies is that we don't want a dominant shareholder.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.040
[Guest 2]: We want diversified shareholding, because a dominant shareholder might sort of make

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.800
[Guest 2]: undue use of the company for his advantage.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.440
[Guest 2]: And so what you get is a dispersed shareholding and no sort of dominant shareholder and the

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.480
[Guest 2]: CEO effectively becomes the one who runs the company.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.040
[Guest 2]: And to get around the problem that he shouldn't run away with the company, what you have is

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.840
[Guest 2]: something called as independent directors.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.840
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.640
[Guest 2]: So every bank and every company now has at least 50% independent directors.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.560
[Guest 2]: But by saying that you are independent, you don't become independent.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.560
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.520
[Guest 2]: So I think the issue and that sort of it's a big issue sort of globally itself is how

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:46.080
[Guest 2]: do you generate independence in mind, not just on paper, through incentives or contracts.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.080
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.640
[Guest 2]: So you might appoint me as an independent director on your company.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.640
[Guest 2]: I'm your friend.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.040
[Guest 2]: You say, okay, let's buy this company.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.200
[Guest 2]: I might just sign off on that even if you are.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.720
[Guest 2]: How do you ensure that I remain an independent and think not of our friendship, but in the

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.680
[Guest 2]: interest of the companies through contracts?

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.040
[Guest 2]: I mean, I can be independent, but law cannot based on my how I might be.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.480
[Guest 1]: See, it's like, you know, when once the new board took over, the directors who were a

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.680
[Guest 1]: part of the old board sort of wrote to the new board saying that, you know, we are all

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.320
[Guest 1]: there to help you.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.600
[Guest 1]: And there were comments, you know, one of the directors even said that, you know, ILNFS

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.960
[Guest 1]: has had a huge asset liability mismatch over the years, and it's all well known.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.000
[Guest 1]: If it's well known, why wasn't anything done about it?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.720
[Guest 1]: Simply because the man who ran the company, you know, ran it like his own feed dump.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.960
[Guest 2]: Curiously, he quit in July.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960
[Guest 2]: July.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960
[Guest 2]: Unhealth reasons.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.800
[Amit Varma]: Well, we'll take a quick commercial break here.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.120
[Amit Varma]: And after we come back, get back to the subject, which really boils my blood, why the hell

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:52.120
[Unknown]: are we rescuing these people out?

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:43.080
[Unknown]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:48.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm sitting with Vivek Kaul and Ashutosh Duttar, who are helping me make sense of IL&FS, which

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:55.120
[Amit Varma]: is an NBFC, who have got taxpayers into a deep amount of SHIT.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.720
[Amit Varma]: So Vivek, so what's the solution to that the government has come up with for IL&FS?

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:05.240
[Guest 1]: A day before the new board took over, I think the old board met and cleared a rights issue

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:13.600
[Guest 1]: of 4500 crores, which three of the investors, LIC, SBI and Oryx Corporation were supposed

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.600
[Guest 1]: to subscribe to.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:20.760
[Guest 1]: Now, obviously, now with the new board taking over that, I don't think, you know, it's on

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.960
[Guest 1]: the table.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.760
[Guest 1]: It's not on the table.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.680
[Guest 1]: But then, you know, the question is, again, I mean, you know, we should at least ask as

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:36.040
[Guest 1]: to why should you know, what makes my blood boil even before, you know, LIC and SBI rescuing

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:42.080
[Guest 1]: IL&FS is the fact that why does LIC, which is essentially an investment company, I mean,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.880
[Guest 1]: there is very little insurance, you know, that it sells, it's essentially an investment

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.400
[Guest 1]: company and why should LIC have a 25% stake in any company?

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:56.560
[Guest 1]: I mean, you know, one of the first things that they teach you, when you sort of start

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.000
[Guest 1]: learning anything about investing is to not have all your eggs in one basket.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.640
[Guest 1]: You know, a mutual fund in India cannot own more than 10% of a particular any company.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.680
[Guest 1]: So why should LIC be allowed to own 25% of a company?

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.920
[Guest 1]: I mean, that's it's bizarre.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.760
[Guest 1]: So obviously, now that you own 25% of a company, the logical thing is that you have to rescue

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:22.000
[Guest 1]: the company because otherwise, you know, whatever you've already invested in it, sort of goes

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
[Guest 1]: to the you know,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.120
[Amit Varma]: And even if you invoke the sunk cost fallacy, this is too much of a sunk cost, 25% of

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:34.920
[Guest 1]: So you know, the other thing is, State Bank of India, you know, which has around 7% stake

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.120
[Guest 1]: in IL&FS made losses of close to 7000 crore last year.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.120
[Amit Varma]: On its own.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.120
[Amit Varma]: On its own.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.320
[Guest 1]: So why is, you know, a loss making bank trying to rescue, you know, another systematically

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.800
[Guest 1]: important financial institution?

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.480
[Guest 1]: No, you know, as far as systematically important financial institutions go, I don't think there

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.520
[Guest 1]: is, you know, a more systematically important financial institution in India than the State

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520
[Guest 1]: Bank of India.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.560
[Guest 1]: Nothing is more systematically important.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.140
[Guest 1]: So why is SBI, you know, being forced into even, you know, more deep shit?

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.680
[Guest 1]: So I mean, if you look at these things, you know, the kind of questions that crop up are,

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.960
[Guest 1]: you know, I mean, they really make your blood boil.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And just elaborate a bit on to just kind of again, take another digression shift from

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.240
[Amit Varma]: IL&FS, how many times we have to say that to LIC, which you've written a couple of really

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.280
[Amit Varma]: good pieces on and if I might quote from one of them, quote, if LIC keeps picking up all

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.400
[Amit Varma]: the rubbish that is lying around, one day it will have to be rescued as well.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.840
[Amit Varma]: The question is, who will rescue the rescuer?

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.840
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, you mean that as a rhetorical question, but the answer is we will be the

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800
[Guest 1]: taxpayers.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.480
[Guest 1]: No, I mean, see, the point is whether it's easy to say that the taxpayer will rescue,

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.480
[Guest 1]: but it's not so straightforward.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.200
[Guest 1]: You know, LIC is huge.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:58.440
[Guest 1]: And if you look at a bank like IDBI, which is not a very big bank, if you know, I think

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.000
[Guest 1]: LIC is investing 10-12,000 crores in that bank.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.880
[Guest 1]: Now, essentially, a, you know, a bank like IDBI needs that kind of money.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.280
[Guest 1]: Just imagine how much LIC is worth one day, you know, if things are not right with LIC,

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.520
[Guest 1]: because LIC is another huge black box.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.460
[Guest 1]: Nobody really knows what is happening inside that organization.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:23.640
[Guest 1]: If you look at publicly available information, it is presented in such, you know, terms that

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.880
[Guest 1]: it's very difficult to make out what is happening inside the organization, even though they

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.360
[Guest 1]: declare, you know, information every three months.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.120
[Guest 1]: But if you go to that particular page on the LIC website, and try to put things together,

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.560
[Guest 1]: it's next to impossible.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:42.560
[Guest 1]: Unless, you know, you work within LIC and you understand the dynamics of how the organization

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.560
[Guest 1]: operates.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.760
[Guest 1]: So, yeah, I mean, it's bizarre that, you know, and you know, one thing that people don't

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.280
[Guest 1]: get is that LIC money is not taxpayer money, okay?

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.000
[Guest 1]: It's money that the policyholders have given LIC to manage.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.560
[Guest 1]: Now, ultimately, those policyholders may also be taxpayers.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.040
[Guest 1]: But that's a different thing altogether.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:07.080
[Guest 1]: So the only aim of LIC should be to sort of manage that money properly.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:12.600
[Guest 1]: LIC is also not a, you know, it's not an asset reconstruction company or, you know, a vulture

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.160
[Guest 1]: fund, or, you know, a distressed asset management fund, you know, you have all these fancy terms.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.080
[Guest 1]: It's not, it doesn't have expertise in those areas, right?

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.720
[Guest 1]: So it should not, you know, a lot of people make this argument, oh, but they're buying

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.040
[Guest 1]: these assets cheap, you know, when they bought IDBI.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.360
[Guest 1]: But that is not what LIC is supposed to do.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:35.280
[Guest 1]: They are supposed to sort of manage your money in the most, you know, risk free way possible.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And normally, you know, for any private insurance company, you have, you know, policyholders,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.400
[Amit Varma]: and your responsibility is to those policyholders, that's all your incentives.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:48.240
[Amit Varma]: But in the case of LIC is complicated, because it's a government company, and they have to

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.240
[Guest 1]: do all these other things.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.240
[Guest 1]: So you'll have like, you know, if the government does not meet its fiscal deficit target this

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.560
[Guest 1]: year, so then they'll, you know, come up with, they'll sell shares in all these public sector

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.600
[Guest 1]: companies, which no one else will want, and then LIC will come in and LIC will sort of

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.680
[Guest 1]: buy those shares.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.640
[Guest 1]: But then till you know, and this is not when it's not like it's been happening, you know,

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.760
[Guest 1]: only in the last four years, it's been happening forever.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:16.440
[Guest 1]: You know, any thing of this sort in LIC comes to the rescue.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.080
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to stroke your ego a bit more by quoting from another piece of work, where

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.000
[Amit Varma]: you said, start quote, of course, the average LIC policyholder is financially illiterate.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, why else would you hand over your hard earned money to LIC?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.360
[Amit Varma]: And given that he is not aware of all that is happening right now, hence, I guess it's

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.060
[Amit Varma]: only fair that he has been taken for a ride.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.520
[Amit Varma]: If you are not bothered about your money, why do you expect someone else to be?

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.520
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.160
[Amit Varma]: And your conclusion here is that the smart thing for anyone to do is stop buying LIC

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.160
[Guest 1]: policy.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.040
[Guest 1]: Yes, I mean, you know, because one, you don't know what is inside that black box, two, you

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.960
[Guest 1]: don't know how your money will be used.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.000
[Guest 1]: And see, if you so I'll give you a very simple example.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.160
[Guest 1]: Now, LIC has stakes in all the 20 public sector banks.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.760
[Guest 1]: And it owns one public sector bank.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.760
[Guest 1]: So there are 21 public sector banks, it has stakes in 20 and it owns one.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:13.040
[Guest 1]: Now, you know, public sector banks are going through a very bad phase right now.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.000
[Guest 1]: And nobody really knows where all that will end.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.760
[Guest 1]: And LIC as a major owner of almost all these banks is already suffering and will probably

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.200
[Guest 1]: suffer more in the years to come.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.160
[Guest 1]: So you know, there is a gentleman called K.C.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.200
[Guest 1]: Chakraborty, who used to be the deputy governor of RBI.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.080
[Guest 1]: Before that, he was the CEO of Punjab National Bank.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.800
[Guest 1]: And he, you know, in an interview some time back said that, you know, the bad loans of

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.400
[Guest 1]: Indian banks are 20 lakh crore.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:49.840
[Guest 1]: And the declared bad loans as of now and as of March 31st, 2018, were around 10.35 lakh

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.840
[Guest 1]: crore.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.280
[Guest 1]: So, you know, we still don't know where all this will end.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:59.180
[Guest 1]: So LIC anyway, as a major owner of these banks, is in a huge mess.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.840
[Guest 1]: On top of that, you know, if you start getting it to rescue all these, you know, island FSS

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.600
[Guest 1]: of the world, I mean, you're really taking the policyholder for a one big ride.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.600
[Guest 1]: And policyholder, poor guy, I mean, you know, he spends more time figuring out which mobile

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.800
[Guest 1]: phone he wants to buy, but he's just happy handing over money to, you know, any LIC agent

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.200
[Guest 1]: who pops over, you know, to be invested because LIC is government.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.120
[Guest 1]: But you know, you should remember that, you know, government also has limited resources.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:33.120
[Guest 1]: I mean, government did not come to rescue everyone who got screwed in with the Unit

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120
[Guest 1]: Trust of India.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.920
[Guest 1]: I mean, they did come up with a rescue plan, but it was a limited rescue plan.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.760
[Amit Varma]: So all these factors have to be kept in mind.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.500
[Amit Varma]: So let me turn to you, Ashutosh, with a question of principle, which is, should such company

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.500
[Amit Varma]: be bailed out at all?

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:53.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, like you were saying before this, that this is a classic case as 2008 was, for

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:58.160
[Amit Varma]: example, of profits being privatized, but losses being socialized.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.720
[Amit Varma]: You know that if a company makes profit, they enjoy the benefits of that.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.280
[Amit Varma]: But the moment they go down, oh, then the government jumps in taxpayer money or public

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.980
[Amit Varma]: sector money is put into that.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.620
[Amit Varma]: And that creates what economists call moral hazard.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.480
[Amit Varma]: They change the incentives of the game because in future also, that means that companies

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:21.120
[Amit Varma]: can afford to invest unwisely and behave badly knowing that the upside is unlimited.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.440
[Amit Varma]: But the downside is none because they'll be bailed out.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.440
[Guest 2]: Yes.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.040
[Guest 2]: And I think what you're seeing in financial markets is essentially this bogey being raised

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.880
[Guest 2]: that the ISF is OK, but this will have repercussions on the entire financial systems.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.520
[Guest 2]: You've already seen share prices of some NBFCs fall 40, 50, 60 percent, that this will create

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.100
[Guest 2]: a systemic issue.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.580
[Guest 2]: And I have some sympathy to that view that there is a risk to that.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:48.480
[Guest 2]: But even if you compare it to 2008, in 2008, many of the top 10 financial institutions

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.320
[Guest 2]: in the US were in trouble.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.600
[Guest 2]: We are currently nowhere near that threshold being built.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.880
[Guest 2]: None of our banks are in trouble.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.360
[Guest 2]: None of the large NBFCs are in trouble.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.520
[Guest 2]: None of the large insurance companies are in trouble.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:03.080
[Guest 2]: So even if one were to say that we are staring at a 2008 kind of a scenario and that requires

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.900
[Guest 2]: a bailout, we are nowhere close to that threshold being reached.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:11.440
[Guest 2]: So I think as of now, at least, there is absolutely no question of why an island FS or any of

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.000
[Guest 2]: the NBFCs which didn't do their asset liability management in place and are currently struggling

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.240
[Guest 2]: should be bailed out.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.520
[Guest 2]: In the last five years, they enjoyed benefits of low interest rates where they could borrow

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.600
[Guest 2]: short term and report fantastic profits.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.360
[Guest 2]: And now that the tide has turned and sort of you have to take it on the chain.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.840
[Guest 2]: Were those low interest rates a problem to begin with?

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.840
[Guest 2]: I don't think so.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.080
[Guest 2]: I think the problem was that people assumed that, I mean, and this happens in every cycle,

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.000
[Guest 2]: people assume that low interest rates will continue forever.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
[Unknown]: Right.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.480
[Unknown]: Sort of people don't assume that things are cyclical and think and eventually sort of,

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.080
[Guest 2]: I mean, as they say in financial markets, the safest statement to say is these two shall

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080
[Guest 2]: pass.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080
[Guest 1]: Nobody wants to say that.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.080
[Guest 1]: So, you know, this is very interesting.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:55.960
[Guest 1]: I mean, I just remembered a line which John Galbraith wrote in one of his books.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.840
[Guest 1]: He says that in America, and I'm paraphrasing here because I don't remember the exact line.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:05.320
[Guest 1]: He said in America, the only socialism is the socialism for the rich.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.640
[Guest 1]: So you know, the same logic applies to financial markets.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:13.320
[Guest 1]: You know, when things are going well, you know, you'll have all these bankers and, you

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.840
[Guest 1]: know, industrialists and everyone talking about free markets and you know, the benefits

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.000
[Guest 1]: of capitalism and but the moment the tide turns, you know, everyone wants to sort of

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.480
[Guest 1]: run back to the government.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.480
[Guest 1]: And it's interesting.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.840
[Guest 1]: So I was again, you know, reading this piece in Business India, and they have these, you

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.680
[Guest 1]: know, all these, you know, so called experts who keep getting quoted in these magazine

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.680
[Amit Varma]: articles.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.760
[Amit Varma]: I love the way you say so called experts, because you're also an expert.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.440
[Guest 1]: But I don't get quoted in magazine articles.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.880
[Guest 1]: So we should change that.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.840
[Guest 1]: No, I'm what I'm what I'm trying to say here is so I'll just read out a few quotes here.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.960
[Guest 1]: And I'll not name the guy because it's not fair on that person, because everyone else

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.600
[Guest 1]: in the market is also saying the same thing.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.960
[Guest 1]: So there's one, the government should move fast.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.560
[Guest 1]: It's a company specific problem and should not be seen as an industry problem.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.680
[Unknown]: So he's basically contradicting himself here.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.840
[Guest 1]: You know, one is saying it's not a big problem, but the government should move.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.560
[Guest 1]: Because if the government moves fast, then it's easy.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.800
[Guest 1]: You know, the private sector does not have to sit together and solve the problem.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.240
[Guest 1]: Okay, there's another guy who says I'm hopeful about the government taking a keen interest

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.840
[Guest 1]: and moving fast to take necessary steps to avoid further pain in the system.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:25.280
[Guest 1]: You know, the point is, unless there is pain in the system at certain points of time, the

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.920
[Guest 1]: system will never get cleaned up.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:34.000
[Guest 1]: You know, the classic example here is, there is a comparison that's made between California

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.180
[Guest 1]: and you know, Baja California, which is a state in Mexico.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:46.240
[Guest 1]: So in California, forest fires, essentially what they do, the policy is that every fire

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.160
[Guest 1]: in a forest has to be stopped.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.000
[Guest 1]: Okay, even the smallest fire.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.280
[Guest 1]: So what that does is that California does not have small fires.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.000
[Guest 1]: What it has is big fires.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.520
[Guest 1]: Now compare that to Baja California, where you let these small fires burn.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.800
[Guest 1]: Okay, what that does is, you know, all this dry shrub and everything that has accumulated

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.240
[Guest 1]: that burns off.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.320
[Guest 1]: So they don't have big fires.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:18.280
[Guest 1]: So if you were to use that analogy for, you know, financial system or capitalism, so you

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:25.040
[Guest 1]: need these periodic small crises to make sure that there is no bigger crisis.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.040
[Guest 2]: That's a brilliant analogy.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:30.280
[Guest 2]: And this is sort of the anti fragile concept that Taleb talks about.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:34.560
[Guest 2]: And I think and sort of where it sort of goes back to is that if you don't inflict losses

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.000
[Guest 2]: today, it sets up more risk taking behavior down the line and sets you up for a bigger

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
[Amit Varma]: crisis later on.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Because everybody assumes there is a put option.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.480
[Amit Varma]: This kind of shit gives capitalism a bad name.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.380
[Amit Varma]: It's one of the fundamental tenets of capitalism that if someone fails, let them fail.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:52.080
[Amit Varma]: It's a lesson for everybody else and it changes incentives down the line.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.100
[Amit Varma]: But here what happens is if you keep rescuing these big boys, you create moral hazard, everybody

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.920
[Amit Varma]: feels or you know, all the other big boys say, hey, we are too big to fail, we'll continue

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.720
[Amit Varma]: to behave badly, we'll do whatever the hell, government will come to us.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.760
[Guest 2]: And this doesn't allow market discipline to work.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.760
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.800
[Guest 2]: I mean, the reason why nobody paid attention to Island Affairs financials is because people

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.320
[Guest 1]: thought it will not go bankrupt.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.480
[Guest 2]: But the moment people feel that if somebody is going to go bankrupt, and there will be

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:21.200
[Guest 2]: no bailout, then before putting my money, I better keep a close eye on what this company

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.200
[Guest 2]: is up to.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.280
[Guest 2]: So in a sense, it is important for me to play discipline to believe that there is no backstop

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.280
[Guest 1]: by the government.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.120
[Guest 2]: So it's sort of it's wonderful for the entire system to be a bit more sort of become a bit

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.240
[Guest 2]: more conservative and discovers that you should let companies fail.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:42.160
[Amit Varma]: So supposing the government does that, supposing tomorrow, no, no, no, I'm building a thought

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.160
[Amit Varma]: experiment.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:47.040
[Amit Varma]: Oh, so supposing tomorrow, Modi ji's office calls Vivek and says, hey, come and advise

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.400
[Amit Varma]: us and he says, hey, do nothing about ILNFS.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:55.020
[Amit Varma]: God, I have to keep saying that ILNFS then and he says, okay, do nothing.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.760
[Amit Varma]: And they say, okay, we won't do anything.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.760
[Amit Varma]: How would that scenario normally play out?

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.120
[Guest 1]: Can I make an analogy here?

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:07.080
[Guest 1]: So, so basically, you know, someone did some research in football.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:12.600
[Guest 1]: And they realized that if the goalkeeper stands straight, when a penalty shot is being taken,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:18.440
[Guest 1]: instead of jumping left or jumping right, he has a 30% chance of stopping the goal,

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:23.480
[Guest 1]: which is a pretty good percentage.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:29.080
[Guest 1]: The point is, the goalkeepers also understand this, they're not like exactly idiots, but

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.080
[Guest 1]: they still jump left or right.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.080
[Guest 1]: Why?

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.240
[Guest 1]: Because, you know, there's a 30% chance.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.440
[Guest 1]: Now, imagine you're standing in, you know, at the center and the ball goes towards your

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.000
[Guest 1]: left or your right and you don't jump.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.960
[Guest 1]: What is the impression that gets?

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.520
[Guest 1]: You're not trying.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.360
[Guest 1]: He's not trying, he's not doing anything.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:55.920
[Guest 1]: So do nothing is never, you know, even though it's a great thing to talk about, it never

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.000
[Guest 1]: really happens.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.040
[Guest 1]: Because I mean, this was something that Dr. Vivek Reddy, who was the governor of the RBI,

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:11.280
[Guest 1]: told me once, and I sort of had gone to interview him and he said, beta, do nothing is never

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280
[Guest 1]: a strategy.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.440
[Guest 1]: You have to do something, you have to be seen to be doing something.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.160
[Guest 1]: Which is where this do nothing thing goes for a toss.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.160
[Guest 2]: So there's a famous...

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.160
[Guest 2]: You don't have to sort of go that way.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.600
[Guest 2]: I mean, for example, when companies currently go into distress, we have a bankruptcy court,

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.320
[Guest 2]: bankruptcy regime to take them to bankruptcy.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.760
[Guest 2]: They need certain handholding during that process.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:37.240
[Guest 2]: Somebody else takes over, runs it, sort of, it's sort of an ICU sort of process.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.960
[Guest 2]: And we had a similar concept for that called as the FRDI bill, which is supposed to do

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.640
[Guest 2]: that for financial firms.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.600
[Guest 2]: But that bill never got passed because the bogey that was created was that it had a clause

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.400
[Guest 2]: that depositors' money would be converted into equity at some stage of point.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.920
[Guest 2]: But that bill essentially provided a framework wherein financial companies which get into

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.280
[Guest 2]: distress, the way to resolve that by taking them into ICU and either selling of them in

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.240
[Guest 2]: pieces or liquidating them or that.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.800
[Guest 2]: And this was this year, this bill was supposed to be passed this year.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.240
[Guest 2]: So in a sense, if we had done that, if our politicians had thought clearly and thought

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.200
[Guest 2]: of what the big picture was, we would have had legal framework through which to take

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.200
[Guest 2]: IL&FS.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.560
[Guest 2]: There would have been no government money involved, and they would have been town bound.

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:24.240
[Guest 2]: So that law gives 12 months timeframe in which to get the company out of distress and would

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.520
[Guest 2]: have had a proper way of solving that problem.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:30.040
[Guest 2]: But because our politics is so muddled, we now have no legal way.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.080
[Guest 2]: And hence we have to go through this supervising the board, new board and all of that.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.080
[Guest 1]: And essentially, we don't know what the new board, what will the poor guys do?

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.440
[Guest 1]: I mean, Uday Kotak already has a day job.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.440
[Unknown]: Right.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, he has a huge bank to manage.

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And why did he take this up?

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:50.040
[Guest 1]: I mean, see, after I say, I guess, you know, after a point of time, everyone in the Indian

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.160
[Guest 1]: financial services business wants to be like Deepak Parekh.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.320
[Guest 1]: You know, you you're not just an institution builder, you also you're an institution, you're

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.440
[Guest 1]: not just an institution builder is what I'm saying.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:07.640
[Guest 1]: You also want to sort of, you know, see, be seen doing something for the country, the

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.640
[Amit Varma]: elder statesman.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.400
[Guest 1]: You want to sort of protect yourself as something like that.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.440
[Guest 1]: So so he has a day job, right.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:19.360
[Guest 1]: And also the fact that all these directors are new, so they really don't have any insider

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.360
[Guest 1]: information.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:24.360
[Guest 1]: They really don't know what was happening there.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:28.520
[Guest 1]: So I'm not really sure as to, you know, this 30 day deadline, I think by 31st, they have

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.560
[Guest 1]: to submit something to the National Company Law Tribunal.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.200
[Guest 1]: I mean, what will they do in 30 days?

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.360
[Amit Varma]: They wouldn't even know the names of all the subsidies.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.880
[Amit Varma]: What are the options open to them?

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.600
[Amit Varma]: Like I think Andy Bloomberg, if I'm not mistaken, Andy Mukherjee in his Bloomberg column, basically

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.240
[Amit Varma]: spoke about not putting any taxpayer money in but having some of the companies.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.560
[Guest 1]: See, what will happen is, see, that's not so straightforward.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.760
[Amit Varma]: This is the problem, you know, Andy works out of Hong Kong.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:55.120
[Amit Varma]: So I mean, honestly, I mean, I love what he writes.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:00.760
[Guest 1]: So see, he said, you know, you should sell the engineering and construction company,

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.760
[Guest 1]: which was formerly Mitas.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:07.520
[Guest 1]: Now, the problem is, you know, the moment you start doing that, you will obviously not,

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.040
[Guest 1]: it will be a distress sale.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.040
[Guest 1]: Okay.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.840
[Guest 1]: Now, a distress sale in India is not so straightforward, because some politician will catch on to it

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:20.160
[Guest 1]: and then there will be some controversy, you know, spun around it.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:25.320
[Guest 1]: So I mean, if you look at what has been happening to banks, and you know, the companies that

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:33.560
[Guest 1]: they are trying to sell or only you know, this, I think Tata have bought Bhushan Steel.

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.680
[Guest 1]: And that's about it.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.480
[Guest 1]: And then there are, you know, nothing else has really...

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.440
[Guest 1]: So big deals have moved so far.

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.760
[Amit Varma]: So what you're really saying is that this is not about the economy, it's about the political

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.760
[Guest 1]: economy.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.800
[Unknown]: Obviously, I mean, you can't just say, yeh karna chahiye, woh karna chahiye, you got

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.280
[Amit Varma]: to see what is likely to happen, because even politicians have incentives.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.280
[Guest 2]: Yes.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.800
[Guest 2]: And even the directors who are now in place who have incentives, because they are bankers,

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.080
[Guest 1]: some of them, they are connected to financial companies.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.080
[Guest 1]: And there are some...

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.080
[Guest 1]: And somebody would have to take write-offs.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.080
[Guest 2]: Bureaucrats...

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.120
[Guest 2]: At the end of the day, somebody will have to take write-downs.

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.440
[Guest 2]: Now, who will take write-downs?

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.760
[Guest 1]: How much of the write-downs will be taken?

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:09.520
[Guest 1]: And the thing is, now that you know, people are getting into sort of getting more and

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.760
[Guest 1]: more information now.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:18.000
[Guest 1]: So I read this piece, which said that around 15,000 crores will have to be written off.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.880
[Guest 1]: Now, I mean, and this is just, you know, when people have started looking at a very, you

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.240
[Guest 1]: know, not in a very detailed way.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.960
[Guest 1]: So once, you know, people are able to get into the books and everything, I mean, you

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.640
[Guest 2]: really don't know what is actually there.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.720
[Guest 1]: Even if there are gold-plated assets out there, for example.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.880
[Guest 1]: There are huge... gold-plated assets is something that, you know, society loves...

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.120
[Guest 1]: What is a gold-plated asset?

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:50.080
[Guest 1]: So gold-plated asset is basically something which is not worth the price that is essentially,

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.400
[Guest 1]: you know, there on the balance sheet.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.400
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:58.200
[Guest 1]: So it's like something might, you know, you might show something to be priced at a thousand

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:03.040
[Guest 1]: crores, while it might be worth only around 500 crores or anything like that.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:07.840
[Amit Varma]: So let's move on for a moment from the narrow issue of IL&FS, so that it's the last time

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.240
[Amit Varma]: I have to say this.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And Ashutosh, let me then put to you a broader question about leaving for the moment political

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.280
[Amit Varma]: imperatives out of the way in the political economy aside for the moment.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.040
[Amit Varma]: We'll come to that after we speak about this.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:26.640
[Amit Varma]: But if there was to be structural reform of the banking sector or of the financial sector

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:30.880
[Amit Varma]: to prevent such problems in future, what kind of structural reforms would you look at?

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.640
[Amit Varma]: For example, when we were discussing this earlier, you sent me a fairly detailed mail.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the questions that you posed is, should there be so much credit outside

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.040
[Amit Varma]: the banking sector?

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.640
[Amit Varma]: Should there be this regulatory arbitrage, you know, is reducing some of the restrictions

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:50.720
[Amit Varma]: on banks and allowing easy entry and exit in case of banks and having banks as a sole

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.760
[Amit Varma]: lending institution a better policy?

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.760
[Guest 2]: Yes.

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.480
[Guest 2]: So I think the philosophical question that I ask is, if I'm a bank and I want to give

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.600
[Guest 2]: a hundred rupee loan, I shouldn't be able to ask myself, should I give it on my books

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.640
[Guest 2]: or my hundred percent subsidiary NBFC?

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.640
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.760
[Guest 2]: So I think those sort of questions, which essentially I am picking and choosing which

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.440
[Guest 2]: regulatory environment to choose shouldn't be there.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.840
[Guest 2]: So a one single rupee loan shouldn't have two different implications in terms of regulation

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.280
[Guest 2]: based on what legal entity is giving that loan.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.920
[Guest 2]: So I think we should start with this thing that the regulatory environment should be

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.040
[Guest 2]: a function of what risk we are building in.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.880
[Guest 2]: And that risk cannot be a function of what is the legal status of you, of whether you

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.800
[Guest 2]: are an NBFC or a bank or a company or an individual.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.080
[Guest 2]: So we should start by that.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.160
[Guest 2]: I think the other issue is whether we should have so much of restrictions on banking in

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.040
[Guest 2]: the first place.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.440
[Guest 2]: And should we have one single kind of banking which we currently have?

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.080
[Guest 2]: So every bank in India does pretty much the same thing.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.400
[Guest 2]: Should we encourage people to come with innovative structure?

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.520
[Guest 2]: Should there be a bank which says, I don't want to raise deposits, I only want to give

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.520
[Guest 2]: loans?

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.320
[Guest 2]: Should there be allow banks which say that I only want to give take deposits, but I don't

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.600
[Guest 2]: really want to give loans?

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.400
[Guest 2]: That's not really my core strength.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.240
[Guest 2]: Should there be banks which say that I only want to facilitate payments or I only want

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.120
[Guest 2]: to run a credit card business?

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.000
[Guest 2]: And currently laws do not allow that.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.920
[Guest 2]: Every bank has to give 40% of its loans to what is called as priority sector.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.460
[Guest 2]: 20% of their branches should be in unbanked rural areas.

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:15.000
[Guest 2]: So essentially you have only just one single business model.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.360
[Guest 2]: And that is what leads to this regulatory arbitrage within BFCs.

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.720
[Guest 2]: So when Raghuram Rabjan came in in 2013, the first press conference he said, he said, we'll

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.720
[Guest 2]: have on tap banking.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.440
[Guest 2]: We are sort of five years down the line and we don't have on tap banking.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.520
[Guest 2]: What is on tap banking?

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.320
[Amit Varma]: So anybody can come and apply for a banking license and they will get that license.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:37.120
[Guest 2]: We only had a few banks being licensed in 2013-14 sort of that first wave and post that

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.120
[Guest 1]: we've not had a single one.

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:42.920
[Guest 1]: It's like, you know, one day RBI wakes up and says, okay, we'll give bank licenses.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:47.440
[Guest 1]: So on tap would mean that I wake up any morning and I feel okay, I am now in a position where

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.280
[Guest 1]: I should be able to get an RBI license.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.320
[Amit Varma]: And then you're held accountable by the market.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.320
[Amit Varma]: But that doesn't...

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.440
[Guest 2]: And the second, I think the issue...

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.560
[Guest 2]: I just want to make one point.

00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:00.040
[Guest 1]: So, you know, he was basically talking about the fact that how, you know, there need to

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.360
[Guest 1]: be different banks doing different kinds of things.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.080
[Guest 1]: Now, this is something I really, you know, firmly believe in.

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:10.760
[Guest 1]: And if you look at the current banking crisis, the one learning that, you know, that has

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:15.840
[Guest 1]: stayed with me is that, you know, all these public sector banks, at least the smaller

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:20.960
[Guest 1]: ones, I mean, you leave out the top five, you leave out, you know, SBI, Bank of Baroda,

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.160
[Guest 1]: Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.800
[Guest 1]: But all these small banks, you know, the Dena Banks and the Bank of Maharashtra's of the

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.360
[Guest 1]: world and the Indian Overseas Banks, they should borrow money and they should stick

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.000
[Guest 1]: to retail lending.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.440
[Guest 1]: I don't think, you know, it's they do not have the expertise to sort of carry do project

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:44.400
[Guest 1]: finance that should be, you know, totally taken out of the equation.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.680
[Guest 1]: Because, you know, one is that the second thing that will happen there is that, you

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:53.080
[Guest 1]: know, all these politically motivated lending, I mean, the moment you can only do retail

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.000
[Guest 1]: lending, the politically motivated lending will go out of the window.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.200
[Amit Varma]: And we've spoken about this in a previous episode on defaults and stuff.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.920
[Guest 2]: And so the other thing that it links to is that the system would be far better if we

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.520
[Guest 2]: had a large number of small banks.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.520
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.280
[Guest 2]: Whereas our focus today is on getting big institutions.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.280
[Guest 2]: Which is very stupid.

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:14.360
[Guest 2]: We are merging banks together rather than saying, okay, this particular bank is doing

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.960
[Guest 2]: nothing, let's just close it down.

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.760
[Amit Varma]: And if you had on tap banking, you would have a lot of small players, you would have a lot

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.760
[Guest 2]: of innovation.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.160
[Guest 2]: A large number of different banks is what contributes.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.720
[Guest 2]: In any industry, if you had differentiated producers, that is what leads to consumer

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:28.720
[Guest 2]: welfare, not just a large number of monolithic players.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.760
[Guest 2]: They don't add to consumer value beyond a point.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.020
[Guest 2]: I mean, just Pepsi and Coke don't add to value.

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:38.160
[Guest 2]: But a Pepsi versus a Tropicana, for example, adds to consumer value because you have choice,

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.160
[Guest 2]: because you're different.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.160
[Guest 2]: I think we forget that.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.320
[Guest 2]: And we have all banks just doing the same thing.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.600
[Guest 2]: Same kind of credit card, same kind of deposit product, same kind of loans, same interest

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.600
[Guest 2]: rates.

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.600
[Guest 2]: There is just no differentiation.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600
[Amit Varma]: And the reason for this is regulation.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.600
[Guest 2]: This is the regulation.

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.080
[Guest 2]: There is no flexibility that banks are allowed to.

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.920
[Amit Varma]: So I can't do something different.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:00.120
[Amit Varma]: So now getting to the question of the political economy on this, what are the interest groups

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:05.080
[Amit Varma]: that argue in favor of the status quo that prevent these changes from coming about?

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.720
[Guest 1]: I mean, the big banks themselves.

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.840
[Amit Varma]: So the big banks are powerful interest groups who want to maintain the status quo, want

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.760
[Guest 2]: to maintain the market shares?

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.880
[Guest 2]: I think the irony in India is that if you look at the big private sector banks, they

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.480
[Guest 2]: somehow dominate every facet of financial services.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.280
[Guest 2]: They have the largest asset management companies.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.000
[Guest 2]: They have the largest insurance company.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.640
[Guest 2]: So in a sense, they have become oligopolies in themselves.

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.560
[Guest 1]: And that creates...

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.760
[Guest 2]: And this is something that runs across all financial services.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.440
[Guest 2]: It's not just in banking.

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.200
[Guest 2]: It is there in mutual funds.

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.200
[Guest 2]: It is there in insurance.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.720
[Guest 2]: It is there in pretty much every facet of financial services that under the garb of

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.720
[Guest 2]: investor protection or consumer protection, you essentially reduce barriers to entry.

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.200
[Amit Varma]: And this speaks to what I sometimes say that free markets don't mean public sector bad,

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.320
[Amit Varma]: private sector good.

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.080
[Amit Varma]: What happens and what we can see happening here as well is that the top players in the

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.720
[Amit Varma]: private sector will always want to protect their turf and will be hand in glove with

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:01.440
[Amit Varma]: the government to use state power to, you know, have regulations of this sort, which

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:05.560
[Amit Varma]: prevent a level playing field, which prevent easy entry and competition.

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.840
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, these are actually not free markets.

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:12.680
[Amit Varma]: Even the private players in this are not supporters of free markets and are acting contrary to

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.680
[Guest 2]: these principles.

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.680
[Guest 1]: Which is understandable.

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.680
[Guest 2]: I mean, they are being rational.

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:22.000
[Guest 2]: It's the job of the regulator to say that I hear you, but this is not in the interest

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.360
[Guest 2]: of the larger society or what I am tasked with.

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.920
[Amit Varma]: And so I'm not going to agree with what you are saying.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.520
[Amit Varma]: But then there's a vicious circle that if the regulator is a government, the government

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.360
[Amit Varma]: have their own incentives at play.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.080
[Amit Varma]: For example, who is going to fund us in the next election?

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.520
[Amit Varma]: How do we get back to power?

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.840
[Guest 1]: And then that eventually there's a center play between money and power and we are caught

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.840
[Guest 1]: in a vicious circle.

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:47.200
[Guest 1]: And more than that, I mean, if you look at it, the statutory liquidity ratio, I think

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.760
[Guest 1]: is still 20 percent or 19 and a half, whatever.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:55.720
[Guest 1]: So almost, you know, by law, one fifth of the deposits that get collected need to be

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.800
[Guest 1]: invested in government bonds.

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.240
[Guest 1]: So it is in the government's interest to have one kind of banking because, you know, you

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.880
[Guest 1]: have all this money coming in.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.320
[Guest 1]: And when all this money gets invested in government bonds, obviously interest rates are going

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.320
[Guest 1]: to be low.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:14.040
[Guest 1]: So and the government is, you know, you and I might want higher interest rates on our

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.240
[Guest 1]: deposits, but the government loves low interest rates.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.640
[Guest 1]: So that is it's not just political funding.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:27.240
[Guest 1]: I mean, it just goes back to the core of how, you know, the banking is structured in India.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I've taken a lot of your time and gained a lot of insight from this episode.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Let me end by asking both of you again, a hypothetical and difficult question that what

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:43.160
[Amit Varma]: is in your minds, if let's say that you are in 2028, what is the best case scenario that

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.240
[Amit Varma]: has happened in these 10 years in terms of the financial system?

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And what is the worst case scenario?

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.960
[Amit Varma]: How bad can things get?

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And if there is any hope, where does that hope come from?

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.120
[Guest 1]: No, I mean, I don't think everything will go wrong.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:03.800
[Guest 1]: I mean, ultimately, you know, things have a way of sort of sorting themselves out.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.760
[Guest 1]: But in the worst case scenario, as you know, Dr. K.C. Chakraborty said, you know, bad loans

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:14.160
[Guest 1]: of banks will be at a level of 20 lakh crores.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.560
[Guest 1]: That indeed is a lot of money.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.600
[Guest 1]: Having said that, there are still I mean, if you if you look at some of the private

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.040
[Guest 1]: banks, I mean, banks like HDFC and Kotak, which are still pretty reasonably run.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:34.120
[Guest 1]: So, you know, people, depositors always have an option of sort of banking with these banks.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:40.560
[Guest 1]: And also, you know, as Ashutosh said, I mean, we need more small banks.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.200
[Guest 1]: I mean, once you increase competition, it obviously, you know, means more value for

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.040
[Guest 1]: the end consumer.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.480
[Guest 1]: And it also means that, you know, if one of the small banks sort of goes bust, you will

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.840
[Guest 1]: be able to limit the damage.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.920
[Guest 1]: I mean, take like, you know, I'm just sort of coming, you know, this is just a hypothetical

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:06.000
[Guest 1]: example here that let's say a bank just decides to do a credit card.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.360
[Guest 1]: So if they have expertise in that area, what will happen over a period of time is that

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.920
[Guest 1]: that they will obviously one is that they will offer a slightly higher rate of interest

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.400
[Guest 1]: to the depositors.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:23.080
[Guest 1]: And two, because they have, you know, expertise in that area, and because the defaults are

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:28.440
[Guest 1]: probably slightly lower than the overall market, they will also charge a slightly lower rate

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.120
[Guest 1]: of interest to their creditors.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.560
[Guest 1]: So the point is, unless you know, you sort of allow banks to innovate a little and experiment

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.640
[Guest 1]: with a few business models.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640
[Guest 1]: And obviously, I mean, you know,

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.080
[Guest 1]: And let them fail when they fail.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.600
[Guest 1]: Yes, let them fail.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.440
[Guest 1]: But to the extent that, you know, depositors money is not wiped out.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.380
[Guest 1]: Because you cannot be experimenting at the cost of, you know, so that sort of mentality

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.640
[Guest 1]: needs to seep in.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.640
[Guest 2]: But then, you know, I mean,

01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.200
[Guest 2]: If I can give you one example, I grew up in a small suburb outside Bombay.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.400
[Guest 2]: Sort of this was in the mid 1990s.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.080
[Guest 2]: There were no private sector banks, there were only public sector banks.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.360
[Guest 2]: And we had a couple of cooperative banks, and they would remain open from 7.30 in the

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:13.520
[Guest 2]: morning till 11 o'clock, and then open again from 5.30 to 7.30.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520
[Guest 2]: Wow.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520
[Guest 2]: The cooperative banks?

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.520
[Guest 2]: The cooperative banks.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520
[Guest 2]: So just six hours?

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520
[Guest 2]: Yes.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.200
[Guest 2]: So the staff might go back home or the what I'm not privy to, but you land at the train

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.520
[Guest 2]: station because that's how most people commute.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.880
[Guest 2]: And the branch is close by, you can do your banking business, go back home.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.400
[Guest 2]: Whereas most government offices, government banks, for example, would run from 9 till

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.040
[Guest 2]: 2 or so, when most people who travel to Bombay cannot access the banking system.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:42.200
[Guest 2]: So that sort of innovation is something that only can come when you are not in that same

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.400
[Guest 2]: structured bureaucratic sort of mindset.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.640
[Guest 2]: And this is a wonderful consumer, they would go to every shopkeeper and collect deposits.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.400
[Guest 2]: And BSU banks would just sit and sort of expect that some people will come and give money.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.400
[Guest 1]: Which is what Sahara also did, by the way.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400
[Unknown]: So it's not so straightforward.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.040
[Unknown]: No, but I agree with him.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.400
[Guest 1]: Because, you know, if you remember in the, you know, probably 20, 30 years back, people

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.000
[Guest 1]: used to have multiple bank accounts.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.680
[Guest 1]: I mean, in fact, some of my older relatives still have 10 accounts in public sector banks.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.080
[Guest 1]: So this is essentially a holdover of an era where, you know, you had to ensure that you

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:19.080
[Guest 1]: had access to your funds on almost all days of the week, at different points of time.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.960
[Guest 1]: So there is one bank which is open on Saturday.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.320
[Guest 1]: So you know, you sort of have an account there.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.880
[Guest 1]: There is one which sort of opens at 11 and closes at 3.30.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.160
[Guest 1]: So people did all these, you know, machinations, and then they opened accounts at different.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.840
[Amit Varma]: But now you don't because you have an ATM.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.580
[Amit Varma]: So now answer the second part of my question, which is what's your source of hope for whatever

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.400
[Amit Varma]: best case scenario can possibly happen?

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:48.680
[Guest 1]: I think, see, my source of hope is the fact that, you know, RBI, despite all its problems,

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.680
[Guest 1]: is actually decently run in comparison to, you know, other government institutions in

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.680
[Guest 1]: the country.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:59.960
[Guest 1]: And up until now, we've had decent, you know, governors.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:04.160
[Guest 1]: And even though, you know, they might have got there because they sort of, you know,

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.680
[Guest 1]: the government wanted them to, but once they are there, they usually, you know, let's say

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.400
[Guest 1]: seven and a half to eight out of 10 times tend to do the right thing.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.800
[Guest 1]: So if that continues, and if that position itself is not compromised, I have hope.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:22.800
[Guest 2]: Ashutosh?

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.520
[Guest 2]: So my hope and worry essentially stem from the same thing, which is the mess that PSU

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520
[Guest 2]: banks find in.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.280
[Guest 2]: I mean, there are two paths that we can take from here.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.000
[Guest 2]: One is that we do nothing.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
[Guest 2]: And PSU banks continue to shrink gradually, but their costs don't shrink.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.040
[Guest 2]: There's a big labor force.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.320
[Guest 2]: The cycle will turn at some point of time, there will be good days, which will come,

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.760
[Guest 2]: achche din will come for some time at least.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.400
[Guest 2]: They will, their profitability will improve.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.120
[Guest 2]: And then again, a downturn come, which will be worse possibly than what we have currently.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.640
[Guest 2]: That's the stage in which we do nothing.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:55.280
[Guest 2]: We just continue, government will give 10,000 crore, 15,000 crore capital every year that

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.280
[Guest 2]: is needed.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:01.520
[Guest 2]: They will sort of just survive, muddle around, and sort of that, and the sort of flamboyant

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.320
[Guest 2]: and the better and private sector banks will continue to go at their expense.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.760
[Guest 2]: The upside case is that we actually use this opportunity to reform our public sector banks.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.200
[Guest 2]: Either make them do things which they're good at and prevent them from doing things that

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:19.280
[Guest 2]: they're not good at, which is like say, project loans or some of those things.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.400
[Guest 2]: And we put in place a structure whereby political interference is minimized.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:28.160
[Guest 2]: And in that sense, public sector banks are at least able to hold on to some of the areas.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.360
[Guest 2]: I mean, to be fair, even now, there is an amount of trust that people have in keeping

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.800
[Guest 2]: deposits with public sector banks, which some private sector banks are able to, but not

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.800
[Guest 2]: all private sector banks.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:42.200
[Guest 2]: I much rather put my money in an SBI rather than most other private sector banks for a

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.420
[Guest 2]: lot of people in the interior parts.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:48.280
[Guest 2]: Can you leverage that strength that they have, prevent some of their bleeding on the asset

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.920
[Guest 2]: side, and at least they are able to generate a bare minimum, minimum return of capital

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.220
[Guest 2]: that they are not feeding off taxpayer money?

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.560
[Guest 2]: Because the next downturn might be worse than what we have seen.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:02.240
[Amit Varma]: Vivek and Ashutosh, thanks a lot for coming on the show and giving me so much insight.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:08.080
[Amit Varma]: I learned a lot today not only about ILNFS, but also what NBFCs and the banking sector

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.080
[Guest 2]: in general.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.080
[Guest 2]: Thanks, Amit.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Thanks.

[Unknown]: Cap.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640

[Unknown]: Move it.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.640
[Unknown]: Move it.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.640
[Unknown]: Kind of great.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.200
[Unknown]: Ji faqrakti?

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.400
[Unknown]: You interrupted.
