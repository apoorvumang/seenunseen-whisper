00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600
[Amit Varma]: If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.480
[Amit Varma]: That's an old philosophical thought experiment to which I will add this further question.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.160
[Amit Varma]: If you feel a desire that you cannot name or understand, does that desire exist?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.520
[Amit Varma]: This question is a poignant one with social and political implications.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.200
[Amit Varma]: We instinctively think of some desires as legit and others as desires that we must hide

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.160
[Amit Varma]: away from the world and perhaps even from ourselves.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.920
[Amit Varma]: We think of some desires as sanskari and others as somehow sinful, even if we don't act upon

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.920
[Amit Varma]: them.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.080
[Amit Varma]: But what is this sanskar?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Look a little deeper and you will find that much of what we think of as traditional Indian

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.180
[Amit Varma]: morality is actually a by-product of colonialism, an imposition by the British or Victorian

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.360
[Amit Varma]: prudishness onto a society that has otherwise acknowledged and respected so many different

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
[Amit Varma]: kinds of desires.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.680
[Amit Varma]: You might argue that, hey, the Manusmriti is such a repressive document, to which one

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.480
[Amit Varma]: can point out that the Kama Sutra written around the same period is not, and it was

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.920
[Amit Varma]: a British choice, not an Indian one, to privilege one over the other.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.960
[Amit Varma]: Indeed, the fact that we are today such an incredibly sexually repressed nation speaks

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.080
[Amit Varma]: to the victory of a strain of politics that has led to this.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.240
[Amit Varma]: India was not always like this.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.200
[Amit Varma]: India was not even mainly like this, but we suppressed the better angels of our nature

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.700
[Amit Varma]: and here we are.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.960
[Amit Varma]: But it's not too late.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.000
[Amit Varma]: We can still reclaim our true selves.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.120
[Amit Varma]: And one way of doing this is by acknowledging and understanding the infinite variety of

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:59.040
[Unknown]: our desires.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.720
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.600
[Amit Varma]: Today's episode is about the history of desire and the history of sexuality in India.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.720
[Amit Varma]: And my guest today is Madhavi Menon, author of the superb book, Infinite Variety, A History

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.240
[Amit Varma]: of Desire in India.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.640
[Amit Varma]: This was an eye-opening read for me and for those of you who are not interested in sex

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.840
[Amit Varma]: because hey, sex is sinful, worry not, this book is full of stories about gods and you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.040
[Amit Varma]: will find many moral lessons in their virtuous behavior.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.640
[Amit Varma]: Before I give in to my desire to begin this conversation, though, I will practice momentary

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.520
[Amit Varma]: renunciation by pausing for a commercial break.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.400
[Amit Varma]: If you're listening to the Scene and the Unseen, it means you like listening to audio and you're

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.820
[Amit Varma]: thirsty for knowledge, that being the case, I'd urge you to check out Storytel, the sponsors

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.160
[Amit Varma]: of this episode.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.680
[Amit Varma]: Storytel is an audiobook platform that has a massive range of audiobooks from around

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680
[Amit Varma]: the world.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.920
[Amit Varma]: Their international collection is stellar, but so is a local collection.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.640
[Amit Varma]: They have a fantastic range of Marathi and Hindi audiobooks.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.320
[Amit Varma]: What's more, I do a weekly podcast there called The Book Club with Amit Verma, in which I

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.240
[Amit Varma]: talk about one book every week, giving context, giving you a taste of it, and so on.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.440
[Amit Varma]: Download that app and listen to my show.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And as long as Storytel sponsors this show within this commercial itself, I will recommend

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.780
[Amit Varma]: an audiobook that I liked on that platform every week.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.160
[Amit Varma]: My recommendation for this week is Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel, a masterful historical novel

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.560
[Amit Varma]: that has won the Booker Prize.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.240
[Amit Varma]: You'd never imagine that a book set in England between the years 1500 to 1535 could be so

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.960
[Amit Varma]: rich and engrossing.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.020
[Amit Varma]: Listen to it as soon as you can on Storytel.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.600

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.720
[Amit Varma]: Remember to Storytel with a single L. Storytel.com.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.560
[Amit Varma]: Madhavi, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.560
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.360
[Guest]: Thank you for your wonderful introduction, which frankly says everything I want to say

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.920
[Guest]: much better than I could ever say it.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.600
[Guest]: So I don't know whether to say thank you or we're done.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.320
[Amit Varma]: We can go have coffee now.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.320
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320
[Amit Varma]: So before we...

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.800
[Amit Varma]: No, no, there is so much in your great book.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.520
[Amit Varma]: And if I had a choice, I would keep you in the studio for all day to talk about it.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.160
[Unknown]: Let's first talk about yourself.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.620
[Amit Varma]: You know, what did you study?

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.520
[Amit Varma]: What were your sort of formative influences?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've specialized in queer theory for a long time before you came to this.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.920
[Amit Varma]: What's your journey been like?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.920
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.240
[Guest]: I find those kinds of questions hard to answer because my life seems quite unremarkable actually.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.120
[Guest]: But maybe that's what makes it fun.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.560
[Guest]: I've always been interested, I guess, in underdogs.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.560
[Guest]: I've always been interested in people who are not privileged, who are not in the center,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.680
[Guest]: people who are marginalized, which at a very young age included women.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.100
[Guest]: And so from a very young age, I was actually very keen on taking up arms against boys and

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.100
[Guest]: against men.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.040
[Guest]: And I remember one of my earliest memories is when I was 10 years old, I was the editor

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.280
[Guest]: of my colony newsletter or newspaper.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.880
[Guest]: And my first editorial had the wonderful title of boys, colon, something needs to be done.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.880
[Amit Varma]: This would have been 1981.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.920
[Guest]: I don't want to give your age away, but early 80s, right?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.920
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920
[Guest]: Wow.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.560
[Guest]: So, given that evidence, obviously, from an early age onwards, I was very invested both

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.780
[Guest]: in speaking up for people who I thought did not have a voice and be and actually trying

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.280
[Guest]: to do something about it.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.860
[Guest]: And so I can't remember when exactly I turned to queer theory or to an interest in sexuality,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.000
[Guest]: but I've always been interested in thinking about things that we ignore or take for granted

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.520
[Guest]: or vilify or actively sort of resist and push into a corner.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.800
[Guest]: And I've always been free or felt free to do that.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.140
[Guest]: My parents have always been supportive, maybe a bit puzzled by me at times, but always supportive.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.940
[Guest]: My mother was a professor of English until she retired, so she was very interested in

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.060
[Guest]: sort of intellectual flights of fancy.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.320
[Guest]: And my father, from whom I get my politics, was just always very politically active.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.280
[Guest]: You know, their families come from Kerala, even though they grew up in Madras, and from

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.280
[Guest]: a Kerala in which the Land Distribution Act was happening when they were younger.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.400
[Guest]: And my father, who comes from a very huge landowning family, a lot of their land got

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.680
[Guest]: taken away.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.500
[Guest]: And all his life, he said that was absolutely the right thing to do.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.660
[Guest]: And so I imbibed a lot of my politics from him, a lot of my intellect from my mother.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.280
[Guest]: And there was never a question of my having to fight against them or fight against my

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.800
[Guest]: family, which I realized is a huge absence of pressure.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.120
[Guest]: You know, a lot of people have to fight against their families first before they can do anything.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.360
[Guest]: But for me, it was just always easy for me to focus on what I wanted to, because that

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.840
[Guest]: was never a problem, that I never had to fight at home, the battles that I could fight outside.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.560
[Guest]: And for that, I think I'm very, very lucky.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.560
[Amit Varma]: And who was sort of your formative influences?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.640
[Amit Varma]: Like one question I often ask my guests, and one doesn't always have a pat answer to this

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.640
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, what are the books or what is the book that changed the way you think about

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.640
[Amit Varma]: the world?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.840
[Amit Varma]: And is this, you know, some thinkers or some books that you can identify as just opening

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.800
[Amit Varma]: your eyes to a new way of looking at the world or clarifying things a little bit more?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I am so bad at answering those kinds of questions, because I just sort of don't

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.360
[Guest]: keep lists.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.880
[Guest]: But if I look back over my own lived reality, clearly, someone who influenced me a lot,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.080
[Guest]: so much that I wanted to work on him, ever since I could remember, was Shakespeare.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.160
[Guest]: I mean, my dissertation work was on Shakespeare, my first three books are on Shakespeare, and

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.740
[Guest]: I'm very deeply invested in him.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.480
[Guest]: And I hate to admit it, but I'm that kind of nerd that when I'm feeling down, and need

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.840
[Guest]: something to pick me up, I actually turn to Shakespeare to read him, because that immediately

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.540
[Guest]: picks me up.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:07.840
[Guest]: And so I've always known from, I'd say my middle teens, that I wanted to work on Shakespeare.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.560
[Guest]: And when I went to graduate school in the US, I remember having a conversation with

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.160
[Guest]: my advisor, because I thought, you know, I wanted to work on Shakespeare.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.360
[Guest]: And he said, that's great, do it.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.480
[Guest]: But people have been writing on him for over 400 years.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.320
[Guest]: So try and see if there's something different that you can do.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.000
[Guest]: And that, I would say, is the first time I actually started thinking about what it was

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.500
[Guest]: in Shakespeare that uplifted me, that actually drew me to it.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.640
[Guest]: Because before that, it was just, oh, my God, I love this, right?

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.280
[Guest]: And this is something that we work against with our students.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.160
[Guest]: It's like, it's great that you love it, and now think about what it is that's inspiring

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.320
[Guest]: that love.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.080
[Guest]: And so for me, when my advisor said, now think about what it is that you want to do with

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.520
[Guest]: Shakespeare, and maybe you want to look at him slightly differently, it became very,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.280
[Guest]: very clear to me then, and it's something that I'm still sort of amazed by, how you

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:08.280
[Guest]: can say in wonderful language, in fabulous poetry and prose, things that are really hard

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.200
[Guest]: hitting, things that are really subversive.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:18.800
[Guest]: And it's almost like packaging a radical politics in a gorgeous form.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.800
[Guest]: So whether it's his poetry or his plays, and you know, I'm happy to talk about both, there's

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.620
[Guest]: a way in which Shakespeare is just sort of hits you when you least expect it.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.400
[Guest]: And that's a skill I don't have, because I'm sort of very blunt edged, and it's like I

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.120
[Guest]: will hit you openly.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.800
[Guest]: But Shakespeare is a real artist that way.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.520
[Guest]: And one of the things I love most about his work, it's something like the poet Keats later

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.080
[Guest]: diagnosed about Shakespeare, and he said, Shakespeare has a negative capability, which

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:54.320
[Guest]: is to say he himself will not be anything, but he'll take on board any persona, any idea,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.120
[Guest]: and become that.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.000
[Guest]: And for me, that's always been important, especially in a day and age now where the

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.640
[Guest]: idea of the self is so important, it's like this is who I am, or this is what I am.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.680
[Guest]: And I think we are so obsessed with the self that we forget to take on board otherness.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.240
[Guest]: And so for me, that taking on board otherness is what Shakespeare exemplifies par excellence,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.560
[Guest]: he is able to take on board multiplicity.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.880
[Guest]: And that for me, just comes through in his works in ways that I find absolutely mind

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.880
[Amit Varma]: boggling.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.560
[Amit Varma]: And that's fundamentally what art does, right?

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.320
[Amit Varma]: It takes on otherness, and it takes on those multiplicities.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:35.040
[Amit Varma]: If Shakespeare was alive today, in this age of Instagram and TikTok and YouTube, web series

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.560
[Guest]: and all that, what do you think he'd be doing?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.640
[Guest]: You know, the thing about Shakespeare that we forget, I mean, maybe you don't forget,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.440
[Guest]: most of us forget, is that he was a popular writer, right?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.560
[Guest]: He was writing for entertainment, he was writing to make money, like there is no question about

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.560
[Guest]: that.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.760
[Guest]: He was very clear that he needed to make money, he was not writing, he didn't think of his

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.160
[Guest]: writing as high art in any sense.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.280
[Guest]: So whatever is most popular now, and you will know that better than me, that's what he would

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.160
[Guest]: be doing, right?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.760
[Guest]: And one of my colleagues was, I was telling you about him, who's written this book called

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.960
[Guest]: Masala Shakespeare, his argument is that he would be writing for cinema, and not for Hollywood,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.480
[Guest]: but for Bollywood, that Shakespeare would be writing popular scripts, with song and

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.320
[Guest]: dance, because his plays also full of that, all kinds of masala elements thrown into it,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.520
[Amit Varma]: because that's what his plays do.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.440
[Amit Varma]: He practically invented masala, like so much of Bollywood tropes come from Shakespeare.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.440
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.240
[Guest]: And therefore, it's no surprise that Shakespeare provides the script for a lot of Bollywood

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.480
[Guest]: films as well, you know, various kinds of adaptations.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.320
[Guest]: My favorite being, of course, Bhansali's Goliyon ki Raas Leela, Ram Leela, which I think is

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.320
[Guest]: just magnificent.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, which I haven't seen.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.960
[Amit Varma]: So how did you, and in fact, you know, you're talking about Shakespeare's popularity, I

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.240
[Amit Varma]: was telling you before this recording that I teach this course for Takshashila on how

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.800
[Amit Varma]: to write an op-ed in like, four webinars, and the second one of them is called the music

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800
[Amit Varma]: of language.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.320
[Amit Varma]: And it talks about Shakespeare a lot.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.680
[Amit Varma]: It talks about why Shakespeare would have been a great op-ed writer, because part of

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.800
[Amit Varma]: the art of writing an op-ed always has to be to write accessibly.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.320
[Amit Varma]: And for me, iambic pentameter is just the optimal accessible form.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, because it's rhythmic and easy to say, right.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.920
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, that's the optimal length of a sentence, you know, which you can sort

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.440
[Guest]: of read comfortably or say comfortably.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.560
[Guest]: And the meter, the iambic pentameter, of course, is, as people say, often like the heartbeat.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.640
[Guest]: So it's just, it comes naturally to the body and viscerally to the body, which is great.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.440
[Guest]: I'm glad your students get some Shakespeare in how to write an op-ed.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.880
[Guest]: I mean, this is something we always forget, not always, often forget about Shakespeare,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.520
[Guest]: because we're so obsessed with the plot of his plays, is that it's his language that's

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.520
[Guest]: doing all the work.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.320
[Guest]: I mean, my favorite example is, say, Romeo and Juliet, in the first 14 lines of that

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.040
[Guest]: play, he tells you the plot.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.080
[Guest]: These two people are going to fall in love and they're going to die.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.800
[Guest]: Then we still have five acts after that, you know.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.200
[Guest]: So the only reason to read that is not to find out, okay, kya hua?

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200
[Guest]: What happened?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200
[Guest]: There's no suspense.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.800
[Guest]: It's to find out how does this work out?

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800
[Guest]: In what language?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800
[Guest]: In what form?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800
[Guest]: In what way?

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.760
[Guest]: So he's very clear, and none of his plots, with perhaps the exception of The Tempest or

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.720
[Guest]: a play like Pericles, actually not even Pericles, none of his plots is original.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.840
[Guest]: So our obsession right now, for instance, with the idea of originality, Shakespeare

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.360
[Guest]: would not have understood what that meant.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, there's a very cool book called The Seven Basic Plots by Christopher Booker, I

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920
[Amit Varma]: think.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.120
[Amit Varma]: And as a teacher of English, you must have access to so many such books.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.960
[Amit Varma]: But essentially, there are just a handful of plots which are recycled over and over

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.960
[Unknown]: again.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.840
[Amit Varma]: And what is important is perhaps a journey and not so much the destination.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.520
[Amit Varma]: And your destination through all of this was this book, which we are talking about today.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.760
[Amit Varma]: But what was your journey to it?

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Like, how did you arrive at this subject of writing about the history of desire?

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.000
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, I'm struck by what you said about when you teach your students about how

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.680
[Guest]: to write an op-ed, you sort of insist to them on accessibility.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.240
[Guest]: And that's something I pride myself on as well.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.640
[Guest]: And it's something that comes quite naturally to me.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.840
[Guest]: Because I think writing should be accessible, not in the sense of dumbed down, because I

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.520
[Guest]: think writing needs to deal with extremely rigorous ideas.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.720
[Guest]: And I'm a great believer in rigor.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.520
[Guest]: But that it needs to draw people in, insufficiently so that they want to deal with that difficulty,

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.520
[Guest]: right?

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.440
[Guest]: If you put them off at the very outset, then they're not going to come in to deal with

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.120
[Guest]: that difficulty.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.840
[Guest]: So for me, I've always, even when I was writing my academic books, very invested in writing

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.200
[Guest]: accessibly.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:47.920
[Guest]: And but as you know, when you're writing academic books, there is a certain degree of formal

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.920
[Guest]: constraint, right?

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.600
[Guest]: So you have to cite various texts, you have to have a bibliography that's very long.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.640
[Guest]: And I was never fond of that, because I always thought that interrupted the flow of the writing.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.280
[Guest]: And so I guess over the last 20 years, as I've been writing my books, I've been sort

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.840
[Guest]: of filing away certain lessons about how I would ideally like a popular book to be.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.800
[Guest]: And all this was while I was still in the US, I was studying there, working there.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.400
[Guest]: And then after I came back, one of the things I loved about being back, and one of the reasons

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.560
[Guest]: I wanted to move back, is that the intellectual culture in India is just much more broad based

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.260
[Guest]: than it is in the US.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.720
[Guest]: As with so many things in the US, if you are an academic, you're an academic, you don't

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.440
[Guest]: really interact with anybody else, you're speaking to one another, five people will

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.320
[Guest]: read your book, and your book will come out two years after you've actually written it

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.280
[Guest]: when you've even forgotten what it is.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.880
[Guest]: And so that kind of lag, time lag in terms of publication, social lag in terms of interaction,

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.840
[Guest]: is deeply ingrained in the US.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.160
[Guest]: One of the many things I love about being here is that academics are reading the same

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:04.180
[Guest]: thing that lawyers are reading, that podcasters are reading, that activists are reading.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.960
[Guest]: And so the conversation is much more multiform, right, that you can speak to many more demographics,

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.400
[Guest]: which I find enriching and enlivening, I really find it exciting.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.600
[Guest]: So that was one thing.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:24.040
[Guest]: And the second thing was that the conversations that people have can actually be about really

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.640
[Guest]: difficult subjects, but they can be had conversationally.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.520
[Guest]: And so I was very invested in that as well.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.440
[Guest]: And so I came back, I started writing a lot of op-eds, a lot of articles, which I loved

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.760
[Guest]: doing, because I was reaching a huge audience right away.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.160
[Guest]: I was writing it the previous day, next day, it would emerge, right, which was unheard

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160
[Amit Varma]: of with academics.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.240
[Amit Varma]: How does an academy cope with the shock of reading a book?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.440
[Guest]: That was really shocking.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.240
[Guest]: But more important than that, I was been doing this for a year or two.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:59.480
[Guest]: And then I met Ravi Singh, who was my editor, who was then with Aleph Books.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.200
[Guest]: And Ravi had read one of my articles, I don't remember which one, I think it was something

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:12.240
[Guest]: about 377 or something about the national flag or one of those uncontroversial topics

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.120
[Guest]: about which I write.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.400
[Guest]: And he approached me and he said, I want you to write something about desire in India.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.400
[Guest]: And I said to Ravi, I have no training in India.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.520
[Guest]: I am not a scholar of Indian literature, philosophy, history, religion, nothing.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.840
[Guest]: I can't write about India.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.240
[Guest]: And when you meet Ravi, which I hope you will at some point, you will realize he's an extremely

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.320
[Guest]: persistent man.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.520
[Guest]: So he said, actually not dissimilar to what my advisor said to me, he said, you just need

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.040
[Guest]: to think about it differently.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.920
[Guest]: Because I'm not asking you to write the definitive history of India.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.360
[Guest]: I'm asking you to think about how these questions of desire that are affecting the way in which

00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.480
[Guest]: you're thinking about life around you can actually be written in book form.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.560
[Guest]: So I promised him I'd think about it at least.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.740
[Guest]: And then I thought about it for a while.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:10.440
[Guest]: And what became clear to me is that I could never write the book on desire in India.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.880
[Guest]: But what I could do, and this is what I tried to do, is that I tried to think about the

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.480
[Guest]: important questions that animate queer theory.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.840
[Guest]: Now, queer theory as a field barely even exists here, right?

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.000
[Guest]: But the important questions that animate queer theory, which, you know, broadly are questions

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.760
[Guest]: of identity, desire, sort of clothing, behavior, biology, I mean, all that stuff.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:44.380
[Guest]: And think about what Indian writings, thoughts, beliefs have said about these questions.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.360
[Guest]: So my framing narratives were very much derived from my training as a queer theorist.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.880
[Guest]: Those are the questions I was going in with.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.200
[Guest]: But the material I was looking at from the vantage point of these questions were Indian

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.740
[Guest]: materials, which I had never really looked at before.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.000
[Guest]: And I remember starting out by saying, I am not going to touch the Kama Sutra because

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.480
[Guest]: it's been done to death, right?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.640
[Guest]: Anyone who thinks about Indian sexuality does that.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.440
[Guest]: But I said, I have to read it at least.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.960
[Guest]: And when I read it, I was blown away.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.360
[Guest]: And so, as you know, I refer to the Kama Sutra a lot in my book.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:23.440
[Guest]: But my goal in the book was to be accessible, to be focused on specific questions and arguments

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.280
[Guest]: and ideas so people can actually engage, not be esoteric at all, which is what people think

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.680
[Guest]: when it's, oh, my God, this is Indian philosophy or Indian religion.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.400
[Guest]: People get completely turned off by that.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.040
[Guest]: But I'm used to that because that's what people do with Shakespeare as well, right?

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.960
[Guest]: It's like, oh, my God, Shakespeare is so esoteric, I can't deal with it.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.940
[Guest]: So I'm actually very used to dealing with subjects that people think of as difficult,

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.240
[Guest]: but that I know actually affects our everyday life.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.580
[Guest]: And so I guess I've had a lot of training thinking about these subjects and insisting

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:59.520
[Guest]: to people that, in fact, you're not, you don't have to be brilliant or have a PhD in order

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.520
[Guest]: to address these subjects.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.560
[Guest]: These are subjects you're addressing already.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.740
[Guest]: So let's just pause and think about them.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.200
[Guest]: And so that was the way in which I arrived at this book, with a lot of encouragement

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:15.600
[Guest]: from Ravi and a lot of encouragement to sort of change the way I was thinking about India.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.600
[Guest]: And so for me, as soon as I was able to get my questions right, I was able to delve into

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.600
[Guest]: the material.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.520
[Guest]: Because otherwise, I think, if I had just jumped into the material without any clue,

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.920
[Guest]: I wouldn't have been able to anchor myself in any way.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.820
[Guest]: So I had to anchor myself as a queer theorist, and then approach this material that was new.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.820
[Guest]: And it was just exhilarating.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.520
[Amit Varma]: No, and it was exhilarating as a reader for me to read it.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.000
[Amit Varma]: I had a lot of fun reading it.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.920
[Amit Varma]: So I could make out that you had a lot of fun writing it.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.920
[Amit Varma]: And it sort of strikes me that there is the role of happenstance, that you weren't thinking

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.920
[Amit Varma]: of doing this.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.000
[Amit Varma]: And then Ravi happened to ask you, and then you looked at it.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.400
[Amit Varma]: And you went along a different path than you otherwise would have.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.240
[Guest]: And who knows, maybe there's some other book at the end of the path not taken.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.020
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of fascinating.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.800
[Amit Varma]: So you know, one of the things that you say in your book, and you've said in your talks,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.440
[Amit Varma]: and that you're very adamant about is that you will not define desire, right?

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.960
[Amit Varma]: So I won't ask you to define it, obviously, that would be mildly silly.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.760
[Amit Varma]: But I'm just curious as to whether, you know, for example, it strikes me that, you know,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.680
[Amit Varma]: yesterday, I was craving a biryani.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Now my desire for biryani is not desire.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.360
[Amit Varma]: That's not what you mean in the book.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.920
[Amit Varma]: From what I could make out your book includes your book accommodates carnal desire, romantic

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.680
[Amit Varma]: desire, which some would say is a rationalization, but at some biological level of carnal desire,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.200
[Amit Varma]: perhaps even a little bit of spiritual desire thrown in, I don't know, I mean, so how does

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.280
[Amit Varma]: one then think about desire in this sense, without necessarily trying to nail it down,

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.720
[Guest]: which is a mistake all these patriarchs have made through history?

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720
[Guest]: Right.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.720
[Guest]: And that's a great question.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:04.600
[Guest]: I think after the victory in Delhi, we should all be eating biryani to celebrate.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.480
[Amit Varma]: We are recording this on February 13.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.480
[Amit Varma]: That's right.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.000
[Amit Varma]: I would say it was a victory for us, but not necessarily a defeat for the BJP.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.200
[Guest]: And therefore, we should eat biryani just to make sure that we continue fighting.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.800
[Guest]: Well said.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.520
[Guest]: I would disagree that your desire for biryani is not the kind of desire I'm talking about.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.440
[Guest]: Because I think one of the things I have done that we find convenient to do is precisely

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:39.320
[Guest]: to sort of separate desires from one another, devaluing some and overvaluing, I would say,

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.320
[Guest]: others.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.680
[Guest]: And so your desire for biryani seems to fall into the lower class of desire, because it's

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.280
[Guest]: merely appetite, it's merely bodily, it has nothing to do with intellect, this, that and

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.280
[Guest]: the other.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.600
[Guest]: I'm sort of paraphrasing what I think you might have felt when you said that.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:01.960
[Guest]: And I would disagree with that because I really think one doesn't know the seat of desire.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.960
[Guest]: One doesn't know what the confluences are that create certain desires.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.680
[Guest]: And so I would say your mind was very much active in your bodily desire for biryani.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.940
[Guest]: And so one of the things, of course, that I am interested in is not making that distinction

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.640
[Guest]: between mind and body, that there is something about the body that is very much controlled

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.120
[Guest]: by the mind, equally something about the mind that is very much controlled by the body.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.320
[Guest]: And these things come together in all these desires that you mentioned.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.640
[Guest]: And so for me, that desire for biryani, and as you know, I have a chapter on paan in the

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.960
[Guest]: book, and I could easily have had a chapter on food in general.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:51.360
[Guest]: Because our desire for X is always a desire that comes from not necessarily a known source.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.580
[Guest]: So we don't know necessarily, oh, why do I want biryani now?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.840
[Guest]: And I think that absence of an origin or the complicated nature of an origin is always

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.880
[Guest]: what is interesting for me.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.120
[Guest]: That's number one.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:11.000
[Guest]: Number two becomes, we rank desires because we sort of feel some can be satisfied, which

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.760
[Guest]: are the lesser desires, and some can't be satisfied, which are the higher desires.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.800
[Guest]: But of course, as you yourself already know, you'd be quite happy to eat biryani again

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.800
[Guest]: today.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.120
[Guest]: But just because you ate it yesterday doesn't mean your desire is satisfied.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:28.800
[Guest]: And this is precisely how we actually live sexuality.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.480
[Guest]: And someone like Freud was one of the early people to theorize this, although, as I say

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.600
[Guest]: in my book, we've had these ideas around in India for centuries.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:45.480
[Guest]: The idea that an act or a deed can exhaust your desire of any kind is completely fallacious.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.120
[Guest]: So whether it is the act of genital sex, whether it is the act of eating biryani, whether it

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:56.040
[Guest]: is the act of writing a letter or an op-ed, that desire, as long as it's desire, always

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.160
[Guest]: needs to be refueled.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.800
[Guest]: And that is precisely why desire is both so scary and necessary.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.240
[Guest]: It's what keeps us going from day to day.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.560
[Guest]: It's also what gets us charged up because it's the thing that can never be satisfied

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.480
[Guest]: in any lasting manner.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.520
[Guest]: And so that's why desire, which is why there's so much legislation against it, desire can

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:25.640
[Guest]: be extremely threatening, both to the self and to the status quo at large, because it's

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.480
[Guest]: the thing that erupts without necessarily having an origin.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.920
[Guest]: It's the thing that erupts, and even when it seems to subside, can erupt at some other

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.120
[Guest]: point in some other day.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.360
[Guest]: So it's the thing over which we don't necessarily have control, which is why it's fascinating

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.080
[Guest]: to me to think about, for instance, traditions of celibacy.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.880
[Guest]: And if I had written a chapter on food, you know, all this sort of fasting, all these

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:58.040
[Guest]: are ways of trying to establish control over something that actually we fear controls us.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.320
[Guest]: And that's why desire can be so frightening.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.520
[Guest]: That's why we want to actually compartmentalize it and say, these desires are okay, but these

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.720
[Guest]: are bad.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:11.000
[Guest]: And my argument is that all desire is potentially threatening, no matter what kind.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's sort of, you know, you quote from the Kama Sutra Vatsyayana saying, passion

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.240
[Unknown]: knows no order, right, where even where he's outlying, you know, the different kinds of

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.440
[Amit Varma]: desires, he also says, look, there are exceptions, I can't contain them.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.680
[Amit Varma]: And what seems to me, as you outlined so beautifully in your book, that one of the tragedies of

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.240
[Amit Varma]: human society, in a sense, is that we have forced these categories and taxonomies onto

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:43.640
[Amit Varma]: our desires, which then also have this overlay of normative thinking around them, that you

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.440
[Amit Varma]: know, heterosexuality is good, man and woman having children is good, but something else

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.440
[Amit Varma]: is not good.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.800
[Amit Varma]: Three lovers together is not good, for example, which you have a chapter on called fractions.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:03.560
[Amit Varma]: And so, tell me a little bit about this normative urge, like, is it an inevitable urge, or is

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.920
[Amit Varma]: it just happenstance that that urge run out where at one time in our culture, we had this

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:15.120
[Amit Varma]: multiplicity of desires that did not need to be given a name and about which value judgments

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.120
[Amit Varma]: were not necessarily made.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:23.920
[Amit Varma]: And then we move to this very puritanical sort of setup where, you know, it's all different.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:30.240
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, Sudhir Kakkar has a biography of Vatsyayana, which is titled the ascetic

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.240
[Guest]: of desire.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.800
[Guest]: It's a fictional biography.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.880
[Guest]: And he's getting that phrase, which seems to be completely sort of contradictory.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.600
[Guest]: He's getting that phrase from Vatsyayana himself, because Vatsyayana writes at the end of the

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.200
[Guest]: Kama Sutra, in which he sort of outlined all these sexual positions, among other things,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.520
[Guest]: but all these ways of having sex.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.320
[Guest]: He says at the end, Vatsyayana was completely celibate for the duration of writing this

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.800
[Guest]: text, that I wrote it not for my pleasure, but for disseminating knowledge.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:08.880
[Guest]: And that is a very, that is a sort of nod to a very clear prescription that students

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.120
[Guest]: should not have sex, right, so that that stage of one's life, when one is a student, one

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120
[Guest]: should not have sex.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.240
[Guest]: I keep joking about this with my students saying, look how how fallen you are compared

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.800
[Guest]: to that.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.480
[Guest]: Because the idea was that you need to and it's a complicated idea, because it's an idea

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:31.600
[Guest]: that is completely opposite, say Greek ideas about education in the in the same time.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:37.520
[Guest]: So Vatsyayana says, I was celibate, but my celibacy, and this goes back to what I was

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:43.080
[Guest]: talking about Shakespeare's negative capability, my celibacy should not take away from the

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: fact that I can know and enjoy sexual positions, right, and that kind of ability to speak from

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.280
[Guest]: more than one position is what I fear we are losing now.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.840
[Guest]: And so it's not necessarily that we were more plural and are not now, I think we are every

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.440
[Guest]: bit as plural now as we were then.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.720
[Guest]: But we are certainly trying to cage that plurality, because it seems to be dangerous.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.880
[Guest]: It seems to be scary to people.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:19.320
[Guest]: And so Vatsyayana can say, I am writing of things that I am not practicing right now.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:26.720
[Guest]: Whereas nowadays, the most sort of popular, say tag of a movie is based on a true story,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.600
[Guest]: or based on real life.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.600
[Guest]: And we are so invested in people speaking their truth, that we refuse to allow for the

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.480
[Guest]: fact that people have multiple truths.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.600
[Guest]: And people have multiple falsities as well.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.840
[Guest]: And no truth is completely the truth in the sense that we understand exactly.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.080
[Guest]: And so that I feel is what we're losing.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.520
[Guest]: And that's what say someone like Vatsyayana is able to model for us, that you don't have

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.880
[Guest]: to actually have one truth alone that defines you for the rest of your life, which I fear

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:58.280
[Guest]: is the problem with sexual identities.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.560
[Guest]: And now this is a very, and I'm well aware that this is a sort of controversial thing

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:09.640
[Guest]: I'm saying, but I've said it many times before, that I understand the desire to be able to

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:19.120
[Guest]: say I am X, but that the people most fully served by my assertion that I am X, are people

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.600
[Guest]: in power over me, not me myself.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:28.240
[Guest]: So in this sense, I think identity is a bit of a trap, because it's only people who want

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:34.160
[Guest]: to curtail my identity and shape it themselves, who want to know who I am.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:41.480
[Guest]: So this question of I am X seems to me a wasted statement because I am X, Y, Z and A, B, C

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.840
[Guest]: as well.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.760
[Guest]: But being forced to say I am X doesn't serve me.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:52.240
[Guest]: It only serves those forms with those multiple boxes of which I can take only one.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:59.540
[Guest]: And so what is sad for me about identity politics is to see people embracing it as their truth,

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:04.920
[Guest]: when it's nothing but the idea of truth as singularity being imposed on them.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:11.960
[Guest]: And so my quarrel with identity politics is that people like us, and I mean every single

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:17.440
[Guest]: one of us because every single one of us is on the margins at various points in our lives.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:23.640
[Guest]: People like us ought to know better, rather than try and scramble to join the center.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.560
[Guest]: We need to be able to embrace marginality much more fully, and not necessarily speak

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.560
[Guest]: the language of the oppressor, which in this case, I think is the language of truth with

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.560
[Amit Varma]: a capital T.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, what you just said, and also, you know, a lot of what is in your book, reminded me

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.080
[Amit Varma]: of this great insight that I got from Tony Joseph's book last year, Early Indians and

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.960
[Amit Varma]: Tony Joseph was also on the scene in The Unseen.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.180
[Amit Varma]: And one of the interesting things he pointed out was, of course, all those different migrations

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.360
[Amit Varma]: took place from out of Africa, West Asia, then the Aryan migration.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.920
[Amit Varma]: And then after the Aryans came and the Aryans were here and the remnants of the Harappans

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:08.280
[Amit Varma]: were here and the earlier and what happened was that for about 2000 years, it was a party.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.400
[Amit Varma]: Everybody mingled with everybody else.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.400
[Amit Varma]: It was full Saturday night, every day, right.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:21.200
[Amit Varma]: And then what happened is, around a couple of 1000 years ago, endogamy sets in a particular

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:27.720
[Amit Varma]: and this is really the victory of a particular political strand, which is that Brahminical

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.680
[Amit Varma]: strand which, you know, sets up the caste system and so on and so forth.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.480
[Amit Varma]: And there's endogamy and you're not allowed to sort of mingle with others.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, Robert Reich expressed the consequences of this quite brilliantly, the geneticist,

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.800
[Amit Varma]: when he said that, you know, people think of India as a large population.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.800
[Amit Varma]: It's not.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.760
[Amit Varma]: The Han Chinese are a large population.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.480
[Amit Varma]: India is a collection of many, many small populations, which is what endogamy has done

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.480
[Amit Varma]: to us.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:33:00.160
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me from this, that one of the driving forces behind maintaining this sort

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.320
[Amit Varma]: of power structure would be controlling the sexual and reproductive choices of women,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:11.800
[Amit Varma]: and therefore, the curtailment of desire and the creation and the propagation of these

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800
[Guest]: narrow categories.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.800
[Guest]: Does that make sense to you?

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.440
[Guest]: It makes perfect sense to me.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.480
[Guest]: Thank you. Wendy Doniger has done a lot of work on this.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:24.400
[Guest]: And as she, as many others have pointed out, the Rig Veda, for instance, begins with a

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.160
[Guest]: hymn to desire.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.040
[Guest]: And it begins with a hymn that says the only thing we can know is desire.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.080
[Guest]: And even that we can never fully understand.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.520
[Guest]: I mean, it pretty much is the thesis of my book, which is that all we know is that we're

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.400
[Guest]: shaped by desire and that we can never know in what way it's going to shape us.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.360
[Guest]: That's the way the Rig Veda begins.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.040
[Guest]: It's not till about 800 BC and the Upanishads start getting written, which is sort of several

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.080
[Guest]: hundred years later, that this second strand that you're talking about starts getting injected

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.360
[Guest]: into these discourses.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:03.240
[Guest]: And so the Vedic literature in and of itself is actually quite invested in desire and sexuality,

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.440
[Guest]: sometimes very disturbingly.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.920
[Guest]: For instance, you'll remember the story of Brahma.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.560
[Guest]: The reason why Brahma has four heads is because he's lusting after his daughter and wants

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.720
[Guest]: to see her whichever direction she goes in.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.920
[Guest]: And that is, for us now, a shocking story on all kinds of fronts.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.320
[Guest]: First of all, he's a god, he's meant to be the creator.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.160
[Guest]: Second, this is what we call incest.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.280
[Guest]: Third, it's also what we call harassment, because she keeps trying to run away from

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.680
[Guest]: him and he keeps growing heads so as to look at her from every direction.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.680
[Amit Varma]: That's in the Vedas.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.240
[Guest]: A fantastic God for the modern surveillance age.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.240
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.240
[Guest]: That's right.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.240
[Guest]: The CCTV camera God.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.240
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:44.400
[Guest]: And so our literatures of all kinds, our scriptures of all kinds, are actually filled with the

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.000
[Guest]: most disturbing kinds of desires, at least disturbing from our vantage point today.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.920
[Guest]: And so to suddenly then start that purification process must have come as a shock even then

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.940
[Guest]: if it continues to reverberate for us today as a shock, and it does.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:05.240
[Guest]: So you can imagine, I don't know what kind of battles must have taken place, but some

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:11.680
[Guest]: scholars say that one of the battles was the advent of Buddhism and Jainism.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:18.360
[Guest]: That they found a lot of people moving away from Vedic Hinduism, which was not of course

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.600
[Guest]: called Hinduism then, so just Vedic religions.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.340
[Guest]: Moving away from Vedic religions to the asceticism of Buddhism.

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.560
[Guest]: And so Vedic religions then said, oh my God, we're losing popularity.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.080
[Guest]: What are we going to do?

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:35.680
[Guest]: And so they decided to inject a strand of asceticism into their discourses in order

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.920
[Guest]: to woo these people back.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.060
[Guest]: That's why you have this entire sort of four stages of life where they say, okay, you can

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:47.160
[Guest]: have sex in this one stage, the householder stage, but everything before and after a celibate,

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.320
[Guest]: including the student stage.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.240
[Guest]: And then the varnaprastha stage, right, when you go into the forest.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.840
[Guest]: So all these are huge developments.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:00.640
[Guest]: We don't quite, we're not privy to the controversies at that time where they debated this.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.700
[Guest]: But no doubt they existed to a large extent.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.880
[Guest]: But you can see how this extremely political desire, which unfortunately continues to this

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:15.340
[Guest]: day, where you want to use your religion to draw people away from other ways of being

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.160
[Guest]: in the world, must have existed.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:23.880
[Guest]: It must have because Vedic religions definitely change or start changing.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.300
[Guest]: Which is why, of course, even in the Mahabharata, you have the story of the invention of marriage.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.640
[Guest]: Marriage did not exist for the longest time, right?

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:36.040
[Guest]: And this person called Shweta Ketu is sort of described as the person who started marriage

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.960
[Guest]: and he starts marriage because, and he's the son of a famous, what we would call today

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:48.960
[Guest]: sexologist, son of a famous sexologist who teaches like Vatsyayana, sex and sexual positions

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.200
[Guest]: to everybody.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:57.160
[Guest]: And Shweta Ketu's mother and father, father's a sexologist, mother, like most women then

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.560
[Guest]: would have sex with whoever she wanted.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.080
[Guest]: And apparently he was so upset when he saw her one day walking off with another Brahmin

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.440
[Guest]: that he said, why on earth should we have this freedom?

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.120
[Guest]: And the father says, but son, this is the way we've always been.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.760
[Guest]: Why are you getting so upset about this?

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.780
[Guest]: And he says, well, from henceforth, it's not going to be this way.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.680
[Guest]: Women must marry, to go back to your question of controlling women, women must marry one

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.920
[Guest]: man and stay faithful.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.920
[Guest]: And that's marriage.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.040
[Guest]: And this is what it's going to be from now on.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.600
[Guest]: And apparently the father's horrified at that, but that is the beginning of marriage as we

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.980
[Guest]: know it, which is rooted in the desire to curb women's desire.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:38.040
[Amit Varma]: So this is what you just said is a mythical instance of a historical process, obviously,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:43.400
[Guest]: but it captures the impulse that, you know, women should not be, our women should not

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.080
[Amit Varma]: be sort of running around.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.800
[Amit Varma]: So we've had these different strains and we'll come back later to, you know, how wonderfully

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.160
[Amit Varma]: wild and awesome Indian civilization has otherwise always been.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:00.240
[Amit Varma]: But the whole process is then further exacerbated by the British coming to India and partly

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.160
[Amit Varma]: the British coming to India because, you know, they are incredibly sexually repressed.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.440
[Amit Varma]: And as you've pointed out, we had open borders, they walked in because they could and also

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.040
[Amit Varma]: because they wanted some action, I guess, for them, it was like Bangkok is today for

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.040
[Unknown]: many Indian men.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.040
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.640
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit more about what happened, what did colonization do to us?

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.080
[Guest]: You know, I like to joke that when I was writing my book, I really tried hard not to blame

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.720
[Guest]: the British for everything.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720
[Guest]: And I just failed.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.560
[Guest]: But I want on the record that I made a good faith effort.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:36.280
[Guest]: I really tried because I am not overly invested in pointing the finger at one villain and

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.520
[Guest]: saying, you know, that's the villain of the story because I don't think it ever works

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.520
[Guest]: that way.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.800
[Guest]: I think life is more complicated than that.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:50.000
[Guest]: But unfortunately, with every one of my chapters, actually, this idea of plurality, this idea

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.560
[Guest]: of complexity, this idea of multiplicity would inevitably screech to a halt around a certain

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.800
[Guest]: historical point.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.040
[Guest]: Now, whether that's because the British introduced certain laws, which they did, for instance,

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:13.440
[Guest]: to outlaw hijras or any transsexual or transgender people, or 377, where they outlawed acts against

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:20.800
[Guest]: nature, or if it was just sort of in pronouncements that they made with, say, Macaulay's minute

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:28.240
[Guest]: on education, whatever it is, on all fronts, I found myself faced with this huge barrier.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:35.560
[Guest]: And so, yes, I think the British were to a large extent responsible for creating a version

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.440
[Guest]: of India that we continue to inhabit largely.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:44.240
[Guest]: But, and I've said this in my book as well, they didn't pull this out of thin air.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.720
[Guest]: They didn't or couldn't have imposed their repression wholesale on us if they didn't

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.040
[Guest]: already find within us some strands that were receptive to that repression.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.880
[Guest]: And so, as I've said before, and this is what I was stating earlier about the Upanishads

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.480
[Guest]: suddenly sort of taking a turn.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.900
[Guest]: And as you mentioned, Manusmriti and the caste system, they found in a certain version of

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:11.120
[Guest]: caste Hinduism, very fertile ground for their repression.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.680
[Guest]: And so what they were able to do, and this is, you know, completely a master stroke of

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:22.000
[Guest]: politics, what they were able to do is cater to our worst instincts, because that's what

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.960
[Guest]: served their best interests.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.480
[Guest]: And so they said to us, you know, people are different from one another, you have to rigidly

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.280
[Guest]: maintain that difference, you cannot, in fact, interact with one another.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.440
[Guest]: And that policy, which is now called by everybody, the policy of divide and rule, was exactly

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.960
[Guest]: what they did in relation to India.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.160
[Guest]: Not only in relation to religion, as we know, and we're still sort of living the consequences

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.680
[Guest]: of that, but also in relation to desire.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.960
[Guest]: So again, as I've said before, if you just look back to say, 10th, 11th century sculptures

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:59.960
[Guest]: and Khajuraho and Puri and Konarak and all these temples across India, if you look at

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:09.640
[Guest]: Sufi poetry, again, from the 8th century onwards, you will find the celebration of variety,

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.000
[Guest]: the celebration of mixture.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.860
[Guest]: And what the British did was to try and succeed to a large extent in separating the strands

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:24.880
[Guest]: of that mixture, in sort of saying, oh, here you have a sculpture where there are two women,

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:32.080
[Guest]: one man and one goat, goats belong in animals, men belong there with one woman, and the other

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.440
[Guest]: woman is out here.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.080
[Guest]: And so they actually, I mean, you can actually sort of physically envisage it as deconstructing

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.080
[Guest]: a recipe, right?

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.320
[Guest]: It's like, you know, when you eat something delicious and you say, oh, I know what all

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.040
[Guest]: went into it, and you list the ingredients.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.520
[Guest]: That's what they tried to do, is separate things out rather than enjoying the gorgeously

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.120
[Guest]: delicious finished product.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:58.920
[Guest]: And but they were able to do that, as I said, because we already had a language of puritanical

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.160
[Guest]: separation.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:08.680
[Guest]: We already had a language in which the shadow of a lower caste polluted an upper caste.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:16.200
[Guest]: And that language of pollution, which is very much behind still the language of swachhata

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.680
[Guest]: or cleanliness, that is a language that they used with deadly effect.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.520
[Guest]: And they used it on all kinds of fronts.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:29.560
[Guest]: They used it to make us feel ashamed of our desires, ashamed of our bodies, and sort of

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:35.640
[Guest]: instigated a wholesale repression, whose consequences, I think, are absolutely awful and horrific.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.960
[Amit Varma]: No, and as you've pointed out in your book, you know, many of the sculptures and temple

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.760
[Amit Varma]: art of the 10th century were actually made illegal under the British, you won't be able

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.880
[Guest]: to do those things like the two women, a man and a goat, there is actually a sculpture

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880
[Guest]: like that.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.240
[Amit Varma]: I don't think it's the goat, it's a horse.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:43:00.400
[Amit Varma]: See, you're embellishing, diminishing, not go to smaller than a horse is suddenly a more

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.000
[Amit Varma]: attractive proposition.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.600
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that what the British did is somewhat willful, but at the same time,

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.320
[Amit Varma]: there's an element of happenstance to it, in the sense that they come to this country,

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.600
[Amit Varma]: they don't understand it is madly, deeply complex, they don't have the mental bandwidth

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.600
[Amit Varma]: or perhaps capacity to engage with it completely.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.920
[Amit Varma]: So they try to draw simple narratives around it.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.960
[Amit Varma]: And their first guides, the interlocutors in the country are obviously the elites, the

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Brahmins.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:31.220
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, so they are fed this Brahminical version where Manusmriti is a guide to morality

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.220
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:35.960
[Amit Varma]: And they extrapolate that to be the truth of the nation.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's very convenient because a lot of their Victorian morality aligns with that

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.440
[Guest]: sort of aligns with that.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:50.200
[Amit Varma]: And yet what is interesting is that in our popular culture, we see these multiple representations

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.520
[Amit Varma]: of desire, not just in the stories about our gods, but also in popular cinema.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.520
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just quote from your book here, where you write, quote, desire is of the world,

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:06.440
[Amit Varma]: and it extends across what we now term, hetero and homosexuality, both of which coexist happily

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.760
[Amit Varma]: alongside polyamory, which is Krishna with many gopis and celibacy, saints with matted

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.760
[Unknown]: hair.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.760
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.920
[Amit Varma]: And later, you say, quote, all around me in the Delhi of the 1970s and 80s were Hindi

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:24.520
[Amit Varma]: films that celebrated same sex attachments, Anand, older women desiring younger men, Doosra

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.280
[Amit Varma]: Aadmi, and cross couple desire, Angur.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:33.640
[Amit Varma]: So stop quote, yeah, so you know, so and later again, you say, quote, millions of people

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:38.320
[Amit Varma]: know the stories of cross dressing gods, men hold hands freely, women frequently sleep

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.440
[Amit Varma]: in the same bed.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:44.760
[Amit Varma]: This is a country that is deeply homophilic, even as it is often superficially homophobic.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:49.600
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote, tell me a bit about this angle, because you know, your book very fascinatingly

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.120
[Amit Varma]: the first chapter, and we are very close to Mehrauli, so I was struck with the urge to

00:44:54.120 --> 00:45:00.760
[Amit Varma]: actually go and see the shrine, you really should, I actually will, and this is the joint

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:05.240
[Guest]: tomb of Jamali and Kamali, tell me a little bit about that.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:10.760
[Guest]: I just want to sort of go back to your thing about cinema, or Hindi cinema, you know, Nick,

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.960
[Guest]: two weeks from now, this much wanted film is going to be released, Shubh Mangal's Yada

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:22.720
[Guest]: Saavdhan, which is being touted as a gay love story with Ayushman Khurrana and whoever his

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.560
[Guest]: love interest is.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.800
[Guest]: And people are so delighted, there's a long article in the Indian Express the other day

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:35.200
[Guest]: about how Indian cinemas finally come of age, and we're dealing with issues of homosexuality

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.920
[Guest]: and openly dealing with issues of desire between men.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:46.480
[Guest]: And that article, like many other such things really irritated me, because it seemed just

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:54.440
[Guest]: to blindly be speaking a language of Americanized identity politics, completely oblivious to

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.520
[Guest]: what's quite literally in our backyards.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:02.680
[Guest]: And so this idea of, oh, here is a gay film, and finally, Indian movies have come of age,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:08.440
[Guest]: A, forgets the history of Hindi cinema, which is the queerest history of any cinema tradition

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.640
[Guest]: anywhere in the world.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.160
[Guest]: And so to forget that is, first of all, not to know your Hindi cinema very well.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:21.400
[Guest]: But the second thing it's forgetting is a much older, much longer tradition of celebrating

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.300
[Guest]: same sex desire in this part of the world.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:30.480
[Guest]: And the example that you just used from my book, which I talk about, which is the example

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:36.720
[Guest]: of various Dargahs across the subcontinent, most close by to us, the Dargah of Jamali

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.200
[Guest]: and Kamali.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.400
[Guest]: And this is one of those Dargahs, it's called the Gay Taj Mahal.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.800
[Guest]: It's actually beautiful, although one can't get into the actual tomb because it's under

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:51.040
[Guest]: lock and key, but it's beautiful when you look at it from the outside as well.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:58.200
[Guest]: And Jamali and Kamali's Dargah is extremely commonplace, which is to say, as an idea in

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:03.180
[Guest]: which two men are buried together side by side, it is extremely commonplace.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:08.600
[Guest]: And as we continue to know that the idea of being together in this life and the next and

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:16.840
[Guest]: the next is a very, very strong indicator of desire, lasting love, love that sort of

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.320
[Guest]: does not know the barrier of death.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.640
[Guest]: And so you have these multiple sites across the subcontinent in which a saint and his

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.600
[Guest]: male disciple are buried side by side.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:33.080
[Guest]: This is to go back to what I said about the complicated relation to education as well

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.200
[Guest]: that we have, right, and desire and education.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:42.700
[Guest]: The saint and his disciple are buried side by side, two men, without any problem, without

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.700
[Guest]: any comment.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.720
[Guest]: Clearly the student is buried by people who have survived him.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.040
[Guest]: So there's no sort of talk even after these two men are dead.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.840
[Guest]: And so you have these spaces.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:48:00.300
[Guest]: And of course, Nizamuddin and Khosrow are perhaps even more famous an example, also

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:08.280
[Guest]: in our backyard here, where Khosrow's poetry about Nizamuddin is just frankly, so erotic

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.600
[Guest]: that it beats most erotic poetry I've ever read.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.320
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I want to quote from a bit of it.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And this, of course, is translation because he didn't write in English.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:20.480
[Amit Varma]: This is quoted in your book, Amir Khosrow on Nizamuddin Auliya, quote, my blossoming

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.200
[Amit Varma]: youth is red with passion.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.760
[Amit Varma]: How can I spend this time alone?

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.120
[Amit Varma]: Will someone persuade Nizamuddin Auliya?

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.160
[Amit Varma]: For the more I coax him, the more he acts coy, I'll break my bangles and throw them

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.160
[Amit Varma]: on the bed.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.940
[Amit Varma]: I'll set fire to these bodies of mine.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.200
[Amit Varma]: The empty bed frightens me.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.440
[Amit Varma]: The fire of separation scorches me.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.440
[Guest]: Stop quote.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.440
[Guest]: Exactly right.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.440
[Guest]: See what I mean.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:45.360
[Guest]: You know, we are so timid today and this is a very blazing, literally explicit expression

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.160
[Guest]: of desire now.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.000
[Amit Varma]: And these are the people who are buried side by side.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's not just sexual desire, it's also romantic love.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.480
[Amit Varma]: Like after Nizamuddin dies, you quote in your book about this couplet of his, where he talks

00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.440
[Amit Varma]: about let the hair hang over my face because the universe is dark.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.440
[Guest]: It's dark.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.440
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.960
[Guest]: That, you know, darkness has set upon the world.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:08.080
[Guest]: And so my hair is just going to cover my face because there's no light left to see.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:15.360
[Guest]: That kind of intensity, that kind of passion is unheard of in whatever shubh, mangal, saavdhan,

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.520
[Guest]: zyada saavdhan, kam saavdhan, whatever it is that we want to do.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.400
[Guest]: I'm glad it's being made.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:27.240
[Guest]: But to tout that as finally India has arrived is such an act of ignorance that it boggles

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.760
[Guest]: my mind.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:34.160
[Guest]: And the sense of even as we are trying to elevate India as finally arriving, we're actually

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:39.160
[Guest]: forgetting India and its histories in all their multiplicities.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.360
[Guest]: And that's what is just completely mind boggling to me.

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360
[Amit Varma]: And I was also struck in all of this.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.280
[Amit Varma]: It's not just Jamali and Kamali and you, of course, describe their tomb, showing how the

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.200
[Amit Varma]: tomb itself is both male and female.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200
[Guest]: Right.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.600
[Guest]: To go back to what we were saying earlier, when we said, you know, this desire is desire

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.600
[Guest]: and that desire is not desire.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.840
[Guest]: One of the things I'm fascinated by is the desire of architecture.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:10.640
[Guest]: And what is fascinating about this Dargah is that among Sufis, the graves are very carefully

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.160
[Guest]: delineated between male and female.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:18.480
[Guest]: And so the male graves have a sort of pen box on top of them because it's understood

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.120
[Guest]: that the Sufis will write the Kalam, will use the Kalam to write.

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.600
[Guest]: And this is what they're taking with them because they're so intellectually oriented.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.260
[Guest]: And the women Sufis have a flat top on them because the idea is that they are paper on

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.720
[Guest]: which will be written.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.200
[Guest]: And if we sort of set aside the sort of sexist nature of that for a minute, what's fascinating

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:43.440
[Guest]: to me about Jamali and Kamali's Dargah is that it is flat on top, which is to say it

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:49.920
[Guest]: is feminine on top, whereas inside it's a dome, it's a pen box.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:56.880
[Guest]: And so it's a male sign of masculinity overlaid by a sign of femininity without deciding necessarily

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.900
[Guest]: which one is the correct one or the proper one.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.320
[Guest]: It's giving us quite literally a hermaphroditic desire.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.960
[Amit Varma]: And you call them signs of femininity because it was a custom that the tombs of female saints

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.960
[Guest]: will be flat on top and the men will have domes.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:16.520
[Amit Varma]: So this very interesting sort of incorporation of both elements into the design also.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.520
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.600
[Guest]: And this is this is something that continues to this day.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:25.360
[Guest]: For instance, I always sort of tell my students the way in which desks and chairs are designed

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.520
[Guest]: have desire in mind when they do that.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:35.160
[Guest]: So, for instance, when you go to schools, the desks will always be blank in front because

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.180
[Guest]: the assumption is that the teacher should be able to see what the students are doing

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.440
[Guest]: with their hands and between their legs, whereas the older you get.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.520
[Guest]: And so, for instance, if you're a professor in an office or if you're an older student,

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:53.280
[Guest]: the desks will have what are known officially this is a technical term as modesty panels.

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.160
[Guest]: The covering of the front of the table is known as a modesty panel because the assumption

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.280
[Guest]: is you should be able to free to do whatever you want behind that table without anyone

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.560
[Guest]: seeing you.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:08.120
[Guest]: So everything around us is articulated in relation to desire.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.900
[Guest]: And that was one of the things I was just fascinated by, which is that let's think about

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.920
[Guest]: everyday life.

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.920
[Guest]: Forget anything else.

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:21.000
[Guest]: How our everyday life is saturated with these things about desire and how the origin plays

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.520
[Amit Varma]: back to something we didn't even realize, like this is news to me, you know, and modesty

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.880
[Amit Varma]: covering is indeed a great help in my office years.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.240
[Guest]: But maybe modesty is alien to you, Amit.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.240
[Amit Varma]: Well, what can I say?

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.760
[Amit Varma]: And I also found this fascinating, I mean, this is really hilarious, where you spoke

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:44.800
[Guest]: about the traveling tomb of Bulleh Shah as an example of mobile desire.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.800
[Guest]: What is this traveling tomb?

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.800
[Guest]: It's just fascinating.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.120
[Guest]: I mean, there is a tomb of Bulleh Shah in what is now Pakistan.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:58.800
[Guest]: And I'm driving down from Manali, and there's a sign saying Bulleh Shah Ji Ka Dargah.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.960
[Guest]: And so I asked the driver, it's like, oh, my God, is this suddenly changed?

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.160
[Guest]: Are we suddenly in Pakistan?

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.560
[Guest]: Isn't this, wouldn't this be amazing?

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:09.640
[Guest]: And the taxi driver says, nahi, nahi, jee, yeh Bulleh Shah Ji Ka Dargah toh har jagah

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.640
[Guest]: hota hai.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.600
[Guest]: It's anywhere you want it to be.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:18.840
[Guest]: Which actually among, for instance, the Bhakti saints, there was this Namdev in Maharashtra

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.280
[Guest]: and things like that, there is a very clear sense of what's called a mobile temple, which

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.600
[Guest]: is you carry your temple with you wherever you go.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.720
[Guest]: So you don't have to, in fact, be fixed on a temple or a particular site, which of course

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.280
[Guest]: throws new light on the entire Ram Janmabhoomi Ayodhya thing, right?

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:39.820
[Guest]: Which is that a fixed temple actually was not the truth of practicing religions that

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.600
[Guest]: now call themselves Hinduism.

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:48.320
[Guest]: Similarly, in Sufi traditions, this idea of a Dargah is both something that is there set

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.120
[Guest]: in stone, quite literally, and something that travels with you wherever you go.

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:58.600
[Guest]: And so people can be in love with Nizamuddin wherever they are, or people can be followers

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:03.040
[Guest]: of Jamali wherever they are, they don't need to be present at that physical site.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.120
[Guest]: And that to me is something that's deeply spiritual, right?

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:13.000
[Guest]: That's deeply evocative in the sense of, I am, I both am and I'm not here.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.560
[Guest]: And that kind of Sufi tradition, and I talk about that story in my book about how they

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:23.120
[Guest]: say the mark of a Sufi saint is someone who can preside over his own burial, right?

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:27.680
[Guest]: And that sense of both being here and not here, going back to Shakespeare's negative

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.880
[Guest]: capability, I'm writing, but I'm not writing myself.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.320
[Guest]: That kind of ability I find absolutely powerful.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:42.000
[Guest]: And that kind of ability is what I think encourages empathy, understanding across borders.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.720
[Guest]: And that's what we're so in danger of losing now.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.560
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we head into a commercial break, I want to take you back to what you

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.400
[Amit Varma]: said a little earlier, which is, you know, it's not there in your book, but I found it

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:56.120
[Amit Varma]: fairly interesting where you were talking about the queer histories of Bollywood, for

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.120
[Amit Varma]: example.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:02.080
[Amit Varma]: And this notion which I have, you know, I can see both sides of where it is coming from

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:07.360
[Amit Varma]: that on the one hand, I'm really glad that films like Kapoor and Sons and shows like

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Made in Heaven are being made where, you know, gay protagonists are shown as completely normal

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.360
[Amit Varma]: people with completely normal desires, and it's not like something exceptional or not

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:19.320
[Amit Varma]: caricatured in other ways.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:24.880
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, it strikes me that the reason that these specific films are like

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:30.240
[Amit Varma]: this is that Bollywood right now is being driven by elites.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:35.040
[Amit Varma]: And this is a reflection of how the elite see themselves or how they want to see themselves.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.040
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:41.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's not necessarily a reflection of popular culture necessarily, I think TikTok gets closer

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.280
[Amit Varma]: to popular culture.

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:48.240
[Amit Varma]: And while it's incredibly, I'm addicted to TikTok, and it's absolutely awesome.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:54.080
[Amit Varma]: But it's also, you know, it also shows our society's misogyny and sexism, and all of

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.080
[Amit Varma]: these things.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.880
[Amit Varma]: So, since you've thought more deeply about this than I have, obviously, can you elaborate

00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880
[Guest]: a little bit?

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.200
[Guest]: Actually, one thing that you said really struck a chord with me, and a friend of mine said

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:08.240
[Guest]: this the other day, she said, and I enjoyed Made in Heaven as much as anybody else, although

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.960
[Guest]: it took me a bit of time to get into it, but I'm really waiting for the second season to

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.200
[Guest]: come out and things like that.

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:18.600
[Guest]: But a friend of mine pointed out what's interesting about Made in Heaven is that the gay male

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:24.160
[Guest]: protagonist who finally comes out at the end, in the narrative of the story, he's the one

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:29.120
[Guest]: who goes out and starts a certain gay rights movement.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:35.120
[Guest]: Rather than placing him within the long history of sort of queer rights movements in India,

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.160
[Guest]: he is shown as the person who is leading the way.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:42.440
[Guest]: To go back to your point of a certain elite kind of narrative that sees itself as being

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:47.680
[Guest]: emancipated, that sees itself as being the sort of torchbearers of freedom, rather than

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:53.000
[Guest]: actually saying freedoms have existed in this part of the world for much longer than you

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.200
[Guest]: can even remember.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.800
[Guest]: And what about if we go back to that rather than sort of saying, here we are in a brand

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.800
[Guest]: new direction.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:05.600
[Guest]: So this idea of reinventing the wheel, as though it has never been done before, is something

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.320
[Guest]: that can be very irksome and very annoying.

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.480
[Guest]: And because I enjoyed Made in Heaven, it was not that annoying to me there, but it's annoying

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.880
[Guest]: to me in several other places.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.120
[Guest]: I didn't love Kapoor and Sons, I didn't hate it, for instance.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:21.760
[Guest]: But for me, a film like Goliyon ki Raas Leela Ram Leela is much more queer.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:29.040
[Guest]: A film like Dostana is much more queer than someone that has an openly gay protagonist.

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.480
[Guest]: That is no doubt doing an important kind of work.

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:37.800
[Guest]: But it is also catering to a kind of identity politics that I find problematic.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:44.240
[Guest]: So for instance, generations of gay men in India, like generations of gay men in the

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.280
[Guest]: US with a different relation to a different person, generations of gay men in India have

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.920
[Guest]: grown up identifying with the icon of Helen, for instance, just like generations of gay

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.560
[Guest]: men in the US have grown up identifying with the icon of Marilyn Monroe.

00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I had an episode with a friend of mine, Vivek Tejuja, who's just written a book

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:05.040
[Amit Varma]: and he spoke at length about how he grew up, you know, with Helen as his icon.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.040
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:11.040
[Guest]: And so that kind of cross-identification is what is queer.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:17.160
[Guest]: Nowadays, when you're saying, oh, gay men should look for a gay man in the narrative,

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.400
[Guest]: you're shutting down on other possibilities.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.640
[Guest]: You're shutting down on the fact that gay men might identify with women.

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.400
[Guest]: You're shutting down on the fact that gay women might identify with men or any kinds

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.760
[Guest]: of cross-border attraction.

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:34.880
[Guest]: And so I see what is to be gained, but I also see what is being lost in that.

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:39.460
[Guest]: So every time we present a gay protagonist and pat ourselves on the back for being so

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:45.140
[Guest]: liberal and liberated, we also have to remember that what we're losing is that texture of

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:50.680
[Guest]: desire that did not predict in advance who I must identify with, that was able to leave

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:57.200
[Guest]: scope for cross-identification, that was able to leave scope for me as a gay man to identify

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.880
[Guest]: with a female vamp.

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:01.160
[Amit Varma]: That's what we're losing right now.

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.080
[Amit Varma]: Now these textures of desires are very complicated.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.360
[Amit Varma]: The real world is very complex.

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Cinema and all popular art necessarily aims to keep it simple, simpler narratives work

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:12.440
[Amit Varma]: better.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, the Shakespeare would disagree.

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.440
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.440
[Guest]: I was just going to say that.

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.080
[Amit Varma]: But over here, that is sort of, I mean, unless you're Shakespeare, you're not going to pull

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.400
[Amit Varma]: off complexity quite like that.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:27.240
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, you have these urges to therefore simplify the narrative, make it explicable

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240
[Unknown]: and so on.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.240
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Which is why I'm curious about what you meant by the queer history of Bollywood per se.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.920
[Guest]: Can you elaborate a bit on that?

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.600
[Guest]: I mean, if you just look at these films of the, of the seventies and eighties, all these

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:46.360
[Guest]: so-called, you know, dosti films, these yaari films, always sort of featuring two or more

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:51.320
[Guest]: of a cast from Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Shashi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.800
[Guest]: And you refer to Anand, of course.

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800
[Guest]: Of course.

00:59:53.800 --> 01:00:00.800
[Guest]: And that's just one example where the intensity of the bond between the men, it may end up

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.600
[Guest]: in heterosexual marriage, right?

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.520
[Guest]: With Jaya Bhaduri or Hema Malini or whoever it is, but the film is about the intensity

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.000
[Guest]: of the bond between the men.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.120
[Guest]: Now, this is where actually an analogy with Shakespeare comes in because all of Shakespeare's

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:22.560
[Guest]: plays, especially his comedies, will end with heterosexual couplings without question.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.620
[Guest]: But the force of the narrative is the force of the bonds between same-sex couples.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.620
[Guest]: So what do you do with that?

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:30.620
[Guest]: We have a choice, right?

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.320
[Guest]: Either we say the end justifies everything.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.920
[Guest]: And the fact that Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri get together at the end means forget

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.960
[Guest]: anything else that happened with anybody else.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.960
[Guest]: You can certainly do that.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.880
[Guest]: And a lot of people have done that.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.000
[Guest]: So people like me who are interested in The Textures of Desire, we know that the end is

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.920
[Guest]: by no means the only thing that is going on.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.640
[Guest]: So for us, our energy is derived from the fabric of the rest of the film.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.760
[Guest]: Like two hours and 58 minutes, these two men are staring deep into each other's eyes.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.940
[Guest]: For two minutes at the end, you have the man and the woman together.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.640
[Guest]: How does the one outweigh the other?

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.960
[Guest]: And so for me, if we actually take cinema seriously, the tropes of cinema seriously,

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.560
[Guest]: who is looking into whose eye, who is saying, I cannot live without you, who is saying,

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.360
[Guest]: I'm going to die if I cannot have you, quite literally in the shape of Anand, that's where

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.360
[Guest]: desire is.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.000
[Guest]: So for instance, if you just sort of did a blind test and you say, here are a list of

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.640
[Guest]: the dialogues that character A is saying to character B, identify who character A is and

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.760
[Guest]: who character B is.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:37.560
[Guest]: Most people from a heterosexist perspective will say one is a man and A is a man and B

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.560
[Guest]: is a woman.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.280
[Guest]: And then you say, reveal A is Amitabh Bachchan and B is Rajesh Khanna.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.960
[Guest]: What do you do with that?

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.640
[Guest]: And so this is what I'm interested in.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.360
[Guest]: That's what I mean about the queer pasts of Bollywood is that there has been a comfort

01:01:53.360 --> 01:02:00.440
[Guest]: with even a celebration of that mode of queerness that will not come out and say, hey, I am

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:07.160
[Guest]: gay, but that covers a spectrum of desire that I find more interesting and fascinating

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.840
[Guest]: than the sort of identity category mode of sexuality, which we are inhabiting today.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.520
[Amit Varma]: I think there's also, you know, I mean, what instinctively comes to me is how should one

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.680
[Amit Varma]: distinguish sexual desire from non-sexual desire?

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.880
[Amit Varma]: Like it just seems to me, for example, looking back at Anand, which I will never view in

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.680
[Amit Varma]: the same way because of you, you have spoilt it for me, or perhaps you made it better for

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.440
[Amit Varma]: me, who knows.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.680
[Amit Varma]: But it seems to me that it doesn't come across as sexual desire in the film, certainly not

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.080
[Amit Varma]: as overtly sexual desire, or maybe my gaze was wrong, and I'll see differently now, regardless.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.080
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, is there a danger that when you're sort of, let's say that as a scholar,

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.080
[Amit Varma]: when you're looking at that kind of cinema, and you're studying queer cinema, is there

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.560
[Amit Varma]: a danger of looking too much and reading into, like, I remember, you know, when I was a teenager,

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.640
[Amit Varma]: I saw the film Dead Poets Society, which is such a lovely film, and I absolutely loved

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640
[Amit Varma]: it then.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.520
[Amit Varma]: And then I came across a review in some esoteric magazine, which spoke about the suppressed

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.720
[Amit Varma]: homoerotic desire in the film.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.560
[Amit Varma]: And I was like, what is this rubbish?

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.800
[Amit Varma]: These are people who are over-interpreting, over-analyzing.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800
[Guest]: Is that a danger?

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:15.360
[Guest]: You know, what always fascinates me about questions like this, and I think it's a very

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.400
[Guest]: good question, because the question a lot of people have.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.800
[Guest]: What fascinates me about these kinds of questions is the implicit assumption that my reading

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.720
[Guest]: is just the right amount of reading.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:32.520
[Guest]: And somebody else's reading is over-interpreting or over-reading, and it's too much or excessive.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:38.120
[Guest]: And that seems to me to emerge always from a position in which my reading is challenged,

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:42.820
[Guest]: or my reading is shown perhaps to be inadequate to the material at hand.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.680
[Guest]: So I don't think there is any such thing as over-interpretation.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.960
[Guest]: I certainly think there are wrong readings or bad readings, but I don't think there's

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.400
[Guest]: anything known as over-interpretation, as opposed to just right interpretation.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.720
[Guest]: I think all interpretation is reading into the material.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.800
[Guest]: You're always interpreting in a certain way.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:09.760
[Guest]: We've all grown up in such a misogynistic, heterosexist framework that that kind of reading

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.480
[Guest]: appears normal to us.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.600
[Guest]: And I'm including myself in this 100%.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.360
[Guest]: And that kind of reading appears normal to us precisely because we've always been told

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360
[Guest]: that is the truth.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.480
[Guest]: You don't need to think about it.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.360
[Guest]: Again, back to truth with a capital T.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:31.880
[Guest]: If, however, and this is what I guess we're all banking on, if we allow the truths of

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:38.940
[Guest]: our lived reality to trump that singular emphasis on truth with a capital T, we can read much

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.880
[Guest]: more widely than we usually do.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.040
[Guest]: Now the best way, for instance, I always tell people, the best way to lose friends is to

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.040
[Guest]: go to a film with them.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.560
[Guest]: And when they say, oh, I really loved it, you say, yes, but what about this that happened

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560
[Guest]: there?

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.000
[Amit Varma]: I just went to get entertained.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
[Guest]: Are you that person?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
[Guest]: I am that person.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.400
[Guest]: But I still have lots of friends, thank God.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.720
[Guest]: But to me, that is what is reading, right?

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.040
[Guest]: That we are always reading films.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.980
[Guest]: But what does it mean to oppose a reading that is not given to us, that we are coming

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:13.880
[Guest]: up with, rather than just inheriting a misogynistic, heterosexist framework and say, but this is

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.880
[Guest]: about love between a man and a woman.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.120
[Guest]: Which brings me back to something you said a little bit earlier before this question,

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.760
[Guest]: which is that how do we know it's sexual desire?

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.140
[Guest]: My answer to that very clearly is we don't.

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.800
[Guest]: We have no idea.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:32.800
[Guest]: But then my question to you would be, how do we know what sexual desire is?

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.120
[Guest]: Do we understand sexual desire as meaning genital intercourse?

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.280
[Guest]: Clearly not, because there are lots of people who feel sexual desire for others who never

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.480
[Guest]: have genital sex with them, right?

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.480
[Guest]: So that's not what we mean.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:53.640
[Guest]: What we mean by sexual desire is a desire that wants some kind of physical consummation.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.640
[Guest]: What does that mean?

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.040
[Guest]: Arm around the shoulder, pat on the back, holding hands, kissing, hugging, whatever

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:03.000
[Guest]: it is, other than kissing, all these things these two men do, if that's the lens through

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.320
[Guest]: which we're looking at.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.480
[Guest]: What we generally understand by sexual desire, in fact, is not shown in any Hindi cinema.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:16.240
[Guest]: You never see, at least in the 70s and 80s, you never ever saw men and women having sex.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:23.320
[Guest]: What you saw were tropes of desire, the flower falling, the shirt untucked, the door that

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:29.200
[Guest]: is hastily slammed shut, the tie that is askew, the bindi that is rubbed off.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.200
[Guest]: All these are there.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:33.320
[Guest]: I mean, Rajesh Khanna is often looking disheveled.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.480
[Guest]: He's often looking sort of, you know, and Amitabh Bachchan is often looking deep into

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480
[Guest]: his eyes.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:44.040
[Guest]: We would normally understand that as a sign of sexual love.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.960
[Guest]: When these two men are looking into each other's eyes, why do we not read that as sexual love?

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:52.120
[Guest]: It's a question for us, not a question for the film.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.480
[Amit Varma]: And as we go into a commercial break, I'll leave you with the reimagining of a film dialogue

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.480
[Amit Varma]: inspired by Madhavi.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.800
[Amit Varma]: So if you don't like it, blame Madhavi.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:05.040
[Amit Varma]: This is that classic scene where Amitabh Bachchan asks Shashi Kapoor, mere paas ghar hai, gari

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.000
[Amit Varma]: hai, ye hai, wo hai, tumhare paas kya hai, and Shashi Kapoor replies, mere paas condom

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
[Amit Varma]: hai.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
[Amit Varma]: See you after a commercial break.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.080
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.160

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.080
[Amit Varma]: We are chatting with Madhavi Menon about The Scene and The Unseen of Human Desire.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.760
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so before we went to the break, you were telling me about how Bollywood has

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:41.640
[Amit Varma]: all these tropes to not show sex, for example, you know, whatever the two roses kissing and

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.200
[Amit Varma]: the closed door and the bindi out of place.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.640
[Amit Varma]: And it struck me while reading your book, that our mythology has these as well, because

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.960
[Amit Varma]: the gods are never actually shown reproducing.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the finest stories that you have outlined at length, and I shall ask

01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.880
[Amit Varma]: you to do so again, is the story of Ayyappa, you know, right from his origin story to everything

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.760
[Amit Varma]: that happens with him, is mind blowing and is extremely relevant to our times as well,

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.280
[Amit Varma]: because Ayyappa is the god at Sabarimala.

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.640
[Amit Varma]: That's what the first is all about.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640
[Amit Varma]: That's right.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.120
[Guest]: So take us through a bit of that.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.120
[Guest]: That's right.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.240
[Guest]: Amit, I see you're sort of hellbent on getting me into trouble, but that's okay.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.240
[Amit Varma]: We'll both get into trouble.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.240
[Amit Varma]: I'm used to that.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.920
[Amit Varma]: This podcast has gone on for more than an hour.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.600
[Amit Varma]: I do not think that, you know.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.600
[Amit Varma]: They would have got to this point.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.560
[Guest]: Exactly. Well, I've already gotten into trouble about this.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.640
[Guest]: I wrote an article on this in the Indian Express, and I had a police complaint filed against

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.640
[Guest]: me.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.640
[Guest]: Are you serious?

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640
[Guest]: Which luckily has not yet been converted into an FIR.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.920
[Guest]: So I'm just hoping it stays that way.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:46.000
[Guest]: And the complaint said, of course, I had outraged, hurt, insulted, one of those words, the sentiments

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.440
[Guest]: of lakhs and lakhs of Hindus, which I actually found funny, because the person thought they

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:56.520
[Guest]: were just lakhs of Hindus, rather than millions, or hundreds of millions, who are these lakhs

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.520
[Amit Varma]: of Hindus?

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.520
[Amit Varma]: You felt offended.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.360
[Amit Varma]: I have only offended so many people.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.040
[Guest]: I must be doing something wrong.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.040
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.760
[Guest]: Let me go on Amit's show and rectify that, exactly, exactly.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.440
[Guest]: I mean, and also part of the problem, of course, is this classification of Hindus, which, you

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.760
[Guest]: know, I don't need to talk about right now.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.360
[Guest]: But the story of Ayyappan is just fascinating.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:25.720
[Guest]: And as you just said, he is the presiding deity at this place of worship called Sabarimala

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.440
[Guest]: in Kerala, and is the presiding deity.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:34.760
[Guest]: And I have known him all my life, because my maternal family, my mother's family, have

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.040
[Guest]: been Ayyappan devotees for a long time.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.000
[Guest]: So my grandfather, my maternal grandfather, I don't know, made that pilgrimage over 30

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.040
[Guest]: times to Sabarimala, and in fact, wanted to take us as well.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.120
[Guest]: And my sister and I were taken, went along with my father and grandfather, when I was

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120
[Guest]: eight years old.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.120
[Guest]: And I like sort of scandalizing people by saying, I am a woman who has been to Sabarimala,

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.000
[Guest]: and I was bleeding when I went.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.280
[Guest]: But of course, the story is that a leech had attached itself to my foot, and so I was bleeding

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.280
[Guest]: in that sense.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280
[Amit Varma]: Non-sanskari leech.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.720
[Guest]: And the lecherous leech.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.560
[Guest]: So I went when I was seven or eight years old.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:17.920
[Guest]: And so Ayyappan and the Sabarimala temple has been a part of my upbringing, I mean,

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.680
[Guest]: part of everyday life.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:25.320
[Guest]: So it was fascinating to me, this entire court case that has, the way it's played out over

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.560
[Guest]: the last two or three years, because I was very glad that someone had filed a case against

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.560
[Guest]: it.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:36.700
[Guest]: I mean, I am not enough of a believer in pilgrimages to have been outraged by that.

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.860
[Guest]: But there was something, I'm so glad that this happened, and I'm very glad the Supreme

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.720
[Guest]: Court ruled the way it did, even though it seems to make no difference because the government

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:48.960
[Guest]: is still not allowing women of menstruating age to enter through the front steps.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:55.400
[Guest]: So what I wrote about Ayyappan, the article that got me into trouble, is that the fundamental

01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:02.680
[Guest]: premise behind people who do not want women of menstruating age in the temple, the fundamental

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:11.200
[Guest]: premise of those people are that Ayyappan is a celibate God, which is to say, and this

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.560
[Guest]: is the fundamental assumption number two, that Ayyappan as a male God is going to be

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.680
[Guest]: attracted to women.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:25.320
[Guest]: And menstruating women, because they are sexually active, will be the ones to tempt Ayyappan,

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.880
[Guest]: the male celibate God.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.200
[Guest]: So you see the number of assumptions going on here.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.840
[Guest]: And this ties back to our earlier conversations, what we take to a conversation that we regard

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.660
[Guest]: as normal are just assumptions we've never been told to think about.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.600
[Guest]: So the assumption of heterosexuality is just rampant here.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.720
[Guest]: Ayyappan, male God, should not see women because his celibacy should not be challenged.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.640
[Guest]: And such a weak God that we need to protect.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.640
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640
[Guest]: Who was it?

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.960
[Guest]: Shashi Tharoor who said, there was a time when we thought the gods would protect us,

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.520
[Guest]: and now we feel that we need to protect the gods.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.080
[Guest]: And so that's the fundamental premise.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.560
[Guest]: And what I find fascinating is that there is actually nothing in Ayyappan's mythological

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.160
[Guest]: stories or histories to suggest heterosexuality in the least.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.280
[Guest]: Now, this is not to say he is or is not heterosexual.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.240
[Guest]: I'm actually not interested in that.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.280
[Guest]: But it is to say that if heterosexuality is the fundamental belief with which people are

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.260
[Guest]: being monitored, can you show me where that belief is coming from?

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.040
[Guest]: And so there are three stories about Ayyappan that we know.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.760
[Guest]: They're all mythological, of course, like all the stories of our gods are.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760
[Guest]: But there are three stories.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.120
[Guest]: And as I said, none of them points in the direction of heterosexuality.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:38.560
[Guest]: The first, of course, an origin story is that Ayyappan is the son of two men.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.680
[Guest]: He's the son of Shiva and Vishnu, Vishnu in drag as Mohini.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:49.520
[Guest]: You know, as you know, Mohini is brought into being to defeat the demon so that the gods

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.280
[Guest]: can churn the nectar and steal the nectar for themselves.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:57.160
[Guest]: I mean, what is wonderful about the pantheon of Hindu gods is that they're always up to

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.760
[Guest]: no good, always up to mischief, always cheating, always doing this.

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.760
[Amit Varma]: It's great.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Our gods are awesome.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Our gods are so much cooler than the people who follow them.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
[Guest]: Never a dull moment.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
[Guest]: Right.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.680
[Guest]: It's just all fun all the time.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:17.360
[Guest]: And so Shiva and Vishnu, Vishnu takes on the avatar of Mohini, destroys this demon called

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.440
[Guest]: Tarakasura, who is actually threatening Shiva.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:25.880
[Guest]: Shiva is hidden in a tree trunk, Mohini does her charm, and then Mohini turns back into

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.880
[Amit Varma]: Vishnu.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.200
[Amit Varma]: And I found even the origin story of the origin story very funny, the way you told it.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.200
[Unknown]: Exactly.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.640
[Amit Varma]: That this demon went to Shiva and said, kindly give me a boon, everything I turn should turn

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.920
[Amit Varma]: to ash.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.120
[Amit Varma]: And Shiva is like chilling and all, he says, fine.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.720
[Amit Varma]: And then this guy starts chasing Shiva.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.720
[Amit Varma]: To touch him.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.720
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.720
[Guest]: And Shiva goes up a tree and he tells Vishnu, come and help me.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.720
[Guest]: Please come and help me.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:50.000
[Guest]: So Vishnu comes as Mohini destroys Tarakasura by making him touch himself.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
[Guest]: So he turns to ash.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.040
[Guest]: And then Vishnu says, done and dusted, I'm back now as Vishnu.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040
[Guest]: And Shiva comes out and says, thanks so much.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:03.660
[Guest]: But you know, I got a dim glimpse of you as Mohini and you were really sexy.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.560
[Guest]: So can you just sort of turn back into Mohini again?

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.120
[Guest]: And so Vishnu says, sure, no problem.

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.840
[Guest]: I actually love, I love all that stuff.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.600
[Guest]: Becomes Mohini and Shiva is so excited, he spills his semen, right?

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.360
[Guest]: That's one of the secrets about our gods is that they never actually have genital intercourse.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.360
[Guest]: It's always the sun inseminated the rock or the river.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360
[Guest]: Semen is spilt here.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.000
[Guest]: So it's always that kind of.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.880
[Guest]: So again, to go back to what counts as sexual desire, you know, it's a desire for a rock

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.640
[Guest]: in many cases.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.360
[Guest]: Shiva spills his semen, off that comes the person who becomes Ayyappan, right?

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.360
[Guest]: In different avatars.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:40.840
[Guest]: So Ayyappan is the son of Shiva and Vishnu in drag as Mohini.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.440
[Guest]: The son of two men.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:48.920
[Guest]: The second story we know about Ayyappan, for a fact, is that his best friend forever, his

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.880
[Guest]: BFF, is a Muslim pirate called Babur.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.880
[Amit Varma]: And in fact.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Bengalis call Babur.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:00.040
[Amit Varma]: I'm half Bengali, so self-deprecating, kindly do not be offended if you are some Mukherjee

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.120
[Amit Varma]: person listening to this.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.120
[Amit Varma]: I am also Bengali.

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.120
[Guest]: Lakhs of Mukherjees.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.120
[Amit Varma]: Babur.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120
[Amit Varma]: Lakhs and lakhs of Mukherjees.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:13.320
[Guest]: But anyway, so Babur, in fact, they are so close that the pilgrimage in Sabarimala, you

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:18.880
[Guest]: have to start from the mosque of Babur, dedicated to Babur, and then go up to Sabarimala.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:24.440
[Guest]: So in fact, you cannot worship Ayyappan without worshipping Babur.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.360
[Guest]: And again, stories of how they got together, whether they fought together, all that is

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.520
[Guest]: the multiple stories.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:36.040
[Guest]: But we do have a story in which Ayyappan tells his father, please treat Babur as you would

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.560
[Guest]: treat me.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:42.560
[Guest]: And the sense of we are one, again talking about tropes of romance, is very much one

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.600
[Guest]: between Ayyappan and Babur.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:50.760
[Guest]: And just as a slight sidebar, the worship of Babur being an absolute necessary prelude

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:57.720
[Guest]: to a worship of Ayyappan just shows you what a syncretic, pluralistic monument Sabarimala

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720
[Guest]: is.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.680
[Guest]: It has also historically been one of the few temples in Kerala that has never had prohibitions

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.400
[Guest]: on caste, which is why the prohibition on women makes so little sense, but I'll come

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.400
[Guest]: back to that later.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.720
[Guest]: So that's the second story.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.480
[Guest]: His best friend is Babur.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:18.400
[Guest]: The third story now, perhaps most fascinating of all, is that Ayyappan says, build me this

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400
[Guest]: temple.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.760
[Guest]: Here is my statue, and I'm going to go up to heaven.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:27.680
[Guest]: Goes up to heaven, because he's the son of Shiva and Vishnu, he's the elite, right?

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.360
[Guest]: His elite god, and is soon set to sort of take over control of the heaven.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.360
[Amit Varma]: He's Lutyens' elite in heaven.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.120
[Unknown]: Lots of real estate, right?

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.700
[Guest]: And so he's set over to take over the heavens, and he has one grand plan.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:48.040
[Guest]: He said, my grand plan is, I want to abolish both birth and death.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.900
[Guest]: Because if we don't die, then we won't need to give birth to more people, because we give

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:56.000
[Guest]: birth to children, because we fear we will die, and then we want someone to continue

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
[Guest]: after us.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.880
[Guest]: But if we're not going to die, why bother giving birth to children?

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.740
[Guest]: We can just enjoy ourselves throughout our life.

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:06.120
[Guest]: So he sort of starts thinking about, how can I execute this plan?

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.680
[Guest]: And the other gods start getting worried, because they know that most of the offerings

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.240
[Guest]: that come to them come because people don't want to die, and because people want to give

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.240
[Guest]: birth.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:19.860
[Guest]: And they said, if we abolish birth and death, what the hell is going to happen to our revenues?

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:25.640
[Guest]: So they send Narada to Ayyappan and says, please, get him to change his mind, distract

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.400
[Guest]: him, take him away from this idea, it's a bad idea.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.400
[Guest]: So Narada goes to Ayyappan and says, excuse me, can I have a minute with you?

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.660
[Guest]: And Ayyappan says, you know, I'm really busy right now, I'm coming up with this plan of

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:41.120
[Guest]: abolishing birth and death, you know, it'll take me a few months, maybe after that you

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.360
[Guest]: and I can chat, coffee sometime, right?

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.240
[Guest]: And Narada says, no, no, no, it'll just take two minutes right now, please, please, please.

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:52.120
[Guest]: So Ayyappan, being a nice, kind-hearted guy says, okay, sets aside his blueprints and

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.800
[Guest]: said, okay, what is it?

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.840
[Guest]: So Narada says, I have just one question for you, Ayyappan said, okay, what?

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:06.600
[Guest]: He says, can you tell me how you are related to your father's wife and your mother's wife?

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:12.920
[Guest]: And legend has it that Ayyappan was so perplexed by that question, that he in fact came back

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.800
[Guest]: down to earth into his temple at Sabarimala, where he continues to this day, because he

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.960
[Guest]: has still not found an answer to that question, right?

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:27.480
[Guest]: If you think about it for a second, right, father's wife, Parvati, okay, you can say

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:33.520
[Guest]: she's my stepmother, she's my father's wife, but not my mother, this, that, and the other.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:39.040
[Guest]: Vishnu's wife, first of all, is Vishnu my mother or is Mohini my mother?

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.360
[Guest]: Is Vishnu my mother in drag as a man?

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.920
[Guest]: So is my mother really a father?

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:48.440
[Guest]: And then is my father's wife or consort Lakshmi, what is she?

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.080
[Guest]: Is she the wife of my mother or my father?

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.120
[Amit Varma]: He's still trying to work out those permutations.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.120
[Amit Varma]: Or is the rock my mother?

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:58.280
[Guest]: Is the rock my mother or the tree trunk or whatever, right?

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:06.360
[Guest]: And so the idea of sexual indeterminacy is written into the very legend of Ayyappan at

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.120
[Guest]: every level that we know about him.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.540
[Guest]: So to presume that this man, son of two men, deeply enmeshed with another man, wanting

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:17.560
[Guest]: to abolish birth and death, should be the presider of heterosexuality.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:21.200
[Guest]: It's like, where is this coming from?

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:27.200
[Guest]: And it is coming, of course, as I dared to answer, from us.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:34.400
[Guest]: That answer of Ayyappan is a male heterosexual God who is celibate is coming from male Brahminical

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.080
[Guest]: priests at Sabarimala.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:42.360
[Guest]: And you know, in any court of law anywhere in the world, your first question in a criminal

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.040
[Guest]: case is who stands to gain?

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.080
[Guest]: The only people who stand to gain here are the male priests and what they think of as

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.080
[Guest]: their tradition.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it could be argued that they have literally imprisoned their God.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:01.160
[Guest]: Whereas the traditions as we know it in relation to Ayyappan all set him free, which is why

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:06.720
[Guest]: Sabarimala is usually such a wonderfully open, syncretic place.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.860
[Guest]: No barrier on caste, no barrier on religion.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.340
[Guest]: The only barrier is misogynistic.

01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:13.840
[Guest]: And I just find that shocking.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.400
[Amit Varma]: Indeed.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:20.800
[Amit Varma]: And while talking about Ayyappan and Vavar, you spoke about how Ayyappan went to his dad

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.760
[Amit Varma]: and said that, you know, my BFF Vavar or whatever, treat us as one.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.200
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you have a very interesting chapter in your book, and this is actually

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:36.720
[Amit Varma]: chapter 1.5 called Fractions, where you sort of militate against this notion of two people

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.720
[Amit Varma]: being treated as one.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:43.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you refer back to Aristophanes, who is asked to, you know, sort of talk about

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.880
[Amit Varma]: desire.

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.720
[Amit Varma]: And Aristophanes said that, you know, man and woman was once joined and they were separated.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.360
[Amit Varma]: So now the two are trying to become one again, which is that whole romantic notion.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.400
[Amit Varma]: But you point out that all desire isn't like that.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, and in fact, I often, you know, these days, people are talking about the uniform

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.600
[Amit Varma]: civil code coming into action at some point in time and whatever.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.400
[Amit Varma]: And I have always thought that in a utopian world, you would not have a civil code at

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.400
[Amit Varma]: all.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:11.360
[Amit Varma]: You would have individuals freely associating with themselves in whatever way, drawing up

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:15.280
[Amit Varma]: their own marriage deeds, if they so desire, without the state being involved.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.280
[Amit Varma]: And why just two individuals?

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.240
[Amit Varma]: It could be three individuals or four individuals, you know, voluntary exchange.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240
[Guest]: Right.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.240
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:29.000
[Guest]: The one thing that I would add to your recounting of my Greek story from Plato, Aristophanes's

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.880
[Guest]: idea is that we were all double once.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:36.320
[Guest]: And it was not only men and women who were joined, men and women were only one third

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.000
[Guest]: of those who were joined.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.720
[Guest]: Another category were men and men, another category were women and women.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:47.320
[Guest]: And so, and these human beings, doubled human beings became so strong that the gods became

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.320
[Guest]: jealous.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.320
[Guest]: Right.

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.960
[Guest]: Greek gods are also quite as fascinating as our gods because they're also up to machinations

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.440
[Guest]: all the time.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.920
[Guest]: And the gods say, let's divide them and half their power.

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.800
[Guest]: So everyone gets divided.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.120
[Guest]: And so according to this myth, that is why we keep saying we're searching for our other

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.600
[Guest]: half because we once used to be double and we've been divided.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.800
[Guest]: But that still sticks, as I point out with this idea of whole numbers and has given rise

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.280
[Guest]: to this entire thing of one plus one equals one.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.280
[Guest]: Right.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.920
[Guest]: I and my lover come together and we are one because we're actually half and half that

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:23.440
[Guest]: come together as one, two becomes one and one plus one becomes one.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.120
[Guest]: This is the mathematics of love, if you will have it.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.120
[Guest]: Right.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.120
[Guest]: So I've always been interested.

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.440
[Guest]: Remember I said at the very beginning, I'm interested in things that people don't like

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.960
[Guest]: to think about.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:37.880
[Guest]: We like to think about whole numbers, but what about the things between these two numbers?

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.280
[Guest]: And so I was always fascinated.

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:46.680
[Guest]: If one plus one equals one, what about one plus half or half plus three quarters?

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.680
[Guest]: Right.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.720
[Guest]: If we had to measure our mathematical investment in our partners, it probably won't be whole.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.520
[Guest]: You're thinking about 55 other things, about 65 other people.

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.520
[Guest]: Right.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.320
[Guest]: So if we're doing this mathematically, what is it?

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.160
[Guest]: How much is it that we are in this relationship?

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:08.360
[Guest]: So when this film going back to Bollywood came out, it just fascinated me because here

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:13.520
[Guest]: is a film that is actually talking about ishq in relation, not to whole numbers, but to

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.600
[Guest]: a fraction.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:20.840
[Guest]: And this is how I say Bollywood can really be brilliant without necessarily saying here

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.200
[Guest]: is a gay character.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200
[Guest]: Right.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.240
[Guest]: And, you know, this is going to be a spoiler alert.

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.200
[Guest]: Anyone who has not seen it, please fast forward the next five minutes.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.960
[Amit Varma]: But even if you give a spoiler, we have agreed it's the journey and not the destination.

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:33.960
[Guest]: There you go.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.960
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:44.120
[Guest]: So the the point of Dehdish Kiya is that these two women are lovers, but we don't know that

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.840
[Guest]: in the film at all because the two women also have two men, Nasruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.360
[Guest]: The women are Madhuri Dixit and Richa Chadda.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:59.640
[Guest]: We always are pairing up these two, man, woman, man, woman, and completely blind to the possibility

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.400
[Guest]: that it might be the two women together.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.400
[Guest]: And so the joke is on us at the end of the film when we finally realize, oh, my God,

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.280
[Guest]: it's the two women who are together.

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:13.040
[Guest]: Because what that shows us is that to go back to our earlier conversation, we have been

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:19.000
[Guest]: looking from a perspective that seems so commonplace, that seems so right that we don't think about

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.280
[Guest]: So the revelation in the film is not about the characters, it's about the viewers.

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:29.800
[Guest]: And, you know, this film is based on an Ismat Chugtai short story called Lihav, The Quilt,

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.760
[Guest]: which, as you know, is famous now.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:37.880
[Guest]: But my favorite story about Lihav is that Chugtai had a case filed against her.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.880
[Guest]: Mantu had a case filed against him similarly, I think, for a Kali Shalwar or something of

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.960
[Guest]: the kind.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.680
[Guest]: They both traveled to Lahore together in 1942 to appear before the court.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.320
[Guest]: And it's still the British High Court, Lahore High Court.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.840
[Guest]: And the charge is obscenity against Lihav.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:02.640
[Guest]: And Ismat Chugtai's lawyer gets her off because he asks every witness for the prosecution,

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.400
[Guest]: OK, you have alleged that this is an obscene story.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:10.680
[Guest]: Can you point to a single word in the story that's obscene?

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.640
[Guest]: And none of the witnesses could do that.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.880
[Guest]: And so the judge said, well, if you can't point to a single word that's obscene, let's

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.400
[Guest]: get rid of this.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:23.040
[Guest]: And that, to me, is the beauty of this tale, because there is no word like gay, lesbian,

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.200
[Guest]: sex, nothing.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.440
[Guest]: Yet here is the canonical love story between two women in our culture.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.040
[Amit Varma]: And it's a masterpiece of subtlety.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.480
[Amit Varma]: Can you tell our listeners, you know, briefly what it's about?

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.280
[Guest]: I mean, it is stunning.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:43.640
[Guest]: It is about this woman, Begum Jaan, and her maid, Rabbu, which is exactly the template

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.840
[Guest]: that's recreated in Dedesh Kiya.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.960
[Guest]: Begum Jaan is married to a man who we would now call a gay man, who is interested only

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.680
[Guest]: in young men and sort of spent all his money on them.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.800
[Guest]: The assumption is that they never had sex, never consummate their relationship.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.640
[Guest]: And the story goes on about how Begum Jaan is wilting with each passing day.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:09.280
[Guest]: And she develops what the story evocatively and brilliantly calls an itch.

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.680
[Guest]: So she develops an itch and she's scratching herself all the time, called the doctors and

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.200
[Guest]: the doctors say, there's nothing wrong with you.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.520
[Guest]: We don't know where this itch is coming from.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.520
[Guest]: But she's in agony.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520
[Guest]: She's in pain.

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.000
[Guest]: She's in distress until the maid, Rabbu, comes and says, I can give you a massage.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.020
[Guest]: I can press you in a way that the itch will disappear.

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:32.200
[Guest]: And the story is narrated about how Rabbu's massages cure the Begum entirely.

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.480
[Guest]: And she blossoms and glows and looks delighted.

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.600
[Guest]: Now this entire story is being told from the vantage point of a 10-year-old girl who is

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:42.600
[Guest]: Begum Jaan's niece.

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:44.880
[Guest]: And so she says, what is all this massaging going on?

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.300
[Guest]: I don't understand it, but Begum Jaan seems to love it.

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.600
[Guest]: And the story is about how she's sleeping in Begum Jaan's room at night in a cot like

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.400
[Guest]: we all do, you know, relative sleep in the same room.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:01.220
[Guest]: But Rabbu is also in the same bed giving Begum Jaan a massage and how the little child wakes

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:08.120
[Guest]: up in the middle of the night and sees the lihaaf, the razae, the quilt, rising and falling

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:12.880
[Guest]: in interesting shapes because of the activity going on underneath it.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.280
[Guest]: And till the end of the story, she has no idea what's going on.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.600
[Guest]: So what are you going to say?

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.960
[Guest]: Razae is obscene, lihaaf is obscene, itch is obscene.

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.100
[Guest]: What do you say?

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:30.240
[Guest]: But you put all these together and you have a clear story about the lack of sexual satisfaction

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.840
[Guest]: and then the consummation of sexual desire.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.760
[Guest]: And so Chukta's brilliance, and the lawyer's brilliance actually, is to say, what do you

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.600
[Guest]: think of as obscene cannot always be named?

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:45.720
[Guest]: Which takes us back to that entire conversation about identity politics and categories of

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.720
[Guest]: naming.

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:47.720
[Guest]: Right?

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.280
[Guest]: What do you lose when you name and what do you gain without a name?

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.040
[Amit Varma]: And just thinking about what seems beautiful about the story is that it also seems to illustrate

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:57.240
[Amit Varma]: what Marshall McLuhan said about the medium being the message.

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:01.080
[Amit Varma]: Because what is so beautiful about the story is not just what happens, but the way it is

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.080
[Amit Varma]: told.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.080
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And that interplay with the viewer where, you know, you get everything and yet don't

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.160
[Amit Varma]: get anything.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.160
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.160
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.280
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and you would have more Danish gear, I'll quickly sort of quote these words

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:20.340
[Amit Varma]: from your book, which sort of make it explicit what you just said, quote, the film is operating

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:24.200
[Amit Varma]: on three basic principles of desire that affect us all.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.560
[Amit Varma]: First, it shows how easy it is to see heterosexual couples everywhere.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:34.160
[Amit Varma]: Second, it shows us that non-coupled, non-normative desires are everywhere around us, even if

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.160
[Amit Varma]: we don't know how to see them.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:41.600
[Amit Varma]: The third principle with which the film works, there is always more and less to desire than

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.560
[Amit Varma]: meets the eye, stop quote.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.600
[Amit Varma]: I was also sort of, and I wonder when you say that, you know, the second principle,

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:53.760
[Amit Varma]: that it shows us that non-coupled, non-normative desires are everywhere around us, even if

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.760
[Amit Varma]: we don't know how to see them.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:59.960
[Amit Varma]: Would it also then hold that even when we don't know how to see them in us?

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:00.960
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:01.960
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:07.120
[Guest]: So if we stick with the first part right now, you know, there's a park outside the studio

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:11.280
[Guest]: with benches and in Delhi, winter sun, of course, there are always people sitting there.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:17.960
[Guest]: And I have a fantastic photo that I took of three men on that bench, watching something

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.880
[Guest]: on a phone, one of the guy's phone.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:20.880
[Guest]: Definitely TikTok.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:21.880
[Guest]: Oh really?

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:26.560
[Guest]: And they are completely intertwined, like arms around each other.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:31.080
[Guest]: One guy's leg is over the other guy's thigh, completely immersed in this video, which could

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.720
[Guest]: well have been of a woman dancing.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.720
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:40.080
[Guest]: But their body language, any other so-called developed country in the world that outlaws

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:43.500
[Guest]: homosexuality, they'd be arrested right there on the spot.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:48.360
[Guest]: So for me, yes, we don't know how to see, and we don't know what it is that we're seeing,

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:53.400
[Guest]: because they might be perfectly heterosexual, or they might be perfectly homosexual, or

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:54.900
[Guest]: they might be a bit of both.

01:30:54.900 --> 01:31:00.400
[Guest]: We don't know what we're seeing, but imposing normativity on everything that we see, which

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.680
[Guest]: is exactly what we do with ourselves.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:09.360
[Guest]: So I was asked last week, I was in Trivandrum for the Lit Fest there, and I was asked, what

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.640
[Guest]: do we do when we go into rural areas?

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:16.480
[Guest]: And this was by an activist, extremely well-meaning, lovely guy.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:21.160
[Guest]: He said, what do we do when we go into rural areas and people don't want to identify themselves

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:22.160
[Guest]: as gay?

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.440
[Guest]: Isn't that a setback to the gay movement, and this, that, and the other?

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:30.520
[Guest]: And I said very clearly, millions of people in India do not even know the word gay.

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:34.720
[Guest]: There are men who have sex with men who have no idea what homosexuality is, and that's

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:40.280
[Guest]: exactly as it should be, because the whole force of a queer politics is that we don't

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:45.320
[Guest]: always have to name everything, that there are things that elude naming.

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:50.080
[Guest]: So I could be a woman who thinks of myself as heterosexual, who is married to a man,

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.160
[Guest]: but who might suddenly have a desire for a woman, right?

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:58.560
[Guest]: This was the big scandal of Deepa Mehta's fire, like how are these two women, heterosexual

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.380
[Guest]: women, married to two men, suddenly coming together?

01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:09.340
[Guest]: So we don't know where desire will emerge from within us, let alone within others.

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:14.920
[Guest]: And so if we name ourselves X, we are going to be bound by it in a way that I don't think

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:21.440
[Guest]: is necessarily healthy or desirable, that we have to be able to say, the name is not

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:26.960
[Guest]: me, that there are desires here that I can't name, that escape naming, and that's what

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.760
[Amit Varma]: makes them so sexy.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:32.760
[Amit Varma]: Which is also hard at a human level, because I think how we make sense of the world is

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:37.920
[Amit Varma]: by simplifying it with narratives and taxonomies and actually naming things and putting them

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:41.440
[Amit Varma]: into categories or pigeonholes, as it were.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.800
[Amit Varma]: So it seems that that is also hard to pull off, especially when the culture is sort of

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.800
[Amit Varma]: like that.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.880
[Amit Varma]: One of the other revelations of the book, which I should have known, but I didn't know,

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:59.000
[Amit Varma]: is Shakuntala Devi's history, and everyone thinks of her as, you know, a genius mathematician.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.320
[Amit Varma]: But at the same age that, in the same year that she pulled off one of her great mathematical

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:09.200
[Unknown]: feats, which I have already forgotten, she published a book called The World of Homosexuals.

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.960
[Amit Varma]: And she was, of course, married and later divorced to a homosexual, but she responded

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.220
[Amit Varma]: to this with, not with anger, but empathy, and wrote this book in which she said the

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:23.040
[Amit Varma]: following words, quote, heterosexual society dictates to the world how people should live

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.920
[Amit Varma]: and what they should do.

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:27.760
[Amit Varma]: Heterosexual society is based mostly on authoritarianism.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.720
[Amit Varma]: The authoritarians are judges, priests and professors, and their weapons of control are

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:37.040
[Amit Varma]: guilt, justice, punishment, and fear, stop quote.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Strong words.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.040
[Guest]: Which kind of, yeah.

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.040
[Unknown]: And this was 1977.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.040
[Unknown]: That's right.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:43.040
[Amit Varma]: Pretty freaky.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.040
[Guest]: So the next sort of question is something.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.040
[Amit Varma]: Can I just sort of address something you just said?

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Sure, sure.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:53.200
[Guest]: When you said that human life, you know, we want to simplify it, we want to have taxonomies

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.480
[Guest]: and categories.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.600
[Guest]: And you're absolutely right.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.960
[Guest]: We always do.

01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:02.720
[Guest]: The reason I'm fascinated by desire rather than, let's say, zoology, which is also very

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:11.200
[Guest]: taxonomic and very categorical, is that desire has always, for as long as we've known, across

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.000
[Guest]: cultures, always defied taxonomy.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:22.960
[Guest]: So what is it about this thing, this multi-leveled, multi-headed hydra that we have been trying

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:26.520
[Guest]: to tame for centuries and have not managed to tame?

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:31.000
[Guest]: That's why I think it continues to provide such rich material for thought and conversation

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.320
[Guest]: and scholarship is actually, for instance, if you think about laws, the number of laws

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:41.000
[Guest]: that are in place to try and police desire, what is this thing that is so scary?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.680
[Guest]: And why does it resist taxonomy?

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:49.160
[Guest]: So I just want to sort of say, in that sense, desire is more resistant to taxonomy than

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.020
[Guest]: we would like to think it is.

01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:56.000
[Guest]: And that's what makes it fascinating, which is also why it's sad when we think that our

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.200
[Guest]: liberation lies in taxonomizing it, that our liberation lies in coming up with more and

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:10.600
[Guest]: more names to describe what we are, rather than allowing namelessness or un-namability

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.040
[Amit Varma]: to be one of those possibilities.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.440
[Amit Varma]: That's a very profound insight.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:18.280
[Amit Varma]: And just going back to zoology, it strikes me that if you look at a cow, a cow being

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.800
[Amit Varma]: a cow doesn't depend on how you look at it, it doesn't depend on how a cow looks at itself,

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.500
[Amit Varma]: and it doesn't depend on what the law says it is.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:31.400
[Amit Varma]: But all of these different factors affect any kind of desire, obviously.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:37.620
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me since you brought laws up, I think one of the issues that confuses

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:43.080
[Amit Varma]: a lot of people is that we tend to conflate legality with morality, and that shapes and

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.080
[Amit Varma]: changes society.

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:48.720
[Amit Varma]: So you can have, as the British did when they came in with the IPC, that you can have a

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:54.680
[Amit Varma]: codification of laws that is imposed from top down, and which hasn't come up organically,

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.120
[Amit Varma]: and yet it changes society because, you know, the coercive nature of the power of the state

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.120
[Amit Varma]: is going to impose a lot of that.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:05.800
[Guest]: I mean, to give you one example, Amit, well, I mean, there are actually two, but let me

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:11.680
[Guest]: give you one example, 377, right, the judgment about 377, which, let me just say upfront

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.960
[Guest]: is wonderful.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.360
[Guest]: I'm really glad it happened.

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.520
[Guest]: It was long overdue.

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:21.680
[Guest]: And I'm just relieved that we are now living in a country where 377 has been read down.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:27.400
[Guest]: But even though it was a victory for us, for me, it was also a bit of a defeat.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:32.320
[Guest]: Because you see, 377, you remember the wording of it under Macaulay's instructions in the

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:38.240
[Guest]: IPC, is it bans carnal acts against the law of nature.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:44.200
[Guest]: Now, successive judges have interpreted law of nature to mean reproduction, anything resulting

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:51.200
[Guest]: in reproduction, which is to say, anybody in the world who is sexually active performs

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.600
[Guest]: acts against the laws of nature, because not every sexual act results in reproduction,

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.960
[Guest]: every single person.

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:06.200
[Guest]: Now, 377 was for a variety of reasons, equated more and more narrowly with male homosexuality

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.280
[Guest]: in India, not even female homosexuality so much.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.160
[Guest]: And so the way in which the legal team, the wonderful legal team that won the case finally

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.640
[Guest]: in the Supreme Court, fought the case, is by saying this is discriminatory to homosexuals

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:25.740
[Guest]: in India, which at one level of police harassment was absolutely true.

01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:30.520
[Guest]: But at another level, and this is where I think we lost the battle, it is true as a

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:36.260
[Guest]: law, it is true about every single sexually active person in this country.

01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:40.800
[Guest]: So for instance, the first Supreme Court bench that overturned the Delhi High Court ruling,

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:46.160
[Guest]: and that Supreme Court ruling was so phobic, including a sitting judge of the Supreme Court

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:53.520
[Guest]: saying in open court, he said, I do not know a single gay man, therefore, I don't think

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.960
[Guest]: this affects that many people in this country.

01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:01.680
[Guest]: The reason he's able to say that is because we have so narrowed our definitions about

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:05.940
[Guest]: who this law affects, that he's able to make that kind of phobic statement and get away

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.360
[Guest]: with it.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.840
[Guest]: If everyone in that courtroom had stood up and said, I perform acts against nature, carnal

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:16.480
[Guest]: acts against the order of nature, what would that judge have done?

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.800
[Guest]: Because in fact, it is true that every one of us is affected by this, right?

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:25.000
[Guest]: And these are very, these are two different ways of approaching the question of desire

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.160
[Guest]: and of sexuality, which is one is the minoritizing narrative, where you say sort of sexual identities

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:36.920
[Guest]: are minority demographics, and the universalizing narrative where you say desire equally stuns

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.380
[Guest]: all of us, equally undoes us all.

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:45.680
[Guest]: And so rather than saying, ghettoizing particular sexual identities, and therefore allowing

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:51.680
[Guest]: one to be triumphant, we say all sexual identities are just all over the place and cannot be

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:52.960
[Guest]: pinned down.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:59.920
[Guest]: So for me, the triumph of 377, which was based on a minoritizing narrative, lost the battle

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.100
[Guest]: of the universalizing impulse.

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.320
[Guest]: And for me, that is an actual loss as well.

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.640
[Amit Varma]: No, and it strikes me also, you know, just the phrase against the order of nature, commits

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:15.120
[Amit Varma]: both a historical fallacy in claiming, in implying that heterosexuality is what is normal

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.600
[Amit Varma]: and nothing else.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And also the naturalistic fallacy in making the connection that if it only what is natural

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:26.440
[Amit Varma]: is right, which is also, you know, obviously, not the case, you know, so you were speaking

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:30.120
[Amit Varma]: in this about one of the reasons about why it's against the act of nature is that it

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.200
[Amit Varma]: doesn't lead to reproduction.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk of reproduction for a bit.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.080
[Amit Varma]: You know, it strikes me like, you know, you have a great chapter on celibacy, right?

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.740
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that a lot of the people who choose celibacy are in a sense trying

01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:48.760
[Amit Varma]: to move, are trying to get away from the way their desires are governed.

01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:53.880
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that in the modern age, with birth control, which therefore liberates

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:58.460
[Amit Varma]: all of us from having to worry about reproduction, but especially women, that you can now give

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:02.120
[Amit Varma]: free rein to your desires and you're not bound by that.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:07.680
[Amit Varma]: Has that therefore changed the way that our desires are now expressed and can be expressed?

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.200
[Guest]: Ah, but you see what you're underestimating, which I know you don't, but in that question

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:16.200
[Guest]: you're underestimating, is the social pressure, right?

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:20.400
[Guest]: So of course, we can say women, you are free now, you can have birth control, men, you

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:26.240
[Guest]: should use condoms like Shashi Kapoor in relation to Amitabh Bachchan, but it simply doesn't

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:27.240
[Guest]: happen, right?

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:30.760
[Guest]: The first question you're asked within a month or two of getting married is, when are you

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.960
[Guest]: going to have children?

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:36.880
[Guest]: I think one of the most criminal developments in our country is that on every street corner

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:42.200
[Guest]: now in cities, you can see IBF clinics, as though what we are suffering from is a lack

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.340
[Guest]: of population, right?

01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:49.200
[Guest]: So the social pressure to have children, and I, for the life of me, do not know where this

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.080
[Guest]: comes from.

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.720
[Guest]: There's no lack of children.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.480
[Guest]: We have, as I said, pantheons of gods who never actually have their own biological children.

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.920
[Guest]: I don't know where this pressure comes from, but it nonetheless exists and exists hugely.

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:08.000
[Guest]: So women are not free any longer, even now, despite contraception and the advances in

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.760
[Guest]: contraception to say, okay, I'm not going to have a child, because it's fairly impossible

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:16.720
[Guest]: to escape that trajectory once you're on it.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:20.400
[Guest]: Then you can say, okay, if you have to have a child, have just one child.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:25.120
[Guest]: And then all these narratives, oh, one child will suffer, and only child will suffer.

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.640
[Guest]: You need a second child to come along.

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:27.640
[Amit Varma]: It's, you know, one of my-

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.960
[Guest]: And oh, both childs are girls, you need a boy.

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:30.960
[Guest]: You need a boy.

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:39.000
[Guest]: So one of my theories is, and it's, I think, a true one, is that the more difficult an

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.160
[Guest]: action is, the more we sentimentalize it, right?

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.400
[Guest]: So we sentimentalize, for instance, war.

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.520
[Guest]: And similarly, I think we sentimentalize motherhood.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.320
[Guest]: So for instance, if you just, again, do that blind test, right?

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:57.840
[Guest]: Ask somebody, any random person, how would you like your body taken over for nine months

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.960
[Guest]: by an alien being, being extremely sick through all of those nine months, not have any control

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:11.260
[Guest]: over your body, have your body torn open and blood and guts spilling out in order to give

01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:12.660
[Guest]: birth to this alien being?

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:15.080
[Guest]: You think anybody will say yes?

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.440
[Guest]: If they said, we'll say, my God, you're mad.

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.040
[Guest]: How can you want to inflict that kind of violence on yourself, right?

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:27.800
[Guest]: Because it is such a violent act, it is smothered over by layers and layers and layers of sentimentality,

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:32.480
[Guest]: motherhood is the best thing that can happen to you.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.960
[Guest]: You haven't lived, if you haven't experienced the joys of motherhood, there is no phrase

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.900
[Guest]: like the sorrows of motherhood, right?

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:40.960
[Guest]: It's always the joys of motherhood.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.640
[Guest]: And ask any mother.

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.280
[Guest]: And if they're being honest, they'll say to you, my God, this is a pain.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.080
[Guest]: I can't believe I signed up for this.

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.080
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.640
[Guest]: And it's a pain for the rest of your life.

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.800
[Guest]: Do you ever stop worrying about the child?

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.160
[Guest]: Do you ever stop fearing bodily damage or mental damage to them?

01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:04.080
[Guest]: So no one in their right minds would sign up for this experience, if it were not utterly

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:07.260
[Guest]: sentimentalized to within an inch of your life.

01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:11.280
[Amit Varma]: So I once wrote a column which will be linked from the show notes for your perusal, for

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:14.360
[Amit Varma]: which I got trolled more than anything else I have ever written.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.040
[Amit Varma]: And the column basically argued that it's immoral to have children.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.040
[Guest]: Good for you.

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.040
[Guest]: I must read that.

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.040
[Guest]: Not for obvious reasons.

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Linked from the show notes.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:27.200
[Amit Varma]: And, and parent trolls, I realized are worse than Bhak trolls or Shah Rukh Khan trolls,

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.200
[Unknown]: all the different kinds of trolls that I have encountered in my life.

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.200
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.120
[Amit Varma]: A deeper thought here is that I wasn't saying that birth control is a kind of panacea, obviously

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:38.200
[Amit Varma]: social change happens at a seemingly glacial pace.

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.760
[Amit Varma]: So if you look back on the last four or five decades, like my God, how much we have progressed.

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:49.720
[Amit Varma]: But I would also say that one of the fundamental, that the fundamental battle of humanity is

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:54.880
[Amit Varma]: as rational beings, we fight the way we are hardwired, right, for example, my wife and

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:59.360
[Amit Varma]: I have decided not to have kids, however, we are hardwired to create kids, we are fighting

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:06.160
[Amit Varma]: a hard wiring, I might feel all kinds of impulses in the course of a day, which I fight, I am

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.300
[Amit Varma]: fighting my biology.

01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:14.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and you could see that a lot of for example, the social pressures to have

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:20.800
[Amit Varma]: children or whatever, are a codification of the way we are hardwired, but equally culture,

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.520
[Amit Varma]: just as it can enforce our hardwiring can also militate against it.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:30.920
[Amit Varma]: And that's sort of the whole kind of battle and all these desires are clearly natural

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:31.920
[Amit Varma]: to us.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.320
[Guest]: And yet we fight them, you know, which is why the phrase hardwiring I'm not it's not

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.940
[Guest]: my best friend.

01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:41.080
[Guest]: Because I actually I don't think there's that much that's hardwired.

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:46.960
[Guest]: I mean, clearly, there are some things that are but these things, the sort of things that

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:51.960
[Guest]: we associate with sentiment and emotion and things like that, are not hardwired and just

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.500
[Guest]: to stick with the example of children and childbearing.

01:44:55.500 --> 01:45:04.000
[Guest]: If you look back even, let's say, 200 years, people routinely had x number of children,

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.320
[Guest]: half of whom would routinely die.

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.440
[Guest]: And this idea of Oh, my God, the loss of a child is the worst thing ever in the world

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.000
[Guest]: simply does not exist as a narrative.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.320
[Guest]: Which is to say the relation of a parent to a child, as we understand it today, i.e. the

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:26.720
[Guest]: craving and all that is a fairly recent phenomenon, cultural phenomenon, which is what I mean

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.520
[Guest]: about the sentimentalizing thing, right?

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:33.320
[Guest]: If you're saying 1000s of years ago, people had children, because to go back to Ayyappan's

01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:37.480
[Guest]: dilemma, we're going to die and we want someone to take over our cave.

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.480
[Guest]: That's different.

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.480
[Guest]: Right?

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:43.240
[Guest]: If people said today, we are only producing children because we want to hang on to our

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.240
[Guest]: money.

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.880
[Guest]: I'd actually have a lot of more sympathy for that kind of narrative.

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.280
[Amit Varma]: But I think both are a cultural rationalization of a natural hardwired instinct.

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:57.720
[Guest]: But I don't know if it's hardwired, if it requires cultural rationalization, you see,

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:02.460
[Guest]: that's my, that's my thing that that if it is hardwired, then it doesn't need anything.

01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:05.560
[Guest]: If it needs something, that means it's actually more tenuous than

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:11.280
[Amit Varma]: No, I think it always needs a little bit of dressing to seem sort of, you know, respectable

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.280
[Amit Varma]: and whatever.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:15.600
[Amit Varma]: Anyways, so that's a whole different argument.

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.040
[Unknown]: We could do an episode on that as well sometime.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on to what I think is a very important aspect of your book, and you have a chapter

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:27.300
[Amit Varma]: on this as well, which is about the role that language plays.

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:32.360
[Amit Varma]: And the fascinating fact that there are some languages, like most of our Indian languages,

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.320
[Amit Varma]: which are gendered languages.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.400
[Amit Varma]: So you know, a chair is a particular gender and all and some which are not like Persian

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:45.040
[Amit Varma]: and English, you know, tell me a little bit about how languages play a part in the landscape

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.040
[Guest]: of desire.

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:47.040
[Guest]: Right?

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:52.040
[Guest]: You know, the reason, side note, why you as with Bengali blood in your family, and why

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.160
[Guest]: me as South Indian blood in my family, the reason Hindi speakers often laugh at us is

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.360
[Amit Varma]: because we get our genders wrong.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:03.320
[Guest]: Because both Bengali and Malayalam are not as gendered languages as Hindi, right?

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.960
[Guest]: Some nouns have gender, but not all of them.

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.120
[Guest]: So in fact, we don't have that usage of gender in our language.

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.320
[Amit Varma]: I am always mocked for this.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.800
[Guest]: Those who are listening kindly don't mock me anymore.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:14.800
[Guest]: I am too.

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:17.720
[Guest]: And I am a Dilliwali born and bred.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:22.000
[Guest]: But you know, talk about hard wiring, there's something in me, where my Hindi in terms of

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.400
[Guest]: gender is completely subservient to my scant knowledge of Malayalam, where the gender doesn't

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.400
[Guest]: play out that way.

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:35.240
[Guest]: Anyway, there are only two things in the world that have gender, physical human and animal

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:41.880
[Guest]: beings and languages, that's it, which I find fascinating, because gender is what confers

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.920
[Guest]: identity on human beings and animals.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:47.320
[Guest]: But for now, we'll talk about human beings.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:51.200
[Guest]: And it's also what confers identity in language.

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:59.760
[Guest]: So for instance, in gendered languages, like Hindi, like Urdu, like all the Romance languages

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.960
[Guest]: in the world, all nouns will have a gender attached to it, right?

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:12.440
[Guest]: And they are awful, like cities, all objects will be feminine, cars, for instance, or cities

01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:13.440
[Guest]: and things like that.

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:17.940
[Guest]: Whereas English in that sense is an extremely gender free language, because other than he

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:23.560
[Guest]: and she, nothing else has gender, no nouns have gender table, everything is an it.

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:31.240
[Guest]: So if we want to correlate language and gender identity, it seems like people who speak English

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:33.020
[Guest]: should be less gendered.

01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:36.440
[Guest]: And people who speak Hindi should be more gendered, which is not the case.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:40.300
[Guest]: But what I find fascinating is that languages can play a really interesting role in how

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.820
[Guest]: we think about desire.

01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:45.800
[Guest]: So for instance, and this is going to go back actually to Tony Joseph, who you brought up

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:51.880
[Guest]: earlier in this idea of migration, people sort of think of Sanskrit as the Ur language

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:52.880
[Guest]: of India, right?

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:57.240
[Guest]: The language of the Indian soil, which was nothing of the kind, because Sanskrit actually

01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:03.640
[Guest]: comes from the old Indo-Persian family of languages, and actually shares more in common

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:06.720
[Guest]: with Persian than it does with many other languages.

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:12.040
[Guest]: So for instance, the word ast, which in Sanskrit means I am, it's the fundamental assertion,

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:15.520
[Guest]: is the same word in Persian, ast, right?

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:20.000
[Guest]: And so Persian, though, is a non-gendered language.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.720
[Guest]: And Sanskrit is a gendered language.

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:30.600
[Guest]: But one of the arguments I'm making is that the reason why the Kama Sutra, Buddhist texts,

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:37.320
[Guest]: Jain texts, Vedic texts, all these texts written in Sanskrit, sometimes in Pali, but sometimes

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:44.000
[Guest]: in Sanskrit, a lot of them are able to talk about genders as being more than just two.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.120
[Guest]: There is also the Napunsak, which is the third, there is the male Napunsak, and there is the

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:50.120
[Guest]: female Napunsak.

01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:53.240
[Guest]: There are like five or six categories of gender.

01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:56.800
[Guest]: And one of the arguments I'm making is that the reason why, say, these texts written in

01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:02.000
[Guest]: Sanskrit are able to have multiple genders is because they still have a trace memory

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.400
[Guest]: of where they come from, which is Central Asia, which is the Persian family of languages.

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:13.920
[Guest]: And so for me, it's really fascinating which languages will and will not allow that capaciousness.

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.200
[Guest]: English, for instance, does not allow that capaciousness historically.

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.440
[Guest]: They're so horrified by anything that does not fit two genders, they say, we have to

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.520
[Guest]: shut it down.

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.920
[Guest]: But linguistically, they're great.

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.620
[Guest]: They don't feminize objects and they don't masculinize valor and things like that.

01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:35.880
[Guest]: So there isn't a direct correlation, but there very much is a relationship between, to go

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.000
[Guest]: back to what you were saying about our desire to categorize.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.200
[Guest]: Language is our means of categorizing.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:47.360
[Guest]: And when we categorize the world around us according to gender, the world looks different

01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.560
[Guest]: from when we don't categorize the world according to gender.

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:57.400
[Amit Varma]: So I've always sort of speculated on the role that language plays in shaping a society.

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:01.880
[Amit Varma]: For example, it strikes me that one of the reasons that I like Japanese literature so

01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:06.360
[Amit Varma]: much, for example, is that my aesthetic preference is to minimalism.

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:12.520
[Amit Varma]: So all the writers that I read, whether they are Kawabata, Murakami, Yoko Ogawa, or whoever,

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.320
[Amit Varma]: are all minimal, very clean writers.

01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:16.520
[Amit Varma]: And that completely plays to me.

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:19.500
[Amit Varma]: And English has some of those values and others.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.100
[Amit Varma]: And when you look at Urdu poetry, for example, it is just the opposite.

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:26.760
[Amit Varma]: It's very sensuous and florid and all of that.

01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:33.320
[Amit Varma]: And if you translate a poem that appears beautiful in Urdu to English, it will fail on that test

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:37.520
[Amit Varma]: of values alone, because you'll, you know, you'll value precision and all of that much

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.920
[Unknown]: more in English.

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:45.000
[Amit Varma]: So in the context of desire, how much does the nature of these languages, you know, in

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.280
[Amit Varma]: being gendered and not being gendered and all of that, affect the people?

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.440
[Amit Varma]: Is there some kind of link that you've been able to?

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:56.960
[Guest]: You know, again, this is fascinating, because Urdu poetry, which you brought up, and Urdu

01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:02.680
[Guest]: is a gendered language, which Persian is not.

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:10.640
[Guest]: But Urdu poetry is, as you said, florid, full of curlicues and flourishes, and just absolutely

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:11.740
[Guest]: stunning.

01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:15.200
[Guest]: But it can also be extremely precise, right?

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.680
[Guest]: One of my favorite shares from Mir, which I can only tell you in the English translation,

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:23.400
[Guest]: Mir says, if not him, there is his brother.

01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.320
[Guest]: Mir, are there any restrictions in love?

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:31.160
[Guest]: I mean, wow, can't even think about it, very precise.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.880
[Guest]: But also extremely elusive.

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:36.840
[Amit Varma]: There's another line quoted in your book, which I wrote down here, which is translated

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:43.360
[Amit Varma]: by Ruth Vanita in Sex and the City from the poet Kass, where he says, quote, just nipples

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:45.400
[Amit Varma]: meeting is not satisfying.

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Some dildo action now would be good, stop quote, which is quite precise, yeah, can't

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.920
[Guest]: argue with that.

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:51.920
[Amit Varma]: Which is very precise.

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:52.920
[Amit Varma]: That's right.

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:58.720
[Guest]: So then you have to think, and this is true of Shakespeare too, that the point that is

01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:01.720
[Guest]: being conveyed can be very precise.

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:08.640
[Guest]: But the form of that conveyance is what gives rise to desire, to sensuality, you know, which

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:12.920
[Guest]: is why we can say the Japanese might alas, and I love Japanese literature as much as

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:13.920
[Guest]: you do.

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.600
[Guest]: I love Japanese aesthetic.

01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:20.840
[Guest]: But why the Japanese might alas be much more repressed than even we are, right?

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.640
[Amit Varma]: Both in terms of gender and in terms of sexuality.

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:24.360
[Amit Varma]: Because they don't have the language.

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:32.880
[Guest]: Because they are perhaps paying homage to an aesthetic of repression, an aesthetic of

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.360
[Guest]: so repression is then seen as a way of life, rather than as something that's imposed on

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:39.360
[Guest]: you.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:43.680
[Guest]: Whereas we can still see repression as something that's imposed on us, because our cultural

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:46.640
[Guest]: coordinates are all excessive, right?

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:51.320
[Guest]: This is why the British when they came here said, Oh, my God, where have we come, right?

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:58.240
[Guest]: You have here, Nawabs dressing as women, Krishna having sex with 16,000 gopis, what the hell

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.120
[Guest]: is going on?

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:05.840
[Guest]: The beauty of the subcontinent is that we have been a subcontinent of excess.

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:11.400
[Guest]: And that excess also comes up just Amit, as you know, in the sheer number of languages.

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:16.120
[Guest]: So even though many of these languages are gendered, the sheer volume and number of languages,

01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:22.880
[Guest]: dialects, versions, I said to you two weeks ago, I was in Trivandrum for the Lit Fest.

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:25.600
[Guest]: And my family comes from Malabar, North Kerala.

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.720
[Guest]: The difference between Malabari Malayalam and Travancore Malayalam is huge, right?

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:37.320
[Guest]: So that kind of linguistic variety, I think does conduce to variety in different spheres

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:41.800
[Guest]: of life as well and other spheres of life, including especially desire.

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:43.880
[Amit Varma]: That's incredibly fascinating.

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:48.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, now sort of get to a question which struck me as I was reading the book that,

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:52.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, you've got a bit in your book, for example, about how Plato's Symposium, which

01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:58.160
[Amit Varma]: was written in 385 BC, is a paean in praise of pedagogical sodomy, right?

01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:03.720
[Amit Varma]: And there is this tradition, which also then comes down to even the Sufis and even, you

01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:07.760
[Amit Varma]: know, you talk about maybe Ramakrishna Paramhansa and Vivekananda being an example of that,

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:12.200
[Amit Varma]: where there is that element of desire playing out between teacher and student.

01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.600
[Amit Varma]: In many cases, a student might be underage.

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:19.640
[Amit Varma]: In another chapter on hair, you point out about how, you know, young men lose their

01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:25.800
[Amit Varma]: attractiveness as soon as hair begins to sprout and so on and so forth.

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.760
[Amit Varma]: Looking at that with the lens of morality as we do today, and the importance we correctly

01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:36.180
[Amit Varma]: finally give to consent, you know, how does that affect your looking at desire?

01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:41.920
[Amit Varma]: Because these notions of consent and individual rights and all of that are in a sense, you

01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:46.640
[Amit Varma]: know, relatively recent, I won't say inventions, but they've been given importance relatively

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:48.640
[Guest]: in recent centuries.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.240
[Amit Varma]: So how does one, you know, you have this beautiful multiplicity of desires, there's so much happening,

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:54.600
[Guest]: but there are also these questions.

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:59.240
[Guest]: Yeah, so tricky, you know, I mean, so complex and complicated.

01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:03.480
[Guest]: What we call underage today, as you know, was not always underage.

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.280
[Guest]: We all have great, great, great grandmothers and grandfathers who were married when they

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.000
[Guest]: were nine or 10, which will strike people with horror now, but frankly, that is where

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.360
[Guest]: we all came from.

01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:21.000
[Guest]: One of the things that I don't like about us saying, oh, in that time period or in that

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.360
[Guest]: day and age, because that implies a position, a vantage point of superiority now, which

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:27.560
[Guest]: I don't think is fully earned.

01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:33.680
[Guest]: So this entire thing about age is one of these things that I think is a bit, and should be

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:38.640
[Guest]: at least treated as a bit more fluid and complicated than it is right now, because we all have

01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:42.220
[Guest]: had ancestors who were quote unquote underage.

01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.480
[Guest]: So that is one thing, right?

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:49.120
[Guest]: The idea that somehow when you're 18, everything becomes okay is a fairly arbitrary sign.

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:55.120
[Guest]: In fact, Alfred Kinsey, who you know, is a famous, famous American sexologist, has compelling

01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:00.960
[Guest]: sections where he says, by saying that you are only an adult when you're 18 years old,

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:06.680
[Guest]: is to completely ignore the most turbulent sexual years of the teenage, when you're told

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:10.480
[Guest]: that it's not only illegal, but immoral to be sexually active.

01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:16.400
[Guest]: And he says the kinds of neurotic disorders that produces is actually harming society

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.600
[Guest]: much more than we know it, right?

01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:22.440
[Guest]: So to suddenly say, at 18, you are and can be sexually active, I think is actually a

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.760
[Guest]: slightly pernicious thing to say.

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:29.780
[Guest]: Because long before 18, we are actually sexually active in our minds, if nowhere else, right?

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:34.200
[Guest]: And to be told over and over again, that's wrong, really doesn't number on people, right?

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:38.520
[Guest]: As we know, in our country as well, really sort of to be told that's bad, that's wrong

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:41.240
[Guest]: is really problematic.

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:46.280
[Guest]: The question of consent is just so much more complex.

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.680
[Guest]: I think there is no doubt, the two things I want to say about it, the first is, there

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:59.320
[Guest]: is no doubt that in an ideal world, we should all be able to experience, express and recognize

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:01.000
[Guest]: consent.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:07.280
[Guest]: The reason why it is so difficult is because consent is not a transparent thing, right?

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.800
[Guest]: If it was, then it wouldn't be a big deal.

01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:15.440
[Guest]: We wouldn't have all these things about consent is necessary and all that if it was that transparent.

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:19.680
[Guest]: The reason it's not transparent to others is because it's not always transparent to

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:21.640
[Guest]: ourselves.

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:25.920
[Guest]: So do I want something now that five minutes later, I won't want?

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.680
[Guest]: Do I not want something now that five minutes later, I might?

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:33.960
[Guest]: Do I want something now that two days later will fill me with so much shame that I will

01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:37.720
[Guest]: retrospectively say I did not want it then, right?

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:40.040
[Guest]: Where is the consent in all this?

01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:42.320
[Guest]: What is my consent in all this?

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:49.320
[Guest]: And I think those are questions that necessarily complicate what we understand as consent.

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:54.280
[Guest]: The problem with those complications, of course, is that people can use it as loopholes for

01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:57.280
[Guest]: very real violence.

01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.640
[Guest]: And this brings me to my second point, which is so far, and I don't know how long we've

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:03.240
[Guest]: been talking, an hour and a half, two hours.

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:08.720
[Guest]: So far, we've been talking about desires and about sexualities and the plurality of desires

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:12.360
[Guest]: in unadulteratedly happy terms and good terms.

01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:20.520
[Guest]: It's a good thing, but desire more than anything else in the world has an underbelly, which

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:27.520
[Guest]: is not that great, which is in fact violent, which can be sadistic, which can be really

01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:31.120
[Guest]: intent on wreaking damage in the world.

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:37.680
[Guest]: Freud's big insight is that our desires are always both things.

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:43.920
[Guest]: They're always something that we want to give us joy, but it also is something that gives

01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:46.400
[Guest]: us destructiveness.

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:53.320
[Guest]: And so when we think about desire, unfortunately, we have to be aware that desire can be extremely

01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:55.520
[Guest]: violent.

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.920
[Guest]: That's the danger of desire, right?

01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:03.220
[Guest]: It can be violent in a way that we like because it can question the status quo.

02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:04.520
[Guest]: That's how we've been talking about it.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:07.660
[Guest]: And that kind of violence is something to be encouraged.

02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:11.600
[Guest]: It can be violent because it can throw acid in the face of a woman who has said no to

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:12.600
[Guest]: me.

02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:15.400
[Guest]: That's the kind of violence we don't want.

02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:17.380
[Guest]: How do we separate the one from the other?

02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:20.800
[Guest]: Because it's often one that turns into the other.

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:25.040
[Guest]: All these people, many of these narratives of acid attacks, for instance, the man would

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.600
[Guest]: say I loved her.

02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:31.240
[Guest]: That can strike us and should as being utterly warped.

02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:37.940
[Guest]: But the dirty secret of desire is that all desire is potentially warped that way.

02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:43.000
[Guest]: And this is something that is the complicating factor.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.140
[Guest]: This is what we need to also think about when we think about the multitudes of desire.

02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:49.680
[Guest]: Because this too is one among those multitudes.

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:55.180
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that we are constantly involved in trying to figure out a trade off between

02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:56.440
[Unknown]: two things.

02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:01.120
[Amit Varma]: One is celebrating our natural desires as the Kama Sutra does.

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:06.120
[Amit Varma]: And the other is repressing our desires as say yoga seeks to do.

02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:12.560
[Amit Varma]: And I think the second is very important as well, for the simple reason that it's again,

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:19.400
[Amit Varma]: me as a rational machine, fighting my programming, that, you know, I might feel that my desires

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.920
[Amit Varma]: get in the way of doing things that I feel I should be doing rationally.

02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:26.720
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, I try to bring an end to it, I try to discipline my mind.

02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.600
[Amit Varma]: This is why mindfulness meditation is such a big deal these days.

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, this was one of the core reasonings for why kind of yoga came up, it's kind of

02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:36.880
[Amit Varma]: both things.

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:37.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:40.580
[Guest]: And no, I mean, I was, I agree completely.

02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:44.760
[Guest]: This is why, you know, I mean, philosophers and thinkers for centuries have known this,

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:45.760
[Guest]: right?

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:49.680
[Guest]: Which is why someone like Hobbes is able to say that life in nature is nasty, brutish

02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:54.120
[Guest]: and short, because actually left to our own devices, we'll all just kill each other, right?

02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:56.800
[Guest]: Because that is actually our instinct.

02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:58.960
[Guest]: Freud is very, very clear about this.

02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:04.240
[Guest]: He says the only when he writes this famous book, Civilization and its Discontents, he

02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:09.200
[Guest]: says the only way we can be civilized is if we repress our desires.

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.960
[Guest]: And so repression for him is actually what results in civilization.

02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:15.660
[Guest]: You cannot have civilization without repression.

02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:16.800
[Guest]: And so that's absolutely right.

02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:19.920
[Guest]: We have to repress our desires.

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:24.000
[Guest]: But with the knowledge that we're doing that, because our desires can go in directions that

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.520
[Guest]: we have no control over, which is what makes desire fascinating, right, for me and for

02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.520
[Guest]: us.

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:35.760
[Guest]: Yes, to repression, but repression is not necessarily the same, although it has been

02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:40.100
[Guest]: allied with immorality, illegality, all that stuff.

02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:45.200
[Guest]: We all walk that fine line between expression and repression.

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:49.720
[Guest]: That line is different for everybody individually.

02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:53.320
[Guest]: There is no perfect golden mean for what that line is.

02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:58.520
[Guest]: Absolutely the sort of yoga karma relation is very much that attempt at finding that

02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:01.760
[Guest]: balance failing most of the time.

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:07.560
[Guest]: But yes, repression has a role to play and a huge role to play in ensuring that we can

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:10.200
[Guest]: live without killing each other, right?

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.400
[Guest]: Which is why when people go around just murdering each other, you call it anarchy, as in there's

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:16.080
[Guest]: no rule whatsoever.

02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:19.460
[Guest]: Similarly, people go around having sex with whoever they want.

02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:24.960
[Guest]: That would also count as anarchy, because you are sidestepping the civilizational impulse.

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:27.600
[Amit Varma]: I've already taken more than two hours of your time.

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.600
[Guest]: Oh really?

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:33.280
[Amit Varma]: Which is this is the beauty of the conversations that I'm fortunate enough to have on the show

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:35.920
[Amit Varma]: that it's just so much fun.

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:42.280
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we go, I also want to ask you, what has happened in the last five

02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:49.840
[Amit Varma]: or 10 years, is that now we can get far deeper insights into human nature because of technology.

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:55.440
[Amit Varma]: For example, a year and a half back, I reviewed this book called Everybody Lies by Seth Stevens

02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.440
[Amit Varma]: Davidowitz.

02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard of it?

02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:58.440
[Amit Varma]: No.

02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:04.200
[Amit Varma]: What Seth Stevens Davidowitz basically does is he looks at anonymized search results from

02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:10.280
[Amit Varma]: Google and other social media, but a vast amount of data, literally big data, and then

02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:14.880
[Amit Varma]: tries to figure out because when you're searching for something on your laptop, it's a private

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:15.880
[Amit Varma]: act.

02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:17.360
[Amit Varma]: You don't need to post it to others.

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:18.720
[Amit Varma]: It's what you really want.

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.640
[Amit Varma]: It reveals something about you.

02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:25.800
[Amit Varma]: And I found the book incredibly fascinating in the kind of insights it threw up for many

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:30.000
[Amit Varma]: of which I had absolutely remotely, no explanation.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.320
[Amit Varma]: For example, yeah, I mean, one that would not surprise you is that Americans search

02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:38.040
[Amit Varma]: for porn more than the search for weather, which is of course, you can't, you can't jerk

02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.400
[Unknown]: off to cumulus clouds.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.080
[Amit Varma]: That's obviously there.

02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:49.040
[Amit Varma]: But what I found interesting was that incest is a surprisingly popular category, and 25%

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:55.200
[Amit Varma]: of searches on Pornhub, which is a popular porn site, 25% of searches on Pornhub by women

02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.080
[Amit Varma]: feature violence against women.

02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And these are searches by women, you know, with common phrases being painful, anal crying,

02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:08.000
[Amit Varma]: public disgrace, extreme brutal gangbang, I think these are popular tags.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.720
[Amit Varma]: And 5% even look for non consensual sex, which is rape or forced sex.

02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.360
[Amit Varma]: And what is interesting is that search rates for all these terms are at least twice as

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:22.640
[Amit Varma]: common among women than men, yeah, which I found very counterintuitive, and I couldn't

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:28.480
[Guest]: sort of explain it to myself, it's, it's, it's, it's fascinating.

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:34.080
[Guest]: We have known for actually quite a while, that women can often fantasize about being

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.600
[Guest]: raped.

02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:39.440
[Guest]: And women can often fantasize about violent non consensual sex.

02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:45.200
[Guest]: Now, some of us might argue that that is fantasy, and that if it were to happen in reality,

02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.040
[Guest]: it would not in fact be what we want.

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:49.360
[Guest]: And that could well be true.

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:55.360
[Guest]: And just in what I've said the last two sentences, you see how consent is so compromised, right?

02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:58.920
[Guest]: It's so split between our fantasy and our reality.

02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:03.480
[Guest]: And sex or our desire always straddles fantasy and reality.

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:07.520
[Guest]: And so that's one of the reasons why I said the idea of consent is not at all a transparent

02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:12.240
[Guest]: one, because we actually want different things.

02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:14.040
[Guest]: We don't want to be raped.

02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:19.520
[Guest]: But we have been brought up in a culture in which violence against women has been so naturalized

02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:22.560
[Guest]: as to be sexualized as well.

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:23.680
[Guest]: And we live in that culture, right?

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:25.320
[Guest]: We don't live in Mars.

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:31.840
[Guest]: And so for instance, how is it possible that all these old men, 75, 85, oligarchs, rich

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:37.480
[Guest]: men, all have young 25 something wives, or girlfriends or lovers or whatever it is.

02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:42.920
[Guest]: It's not because the women are finding them that sexually attractive, but sexual attractiveness

02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:50.900
[Guest]: also has being involved with men, rich men in power as one of its tags.

02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:55.600
[Guest]: And so in that case, then sexual desire to go back to our earlier conversation has barely

02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:00.760
[Guest]: anything to do with genitalia, and everything to do with this guy is a rich patriarch.

02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:04.280
[Guest]: And so for instance, why would Monica Lewinsky have an affair with Bill Clinton?

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:06.960
[Guest]: Because he's the President of the United States of America.

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:11.640
[Amit Varma]: But I'd argue that that is the proximate reason, but not the ultimate one, in the sense that

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:17.200
[Amit Varma]: what, you know, evolutionary psychologists would say is that women have been hardwired

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:23.560
[Amit Varma]: to be attracted to successful men, and, you know, older men who can look after them and

02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:25.360
[Amit Varma]: their babies well.

02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:30.720
[Amit Varma]: And so that attraction will result in say, a Monica Lewinsky going for a Bill Clinton.

02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:32.960
[Guest]: And it's kind of hardwired in that sense.

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:35.440
[Guest]: See, this is why I don't like hardwired at all, right?

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:39.380
[Guest]: Which is why evolutionary psychology, I think, can be fascinating.

02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:44.640
[Guest]: But I don't like this phrase of it, because it's not like if you're thinking about hardwired

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:47.600
[Guest]: as you know, something that comes down over centuries.

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:52.120
[Guest]: It's not like 50,000 years ago, a neanderthal woman was saying, let me find someone who

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:54.600
[Guest]: was 90 years old to look after me and my children.

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:55.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's simply not the case.

02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:59.320
[Amit Varma]: You'd be drawn to success, you'd be drawn to the alpha male in the tribe, which would,

02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:01.880
[Amit Varma]: of course, increase your chances of reproductive success.

02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:05.600
[Guest]: But you could also be drawn in the opposite way, which we don't say at all, right?

02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:09.680
[Guest]: You could be drawn to the woman who has multiple children, because you think she'll have more

02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:10.680
[Guest]: children.

02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:11.680
[Guest]: That's not the case that happens here.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:12.680
[Guest]: At all.

02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:15.320
[Guest]: Men are not attracted to women who have multiple children, necessarily, right?

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:17.880
[Amit Varma]: Men are attracted to multiple women for just that reason.

02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:20.600
[Guest]: Men are more promiscuous naturally than women.

02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:22.240
[Guest]: See, naturally ka nahi pata.

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:23.240
[Guest]: Not at all.

02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:27.400
[Guest]: You see, I think we're naturalizing something, and then saying it is natural.

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:31.800
[Amit Varma]: I think it's sort of, you know, in the whole nature versus nature thing, I think it's sort

02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:34.120
[Amit Varma]: of dangerous to go to one extreme or the other.

02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:38.840
[Amit Varma]: I like the phrasing that I'd once heard, that nature gives us knobs, nurture turns them.

02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:43.400
[Amit Varma]: So I think both are incredibly important, and we should not deny one or the other.

02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:44.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:45.400
[Guest]: No, no, there's no question of denying.

02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:49.720
[Guest]: But I sort of don't think that 25-year-olds being attracted to 90-year-olds is somehow

02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:56.520
[Guest]: hardwired, because there are plenty of, let's say, 24-year-olds who are perfectly rich men,

02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:57.520
[Guest]: for instance.

02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:01.720
[Guest]: You know, and it also doesn't explain the fact that women are always younger, the men

02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:08.200
[Guest]: always have to be older, you know, all that stuff is problematic.

02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:13.880
[Guest]: And you know, talk about underage or whatever it is, these things are very complicated.

02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:18.600
[Guest]: And yes, there is centuries of conditioning of one kind or the other.

02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:22.400
[Guest]: That's the compromise we can arrive at, of conditioning of one kind or the other.

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:29.580
[Guest]: But all this conditioning means that in some ways, many ways, many of us might have naturalized

02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:35.200
[Guest]: our own oppression, to the extent that it doesn't even feel oppressive to us any longer.

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:36.200
[Guest]: Right?

02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.460
[Guest]: And this was a big insight, say, by someone like Michel Foucault, where he says, you know,

02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:44.840
[Guest]: people keep saying, oh, we want relationships of equality, where there is no power differential

02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:45.840
[Guest]: between the two.

02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:51.040
[Guest]: And he says, you can't have a relationship without power difference, it is an impossibility.

02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:54.520
[Guest]: And in fact, this is also an insight of the best kind of feminist thinking, is that power

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:58.400
[Guest]: difference is sexy, is attractive.

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:01.480
[Guest]: So to sort of say we want a relationship of equality is a pipe dream.

02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.760
[Guest]: But again, as I say, there's always fantasy and reality involved in all these conversations

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:07.760
[Guest]: across the spectrum.

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:08.760
[Amit Varma]: No.

02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:14.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know, another interesting finding of everybody lies has nothing to do with nature.

02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:17.400
[Amit Varma]: Because this particular finding was unique to India.

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:24.040
[Amit Varma]: And this finding was that so basically, what he did was, he typed my husband wants into

02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:26.880
[Amit Varma]: the search bar to see what would pop up.

02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.360
[Amit Varma]: And apparently, for Indians, the number one result was, my husband wants me to breastfeed

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:32.360
[Amit Varma]: him.

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And this is apparently 50 times more common in India than anywhere in the world.

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.360
[Amit Varma]: So it is clearly not nothing to do with hardwiring.

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:45.280
[Amit Varma]: It is clearly a cultural thing, that Indian men want to be breastfed.

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And this is just so bizarre that, you know, I couldn't fathom what the reasons was cultural

02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.240
[Amit Varma]: for whatever, for something like this to even evolve to this stage.

02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:55.240
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah.

02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:59.520
[Guest]: No, really, it doesn't make that phrase, ma ka ladla, even more evocative, doesn't it?

02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:00.520
[Amit Varma]: It does.

02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:09.640
[Guest]: This, the sense of, I mean, we've always known that about, about Indian men, or rather Indian,

02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:13.680
[Guest]: Indians obsession with having male children, and therefore those male children being sort

02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:18.600
[Guest]: of pedestalized in ways that I think are actually very dangerous, both for the child and the

02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:19.600
[Amit Varma]: mother.

02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:20.600
[Amit Varma]: And then also the saas bahu dynamics.

02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:21.600
[Guest]: Exactly, exactly.

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:26.920
[Guest]: But I'd be interested, I mean, I haven't read the book, but does he say there's an equivalent

02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:30.600
[Guest]: in, let's say, the Jewish community, because that's the other community that is supposed

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:32.640
[Amit Varma]: to have that mother-son thing.

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:37.280
[Amit Varma]: Not this specific things, but he did find that while there are things that are common

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:41.880
[Amit Varma]: across cultures, which plays to the whole hardwiring nature thing, but there are also

02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:42.880
[Amit Varma]: many, many differences.

02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:43.880
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:48.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, and this was one of the unique things about, I'll quote him, in fact, I have it

02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:53.080
[Amit Varma]: right in front of me, quote, porn searches for depictions of women, breastfeeding men

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:57.960
[Amit Varma]: are four times higher in India and Bangladesh than in any other country in the world.

02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.640
[Guest]: India and Bangladesh.

02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:00.640
[Guest]: Wow.

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:01.640
[Guest]: Wow.

02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:02.640
[Guest]: That's fascinating.

02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:03.640
[Guest]: It's really fascinating.

02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:10.920
[Guest]: But you know, porn in, in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and all that is very scatological,

02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:11.920
[Guest]: right?

02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:16.100
[Guest]: In Japan, there are these bars where you lie under a glass table and have women shitting

02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:17.100
[Guest]: on you.

02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:18.100
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard of that?

02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:20.240
[Guest]: I'm not surprised, but I haven't heard of it.

02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:25.680
[Guest]: So men lie under glass tables and have women sitting on top of them, shitting on them,

02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:28.240
[Amit Varma]: which is just, which is just fascinating to me.

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:30.480
[Amit Varma]: As a student of Desire, does porn interest you?

02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:34.720
[Amit Varma]: Did you look at a lot of porn while, I mean, look at not in that sense, but did you sort

02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:35.720
[Amit Varma]: of study?

02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:42.240
[Guest]: Only, I mean, for this book, only for the chapter on bhabhis, because that's the other

02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:48.600
[Guest]: finding in Pornhub is that Indians search for that word bhabhi.

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:53.040
[Guest]: One of the searches, one of the highly, highly, highly ranked searches is bhabhi.

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:59.060
[Guest]: And also that women are the, in India are the third biggest demographic who watch porn

02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:04.600
[Guest]: on Pornhub, which is also fascinating given how repressed women are in India.

02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:07.500
[Guest]: Porn, my answer is yes and no.

02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:15.140
[Guest]: It fascinates me in as much as it is a popular exploration of sexual desires that might not

02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.520
[Guest]: be sanctioned, right?

02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.920
[Guest]: On the one hand, I find that fascinating.

02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:23.780
[Guest]: On the other hand, those desires that aren't sanctioned actually are such a mirror image

02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:28.260
[Guest]: of ones that are sanctioned that I'm not that interested in it actually.

02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:33.460
[Guest]: So in other words, if I just study sort of the daylight world as opposed to the twilight

02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:38.080
[Guest]: world, and I'm using this only metaphorically, the daylight world of desire, that is sort

02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:43.160
[Guest]: of pornographic enough in its imagination as than porn is.

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:44.160
[Amit Varma]: Great.

02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:48.280
[Amit Varma]: So having taken, you know, more than two hours of your time, what are you working on next?

02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:49.720
[Guest]: Yeah, good question.

02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:52.720
[Amit Varma]: That's what Ravi, my editor keeps asking me, what are you writing next?

02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:56.680
[Guest]: Well, God bless Ravi if he made you write this book, but what's next?

02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.460
[Guest]: I really think I want to write something on laws.

02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:03.480
[Guest]: There's this Pedro Almodovar film, I don't know whether you've seen it, called The Law

02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:04.840
[Guest]: of Desire.

02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:08.720
[Guest]: So I want that to be the title of my book, The Law of Desire.

02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:14.920
[Guest]: And I just want to look at three or four different sexual activities and the laws governing them

02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:17.920
[Guest]: and to think about what that says about us and our society.

02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:23.120
[Guest]: So I want to think about marriage, I want to think about prostitution, I want to think

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:29.100
[Guest]: about adultery, I want to think about transgender, and of course, homosexuality.

02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:33.600
[Guest]: And think about, I mean, these are just the five right now, rape might be one of them,

02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:35.520
[Guest]: one might come out, one might go in.

02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:42.200
[Guest]: But just to think about how we imagine these sexual crimes, and how we imagine the law

02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:45.040
[Guest]: can actually put a lid on them.

02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:46.400
[Guest]: Just to think about those.

02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:52.440
[Amit Varma]: This is so fascinating, I'm filled with desire to read your next book.

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:53.800
[Guest]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.

02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:54.800
[Guest]: Thank you so much, Amit.

02:14:54.800 --> 02:15:00.160
[Guest]: You are, I hope you get told this often, but you are an amazing interlocutor, and a pleasure

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.160
[Guest]: to talk to.

02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:02.160
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.160
[Guest]: You're so kind.

02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:05.160
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for that.

02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:09.720
[Amit Varma]: In case you enjoyed listening to the show, kindly remember that the history of India

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:12.600
[Amit Varma]: could be called the Indian National Congress.

02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:17.720
[Amit Varma]: And to find out more about it, go to your nearest online or offline bookstore and buy

02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:22.640
[Amit Varma]: By which I don't mean buy a lot of books, which would also be welcome, but buy this

[Amit Varma]: specific book, Infinite Variety, A History of Desire in India by Madhavi Menon, very

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:28.920
[Amit Varma]: smartly.

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And the reason she has written so many books, she's not on social media.
