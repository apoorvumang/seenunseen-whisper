00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.480
[Amit Varma]: I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.760
[Amit Varma]: take a shot at answering all these questions and many more.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.320
[Amit Varma]: I aim to go beyond the scene and show you the unseen effects of public policy and private

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
[Amit Varma]: action.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.800
[Amit Varma]: I speak to experts on economics, political philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, and constitutional

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.640
[Amit Varma]: law so that their insights can blow not only my mind, but also yours.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.440
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen releases every Monday, so do check out the archives and follow the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.680
[Amit Varma]: show at sceneunseen.in.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.400
[Amit Varma]: You can also subscribe to The Scene and the Unseen on whatever podcast app you happen

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: to prefer.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.480
[Amit Varma]: And now, let's move on to the show.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.320
[Amit Varma]: The two great powers in the world today are the USA and China.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's curious that although China is our neighbor, we know so much more about the USA.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200
[Amit Varma]: We are steeped in American culture.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.600
[Amit Varma]: We sing their songs, we speak their language, not just English, but American English.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.760
[Amit Varma]: And we know as much about their celebrities' love lives as if they were our celebrities.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.260
[Amit Varma]: But we know next to nothing about China.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.760
[Amit Varma]: Some of this is due to language, of course.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.480
[Amit Varma]: We were colonized by the British.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.040
[Amit Varma]: We turned English into an Indian language.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.320
[Amit Varma]: So of course we would know more about America.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.240
[Amit Varma]: Some of it is because America is a more open society.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.200
[Amit Varma]: And this globalized world is actually an Americanized world.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Those reasons explain a lot.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.480
[Amit Varma]: But it is possible that China, our largest neighbor, could also be our biggest ally,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.640
[Amit Varma]: just as they could also be our biggest threat.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.640
[Amit Varma]: We really should know more about China.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.400
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadwa.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.920
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.920
[Amit Varma]: In my last two episodes, I focused on Pakistan, first on the electoral and political landscape

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.280
[Amit Varma]: in Pakistan, and then on how going nuclear changed our relationship with them.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.700
[Amit Varma]: In this episode, I want to talk about China, in particular, Chinese foreign policy.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.400
[Amit Varma]: How does China see itself vis-a-vis the rest of the world?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.640
[Amit Varma]: What are its foreign policy objectives?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.600
[Amit Varma]: How does it aim to achieve them?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.200
[Amit Varma]: Should India be worried or hopeful?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.080
[Amit Varma]: To discuss all this, I'll be speaking to Manoj Kevalramani, a fellow at the Takshashila Institution.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.640
[Amit Varma]: Manoj is a China expert and writes Eye on China, a weekly column about developments

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.760
[Amit Varma]: in the Middle Kingdom.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.040
[Amit Varma]: For the website, I add it pragati at thinkpragati.com.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.560

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.440
[Amit Varma]: laymen called Inside, She's China.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.200
[Amit Varma]: This four-week course, which consists of a bunch of webinars and can be done remotely,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.280
[Amit Varma]: begins on August 27th.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.520
[Amit Varma]: And now my conversation with him, but before that, a quick commercial break.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.920

[Amit Varma]: Manoj, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.280
[Amit Varma]: Hi, thank you so much.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Manoj, I got to warn you before we start our conversation that I'm a complete newbie about

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.920
[Amit Varma]: both China and about foreign policy.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.560
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, doing an episode on Chinese foreign policy will require a lot of patience

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.560
[Guest]: on your part.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.240
[Guest]: No, I mean, that's wonderful for me because I can get away with a lot of errors, I guess

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.240
[Guest]: then.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.960
[Amit Varma]: But no, I'm sure it'll be fun.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.680
[Amit Varma]: The listeners of the scene in the unseen are very knowledgeable, they will find any errors.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.360
[Amit Varma]: So let me kind of start off by asking you this.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.480
[Amit Varma]: I'd done an episode on foreign policy in general, a few weeks ago with your colleague Nitin

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.600
[Amit Varma]: Pai.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.120
[Amit Varma]: And Nitin pointed out the various different schools of foreign policy.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.440
[Amit Varma]: And about China, what he said in particular was that the impression I got from that episode

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.880
[Amit Varma]: was that China has sort of had a very insular foreign policy where it doesn't look outward,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.960
[Amit Varma]: it's kind of happy with what it is and just defending its borders and so on and so forth.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.600
[Amit Varma]: What has, is that correct?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.600
[Amit Varma]: What has been the historical outlook of China towards the rest of the world?

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.760
[Guest]: And is that changing?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.760
[Guest]: That's a good question.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.280
[Guest]: I mean, I wouldn't characterize China's foreign policy outlook as insular.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.360
[Guest]: I wouldn't do so at any point of time.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.280
[Guest]: I mean, when you talk about China, what you really need to think of is that this is a

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.240
[Guest]: political entity which has been there for at least 2000 plus 2500 years.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.440
[Guest]: And that's how the Chinese also view themselves as a civilization, obviously much older, 5000

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.240
[Guest]: odd years, but as a political unified entity from about 2000 years onwards.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.480
[Guest]: And throughout that period, there have been periods of expansion, there have been periods

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.240
[Guest]: of being insular.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.960
[Guest]: But the idea that China remains a serious actor internationally has been a core idea

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.600
[Guest]: within the political system, whether it was during the dynasties, or whether it is during

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.240
[Guest]: the People's Republic era.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.840
[Guest]: So just a quick sense, I think, I presume one of the concepts that Nitin must have spoken

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:52.560
[Guest]: about was this concept of Tianxia, which is a Chinese term referring to a broader concept

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.840
[Guest]: of all under the heaven.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.480
[Guest]: This is the fundamental concept which places, from which we derive the idea of the Middle

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.480
[Guest]: Kingdom.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.960
[Guest]: So when you see a kingdom or a polity talking about itself as the center of the world as

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.160
[Guest]: the Middle Kingdom, you can't really see it as insular in that sense.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.120
[Amit Varma]: That's where I derived that logic from.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.920
[Amit Varma]: And what's traditionally been China's approach towards the world, like one of the things

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.040
[Amit Varma]: that you know, Nitin did speak about is how international relations really evolved during

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.800
[Amit Varma]: the 20th century with different nation states looking outwards and trying to establish a

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.520
[Amit Varma]: particular place for themselves in the world.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.640
[Amit Varma]: How has that evolved from China, the way China sees itself vis-a-vis the rest of the world?

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.800
[Amit Varma]: And has ideology had an impact on that?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.320
[Guest]: Okay, so I think this is great.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.240
[Guest]: So this picks up on the point of the Middle Kingdom.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.680
[Guest]: And then that's where I'll build further from.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.360
[Guest]: So the idea of the Middle Kingdom is this central body through which everything emanates,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.600
[Guest]: and civilization and culture emanates from it, commerce and trade emanates from it.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.000
[Guest]: And it's the center of the world.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.680
[Guest]: So in that sense, it sees itself or it saw itself as the center of the world, as a exceptional

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.360
[Guest]: state in this larger international space.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.720
[Guest]: Now, if I was to fast forward that, to say 1949, from the fall of the Qing dynasty in

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:22.680
[Guest]: 1911, 1912 to 1949, that chaotic period in China, where you have colonization, you have

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.640
[Guest]: a civil war between nationalists and the communists, and you have the World War invasions by the

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.280
[Guest]: Japanese.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.680
[Guest]: And China goes through this entire period of turmoil, where it's questioning its place

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.800
[Guest]: in the world.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.280
[Guest]: And it's wondering where the idea of this Middle Kingdom has gone, where the glory of

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.900
[Guest]: the Middle Kingdom has gone.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.880
[Guest]: And then in 1949, we have the People's Republic, which emerges.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.840
[Guest]: And the People's Republic under Mao Zedong has an idea of itself as a revolutionary force.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:56.600
[Guest]: So it sees its role in the international arena as a political entity that must promote revolution.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.880
[Guest]: So this is obviously with the Soviet Union.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.000
[Guest]: So China goes through that.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.760
[Guest]: That's your first modern China, the People's Republic phase, where you establish the idea

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.080
[Guest]: that you want to be a revolutionary force.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:13.040
[Guest]: And then by the late 1970s, after Mao Zedong's death and the arrival of Deng Xiaoping in

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.160
[Guest]: charge of China's affairs, you have a new architecture of foreign policy, which comes

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.480
[Guest]: out, which is not personality driven by Mao, which is not looking at revolution, which

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.280
[Guest]: is looking at China as a state within the community of states, and which is looking

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.600
[Guest]: at China as an actor in that arena.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:38.160
[Guest]: And Deng Xiaoping goes on to develop this concept of Tao Guang Yang Hui, which essentially

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.360
[Guest]: roughly translates into hide your strength and bide your time, although the actual translation

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.220
[Guest]: is not that, but that's broadly what it's accepted to imply.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.040
[Guest]: And what happens with that is that it's China now focusing on its own domestic growth, on

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.760
[Guest]: its economy, on its immediate interests, as opposed to this idea of a revolution, of a

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.960
[Guest]: global revolution.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.280
[Guest]: And from that era, we come to today, which is a new era under Xi Jinping.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.840
[Guest]: He defines it as a new era.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.800
[Guest]: That's the phrase that he uses.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.200
[Guest]: And the idea now is that China has come to a point where it can express itself internationally.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.400
[Guest]: It can pursue broader interests, and it no longer needs to necessarily hide its strength

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.660
[Guest]: and bide its time.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.720
[Amit Varma]: It actually needs to express itself more on the international stage.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.920
[Amit Varma]: And what are these broader interests that under Xi Jinping, under this new era that

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.680
[Guest]: China is now exploring?

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.480
[Guest]: So I think these broader interests are that they build on the interests that have been

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.920
[Guest]: defined over the decades.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.920
[Guest]: So one of the concepts that is very prevalent in Chinese foreign policy is the idea of core

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.720
[Guest]: interests.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.960
[Guest]: As the name suggests, core interests, these are fundamental.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.080
[Guest]: So these are the need to sustain development, economic development, the need to ensure territorial

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.640
[Guest]: integrity.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.240
[Guest]: One must remember that China has territorial disputes in the east and the west, and even

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.200
[Guest]: somewhere in the north.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.040
[Guest]: So it's important for the Chinese, therefore, to ensure the integrity of their nation.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.280
[Guest]: That's how they see it as.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.920
[Guest]: So the stability in Tibet, stability in Xinjiang, the border dispute with India, maritime disputes

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.520
[Guest]: in the South China Sea, the Senkakus and Diaoyu dispute in the East China Sea.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.280
[Guest]: These are all factors that have built over a period of time as core interests.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:32.920
[Guest]: So development, territorial integrity, broader economic security in which you're expanding

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.920
[Guest]: your enterprises.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:40.080
[Guest]: They are going global and they are capturing market share, revenues, resources internationally

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.160
[Guest]: to ensure domestic development.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.920
[Guest]: All of these are core interests which lead to a more fundamental core interest, if you

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:53.640
[Guest]: may, and that is the stability and the continuation of the rule of the Communist Party of China.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.800
[Guest]: That is a predominant interest of the party, is for the system to survive.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.480
[Guest]: So under Xi Jinping, he's built on that.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.900
[Guest]: And you would see the idea of the Belt and Road.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.200
[Guest]: You would see the idea of global governance reforms.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:14.120
[Guest]: All of these being part of China's core interests, sort of accumulating within China's core interests,

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.360
[Guest]: because it's through these that China becomes a bigger actor internationally, and it also

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.040
[Guest]: secures itself.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.200
[Guest]: So that's where I would define the broad set of interests that the Chinese have.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.040
[Amit Varma]: So you sort of spoke about the focus then being on these three areas, that is, China

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.680
[Amit Varma]: continues developing, China looks after its territorial interests, whether it's in Tibet

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:41.320
[Amit Varma]: or the South China Sea or wherever, and also the third one being broader economic security.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.920
[Amit Varma]: But one interesting thing you said, which sort of intrigued me is that, and I hope I

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.640
[Amit Varma]: understood it correctly, is that the reason for this is because Xi Jinping feels that

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.680
[Amit Varma]: the party has to continue structurally being the entity in charge in China.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.080
[Amit Varma]: And the one thing that ensures that is if China itself is secure and stable within the

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.080
[Amit Varma]: world.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.540
[Amit Varma]: So in that sense, all of these are a means to the end with the end being the continuation

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.240
[Amit Varma]: of the party in power.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.880
[Amit Varma]: Did I understand it correctly?

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.560
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:19.760
[Guest]: So if you read through Xi Jinping's speeches and government documents, what you will find

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.920
[Guest]: is that, and this was specifically noted by Xi in the 19th Party Congress, which is this

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.320
[Guest]: meeting that happens once every five years.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.960
[Guest]: It elects a new Politburo, a new Politburo Standing Committee, which are your central

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.640
[Guest]: bodies that run the party, and also elects a new General Secretary every 10 years.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.280
[Guest]: So Xi Jinping this year started his second term as the General Secretary of the Communist

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280
[Guest]: Party.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.360
[Guest]: So at this important meeting, which happened in October last year, Xi Jinping delivered

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.720
[Guest]: a very long speech.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.920
[Guest]: It was, I think, about three and a half hours long.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.080
[Guest]: And one of the central ideas of the speech was the concept that the party has to have

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.440
[Guest]: a say in every sphere of society in life.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.260
[Guest]: The party must penetrate everything.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.520
[Guest]: From there, Xi Jinping went on in March, where he became the president for the second time.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.120
[Guest]: And again, at that meeting, he delivered a speech, which was mercifully just 30 odd minutes

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.360
[Guest]: long.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.200
[Guest]: And in that speech, he reiterates these points.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.600
[Guest]: And thereafter, there is a reorganization of government, where the party is further

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.840
[Guest]: merged with the government.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.840
[Guest]: So this ensures that the party survives, the party begins to further cannibalize government

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.960
[Guest]: and state institutions.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.640
[Guest]: And that's one of those fundamental goals, whether it's domestically or internationally,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.520
[Guest]: the survival of the party is a precondition for anything else to happen.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And this reminds me of the old slogan we had in India back in the good old days, I say

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.120
[Amit Varma]: ironically.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.840
[Amit Varma]: India is Indira, Indira is India.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.520
[Amit Varma]: And here it would seem there are sort of two relevant slogans, one, of course, being that

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.920
[Amit Varma]: China is the party, the party is China.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.320
[Amit Varma]: And the other could even be that Xi is a party, the party is Xi, because in a sense, what

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.200
[Amit Varma]: Xi has also been trying to do, and again, correct me if I've misunderstood it, is consolidate

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:16.000
[Amit Varma]: his own hold of the party, even as the party consolidates its dominance over Chinese institutions.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Is that correct?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.120
[Guest]: No, that's absolutely correct.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.280
[Guest]: And so much of Xi Jinping's first five years in power, I mean, he came into power in late

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.000
[Guest]: 2012, became the president in March 2013.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.400
[Guest]: And what he's done is that he's structurally broken down networks of patronage in the name

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.480
[Guest]: of fighting corruption.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:45.240
[Guest]: And he's also used that anti-corruption campaign to eliminate rivals, target rival factions,

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:52.560
[Guest]: streamline government processes, place confidence in key positions, and centralise the entire

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.920
[Guest]: decision making apparatus further.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.280
[Guest]: Now, this might sound quite odd to a lot of people who generally look at China from the

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.280
[Guest]: news and view the Communist Party as this one uniform actor.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.360
[Guest]: It's quite a divided actor in some ways.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.640
[Guest]: And decision making can get paralysed at multiple levels.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.480
[Guest]: And that's evident from the fact that Xi's had to look to centralise so much authority

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.600
[Guest]: in order to ensure that decisions are taken and executed.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.600
[Guest]: So he's done that.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.600
[Guest]: And that's resulted in this.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.740
[Guest]: I mean, the culmination of all of this was the removal of presidential term limits in

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:34.040
[Guest]: March this year, where now Xi Jinping effectively can remain president for life if he wants

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.120
[Guest]: to.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.960
[Guest]: So he has, yes, centralised the party, he's renamed, he's got his name entered in the

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:48.080
[Guest]: constitution of the country with his banner idea, which is Xi Jinping thought.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:54.800
[Guest]: So that's now a part of the Communist Party and the Chinese state's constitution.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.240
[Guest]: And that's a guiding vision now for the state.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:03.240
[Guest]: So he's elevated himself to a position which is only, if not equal to, then probably secondary

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.740
[Guest]: to Mao, because it's very difficult to be equal to Mao.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.040
[Guest]: But he's gotten himself to a position like that.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.420
[Guest]: And so yeah, it has become that the party has become Xi Jinping's party.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.800
[Guest]: The other idea that you spoke about, which was the party being China and China being

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.980
[Guest]: the party, I think the Communist Party would like for people to think that way.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.280
[Guest]: But we must remember that the Communist Party of China has about 90 million members at the

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.960
[Guest]: max.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.680
[Guest]: And China is a far more diverse, far more vibrant country in that sense.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:43.600
[Guest]: There is a lot of different views and opinions that are expressed, and the party remains

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.680
[Guest]: this firm actor, which would like the image internationally to be that China is the party

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.180
[Guest]: and the party is China.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.680
[Guest]: But China is far more diverse than that.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.320
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, are there other actors on the political stage, for example, apart from the

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.320
[Amit Varma]: party?

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, China's not a democracy, the party basically rules it, right?

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.040
[Guest]: Yes, it does.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040
[Guest]: It does rule it.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.880
[Guest]: But when I say that China is very diverse, it's not necessarily in the context of formal

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.240
[Guest]: political activity.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.040
[Guest]: Because yes, you have eight other political parties that operate within China.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.240
[Guest]: They operate under the guiding hand of the Communist Party of China.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.040
[Guest]: So they don't effectively have any autonomy.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.120
[Guest]: They don't really contest elections.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.360
[Guest]: Elections in China occur at certain levels, at the village level.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.800
[Guest]: Those are experiments that are being conducted.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.680
[Guest]: But predominantly, the political system is run through the party system.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.360
[Guest]: So the party has a parallel system from center to provinces and further down to the state

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.000
[Guest]: system of central government, provincial government and further down.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.200
[Guest]: And these two systems intermingle with each other.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.480
[Guest]: So there isn't any room for other political actors to actually play any meaningful role.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.160
[Guest]: But when I say that China is far more diverse, it's because not everybody necessarily, or

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:02.320
[Guest]: at least a large majority, don't necessarily recognize the party as necessarily this guiding

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.320
[Guest]: light, this force.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.720
[Guest]: They see the party as an important actor, but they also see themselves as distinct from

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720
[Guest]: the party.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.360
[Guest]: A lot of people would like freedom of expression, a lot of people would like freedom of association.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.240
[Guest]: And so therefore, I don't see necessarily this connect.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.360
[Guest]: A lot of people would have a different perspective from the party in terms of how the politics

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.760
[Guest]: should be run.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.880
[Guest]: But it's also about where your interest lies.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.920
[Guest]: Can you actually append the order?

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.880
[Guest]: Does appending the orders serve your interests?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.560
[Guest]: So there are multiple factors at play.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.960
[Guest]: But as a society, if you visit China, what you realize is that there are multiple different

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.560
[Guest]: thoughts.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:45.640
[Guest]: And the party's single ideological notions don't necessarily run through society.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.320
[Guest]: It's not a society which has stopped thinking.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320
[Guest]: It's not North Korea.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:55.520
[Amit Varma]: Right, so my sort of follow up question to that is, you had mentioned Xi's sort of formulation

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:02.520
[Amit Varma]: of quote unquote, a new era, which is the sort of outward looking foreign policy.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, is that something that has come from Xi himself or was that part of a developing

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.360
[Amit Varma]: consensus within the party?

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.280
[Amit Varma]: And was it at some point inevitable that China would move in this direction?

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.460
[Guest]: Okay, that's a good question.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:22.560
[Guest]: So a lot of this talk of the new era, okay, then the nomenclature for the new era comes

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.160
[Guest]: under Xi Jinping.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:31.660
[Guest]: But you can see a shift that's happening in Chinese foreign policy from around 2008 onwards.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.480
[Guest]: And this coincides with this financial crisis around the world, with the West struggling

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.120
[Guest]: with its banking system.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.920
[Guest]: And you see, the Chinese essentially adopt a far more aggressive or assertive approach

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.080
[Guest]: in their foreign relations.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.080
[Guest]: This manifests in the South China Sea.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.040
[Guest]: This manifests in a remarkable conversation between a Chinese delegation and an American

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:05.320
[Guest]: delegation, where the Chinese delegation essentially tells the American delegation, responding

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.360
[Guest]: to the credit crisis that's developed in 2008, that there was a point where you were our

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.920
[Guest]: masters and you were our teachers.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920
[Guest]: I think the word was teachers.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.800
[Guest]: Yeah, that you were our teachers when it came to the economy.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.400
[Guest]: But today you failed, and we will have to find our own course, something to that effect.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.060
[Guest]: So there's a departure that starts to take place from that point of time.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.880
[Guest]: And that departure is witnessed in this assertion in the South China Sea, with regard to an

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.440
[Guest]: oil rig with Vietnam, with regard to the Scarborough Shoal, in the context of the China-Philippines

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.920
[Guest]: spat in the South China Sea.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:45.240
[Guest]: In 2011-2012, we start seeing tensions with Japan in the East China Sea.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.760
[Guest]: So you start to see this shift happening at that point of time.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:57.880
[Guest]: And the perception is that there is an opportunity right now for us to express ourselves, because

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.720
[Guest]: there is serious turmoil around the world.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.160
[Guest]: And you can see that America is on a decline.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.280
[Guest]: And this credit crisis is precipitating that decline further.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.520
[Guest]: So you see that sort of conversation happening within China.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.320
[Guest]: And in that milieu is when Xi Jinping comes to power.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.480
[Guest]: And so there are these two philosophical arguments that are happening when Xi Jinping comes to

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.520
[Guest]: power.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.400
[Guest]: So there are these two philosophical concepts.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.960
[Guest]: The first is the Deng Xiaoping concept of Tao Kuang Yang Hui, which I spoke about earlier.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.280
[Guest]: And the second is this more assertive concept called Fen Fai You Wei.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:39.640
[Guest]: Fen Fai You Wei essentially translates into striving for achievement.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:46.960
[Guest]: That concept essentially implies that you need to actively shape the international or

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.860
[Guest]: the external environment to suit your interests.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:55.800
[Guest]: So that implies a certain assertion in your foreign policy, as opposed to trying to keep

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.360
[Guest]: a low profile and taking advantage of scenarios as and when they arrive to serve your interests.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.280
[Guest]: And so there is this sort of shift that begins to happen.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.960
[Guest]: Under Xi Jinping, what we see is that we see this get crystallized into a clearer vision.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.640
[Guest]: The idea of a new era, the idea of Belt and Road and China actively going global.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:21.200
[Guest]: The idea that China is going to invite countries over and political parties over to Beijing

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.480
[Guest]: to shape a discourse on human rights, which is something that the West has dominated.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.800
[Guest]: The idea that China wants to reshape governance norms, whether it's related to artificial

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.240
[Guest]: intelligence, whether it's related to human rights, whether it's related to lending.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.880
[Guest]: So it's these sorts of things that start to happen.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:45.120
[Guest]: So I would trace this sort of shift in foreign policy starting from about 2008 onwards.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.720
[Guest]: And under Xi Jinping, it gets crystallized further, it becomes far more public, and China

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.200
[Guest]: becomes far more vocal about it.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.440
[Guest]: So that's how I would categorize it.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.120
[Amit Varma]: And what you described as this striving for achievement, how does it manifest itself?

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.200
[Amit Varma]: For example, how is Chinese foreign policy today?

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:09.400
[Amit Varma]: What are the salient ways in which it is different from Chinese foreign policy of say, 1995?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.400
[Guest]: So okay, how is it different?

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.800
[Guest]: It's different, firstly, in terms of what is the narrative that is being projected.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.200
[Guest]: So the narrative today that is being projected is one of China as an innovative, leading

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.760
[Guest]: world power, as opposed to the 1990s, and even through the 2000s, where the narrative

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.320
[Guest]: was essentially about China, a developing power, a developing state, which is eyeing

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.240
[Guest]: a peaceful rise or which is eyeing peaceful development.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.740
[Guest]: So there is a narrative shift that happens.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:43.260
[Guest]: If you look at that in the context of how China now looks at providing aid, providing

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:49.760
[Guest]: investments to countries, as opposed to wanting to be a recipient of aid and investment.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.040
[Guest]: So those are sort of few tangible ways where this happens.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.160
[Guest]: It also happens in the context of expanding military to military engagement.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.700
[Guest]: China wants to sell weapons, it wants to sell its arms, it wants to build up this defense

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.680
[Guest]: industrial base.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.640
[Guest]: So from projection to actual changes in these financial support to countries, investment,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:12.080
[Guest]: arms sales, the essentially the opening up and going abroad and actually projecting the

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.280
[Guest]: power that you now have built up over time.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.680
[Amit Varma]: That's the change that happens.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.960
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to want to drill down on that in some more detail, but let's take a quick

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.840
[Amit Varma]: commercial break first.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.960
[Unknown]: So it's been another great week on IVM podcast, if you're not following us on social media,

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.960
[Unknown]: please do.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.640
[Unknown]: We're IVM podcast on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.500
[Unknown]: Last week, we launched a new podcast called the kinetic living podcast with Urmi Kothari.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.040
[Unknown]: It's a show about keeping fit both physically and mentally.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.680
[Unknown]: Listen to our conversation with some of the most interesting people and how they went

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.680
[Unknown]: on their fitness journeys.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.720
[Unknown]: On Cyrus Says this week, Cyrus speaks to Nihal Mariwala, co-founder of Setu India.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.880
[Unknown]: They speak about health culture in this country.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.400
[Unknown]: On Colaba Cartel, I'm joined by Gauri, Jai, Abhishek and Sumit who reveal how they came

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.900
[Unknown]: up with the concept for the new restaurant Misty.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.520
[Unknown]: On Geekfruit this week, Tejas and Dinkar discuss all things in pop culture that are so bad,

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.120
[Unknown]: they're hilariously good.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.360
[Unknown]: This week on Shunya One, Sheila Ditya speaks to Nitya Sharma from Simple.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.080
[Unknown]: That's the sign you see every time you have to enter the OTP for your payments on the

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080
[Unknown]: apps that you use.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.200
[Unknown]: On the scene and the unseen, Amit Verma speaks to journalist and China expert Manoj K. Varumani

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.520
[Unknown]: to dissect China's foreign policy and its impact on India.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.040
[Unknown]: And with that, let's continue with your show.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen, Manoj.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960
[Amit Varma]: Thank you, Amit.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:25.080
[Amit Varma]: So we were sort of talking about this fundamental change that, you know, happened between the

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.120
[Amit Varma]: era of Deng and the era of Xi, the era of Deng basically being hide your strengths and

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:35.560
[Amit Varma]: bide your time as, as you put it, which China was content to sort of focus on its own internal

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.000
[Amit Varma]: development and not worry so much about the rest of the world.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.800
[Amit Varma]: And Xi's formulation, which, as you pointed out, is something that was happening anyway,

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.760
[Amit Varma]: and it's not necessarily dependent on his person, was that of a new era where China

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:57.360
[Amit Varma]: takes a much more active role in world affairs, where it tries to sort of sustain its development,

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:05.080
[Amit Varma]: be more aggressive about its territorial integrity, and search for broader economic security,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.080
[Amit Varma]: and get more involved in the world, whether it's in terms of, you know, investing in other

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:14.240
[Amit Varma]: countries around the world, including Africa recently, as you wrote about, on Pragati,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.240
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.240
[Amit Varma]: And all this is very interesting, because this is happening at a time where like you

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:26.000
[Amit Varma]: refer to the financial crisis of 2008, as sort of one of those points where something

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.000
[Amit Varma]: began to turn, or maybe when it became visible, where America sort of losing its grip as a

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.240
[Amit Varma]: sole superpower of the world.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.640
[Amit Varma]: And especially now that, you know, Donald Trump has come on the scene, and he's starting

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.360
[Amit Varma]: these trade wars, and so on and so forth.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:48.440
[Amit Varma]: So how has the US, like earlier, for example, the US was content to do its thing and the

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.840
[Amit Varma]: China was content to do its thing and sort of build itself while America did what it

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.400
[Amit Varma]: did and rule the world.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And now it's almost like, would it be fair to say, number one, that it's bipolar and

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:05.960
[Amit Varma]: number two, that China is actively trying to be the one big player on the block?

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:12.080
[Guest]: I wouldn't categorize what's happening right now as bipolarity or a shift towards bipolarity.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:19.080
[Guest]: I think a lot of Chinese analysts would like to believe that bipolarity is inevitable.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.320
[Guest]: But I wouldn't categorize it as that right now.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:28.200
[Guest]: What I would say is that what's more inevitable is what's more probable, what's more inevitable,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:36.440
[Guest]: what's more probable is the idea of multipolarity with multiple power centers, whether it's

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:43.080
[Guest]: the US, whether it's India, China, Russia, the European Union, probably South Africa,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080
[Guest]: probably Brazil.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:50.320
[Guest]: So you have multiple power centers that will emerge, each with their own capacity to project

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.920
[Guest]: power, whether it's economic, military power, hard power, soft power, economic.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.160
[Guest]: So that's how I would see, that's the way I see the world go, that's direction in which

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.560
[Guest]: I see the world going in.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.000
[Guest]: And that would lead to some interesting combinations among states.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.160
[Guest]: But as far as this notion that there would be bipolarity in the Chinese, the party is

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:21.600
[Guest]: looking at this as an opportunity to somewhere replace the US as a leading global power eventually.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.960
[Guest]: You will see literature coming out of China which argues that, and which argues that is

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.120
[Guest]: inevitable.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.980
[Guest]: But my sense is that if you just look at capacities at the moment, you will see that the Chinese

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:39.840
[Guest]: don't necessarily have the hard power capacity to project power around the world, even in

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.920
[Guest]: their region, which is East Asia.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:50.380
[Guest]: Their capacities are limited just by geography, just by US alliance systems.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.280
[Guest]: So there's a lot that needs to change for some of this bipolarity or any of this to

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.720
[Guest]: come about.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.040
[Guest]: That's how I would view it.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.040
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.480
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the dissonances I've always felt between economics and geopolitics,

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.480
[Amit Varma]: and obviously, I know the former much better than I understand the latter, is that economics

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.040
[Amit Varma]: is fundamentally positive somewhere, you know, two parties interact, and both of them can

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040
[Amit Varma]: benefit.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:19.720
[Amit Varma]: And geopolitics often plays out like a zero sum game, where, you know, there's a lot of

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.840
[Amit Varma]: one upmanship, and there's a lot of zero sum thinking.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.400
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, with Trump becoming the president in the US, Trump is clearly a zero sum thinker.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's the reason he started these trade wars, because he foolishly assumes that

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.520
[Amit Varma]: a trade deficit is a bad thing.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, if there's a winner, there must be a loser.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.360
[Amit Varma]: And if there's a trade deficit, the US must be a loser, and so on and so forth.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.200
[Amit Varma]: And that's, that's obviously very fundamentally flawed thinking, but we can say that, okay,

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.420
[Amit Varma]: Trump is an aberration.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.600
[Amit Varma]: But how does the Chinese view it?

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Do they view it in positive some terms, in the sense that, look, we just need to expand

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.680
[Amit Varma]: our trade everywhere, and everybody's benefiting, and that's fine, as long as, you know, we

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.520
[Amit Varma]: are stronger, or do they also have a little bit of the zero sum sense where other people

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.320
[Amit Varma]: have to be outwitted, and they have to establish their dominance?

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:13.160
[Guest]: I think that the Chinese, if you look at the rhetoric, you will see the Chinese being very

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.480
[Guest]: critical of the idea of zero sum politics.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.320
[Guest]: They will essentially repeatedly, if you look at Chinese diplomatic communication, they'll

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:27.320
[Guest]: be talking about the fact that zero sum thinking is Cold War mentality, and the world has moved

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.120
[Guest]: way past the Cold War.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.000
[Guest]: And we need to get beyond this, we need to look at win-win diplomacy, we need to look

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.400
[Guest]: at building a community of common destiny for all of mankind.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.640
[Guest]: All of this is fine rhetoric, but it doesn't necessarily translate into as idealistic a

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.440
[Guest]: vision of the world in terms of practice.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.760
[Guest]: So in terms of practice, how the Chinese go about it is, fundamentally, my interests need

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.080
[Guest]: to be taken care of.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.720
[Guest]: But yes, that does not necessarily mean that you need to be damaged, which is zero sum

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.320
[Guest]: mentality, which is what Trump is doing when he's saying that our relationship is a transaction,

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.240
[Guest]: I need to win every deal.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:10.240
[Guest]: The Chinese view it as, can I serve my interests while also getting you something that you

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.240
[Guest]: want, which is their approach in Africa.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.960
[Guest]: And just an example of that approach I'll give you, last week when Xi Jinping was in

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:25.200
[Guest]: Africa and when he visited Rwanda, there was a quote by the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.360
[Guest]: where he talks about how China relates to Africa as an equal.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.440
[Guest]: He says, we see ourselves as people on the road to prosperity.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.720
[Guest]: China's actions demonstrate that you see us the same way.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:43.080
[Guest]: This is a revolutionary posture in world affairs, and it is much more important, much more precious

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.520
[Guest]: than money.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.360
[Guest]: So you can see that there is an approach with China, which is not necessarily zero sum.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.480
[Guest]: It's willing to play the game, it's willing to bargain, it's willing to trade off, provided

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.160
[Guest]: that its core interests are met.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.800
[Guest]: And that's something that America under Trump is not doing so well.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.440
[Guest]: So that's how I would characterize China's approach, which is that I have a certain set

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:09.320
[Guest]: of core interests, any engagement needs to make sure that those core interests are met.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.640
[Guest]: Within those boundaries, I can work with you.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And that actually sounds eminently sensible.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.960
[Amit Varma]: And so I'm going to ask you to sort of take a step back from description to prescription,

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.480
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that if you then have to look at China's foreign policy as an expert, what

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.980
[Amit Varma]: would you do differently?

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.280
[Amit Varma]: Is there any reason for the approach to be different?

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Or does this all make spectacularly good sense to you?

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.280
[Guest]: I think it makes really good sense.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.760
[Guest]: I think it makes really good sense.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:43.320
[Guest]: I think the errors that the Chinese have made in the last few years have been this error

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:50.200
[Guest]: of assertion, this error of announcing themselves as a great power, as a big power, before they

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.520
[Guest]: actually have got the kind of capacity that you need to be a great or a big power.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.800
[Guest]: And you can see that manifesting in how the Chinese are now looking at scaling down some

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.520
[Guest]: of their rhetoric about, oh, we are not that innovative, we are not that technologically

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.400
[Guest]: advanced.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.200
[Guest]: So that rhetorical shift is what they are making.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.800
[Guest]: Because this announcement of China being this great power, which is going to play this leading

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.840
[Guest]: role in world affairs, which is once again wants to take the center stage in world affairs,

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.200
[Guest]: leaves you open to a lot of criticism about your domestic economy being highly shielded,

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.480
[Guest]: about access to your markets, about the problems that your investments are creating in other

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.480
[Guest]: countries.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.880
[Guest]: So I think rhetorically, those are the errors that they have made.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.680
[Guest]: Practically, what they need to do is they need to look at their own.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.680
[Guest]: If I was a Chinese analyst, if I was sitting in Beijing, what I would be advising the government

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:49.120
[Guest]: is that we need to fundamentally look at our debt issues, because our economy is perched

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.200
[Guest]: on a massive debt overhang, which we've been kicking this can down the road year after

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.200
[Guest]: year.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.720
[Guest]: Sooner or later, it's something that's going to come to bite.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.660
[Guest]: And this will damage us not just domestically, but also internationally.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:09.080
[Guest]: What happens to you when all these pledges of belt and road investments that you've made

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.180
[Guest]: are no longer doable because you're struggling with debt at home?

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:19.960
[Guest]: It completely undermines the idea of China as this pillar on which a new sort of global

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.920
[Guest]: economy can be built.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.680
[Guest]: So I'd somewhere pull back on the rhetoric.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.760
[Guest]: And I'd also try and look at structural issues domestically.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:37.880
[Guest]: The things that the Chinese have done right in the last few months or a year or so, is

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:43.760
[Guest]: that they've looked to soften their positions with regard to Japan, India.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:49.400
[Guest]: And despite all the conflict and confrontation with the Australians over issues of sharp

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:55.120
[Guest]: power and Chinese influence in domestic Australian politics, they have shown overtures where

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.720
[Guest]: they would like the Australians to work with them.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.920
[Guest]: So they've identified that there is a potential for countries to coalesce against us.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:09.400
[Guest]: And that's, again, a product of their policies, tangible policies in the South China Sea,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:14.240
[Guest]: but also a product of their rhetorical approach, which has been one of China has arrived and

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.240
[Guest]: China will do what it wants to do.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:22.800
[Guest]: And so the scaling down of the rhetoric, the reaching out to Japan, reaching out to India,

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.680
[Guest]: reaching out to Australia, looking to work with multiple actors, even though there are

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.760
[Guest]: political shifts in different countries, say Malaysia, which has just had an election.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.440
[Guest]: And the new leadership has blocked Chinese projects, but the Chinese haven't gone sour

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.440
[Guest]: on them.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.600
[Guest]: They've in fact reached out to them.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.000
[Guest]: The Chinese foreign minister was one of the first foreign ministers to travel and have

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.880
[Guest]: a conversation with the Malaysians.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.000
[Guest]: And it's quite likely that Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, would be visiting Beijing

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.580
[Guest]: soon this month.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.920
[Guest]: So you can see that the Chinese are looking at deeper engagement and softening their positions.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.160
[Guest]: And I think the biggest sort of giveaway that this is going to happen more in the coming

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.960
[Guest]: future is in the end of June, there was a Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference held

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.880
[Guest]: in Beijing.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.480
[Guest]: And Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference essentially is a conference where all the

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.540
[Guest]: senior most delegates of this party meet together and they debate, deliberate on foreign policy

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.720
[Guest]: and the agenda and how they should go about it.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.640
[Guest]: And this is just the second time that such a conference has happened in Xi Jinping's

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.720
[Guest]: tenure so far.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.120
[Guest]: And during this conference, they came up with a list of 10 points which characterize Xi

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.680
[Guest]: Jinping's thought on diplomacy.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:41.680
[Guest]: And the point of core interest was number nine, which indicates that they want to downgrade

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.560
[Guest]: a certain, their assertion.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.320
[Guest]: They want to make sure that this assertive attitude is not that significant going forward.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.200
[Guest]: And what was on the top, what was among the priority list was this idea of working with

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.780
[Guest]: countries, creating a shared community of common destiny.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:03.180
[Guest]: So all that signifies that you're going to be looking to reaching out to countries.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:09.000
[Guest]: You want to build partnerships because things around you are changing quite dramatically,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.300
[Guest]: largely owing to Trump.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:16.600
[Guest]: And so this is, I think they've adopted the right path, but it's just about have you gone

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.600
[Guest]: too far?

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.920
[Guest]: If you let the cat out of the bag already, can you put the genie back in the bottle?

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.520
[Guest]: I think that's the balance that the Chinese government needs to strike right now.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to ask you about the implications in this for India.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.480
[Amit Varma]: But before we go there, I was intrigued by the debt crisis that you mentioned and the

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.400
[Amit Varma]: fact that they need to do something about it.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.040
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense of what that debt crisis is, what is the worst case scenario in which

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.600
[Amit Varma]: it plays out?

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.560
[Amit Varma]: And what is it you would recommend that they do now to, you know, before things get worse?

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.760
[Guest]: OK, so I should preface this by saying that I'm not an economist and I know very little

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.680
[Guest]: about how economies function, but here's my broad sense.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.200
[Guest]: So why did the Chinese accumulate all this debt?

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:03.400
[Guest]: They accumulated all this debt is because they wanted to invest heavily at a point of

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.400
[Guest]: time.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.760
[Guest]: I'm going to go back to say about 2008 again, because again, that is one of those tipping

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.800
[Guest]: points where all this begins to happen.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.120
[Guest]: So in 2008, once the world economy is going through this cash crunch, this liquidity crunch,

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.600
[Guest]: the People's Bank, the Chinese Central Bank, announces a massive stimulus package.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:27.920
[Guest]: I can't remember the numbers, but it's hundreds of billions of dollars, a stimulus package

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.800
[Guest]: for the economy.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:36.800
[Guest]: And they hope that by stimulating investment, then you can create growth.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.800
[Guest]: And that's what they do.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.080
[Guest]: You have more and more states and provinces and local governments undertaking massive

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:48.360
[Guest]: infrastructure projects because there is all this cash now available.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.040
[Guest]: And all these infrastructure projects, you're not considering necessarily the economic viability

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.040
[Guest]: of these projects.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.080
[Guest]: I mean, are they going to lead to any productivity gain?

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.600
[Guest]: You're investing because that looks good on your GDP because you're constructing.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.160
[Guest]: And that's how growth continues for a significant amount of time.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.120
[Guest]: Throughout that period of time, the Chinese government is talking about wanting to shift

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.800
[Guest]: from export and investment driven growth to consumption driven growth.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.320
[Guest]: Now, we've got a domestic market, we need to stimulate consumption and investments are

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.160
[Guest]: being wasteful to a large degree.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.180
[Guest]: So we need to curtail this wasteful investment.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:30.280
[Guest]: So what starts to happen is that because the government at the center, somewhere it wants

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.320
[Guest]: to contain this investment, but it also needs to sustain growth.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.480
[Guest]: So there is this push and pull which is going on, during which period of time, a lot of

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:44.000
[Guest]: local governments, a lot of companies are piling on massive amounts of debt.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.560
[Guest]: Because at the end of the day, for a local mayor like me, if I'm the mayor of a city

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.760
[Guest]: like Tianjin, bureaucratically, my progression up the ladder in the Chinese system is dependent

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.920
[Guest]: on how I deliver on these material goals.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.800
[Guest]: And if I'm supposed to meet 9% growth, 10% growth, I will take on the debt to meet that

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800
[Guest]: growth.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.680
[Guest]: And eventually those massive projects, whether it is a metro project or a massive park or

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.160
[Guest]: a massive housing system, that's going to be looked after by somebody else.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.200
[Guest]: Because in a couple of years time, I'm going to move on to a different job.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.140
[Guest]: So this is somebody else's problem who comes after me.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:22.820
[Guest]: So that's how the system has piled on this massive amounts of debt largely.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.120
[Guest]: At present, Xi Jinping has been talking about deleveraging for the last few years.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.320
[Guest]: He wants, he realizes that there's a lot of unnecessary debt that's been picked up, whether

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.800
[Guest]: it's in infrastructure, whether it's in things called zombie companies, which are essentially

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.960
[Guest]: companies which are no longer profitable, but are propped up by state subsidies.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.360
[Guest]: And he wants to curtail all of this.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.800
[Guest]: He wants to rein in this level of debt.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:52.880
[Guest]: But the problem is that the more you strip the cash flow in the economy, it's not just

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880
[Guest]: going to slow down.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.600
[Guest]: It's also going to lead to companies shutting down, job losses, and that's going to lead

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.360
[Guest]: to instability.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.720
[Guest]: So how do you balance that push and pull between stability, growth, and wanting to have more

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.400
[Guest]: productive growth?

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.160
[Guest]: So that's broadly the nature of the beast at the moment.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.160
[Amit Varma]: That's incredibly fascinating.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.480
[Amit Varma]: And it sounds to me very similar to how the US financial crisis happened in terms of it

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.120
[Amit Varma]: being enabled by easy money and bad incentives.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.600
[Amit Varma]: But you know, moving on from the economics and back to the foreign policy, India's always

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.040
[Amit Varma]: had a sort of an iffy relationship with China.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.880
[Amit Varma]: We've lost a war to them, we've kind of, you know, been wary of them, we have an ongoing

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.640
[Amit Varma]: border dispute with them.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.160
[Amit Varma]: How does or how does China's new approach to its place in the world affect India?

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:46.320
[Guest]: You know, I want to answer this question with an anecdote to begin with.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.840
[Guest]: So I spent five years living in the mainland.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:57.280
[Guest]: And in those five years, anybody that I spoke to, whether it was from the media, or it was

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:03.560
[Guest]: from, you know, the ordinary sort of intelligentsia, the ordinary public, factory people, people

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.760
[Guest]: who are in manufacturing and across the sector, I found only a handful of people perhaps who

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.640
[Guest]: knew that there had been a war between India and China.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:19.320
[Guest]: It's not something that they've, it's not something that survived in public memory.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.920
[Guest]: And that's probably because the party has not wanted it to survive as much.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.360
[Guest]: Today, obviously, things are different, and that's because of the Doklam standoff last

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:35.160
[Guest]: year, where you had Chinese media being extremely critical of India, you had a lot of racist

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:44.400
[Guest]: content, you had content which called out India, which put out editorials from 1962.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.640
[Guest]: So the war essentially is now back in the memory, at least in public consciousness,

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.600
[Guest]: I presume people would know because I got a lot of messages from friends in China at

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:58.080
[Guest]: that point of time, saying that, oh, we didn't realize that this had happened, and that we

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.680
[Guest]: had a war in the past, and we hope that there's no more war in the future.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:08.040
[Guest]: So that's just an aside, an anecdote, that a lot of people in India, I mean, in India,

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.120
[Guest]: the war with China is so deep in within our conscience.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.800
[Guest]: But I don't think that's the same over there.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:21.000
[Guest]: It doesn't resonate similarly, in terms of how China sees India today, and what China's

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.760
[Guest]: new position in the world implies for India.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:36.160
[Guest]: So I think we can take what happened in Wuhan, as an example of China recognizing that India

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.360
[Guest]: is an important actor.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:44.600
[Guest]: I think we've seen this for the last two years, when India boycotted the Belt and Road Forum

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:53.240
[Guest]: in 2016, you saw that when we boycotted the Belt and Road Forum, there was a lot of talk

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:57.680
[Guest]: about India being the only country which had not attended this forum.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.000
[Guest]: And there was some degree of frustration from the Chinese point of view.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.480
[Guest]: But there was repeated attempt to try and get India on board by talking about CPEC being

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.320
[Guest]: a development initiative, and China's position on Kashmir does not change, and so on and

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.420
[Guest]: so forth.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:19.720
[Guest]: And thereafter, after the Doklam standoff, this accommodation by both parties, which

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:26.520
[Guest]: began at the meeting in Xiamen and BRICS in September last year, and then has further

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:33.440
[Guest]: gone on to Wuhan and thereafter, I think the Chinese see value in working with India.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.480
[Guest]: They know that India is geographically well placed.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:42.120
[Guest]: If Belt and Road in South Asia has to yield some degree of success, a measure of success

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.440
[Guest]: in India, you need to get India on board.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:51.360
[Guest]: India is also a massive market for infrastructure investment, for Chinese companies to set up

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.160
[Guest]: manufacturing bases, there's lots that the Chinese can do in India.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.160
[Guest]: And so I think that there is a sense that India can be a partner.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:07.520
[Guest]: But along with that, there is also this suspicion that persists with regards to India's relationship

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.520
[Guest]: with the West.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.600
[Guest]: Again, I don't think that the Chinese see the world necessarily as a zero-sum game,

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:20.420
[Guest]: but they are fundamentally cautious about the idea of India, the US, Australia, Japan,

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:25.200
[Guest]: this idea of these democracies coalescing together to contain China.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:32.560
[Guest]: So they see India as a possible spoke in the US alliance network, the US alliance wheel,

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.760
[Guest]: and they see that as a possible occurrence.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.560
[Guest]: So therefore, I feel that there is this sense of that we need to engage with India.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.200
[Guest]: And Wuhan was that example where there was, it was not just the Indian side which wanted

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:50.560
[Guest]: to engage, but it was also the Chinese who wanted to engage and who saw merit in working

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.560
[Guest]: together.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.400
[Guest]: So I feel that there is actually opportunities going forward.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.560
[Amit Varma]: So can you explain Wuhan to me because I don't know much about what happened there.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:05.380
[Guest]: Okay, so this was basically, it came as a bit of a surprise.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.800
[Guest]: So Narendra Modi, after the Doklam standoff, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indian Prime

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:14.440
[Guest]: Minister, he traveled to Xiamen in September last year, which is a city in Southeast China.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.680
[Guest]: He traveled over there for the BRICS summit.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:23.320
[Guest]: At that summit, from what we understand, there was a, there was sort of a breaking of the

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:31.400
[Guest]: ice and Xi Jinping and Modi spoke and there was feelers put out of having a broader conversation

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.280
[Guest]: that led to more diplomatic activity with the Chinese foreign minister visiting New

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.880
[Guest]: Delhi in December and talks again, beginning on the boundary issue.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.760
[Guest]: And that graduated in February this year, we had Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale go

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:51.880
[Guest]: to China and that set up again a framework of what sort of conversation we need to have.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:58.200
[Guest]: And that essentially led to this meeting in Wuhan between Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:03.240
[Guest]: And the idea was that it's a two day summit, it's informal, it's unstructured, we're not

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:09.080
[Guest]: necessarily going to be talking about specific issues and identifying specific outcomes that

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.080
[Guest]: we need to come up with.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.720
[Guest]: We're going to have this broad based conversation about what are your interests?

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.720
[Guest]: What are our interests?

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.280
[Guest]: How can we work together?

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:22.040
[Guest]: How can we prevent potential conflict like situations erupting?

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.160
[Guest]: Because last year at Doklam, we ended up in a position where there was a lot of talk of

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:32.200
[Guest]: war and there was a lot of jingoism, largely from the Chinese side, actually, the Indian

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.600
[Guest]: side was very restrained.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:40.080
[Guest]: So Wuhan was this opportunity for these two leaders to sit down together and say, look,

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.340
[Guest]: there are dramatic changes happening in the world.

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:48.640
[Guest]: At the end of the day, we're neighbors, we're growing economies, we have converging interests,

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.080
[Guest]: and we need to engage, we can't end up in some of these binaries.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:57.240
[Guest]: That's the broad narrative that's been put out by both sides.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:01.560
[Guest]: And since then, we've seen deeper engagement between the two countries.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:07.080
[Guest]: What I mean by deeper engagement is that they're going to resume bilateral military exercises

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.560
[Guest]: this year, India will be participating in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's military

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:18.320
[Guest]: exercises along with China and Pakistan, India has been probably a little more restrained

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.400
[Guest]: in terms of its criticism of Belt and Road.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.240
[Guest]: There are some analysts who would say that India has also scaled down its activity with

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.520
[Guest]: the quadrilateral group, which is the US, Australia, Japan and India.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.000
[Guest]: I don't necessarily subscribe to that.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.360
[Guest]: But yeah, you can see that in terms of public rhetoric, there has been a general shift in

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:44.200
[Guest]: India's position where we're not necessarily being that critical, while we are keeping

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:51.760
[Guest]: our fundamental oppositions to BRI, whether it be with related to CPEC or debt, still

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.760
[Guest]: out there.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:58.440
[Guest]: But we're not necessarily going out proselytizing or telling people that this is a real problem.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.800
[Guest]: So I think there's a broad understanding that's been arrived at between the two sides that

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.720
[Guest]: we need to maintain peace at the border, we need to look at our common interests, and

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.000
[Guest]: we need to work on them.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:14.480
[Guest]: One of the tangible outcomes of that Wuhan meeting was this idea that India does not

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:21.520
[Guest]: need to look at China's engagement within South Asia with a lens of suspicion.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:29.320
[Guest]: So the Chinese have proposed this model called India-China Plus or India-China X, under which

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.080
[Guest]: they want India and China to work together in a third country, carry out joint projects

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.680
[Guest]: in a third country.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:39.640
[Guest]: And the first country that they've announced for this is Afghanistan.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.960
[Guest]: It's still not clear what exactly this joint project will be.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:47.640
[Guest]: But what we know as of now is that there will be a joint capacity building project.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.960
[Guest]: We're not still clear on the details of when that will happen, what that project is going

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.080
[Guest]: to be.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:58.240
[Guest]: But the idea is you've set about a framework of working together as opposed to looking

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.360
[Guest]: at each other's actions with suspicion.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.360
[Amit Varma]: All of that is very heartening.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:07.280
[Amit Varma]: But I want to go back to a phrase you used a little earlier when you spoke about China's

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.720
[Amit Varma]: attitude to China's position on Kashmir.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:16.760
[Amit Varma]: And you know, there's also been the sense that China is sort of exploring deeper engagement

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.960
[Amit Varma]: with Pakistan and helping them in their conflict with us.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:26.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, is that sort of a historical artifact of how the world used to be a while ago, or

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.680
[Guest]: are they hedging?

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.280
[Guest]: Okay, so that's a good question.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:36.200
[Guest]: I would see the China-Pakistan relationship, yes, of course, it has implications for India,

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.680
[Guest]: but I would see it also as independent of India.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.760
[Guest]: The China-Pakistan relationship is very deep.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:50.480
[Guest]: It's deep political engagement, it's deep economic engagement, it's deep military engagement.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.440
[Guest]: There is a strategic relationship between these two sides, and which at some level has

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.920
[Guest]: implications for India, serious implications for India, but it's also independent.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.520
[Guest]: So CPEC is an example of how it's independent of India.

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:10.560
[Guest]: I personally don't see CPEC as something that is targeted at India.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:15.600
[Guest]: The Chinese could have managed CPEC better, the routing particularly, and they could have

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.280
[Amit Varma]: managed to avoid some of these.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.720
[Amit Varma]: Just expand on what CPEC is.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:24.880
[Guest]: So CPEC is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is this massive corridor which begins

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:31.240
[Guest]: in Xinjiang in China, and goes all the way down to Gwadar in Pakistan.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:40.000
[Guest]: This is going to be Chinese investments in building roads, bridges, rail networks, ports,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.840
[Guest]: free trade zones.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.480
[Guest]: So it's part of the broader Belt and Road Strategy.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:53.240
[Guest]: As far as we know, the pledged investment is around $60 billion, and CPEC should be

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.260
[Guest]: completed, the time range for this is till 2030.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:03.560
[Guest]: So it's over a period of 14-15 years is when the Chinese see this as being completed.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.720
[Guest]: So the idea is to essentially support the Pakistanis in terms of building all this infrastructure

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:13.480
[Guest]: and facilities for them, and also gain, sort of deepen their own economic footprint within

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.480
[Guest]: Pakistan.

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:21.600
[Guest]: So the India component of this obviously comes from the fact that part of the CPEC route

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:26.880
[Guest]: runs through what is Pakistani-occupied Kashmir.

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:32.280
[Guest]: And so that's where India's objections primarily are that, well, this is impinging on our sovereignty

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.720
[Guest]: because all of Kashmir is an integral part of India.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.160
[Guest]: And the Chinese say, well, look, don't look at this as a political issue, this is purely

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:49.600
[Guest]: a development project, which is, I mean, that's an argument that has weak legs to stand on.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.840
[Guest]: I mean, the Chinese would not allow anybody else to build in an area that they claim as

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.440
[Guest]: theirs, but take it for what it is.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.360
[Guest]: So that's what CPEC is.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:05.560
[Guest]: So I would say the Pakistani-Chinese relationship is far broader because today, Pakistan, if

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.360
[Guest]: you look at Pakistani politics today in the state of the army, Pakistan's fracture of

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:17.080
[Guest]: its relationship with the US, China has become an important patron for the Pakistanis.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.760
[Guest]: It's always been an important partner, but today it's become a patron.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.880
[Guest]: So that's how I would classify that.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:31.200
[Guest]: Now what deeper Chinese engagement with Pakistan does is that it also raises the stakes for

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:37.800
[Guest]: China to ensure stability in Pakistan and also stability between India and Pakistan.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:42.320
[Guest]: So there's an interesting dynamic that comes into play where China now becomes an actor

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:51.360
[Guest]: that has legitimate interest in averting conflict between these two rival states in some way.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:56.440
[Guest]: So to me, that's the concept, that's the idea that's interesting in all of this, is that

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:01.440
[Guest]: it raises China's stakes to ensure stability.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:07.960
[Guest]: And if China does gain the kind of leverage that we imagine that it has, that Indians

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:13.400
[Guest]: imagine that it has, that China has deep say in Pakistan, it actually can motivate policy

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.720
[Guest]: in Pakistan, I doubt all of that.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:22.940
[Guest]: But if the stakes get higher and the Chinese can develop levers and drivers to at least

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:30.080
[Guest]: shape policies in Pakistan, that can have massive implications for India and probably

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.640
[Guest]: even positive implications.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.560
[Amit Varma]: No, and positive implications, exactly.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.480
[Amit Varma]: Because just thinking aloud, you know, a couple of episodes back, your colleague Pranay Kotesane

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:45.000
[Amit Varma]: had done an episode with me on Pakistan, where he spoke about how there are basically two

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan's.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.160
[Amit Varma]: One is the military jihadi complex, which rules Pakistan and the other is basically

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:54.240
[Amit Varma]: the putative state of Pakistan, or you could say, the people of Pakistan, the civil society

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:59.840
[Amit Varma]: of Pakistan and economic development of the kind that China is clearly hoping to enable

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:04.880
[Amit Varma]: there would strengthen civil society vis-a-vis the military jihadi complex.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:11.040
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, it would increase the incentives of the military jihadi complex

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:16.240
[Amit Varma]: to sort of keep Pakistan stable and not enter into a conflict with India.

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:23.080
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, I mean, in that sense, a deepening Chinese involvement in Pakistan is something

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:27.240
[Amit Varma]: that could actually turn out pretty well for us contrary to rhetoric.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:32.360
[Amit Varma]: I've taken a lot of your time, I want to end by asking you a dual question that I ask all

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:39.280
[Amit Varma]: my guests on whatever the subject of the expertise is, that what makes you hopeful?

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And what makes you anxious about China's new direction in foreign policy?

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:50.160
[Guest]: Okay, what makes me hopeful is the, that's a good question.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:55.680
[Guest]: What makes me hopeful is the idea that there is a desire now, there has been reflection,

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.520
[Guest]: at least it appears so, that there has been some reflection and there has been a desire

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.760
[Guest]: to recast Chinese foreign policy as less aggressive.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:08.840
[Guest]: And the pressures that have come with this trade war have meant that there has been a

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:14.200
[Guest]: certain degree of rethink and a certain degree of imperative to actually open up China further.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:20.920
[Guest]: So there is hope that as China engages further, and as some of these pressures hit further,

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:26.680
[Guest]: China will act more responsibly, not just in terms of how it deals with conflicts, whether

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.920
[Guest]: it's on its periphery, or whether it's with regard to trade, or whether it's regard to

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.760
[Guest]: openness of markets.

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.160
[Guest]: So that is one thing that probably makes me hopeful is that if there is some degree of

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:45.120
[Guest]: rethink away from nationalistic rhetoric towards far more sane thought of how do we engage

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.960
[Guest]: far more pragmatic approach to what's happening in the world, that can actually lead to benefits

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:54.960
[Guest]: not just for China, but also for countries in the region, India, Japan, other Southeast

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.760
[Guest]: Asian countries.

00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:04.520
[Guest]: What makes me fearful is Xi Jinping's centralization of power, his centralization of power, the

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:10.800
[Guest]: building of a personality cult around him, which is sort of like one can reminisce, one

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.960
[Guest]: does reminisce.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:16.280
[Guest]: And if you read Chinese academics and authors who are writing today, who have dissenting

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:22.240
[Guest]: voices, and how some of these people are being silenced, there is a fear of China slipping

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:28.560
[Guest]: back into the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, we are still some way away from that.

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:32.440
[Guest]: But you're taking those first steps towards something like that.

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:39.360
[Guest]: And that's extremely dangerous, not just for people within China, but also for the broader

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.560
[Guest]: region.

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:46.520
[Guest]: Because China today is a driver of the global economy, and to see a state like that slip

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.840
[Guest]: into chaos has broader implications for people around the world.

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:54.320
[Amit Varma]: Manoj, the last one hour has been incredibly insightful.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.880
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us.

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.880
[Guest]: My pleasure.

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.880
[Guest]: This has been fun.

00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.400
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much, Amit.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:06.320
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to the show, do follow Manoj on Twitter at the China dude, all one

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.800
[Amit Varma]: word.

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Also consider signing up for his course, Inside Geeks China, which is an online course which
