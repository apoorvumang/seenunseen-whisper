[Unknown]: IVM

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.360
[Amit Varma]: Before we move on with this episode of the scene in the unseen do check out another awesome podcast from IVM podcast

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Cyrus says hosted by my old buddy Cyrus brocha

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.820
[Amit Varma]: One of the things few people would dispute is that at least half the potential of this great country of ours is wasted

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.700
[Amit Varma]: Women are treated like second-class citizens in India

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.240
[Amit Varma]: You've got to have your head in a hole in the sand if you deny this, but is that changing now?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.600
[Amit Varma]: We are part of a global village and we are exposed to Western and more progressive culture

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200
[Amit Varma]: We are empowered by technology and markets hell

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.280
[Amit Varma]: We're in the 21st century is going to take a long time for every woman in this country to truly gain autonomy and agency

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.680
[Amit Varma]: But are we at least moving in the right direction? I believe we are but sometimes I'm not so sure

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.680
[Amit Varma]: How do we even measure something like this?

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen our weekly podcast on economics politics and behavioral science, please. Welcome your host Amit Bhadma

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen today's episode arose out of a conversation

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.960
[Amit Varma]: I was having with my friend Devika Kher an economist who works at the Takshashila

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.360
[Amit Varma]: Institution on the 20 million jobs project her colleague in that project

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.340
[Amit Varma]: Yazid Jal was my guest on the show in my last episode which was about India's jobs crisis

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.140
[Amit Varma]: But Devika and I were not talking about jobs per se but about women in India

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.280
[Amit Varma]: my question for her was

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.160
[Amit Varma]: What metrics can be used to determine whether women are getting empowered in India?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And if so, how fast and by how much and this is a really complex subject because you can't measure most of these metrics

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.800
[Amit Varma]: Data is unreliable and the metrics can tell you different stories. For example, I told Devika about a column

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.160
[Amit Varma]: I wrote many years ago arguing that we should celebrate rising divorce rates

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.440
[Amit Varma]: Rising divorce rates are a good thing because they are a sign of women being able to walk out of bad marriages

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.720
[Amit Varma]: But Devika pointed out the flip side

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.200
[Amit Varma]: it could also mean that more men were abandoning their wives and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.920
[Amit Varma]: Like this one so many metrics we could pick have their flip sides

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.640
[Amit Varma]: For example, some metrics that make it seem that things are getting worse like rising rape statistics could mean just the opposite

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe more women have the courage to actually report rapes. We spoke about a bunch of serious metrics and then it got damn boring

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.520
[Amit Varma]: so we gathered all the folks at Takshashila around a water cooler and

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.800
[Amit Varma]: Brainstormed around funkier and more counterintuitive metrics of empowerment. For example, how many women commit white-collar crimes?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.680
[Amit Varma]: What is the number of male kids who are the last child in their family?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.600
[Amit Varma]: How many women go and buy pickles instead of making them at home?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.960
[Amit Varma]: How many people when they get caught speeding in Gurgaon tell the cop to janata hai meri maa kaun hai?

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.640
[Amit Varma]: You get the drift. So today's episode will not provide any answers to the question of how women are doing in India

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.360
[Amit Varma]: But will provide a whole bunch of different ways of looking at this problem

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.120
[Amit Varma]: I'm privileged to have three accomplished women in the studio with me and I'll introduce them to you after a quick commercial break

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.080
[Amit Varma]: Like me are you someone who loves fine art?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.080
[Amit Varma]: But can't really afford to have paintings by the artists you like hanging on your walls

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.560
[Amit Varma]: Well worry no more head on over to Indian colors calm

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.520
[Amit Varma]: Indian colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the best artists in India and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.480
[Amit Varma]: adapts them into objects of everyday use these include wearable art like stoles and shrugs home decor like cushion covers and

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.560
[Amit Varma]: table runners and

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.720
[Amit Varma]: accessories like tote bags this allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price and

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:52.800
[Amit Varma]: Artists get royalties on sales just like authors do what's more Indian colors now has an exciting range of new products including fridge magnets

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.760
[Amit Varma]: with some stunning motifs and

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.560
[Amit Varma]: Salad bowls and platters made of mango wood their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier vasvo x-mas for Brinda Miller

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.360
[Amit Varma]: They leap Sharma Shruti Nelson and Pradeep Mishra

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.240
[Amit Varma]: They accept bulk orders for corporate and festival gifting

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.160
[Amit Varma]: But even if you want to buy just for yourself or a friend head on over to Indian colors calm

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.440
[Amit Varma]: That's colors with an OU and if you want a 20% discount apply the code IVM 20

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.520
[Amit Varma]: That's IVM for IVM podcasts IVM 20 for a 20% discount at Indian colors calm

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen let me introduce my guests one by one

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.140
[Amit Varma]: Devika Kher is an economist and policy analyst at the Takshashila institution in Bangalore where she works on the 20 million jobs project

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the show Devika

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.600
[Amit Varma]: Hi, Amit

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.520
[Amit Varma]: Nidhi Gupta runs a policy school at the Takshashila institution

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.680
[Amit Varma]: And she's done previous episodes with me including notably on behavioral economics welcome Nidhi. Glad to be here Amit

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.400
[Amit Varma]: Hamsini Hariharan is my colleague at Pragati the magazine I edit at thinkpragati.com

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.640
[Amit Varma]: And she's also the host of the brilliant weekly show the Pragati podcast and while she's a guest here

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm also going to ask her to co-host the show with me today. Hey, Hamsini. What's up? Hey, Amit. Let's smash the patriarchy

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.740
[Amit Varma]: Let's smash the patriarchy and let's begin with a sledgehammer wielded by Devika

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.080
[Amit Varma]: So Devika as an economist and you know you've been working on the jobs crisis in India

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.320
[Amit Varma]: And you've written a lot about women labor force participation and women at work generally

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.760
[Amit Varma]: But even beyond that as an economist, how do you think about this?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.320
[Guest 2]: I know this might sound like it's coming from the entire project that I've been working

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.920
[Guest 2]: But I genuinely believe that with more women working there would be more women who would have access to a lot of resources

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.400
[Guest 2]: And when I say access, I mean not just have a bank account to their name, but be able to do e-commerce transactions, right?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.600
[Guest 2]: So for me I entered into this entire genre of women employment from the 20 jobs angle first

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I always thought that with more women working women will be more empowered and that's just a general outcome

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.560
[Guest 2]: I think a lot of economics is speaking out here because I personally believe if you have a higher income

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.960
[Guest 2]: You will get a better share in the household

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.560
[Guest 2]: Decision-making you would be the more important part of the family and therefore family will eventually respect you

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.160
[Guest 2]: So that was my theory, but when I entered into this project

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.680
[Guest 2]: I realized that other than the fact that 20 million jobs is a huge task as Yazeed would have told you

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.800
[Guest 2]: The problem with female labor employment ratio is completely different from the rest of the problem

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.680
[Guest 2]: Unlike the rest of the problem where there's a linear growth, but not at the pace at which we want

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.880
[Guest 2]: The female labor force participation rate has actually fallen in the last few years and that just shows us the grim picture of how

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.480
[Guest 2]: Leave apart the fact that we don't have enough women working. We also do not have enough women

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.440
[Amit Varma]: The women who were working are leaving the workforce and this is something that blows my mind because I automatically assumed that hey

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.160
[Amit Varma]: Things are really bad

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.320
[Amit Varma]: but this is really getting better and therefore you'd imagine that more women are entering the workforce and

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.760
[Amit Varma]: When I read your pieces and pieces by people like Namita Bhandari, which show that just the opposite is happening

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.040
[Amit Varma]: I don't get it. Why why are less women working today than say 15 years ago?

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.880
[Guest 2]: So there's this thing called the u-curve when it comes to female employment. There are a lot of research papers

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.200
[Guest 2]: there are a few which have done in-depth study on this and the idea is that

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.720
[Guest 2]: Women are considered to be

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.480
[Guest 2]: Income earners until unless the household income is has reached a certain point beyond which

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.200
[Guest 2]: they expect women to be

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.880
[Guest 2]: Contributing to the household chores which are considered to be the women

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.000
[Amit Varma]: So basically what you're saying is that in really poor families, there's no choice

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.080
[Amit Varma]: They have to let the woman work because they need the income but the moment she reaches a level where household reaches an income

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.040
[Guest 2]: They they believe that the woman can get back

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.040
[Guest 1]: What you're saying is there's something that we call a double burden, right?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.320
[Guest 1]: So generally women who are working have to do work

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.280
[Guest 1]: But they also have to come back and cook and clean and take care of their kids and all of that

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.600
[Guest 1]: What you're saying is after a certain point they're saying we will take away the double burden from you

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.200
[Guest 1]: You don't go to work you stay at home. Is that right?

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.280
[Guest 2]: Yeah, exactly and the priority that your priority is not to have that career

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.160
[Guest 2]: Your priority is to ensure that the household runs fine

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.720
[Guest 2]: so then therefore

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.920
[Guest 2]: It makes sense for them that as soon as the household reaches a point where you can stay back home your priority shifts to taking

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.440
[Amit Varma]: Care of everything that is and the way you put it Hamsini

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.640
[Amit Varma]: It almost sounds like you know, it's a patriarchy's way of empowering women that you have a double burden even take one

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:31.640
[Guest 3]: The unpaid care work that women have to do so take care of the children take care of the men at home

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.240
[Guest 3]: Cook clean. It's all unpaid and it's taken for granted

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.280
[Amit Varma]: So the man will take the credit for you know, all the capital he brings home

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:46.120
[Guest 3]: But the woman's capital is simply not considered. It's just because how do you put money to this? How how much is it worth?

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.760
[Guest 2]: I have a base idea of that actually

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:56.760
[Guest 2]: So, um, if you actually do a math of how much do you pay a cook? How much do you pay your if to a laundry person?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.480
[Guest 2]: How much do you pay the cleaning lady?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.560
[Guest 2]: How much do you pay all of these people who help run your household and as someone who's been living in a city alone?

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.960
[Guest 2]: I I do pay people for all of these stuff that my mom used to do back home, right?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.360
[Guest 2]: So now I know that this is the amount of money at least that my mom deserves for every monthly

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.320
[Guest 2]: Monthly amount she spends on doing this work, right? So a lot of countries have actually tried to come up with a

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.040
[Guest 2]: base figure for unpaid care

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.640
[Guest 2]: The problem with that is that even though it's acknowledged no one really pays

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.880
[Amit Varma]: There's no real value to it

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.320
[Amit Varma]: And I'd actually say that a base figure would be way too low because for most women you also have to take into mind the opportunity

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.920
[Amit Varma]: Cost if they weren't, you know washing dishes and doing whatever and if right from the start

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.760
[Amit Varma]: They'd got an education and they were out working. They'd be earning so much more

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.280
[Amit Varma]: So their time is not worth what your mate plus cook plus sweeper is, you know, those services are worth

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.280
[Guest 2]: It's worth so much more. So in our jobs

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.040
[Guest 2]: Conversation we had the same

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.440
[Guest 2]: Point which is for every one woman who leaves her household to go out to work

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.600
[Guest 2]: She creates one point one or three one point three around around that number of jobs in the sense

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.960
[Guest 2]: The fact that that woman is not at home itself ensures that you would then hire a cook or a mate, right?

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:18.720
[Guest 2]: So it's it's actually beneficial from the entire jobs angle also if not from just empower

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but those are low-skill jobs that you create

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:27.640
[Guest 2]: But the idea is that then you create so then one more woman can then afford a household income that she will then use based

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.720
[Guest 2]: On her usage. So the link is

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.360
[Guest 2]: Actually positive. The only thing is that

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.760
[Guest 2]: Other than being a cook, I think rest of them are still women oriented jobs

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.960
[Guest 1]: You will still get a maid who's a woman you will still get a nanny a cleaning lady

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.880
[Guest 2]: How much does that do for the image of women in the society? I am I have doubts

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.400
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that's one of the funkier metrics will come to later that how many men do these kind of domestic jobs?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.400
[Guest 2]: Like is your maid a man?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:11:00.720
[Guest 1]: And outside of the jobs angle though thinking, you know with your economist hat on what are the other kind of metrics that you'd look look at to

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.440
[Amit Varma]: You know just to see if women are actually progressing in this country

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.760
[Amit Varma]: So there are old-school metrics like maternity mortality rate and that kind of stuff

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.720
[Guest 2]: But what you're seeing is that there's a lot of women who are actually

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:23.920
[Guest 2]: so there are old-school metrics like maternity mortality rate and that is a good metrics of understanding how

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.320
[Guest 2]: How are women doing health-wise?

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.680
[Guest 2]: There is the entire educational level not just the enrollment rate, but also the completion rate

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.120
[Guest 2]: We do not have many people talking about that that a lot of women do enter

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:41.040
[Guest 2]: Enrollment rate has increased over the years, but the completion rate is still the the more grim part of the so why is that?

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Why are if more women are enrolling? Why aren't more people? I mean, why doesn't that reflect in the completion rate because they leave school before

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.880
[Guest 2]: They can complete their even I think secondary schooling

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.680
[Guest 2]: Because I think the first and primary thing which has been discussed a lot is the fact that as soon as they're at puberty

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.380
[Guest 2]: You need to have a provisions for sanitation or you need a washroom with the water connectivity

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:12.340
[Guest 2]: So even if the uh, rural schools do have toilets, they do not have proper resources around to

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.980
[Amit Varma]: Ensure and also at some point after a certain age

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.700
[Amit Varma]: It might just be dangerous for girls to go to school alone and so on. So the families are like, so that's the other thing

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.540
[Guest 2]: so

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.740
[Guest 2]: There are many factors actually one is the sanitation. The other is distance between the school and the household

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.140
[Guest 2]: uh, the third is how

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:35.060
[Guest 2]: How many girls in that area do go to the school? Right? Like if there is only one person going to sending their kid to the school

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.580
[Guest 1]: It generally doesn't happen. So and the last is value, right? If uh,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.700
[Guest 1]: Your aim is to get married and then they'll be like, okay and it is good for a girl to study

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.300
[Guest 1]: Up till eighth standard but after that, you know, she's going to get married

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.580
[Guest 1]: Anyway, she might as well learn how to cook and clean and do everything that is I think there is

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.580
[Guest 3]: This calculation of opportunity cause that the family does right?

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.540
[Guest 3]: So if i'm going to send you to school, how much am I going to pay versus

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.980
[Guest 3]: If you stay back, you would be able to take care of these things at home, you know be able to cook clean

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.060
[Amit Varma]: Right. I mean, there's a there's a very good help your father help your mother with other things

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.020
[Amit Varma]: There's a very good friend uh phrase a friend of mine Uday Shankar uses when he's talking about

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.180
[Amit Varma]: When anyone is constructed with a decision you should ask yourself

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.940
[Amit Varma]: What are you optimizing for?

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.420
[Amit Varma]: And here what happens is that if a family is to ask themselves

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.420
[Amit Varma]: That they treat girls and boys differently because they're optimizing for different things

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.100
[Amit Varma]: They want the boy to eventually go out on the jobs market earn money blah blah blah

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.900
[Guest 2]: And they want the girl to get married. Yeah, and that's that's a very economical approach. So you if you remove the entire

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.340
[Guest 2]: Judgment based on how they remove options for both the genders

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.860
[Guest 2]: But other than that, it's running a household is an economy in itself

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:50.100
[Guest 2]: It requires time energy effort all of that and the moment you uh, expect it to happen on its own

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.900
[Guest 2]: Uh, then you're being irrational. The problem comes from the fact that

00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:00.260
[Guest 2]: We have always considered women to be doing that rather than making it an option between the two genders

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
[Guest 2]: Okay, so adding on to that

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:08.900
[Guest 3]: Um, imagine that if parents actually started seeing going and living with their girl children as an option

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:13.140
[Guest 3]: Right currently you see your male child as an investment you're making because in your old age

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.380
[Guest 3]: You're going to go live with them or they're going to take care of you. So I might as well invest in that

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:25.300
[Guest 3]: The current notion that we have in india at least is that we we we as parents cannot go and live with our children

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.020
[Guest 3]: Right and it begins right there. It's almost considered shameful that for parents to go and live with a girl

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:37.300
[Guest 3]: Yeah, right shameful and um, how can we do it? You are our girl child and oh we will we cannot be a burden on you

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.580
[Guest 3]: So when they think of the girl child, they think oh I cannot you know

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.740
[Guest 3]: And this girl is going to go away and she's not going to be part of our family anymore

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:50.100
[Guest 3]: So if you begin with this notion of you are not a part of our family

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.940
[Guest 3]: Then you don't want to invest in that right? So so this is a very selfish view of parenting

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.900
[Guest 3]: If you were to think right that i'm investing in this person or my male child because i'm going to go

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.900
[Guest 3]: Um live with them

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.380
[Guest 3]: Actually rather than selfish. I think it's just an

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:13.540
[Guest 1]: Exclusionary way of looking at membership of of an economy. I think this is also an outcome of the fact that we do not have

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:19.060
[Guest 2]: Old age care, uh in the city and then old age care by the way covers up for all the crashes you don't see around

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.460
[Guest 2]: This is my argument in one of the pragate articles too, right that we can't get women to the city

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:30.180
[Guest 2]: So we should get cities to the women by cities is because cities provide all of those services that if my mom wanted to work

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:36.580
[Guest 2]: When I was in kindergarten, uh, she could leave me at a crash and then go back to her work and

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.100
[Guest 2]: Uh in rural areas, you can't expect that to happen for various reasons

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.500
[Guest 2]: But one of them primarily being that where do you leave those kids? Uh, if both the parents are working

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.060
[Guest 2]: so, uh

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.140
[Guest 2]: I think that's an important part. And the other thing that i've been looking at

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.660
[Guest 2]: The entire angle of how we look at women is also

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.780
[Guest 2]: How education is only seen as a basic criteria to get married

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.940
[Guest 2]: So and this goes on right like even when women get jobs

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.420
[Guest 2]: They are not seen as someone who is going to continue with the job. They're seen as someone who

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:15.140
[Guest 2]: Will take the job for the meanwhile and then based on wherever the partner is would have to shift according to that

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.540
[Guest 2]: So we do not want our women to have careers. We want them to have jobs

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:25.940
[Guest 2]: For the time being when and where the household needs it. So if you see, um, there was a UNDP report which said

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.220
[Guest 2]: Around 68 percent of the women who graduated, uh, don't have paid jobs

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.980
[Guest 2]: So yes, so when I look at the education numbers, I feel really happy about the fact that there are more women graduating

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.300
[Guest 2]: But then I realized that most of them just go back to home

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.140
[Guest 2]: And what's the corresponding figure for men?

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.580
[Guest 2]: Would you have an idea because i'd imagine the majority of graduates don't have paid jobs, right?

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:52.020
[Amit Varma]: So we have a problem and then I think the other point of this is that, uh, i'll give you the other figure which is

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:59.940
[Guest 2]: Regarding the labor force participation. So while women I told you about how like they the female labor force participation rate

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.500
[Guest 2]: Fell from 34 to 27 percent from 1993 to 2020

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.420
[Guest 2]: So I think that's a problem. I think that's a problem. I think that's a problem

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.760
[Guest 2]: Female labor force participation rate fell from 34 to 27 percent from 1993 to 2013

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:22.980
[Guest 2]: In that meantime, uh, there were around 24.3 million jobs created for men so while women were leaving

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.900
[Guest 2]: Uh back to go back home from instead of working, uh men got all of those additional jobs

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:35.640
[Guest 2]: And in I agree as a pie, we don't have enough jobs out of which the share that can be distributed

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.520
[Guest 2]: Inevitably goes to the men because women then

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.120
[Guest 2]: Leave the workforce. So even the jobs that were created all of them then literally went towards

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.720
[Amit Varma]: And all of these social attitudes that we spoke about and will continue to speak about as the episode goes on

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.800
[Amit Varma]: How much do you think uh, they we are stuck in a vicious cycle

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.320
[Amit Varma]: Where if if you are a parent and all the people around you think this way

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.200
[Amit Varma]: You are forced to think this way because otherwise, how do you fit in?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:06.600
[Guest 3]: So, I mean you're absolutely right about that, right if you think women are being empowered then as a parent

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.840
[Guest 3]: My parents must be able to think that

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.120
[Guest 3]: You know, I must when I said already that they I must invest in my girl child as well

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.680
[Guest 3]: um, and a lot of

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:23.880
[Guest 3]: Women empowerment is when i'm able to educate and bring up my parents and say, you know with confidence that my

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:30.280
[Guest 3]: My daughter is as able as my son when that starts to happen

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:36.040
[Guest 3]: when my parents spend as much time with me when i'm married as

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.240
[Guest 3]: They spend with my brother when you know, he's married

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.440
[Guest 3]: That's when you would feel that women are really empowered

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.000
[Guest 3]: I can call my parents to my house to live with me in my house as

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.280
[Guest 3]: Much as my husband can right because it's not his house. It's your marital house

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.080
[Guest 3]: And I am empowered only when I can take that decision as well when I am able to say hey

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:03.800
[Guest 3]: My family or my parents are as much my family as your parents are and it will forever continue to be like that

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.280
[Guest 3]: right, so I think that's when

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.160
[Guest 3]: Women in households are truly empowered

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:15.960
[Guest 3]: Right, of course women in workplace. I mean there is empowerment you can talk about in workplaces, which is a completely different dimension, right?

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:22.520
[Guest 3]: There is empowerment in households. There's empowerment in society in general, and i'm sure you have those things. You will bring up

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.920
[Guest 1]: Um, I think there are two aspects to this even with your example, right?

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.520
[Guest 1]: One that liberal feminists call for is equality in opportunity, which means you know that

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.840
[Guest 1]: Women should have the same access to jobs and so on and so forth

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.640
[Guest 1]: But the second which you also pointed out in your example

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:46.200
[Guest 1]: Is that there is a structural inequality that is geared towards women and that is the cycle that's harder to break

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.480
[Guest 1]: So when we're talking about a vision viciousness

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.080
[Guest 1]: viciousness

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.080
[Guest 1]: When we're talking about a viciousness

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.800
[Guest 1]: It's easier to provide equality and opportunity at least relatively

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.440
[Guest 1]: Whereas the structural inequality is something that has taken

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.960
[Guest 1]: Centuries and will continue to take centuries of us

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:11.080
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I like the second half of your point is uh, so namita in her series covers that

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:18.280
[Guest 2]: One of the bigger fears of women having job was the fact that then she'll become independent and open-minded and then who will marry her

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.800
[Guest 2]: Because the idea is that an independent woman then I will ask for rights and

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.640
[Guest 2]: And certain freedoms, uh, which the society is not ready to

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.320
[Amit Varma]: So essentially the patriarchy is okay with women being empowered as long as they're still in charge. Yeah, of course. Yeah, right

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.560
[Amit Varma]: Even if you look at we can come to this later

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.360
[Guest 1]: But even if you look at marriage rates for more successful women, it's much lower

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.160
[Guest 1]: No one wants to marry a successful woman

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah, and successful women frankly shouldn't want to marry

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.280
[Guest 1]: Or do you guys deal with indian men? Oh, um

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.920
[Amit Varma]: So let's start doing one this so when we were having a water cooler conversation with you guys and all your

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.640
[Amit Varma]: Charming takshashila colleagues we came up with

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.480
[Amit Varma]: More than 60 different funky metrics, uh, which we can

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.280
[Amit Varma]: You know consider to look at whether women are getting empowered or not whether there's progress

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And for many of these if not, most of these data is very hard to come by

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.300
[Amit Varma]: So we don't mean this episode to be some kind of statistically

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.280
[Amit Varma]: Rigorous way of evaluating the condition of women in this country because there are no statistics and we're not going to be rigorous about this

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.640
[Amit Varma]: But if you just look around you they could present a lens of

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:31.000
[Amit Varma]: You know looking at different aspects of how women are doing. Uh, let's kind of go through the categories

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.780
[Amit Varma]: Which bleed into each other so they're not like exclusive

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:41.400
[Amit Varma]: And my first category is titled women socially empowered like, you know signs of the social empowerment of

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:49.080
[Amit Varma]: Women and hamsini one suggestion you came up with was how many women go and buy pickles from the market instead of making it at home?

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080
[Amit Varma]: Which is you know, really?

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:58.520
[Amit Varma]: Interesting solo travels by women our friend anupam manoot spoke about women who go to pubs alone or at all for that matter

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:04.840
[Amit Varma]: Uh, you mentioned women who go to public sports events nidhi mentioned gym memberships. Yeah for women

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Um and one that really struck me as a beautiful metric what you said nidhi was the number of male kids who are the last child

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.840
[Amit Varma]: therefore indicating that the parents are

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.720
[Amit Varma]: They still want to go to the gym

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.360
[Amit Varma]: Before indicating that the parents are uh, they still want a male child

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.640
[Guest 3]: Yeah, so if you don't see if you see two sisters or three sisters and then you see oh no male child

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.000
[Guest 3]: I think that's a very good indicator. That's a great indicator

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.880
[Guest 2]: I think this was more like giving up they tried and then they were like no

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.880
[Guest 3]: I think it's also that they say that we want to have two children

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.720
[Guest 3]: Whether it's girl children or boy children doesn't matter and we are not and that's why you would see

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.460
[Guest 3]: Uh, if if you look at your parents generations

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.200
[Guest 3]: They would have more children and they probably stopped

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.560
[Guest 3]: After one, you know male child was born

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:02.600
[Guest 3]: So if it's only two girls in the family, it says that oh parents think that girls can take care of them as well

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.160
[Guest 3]: That they don't need to have male children

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.240
[Guest 3]: That they would invest

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.280
[Guest 3]: All of their time effort energy in bringing up these girl children

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.320
[Guest 3]: So it speaks to a lot of things right and it's also an indicator of

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.600
[Amit Varma]: Uh, like if a girl is a last child, that's also an indicator

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.160
[Amit Varma]: Especially if she's just the first or the you know, the first only child or the second child of two

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.200
[Amit Varma]: That those parents I mean, of course, they could have stopped trying for other reasons like rising divorce rates

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.280
[Unknown]: Yeah, I think another thing that's what I meant amit that you know

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.720
[Guest 3]: If if there is no male last child, right then it shows that you know, right?

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.440
[Guest 1]: I think a poignant point is that whenever my mother used to tell me this whenever

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.520
[Guest 1]: Uh women of her age would go into hospitals and they were just having children

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.400
[Guest 1]: Uh, they would always have the option to have their tubes tied

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.480
[Guest 1]: And whenever women were considering this option and if they did not have male children, the doctor would ask

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.720
[Guest 1]: Are you sure you don't want to try for a boy?

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.160
[Guest 1]: Uh, and she said what struck her was that no one ever asked her. Are you sure you don't want to try for a girl?

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.360
[Guest 1]: Um, but that is a very very interesting point just to explain how our social mindsets work

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.440
[Amit Varma]: And women have the satitude also mothers have the satitude as much as a man, right? Yes. Yes

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.120
[Guest 1]: we can't

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.920
[Guest 1]: uh

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.400
[Guest 1]: Blame just men for everything. This is uh, it's not even the blame thing, right?

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.040
[Guest 2]: Like you have to look at it as a society not as a gender thing

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.720
[Guest 2]: So the society in which our parents brought up was speaking like that

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.920
[Guest 2]: So in that context it wasn't a male or a female thing

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.280
[Guest 2]: It was the fact that as a woman or as a man, you would expect women and men to do these things

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.680
[Guest 2]: So that's why I I generally hear this a lot that oh woman went against a woman

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:40.520
[Guest 2]: No, it is a person who was brought up in a setup went against a person who was brought up in another setup

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.920
[Guest 2]: You have to look at the environments they were brought up in and not the gender clearly, right?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean I had a previous episode on this with

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:53.160
[Amit Varma]: Aditi Mittal and my producer Swati Bakshi and Swati made the point here that a lot of women especially in high positions in companies

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:59.400
[Amit Varma]: Are tools of the patriarchy, you know, just because they're women in a high position doesn't mean that they don't reinforce the same

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.200
[Guest 3]: and I just like to add that

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.200
[Guest 3]: It's not that they

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.960
[Guest 3]: Sometimes they really are patriarchal. It's not that they are tools

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.040
[Guest 3]: So they don't themselves believe in it. A lot of women themselves have very patriarchal

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.360
[Guest 3]: attitudes I have

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.360
[Guest 3]: You know, I know of some people who

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.800
[Guest 3]: Whose mothers would tell them that how can you have your husband, you know clean up the dishes?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.920
[Guest 3]: And they actually accept that and say no no, no, my mother won't like it

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.400
[Guest 3]: So one your mother first has a patriarchal attitude and then you submit to it

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.160
[Guest 3]: Right that oh because my mother won't like it because she thinks my husband shouldn't be doing it. So I really shouldn't. Why?

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.240
[Amit Varma]: Exactly

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Let's let's kind of move on through the list women enrolling for Coursera. I think that was

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.240
[Guest 3]: So I think if women are investing in their own education continuous learning

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.520
[Guest 3]: And here money is not involved. So this is really about

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:59.080
[Guest 3]: women wanting to learn and after a certain age your willingness or your

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.240
[Guest 3]: Willingness or your uh want to learn something is always tied with

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.120
[Guest 3]: Uh, do you want to you know advance your career?

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:11.900
[Guest 3]: Is this because you just have this hunger to learn and that to me, you know speaks of empowerment

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.440
[Amit Varma]: And statistics of these sorts should sort of not be very hard to get right the Coursera one

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.280
[Guest 2]: Yes, sure, but the last child is a son would be a bit difficult

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.360
[Guest 1]: But even then senses, you know as a woman and mathematics is so hard for me

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.360
[Guest 2]: What do you know of statistics

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.960
[Guest 3]: So this is something Amit we'll get to you on

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.680
[Guest 2]: Women in media, right?

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.240
[Unknown]: This is a stereotype we were reading the other day where

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.960
[Guest 2]: It was an assumption that

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.520
[Guest 2]: Women should not be reading news that's related to war or national security because it's such grave

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.400
[Guest 2]: Topics and how would they be able to handle it? Right? So our little hearts can't handle

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.280
[Guest 1]: I've started crying in front of the teleprompter, but

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.080
[Unknown]: How do you see that changing? Do you see that changing around you actually to be very honest?

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.920
[Amit Varma]: I think swati brought up this point in in the podcast which I did with aditi and swati and

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.880
[Amit Varma]: And in her experience was that women in high places tend to reinforce the same attitudes

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.240
[Amit Varma]: But frankly in my experience like for example, i'm the editor pragati

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:12.680
[Amit Varma]: But uh all the people that are right for all my editors without exception are women and they're

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.720
[Amit Varma]: You know extremely competent and really good and I mean

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.880
[Amit Varma]: They're just all excellent editors and I get along really well with them and through my career

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.880
[Amit Varma]: I've been fortunate to so I don't think that's a huge problem in the media

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.040
[Amit Varma]: But it is also possible that because I am a man. It's an invisible problem for me

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:34.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, I can't comment on what women actually have to go through the the other angle of it is that

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:40.600
[Amit Varma]: You the media is sort of there's a selection bias involved if you look at the media because more women tend to come into the

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.320
[Amit Varma]: Media because more men go to the media and they're more

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.320
[Amit Varma]: Tend to come into the media because more men go towards, you know, the stem side of things

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.160
[Amit Varma]: And you have more women likely to you know study the humanities and then

00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:02.300
[Guest 1]: Sure, and even within the media there's a thing of oh, you know women will cover soft beats like culture or entertainment

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.160
[Amit Varma]: And not do hard beats and in fact, that's one of the metrics we have in another category

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.760
[Amit Varma]: Which is women going beyond gender roles and I think one of you pointed that out and within takshashila itself you have

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.320
[Amit Varma]: Women like for example shibani mehta covers defense

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.980
[Amit Varma]: Which is not something that covers international covers international relations when she's not doing dredge work at pravati

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.760
[Amit Varma]: And let's just go to that subject right now and look at how so women transcending gender roles

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.120
[Amit Varma]: um

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:38.840
[Amit Varma]: One is of course women scholars slash journals and fields that men traditionally cover and you see this even in journalism

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:44.920
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you look at someone like scroll who do outstanding reportage and and they have an amazing team of reporters

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Supriya sharma onwards who actually go out in the field go out in rural areas and report from villages and so on very fearlessly

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.600
[Amit Varma]: And as if it's just the most natural thing to do which I think 30 years ago

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.480
[Amit Varma]: You wouldn't really have had women journals out in the field like that, right?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.920
[Guest 1]: Yeah, true. And there's also uh an idea that women do as I said beats that are not popular

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.480
[Guest 1]: So earlier when a lot of people say oh women are doing finance journalism

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:14.600
[Guest 3]: This is new can they wrap their heads around these crazy statistics? I think uh, so to talk about gender roles, right somehow we

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.440
[Guest 3]: um

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.060
[Guest 3]: We attribute everything that has to do something with empathy

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.740
[Guest 3]: Right to women that if it involves care and being empathetic

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.240
[Guest 3]: let's have women do this, but if it's something that's

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.840
[Guest 2]: um hard feel that doesn't you know, that's too rational or pragmatic or that

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.760
[Guest 3]: He needs you to take hard stances. You have men do it and that's why I mean there are of course roles that

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.300
[Guest 3]: women need to take because of

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.580
[Guest 3]: Biology, but then there are these artificial

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.080
[Guest 3]: Gender roles that we create based on why can't men be empathetic?

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.960
[Amit Varma]: and also I think the larger point is that even biology being what it is like even if you assume that men and women are

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.280
[Amit Varma]: hardwired differently and and uh

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.120
[Amit Varma]: You know acknowledging their difference is fine

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:03.880
[Amit Varma]: As long as you also acknowledge that despite whatever hardwired differences there might be you treat both sexes

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.680
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely equally so, you know, it might be the case that women are naturally more empathetic

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.960
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, uh, you know, it's natural to get them for those professions

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.520
[Amit Varma]: But when it actually comes to how you treat women as a public policy matter as a governance matter

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:22.120
[Amit Varma]: You have to treat them equally and I think often there is a conflation between these two where you know

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.260
[Amit Varma]: Talking of natural differences for example has become politically incorrect because of the assumption that it implies

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:34.460
[Amit Varma]: Is that you are prescribing unequal treatment which is often not the case but often is the case with those maniacs on the alt-right and

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:41.020
[Guest 2]: Men's rights activists. Yes. So actually there's a technical term for it. It's called pink collar jobs, which is the job. Of course

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.020
[Guest 2]: It's called pink collar jobs

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:48.220
[Guest 2]: but the idea is that women are seen to be doing certain type of jobs and

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.820
[Guest 2]: The sad part is they are trained to do those jobs, too

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:57.740
[Guest 2]: So it's a vicious circle where you are trained to do the sort of thing you are expected to do and therefore you end up

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.020
[Amit Varma]: doing just that

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.020
[Amit Varma]: right, so

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.740
[Guest 2]: Exactly and no, uh, the point goes further ahead, right?

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:08.700
[Guest 2]: Like when uh government starts building its schemes and the skill india moment, uh scheme that they came up with

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:15.980
[Guest 2]: uh, if you look for jobs that they the skills that they thought for women were all uh stitching parlour work and

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.200
[Guest 2]: very

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.380
[Amit Varma]: Prototypical this is official government thinking. Yeah, this is uh, so government thinking

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.940
[Guest 2]: Basically coming from the society, right?

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.820
[Guest 2]: uh, but it comes from the fact that a lot of them would invest in uh,

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:35.980
[Guest 2]: It's not like they are against women working, but they only see women working in certain fields. So, um

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.340
[Guest 2]: What that does is that then women have to compete?

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.820
[Guest 2]: For those similar those set of five jobs that are supposed to be female jobs

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.780
[Guest 2]: And then in that the race if you do not get the job you like or the pay you like

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.200
[Guest 2]: Then you end up coming out of the workforce rather than continuing and you might be a brilliant woman mathematician

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.660
[Guest 2]: Yes, I have an aptitude for whatever for banking, but you'll never know because you're sitting at a yeah

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:04.780
[Guest 2]: The onion had this one article that said, uh, you might be the the prodigy violinist and um

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.060
[Guest 2]: And you will never know because you never picked up a violin

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:13.580
[Guest 1]: Uh, which is poignant. I mean, it's yeah, I mean did that it's not funny. Yeah

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.300
[Guest 1]: What are the other statistics that we have in uh crossing gender roles?

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.180
[Amit Varma]: Women teaching science nidhi brought it up, you know

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:26.860
[Amit Varma]: Which is again harks back to what devika was saying that women are supposed to teach humanities and arts and soft subjects

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.760
[Guest 1]: I'm going to actually disagree with this because if we're just talking about this metric anecdotally

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.140
[Guest 1]: I had one

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:40.140
[Guest 1]: Male teacher through all of high school teaching itself is a female oriented because teaching itself is female oriented

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.020
[Guest 1]: Maybe if you're talking at a high school level, then there could still be a lot more women teaching science

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.180
[Guest 1]: But if you're talking at a college or a professorial level, then you could have a lot more

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.420
[Guest 2]: Also look at women who do stem like who who study stem subjects

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.960
[Guest 3]: We have to study stem who go on to become scientists, you know, well-known scientists mathematicians

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.160
[Guest 3]: uh, so to counter your point hamsini you countered the anecdote with an anecdote, but

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
[Guest 2]: I am going to

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.760
[Guest 3]: Actually in high schools as well we've all had women teachers but

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.920
[Guest 3]: uh from what I understand women would teach more language and arts whereas

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.800
[Guest 3]: subjects like math

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.840
[Guest 3]: physics

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.080
[Guest 3]: Uh pe physical education are all taught by men

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:34.480
[Guest 3]: So to me, I would feel that oh women have been empowered if there are more women teaching physical education

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:40.100
[Guest 3]: In schools or if there are more women teaching math in high schools in universities

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.160
[Guest 1]: You know at all levels no, I completely get your point

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.720
[Guest 1]: Like I still rest my case

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.280
[Guest 1]: But no, I I do understand where you're coming from

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.080
[Guest 1]: When you're saying that we need to have more women involved in all these areas that are seen as traditionally male

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.760
[Guest 2]: Yes, and you would see the outcome when there are more than four women doing mechanical engineering in a class, right?

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.720
[Guest 2]: Because see that the outcome is the fact that you don't see your daughter as a mechanical engineer

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.360
[Guest 2]: So you do not and a lot of so this is one more point that namita in her series brought out

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:16.000
[Guest 2]: Was that one of the problems with that they faced when they were trying to empower women was that a lot of decisions for women

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.440
[Guest 2]: Are taken by someone else

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.960
[Guest 2]: Which is not the similar case for men at after 18 a lot of the decisions about career about their career

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.120
[Guest 2]: About career about the city where they're living in a lot of like what they're going to study

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.560
[Guest 2]: A lot of that is with men but with women the problem was that

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.480
[Guest 2]: Even if they were educated

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.120
[Guest 2]: They had to get like three permissions before they took their first job

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.280
[Guest 2]: And then like two permissions if the job required you to be staying out of home at after six

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.720
[Guest 2]: so

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:46.640
[Guest 2]: Just that itself is a huge cost that we do not calculate when we are trying to look at women joining the workforce

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.080
[Guest 1]: I was

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.480
[Guest 1]: Uh, I was actually thinking about this. Um

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.360
[Guest 1]: It just taking my school, right?

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.560
[Guest 1]: There were say more girls who were topping the class or subjects than there were boys

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:03.600
[Guest 1]: But now when I think about what all of them are doing, I think two or three of them

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.160
[Guest 1]: Are working compared to like the one boy who did well and is now doing his phd in penn state

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.240
[Guest 1]: So it the I don't think the disparity struck me until now because you're right

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.320
[Guest 1]: I don't think a lot of these women

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.960
[Guest 1]: Uh either with their knowledge or without their knowledge

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.840
[Guest 1]: They don't take these major decisions for themselves

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:29.200
[Amit Varma]: The world is not open and also the I mean your circles would have been relatively extremely privileged circles

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.680
[Guest 1]: I mean outside of those it's just like far far worse

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean just the very fact that in a government form you have to write husband's name or father's name and this you know

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.240
[Guest 3]: In so many places is kind of mandatory

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:44.420
[Guest 3]: So I had uh, it's a sad joke, but uh, we were talking about women in science, right in engineering colleges

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:51.140
[Guest 3]: They're running uh, because there are so few women in mechanical engineering and you know materials engineering

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.460
[Guest 3]: That they're actually called non-males

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.900
[Amit Varma]: So there are males in the class and there are no and there are non-males

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.860
[Guest 3]: Because they for sure can't be girls

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:07.780
[Amit Varma]: A suitable foundation for a dystopian novel on this delightful note. We'll take a quick commercial break, but lots more after we come back

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.540

[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you on with your show

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:17.860
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen we're discussing women transcending gender roles and uh, you know

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:22.820
[Amit Varma]: what the other examples given as women as drivers slash bouncers, which uh, uh

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:29.380
[Amit Varma]: Anupam gave but I I mean, I don't know where uh, have you guys ever seen any women bouncers? No, no

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.620
[Guest 3]: very unlikely, uh

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.740
[Amit Varma]: But not just in india nowhere. Yeah, and here's a survey

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.060
[Amit Varma]: I'd like someone to take that if you're a man sitting on a plane

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.540
[Amit Varma]: And the pilot announcement comes from a female voice. Will you be a little more nervous?

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.620
[Unknown]: You tell us

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.540
[Amit Varma]: Not me at all but multiple times when i've been on the in a cab in an uber or

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.260
[Amit Varma]: So on i've had the cab guy curse at a woman and say you know woman driver. What can you expect?

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:02.820
[Guest 1]: I think uh, the bangalore political action committee bpac is actually training women to drive more cars because

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.980
[Guest 3]: That's a great and I think one great thing i've seen at least in bangalore metro is most of the metro drivers are women

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:14.980
[Guest 1]: Yeah, yeah, so that speaks of you know, it's that is a deliberate government policy by the

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.140
[Guest 2]: Bangalore metro. Oh, okay

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:22.660
[Guest 2]: So there are two things in this one is just trying to understand how many women have driving licenses, right?

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:27.940
[Guest 2]: Like that itself is a good indicator of how many have access to leaving apart the fact that in india

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.100
[Guest 2]: You can get a driving license without knowing how to drive

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.940
[Guest 2]: but

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.980
[Guest 2]: a that b is how many single women, uh,

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:42.660
[Guest 2]: Use different transports in the sense flights or metro, right? So in india like you would see when uh, you're traveling. Uh,

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:50.420
[Guest 2]: Via a flight or via metro you would see most of the women have a co-passenger, uh, which is mostly a man

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.780
[Guest 2]: Um, but the idea is that if you can see more women traveling alone

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:59.460
[Guest 2]: That's a good indicator of the fact that a they are empowered enough to move around freely. But the second, um

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:05.220
[Guest 2]: Thing is that a lot of people who take flights are the ones who use it for business purposes and not for private

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:10.660
[Guest 2]: That's the statistic. So if there are more single female, uh riders or female, uh passengers

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.980
[Amit Varma]: You realize that they are part of that the higher

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:19.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in fact nitin pai has suggested one of the metrics he suggested was to see how many women have metro cards metro cards

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.680
[Guest 1]: Yes, so it's not only social empowerment

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.900
[Guest 1]: But it's also the fact that they have the agency to go search for jobs

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.940
[Guest 1]: for example, one thing that I was saying is that uh,

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.740
[Guest 1]: The line in an airport at the women's section for example

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.900
[Guest 1]: Is always much much longer and that's just a design issue

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.780
[Guest 1]: These airports are not designed for women if they were then these we would like four

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.780
[Guest 1]: gates for men

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.500
[Guest 1]: For one will be for women and like the women will also have kids with them, by the way

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.380
[Guest 3]: so I once actually fought with uh, one of those airport and I said I want to stand in this line because

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.220
[Guest 3]: That that the other line for women is just so long. I have a flight to catch

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:05.460
[Guest 3]: Why can't you just let me pass through this? I will stand with my hands out and you know, you're not anyways

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.740
[Guest 3]: Uh, you know frisking the guy so you do what you're doing

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.660
[Guest 3]: Uh with me or call one of your woman colleagues here and he just refused he said no you have to go in the woman's line

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.660
[Guest 3]: But he showed you your place

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:23.300
[Amit Varma]: Speaking in the line. Yeah. Yeah. So now to invert this we've done what you know women transcending gender roles

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.820
[Amit Varma]: Are men transcending gender roles also?

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.220
[Amit Varma]: Metrics for the empowerment of women for example, uh, Manoj K V Ramani

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.020
[Amit Varma]: Uh who writes a brilliant I on china?

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.060
[Amit Varma]: Column on pragati, which is quite the best thing on pragati

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:43.380
[Amit Varma]: Suggested a great metric how many men cook or do domestic work would this indicate women are being empowered?

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.820
[Guest 1]: Yes, so i'm going to draw attention to this friends episode

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:53.620
[Guest 1]: Where ross and rachel get a male nanny, right and they eventually fire him because that's how

00:40:54.660 --> 00:41:01.940
[Guest 1]: Fundamentally insecure ross feels about this kind qualified person who is working for him

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.060
[Guest 1]: um, just because he's in a space that he's

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:12.500
[Guest 1]: Really not accustomed to seeing men in um, so I think yeah men taking other gender roles is indicative

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.420
[Guest 1]: But there's also a thing that it's an economy of having lesser jobs

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.380
[Guest 1]: Men will take whatever that comes their way is what I think. What do you think?

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:27.700
[Guest 2]: So, uh, one thing is the fact that uh men taking generally a female oriented job

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:32.020
[Guest 2]: Is an indicator of the fact that within the household the dynamic is changing

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.740
[Guest 2]: In the sense that uh, if uh, there is this thing called, uh, the decision burden

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.340
[Guest 2]: I don't know, uh the exact name

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:43.140
[Guest 2]: But the idea is that even though you would a man would clean dishes and do the three tasks you ask him to

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.700
[Unknown]: The managerial task is

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.980
[Unknown]: It's called the emotional. It's called the mental load. Yeah, that that still stays. So that is one problem with that

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.540
[Guest 2]: um, the other thing is that

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.780
[Guest 2]: As you mentioned if you see more number of men as cooks around you

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:02.900
[Guest 2]: That does not mean that oh now men are uh, men want to become cooks

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.980
[Guest 2]: And so the gender stereotype is being broken

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:10.420
[Guest 2]: No, uh, we have very little number of jobs to begin with and men are expected to go take the job

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:16.180
[Guest 2]: And also chefs and women are cooks. Yes, exactly men are chefs and women are even in a household if men are cooks

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.020
[Guest 1]: They will not do the cleaning

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.740
[Amit Varma]: The women will do the cleaning. I've got to tell you I don't do the cleaning in my household, but neither does my wife

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.740
[Amit Varma]: We have a maid

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:29.380
[Guest 1]: We have a maid who comes in and does it which is a maid. You have outsourced. A male maid, not a male. Yeah

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:37.380
[Guest 2]: A non-male maid. So that's the idea, right? You have actor and actress you have uh terms for each of those

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.380
[Guest 2]: professions which had dominant male or female persons

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:48.900
[Guest 2]: But you don't have maid and some like some female version of it. Male servant. Because male servant not

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.220
[Guest 2]: Male servant is the house

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.940
[Guest 2]: Servant sort of guy who would stay with you

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:59.700
[Guest 2]: Uh, the maids that come are all female. You don't have a male maid term

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.580
[Amit Varma]: Maid in your head is a female word. Yeah

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.980
[Amit Varma]: Men as domestic help is also I think Anupam has suggested this metric and one very interesting and awesome metric

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:15.060
[Amit Varma]: Which is also easy to get data on which Nidhi you suggested was how many men download big basket apps?

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.180
[Guest 3]: Yeah, so, you know the burden of doing uh

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:25.160
[Guest 3]: uh grocery not just deciding what to cook but also getting all the ingredients falls on women because

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.160
[Guest 3]: you know, that's how we divide the gender roles, but if you see if

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:35.560
[Guest 3]: Big basket app has been downloaded by men and they are using it that tells you that that the roles are changing that the women

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:42.360
[Guest 3]: Are being empowered the men are also worrying about it. I think another metric that I think would speak of women empowerment is

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.520
[Guest 3]: fathers

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:50.920
[Guest 3]: Dropping and picking children up on weekdays as well. Not just on weekends and attending ptms

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.360
[Guest 3]: So if parent teacher meetings are not just attended by mothers

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:59.160
[Guest 3]: But fathers that also tells that they are taking part in care work as well

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:05.640
[Guest 3]: And if it happens on a weekday even more so because hey the mother also has a job to go to so sometimes it's the mother

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:10.440
[Guest 2]: Sometimes it's the father. Nidhi the first one. I I had a thing about the first thing

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.640
[Guest 2]: so, um a lot of e-commerce apps and my problem with counting them as an indicator is that

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.420
[Guest 2]: Women do not use the e-commerce

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.520
[Guest 2]: Apps for the payment end of it

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.600
[Guest 2]: So what you would do is you would have a phone because you're a man in the house

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.320
[Guest 2]: So you of course have a phone you would have the app

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.960
[Guest 2]: Uh, you would make your mother select what she needs and then make the payment

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:39.320
[Guest 2]: She would a not be told how to make the payment like i'm sure that's changing and a lot of people would be like no

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.560
[Guest 2]: We're teaching our parents how to do it. But of course

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.240
[Guest 2]: Just generally if you have uh money enough to buy

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.200
[Guest 2]: A phone for one of your parents is generally the father

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.920
[Amit Varma]: That's a great example of the seen in the unseen like one metric which seems to work. Yeah, but not

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.720
[Guest 1]: I actually wanted to add to your second point when uh, you're taking your daughter to school. I'm sure you'll see this but now

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.920
[Guest 1]: Uh, what I hear is that uh parent teacher meetings

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.240
[Guest 1]: uh schools

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.240
[Guest 1]: Send daily whatsapp messages to all parents

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.280
[Guest 1]: informing them of what homework your kids have

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:18.600
[Guest 1]: Which is horrible because you know now your parents know everything that you're up to but in most schools

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:25.480
[Guest 1]: The registered mobile number is always that of the mothers unless it is a single parent household

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.440
[Guest 1]: Yes, even if it is a family which is divorced and the child is staying with her father

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:36.120
[Amit Varma]: The registered number will still be that is it a good thing or a bad thing because this would also indicate that mothers are more

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.480
[Amit Varma]: responsible

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.480
[Unknown]: But do you want?

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.640
[Guest 3]: So I think a proxy is that you know, if they actually go and pick up the child, I mean if

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.920
[Guest 3]: Or if they are going for these ptms, like I said, right that shows that hey

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:57.800
[Guest 3]: They are as involved in this care work and they might become the emergency contact. Okay. I'm also going to counter that point

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.080
[Unknown]: slightly

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.160
[Guest 1]: Because the way I look at it, right?

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:07.320
[Guest 1]: Um, if you take a two-parent household where the mother is doing a lot of house work before she goes to work

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.040
[Guest 1]: The father will drop the child because he can drop the child earlier and then get to work

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.080
[Guest 1]: Whereas the woman will have to clean up after everyone has left home

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:20.520
[Guest 3]: And only then will she be able to that's why I said if the father is also picking up the child on a weekday

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.320
[Guest 3]: All right, that means that means they have to leave work and do it

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.560
[Guest 3]: So if somebody has to pick up their child at 2 p.m

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:31.320
[Guest 3]: It means hey, sometimes you do it. Sometimes your wife does it which means that there is, you know, some equality

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.320
[Amit Varma]: Darling, my office was busy

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.640
[Amit Varma]: Let's let's kind of go back to our earlier metric. We have many metrics

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.960
[Amit Varma]: So, I don't know if you should even go through it like this category by category since we've made them. Let's

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.480
[Amit Varma]: social empowerment of women

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:52.520
[Amit Varma]: Number of male kids with the last child women enrolling for Coursera and Nidhi you suggested women taking abortion decisions alone

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:57.800
[Guest 3]: Yeah, so, um one there's a lot of sex selection, right? So female children are

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:04.440
[Guest 3]: Generally aborted and then it comes from the family. So from the husband or from the husband's

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.680
[Guest 3]: father mother

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.960
[Guest 3]: But if a woman is taking that decision independently

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.560
[Guest 3]: One is that you know that woman decides I don't want to have this child that is empowerment

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:22.440
[Guest 3]: Herself and that she is responsible for her own health, right? So sometimes actually this um

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.240
[Guest 3]: aborting the female

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:31.160
[Guest 3]: Uh, you know fetus also happens at a stage where it is dangerous for the pregnant woman, right?

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.960
[Guest 3]: And at that time a woman by herself would not decide to do it because it's danger to your own life

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.200
[Guest 3]: But if a woman's deciding

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:46.680
[Guest 3]: but if a woman's deciding before that term it tells you of a woman is empowered because she can take this decision now by

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.320
[Guest 3]: Herself that whether she wants to risk her life or not

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:54.920
[Guest 3]: Whether she wants a child or not irrespective of whether it's a male child or a male fetus

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.280
[Guest 2]: I'm majorly wary of that because

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.920
[Guest 2]: a lot of these decisions in Indian setup are taken by the family and

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:08.600
[Guest 3]: So see again, that's why I said that if it is decided by if a woman independently

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.000
[Guest 1]: Then it will go back to whether or not women have free will

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.800
[Amit Varma]: No, that's the thing right coming back to the society

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.040
[Amit Varma]: But I I think we agreed that

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:21.080
[Amit Varma]: Sort of this is a metric that is impossible to kind of get data on and women are mostly seen as

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:25.560
[Guest 2]: the other thing that they had mentioned was the sale of oral contraception, I think that is uh,

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.760
[Guest 3]: Which is I control. Uh, yeah, you know

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.680
[Guest 3]: how I

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.680
[Guest 3]: When do I want to reproduce?

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.640
[Guest 3]: Right. So yes, I want to be sexually active

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.760
[Guest 3]: But that doesn't mean that it is only for the purpose of reproducing and I want to control when I want to

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.560
[Guest 3]: Bear a child. Yeah, and I think that's also women empowerment because you would see that in the

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:51.640
[Guest 3]: You know in poor people the age at which women bear children is much lower

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:58.360
[Amit Varma]: Than in you know people who are educated and in fact, that's possibly another metric like the age at which you have the first child

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.640
[Guest 3]: Yeah is alone because educated women and who work tend to have children much later in life

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.840
[Amit Varma]: And and Hamsini in this I've got there's another metric which you suggested

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:11.560
[Amit Varma]: Which I think is a fantastic metric for seeing how empowered women are which is the number of women in prison

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.480
[Guest 1]: Yes, uh the number of women in prison

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.360
[Guest 1]: simply because uh

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.200
[Guest 1]: First there is a very mother india attitude that we have towards our women

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.280
[Guest 1]: Right and the second is that if they are in prison, then they have been convicted

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:31.560
[Guest 1]: It shows that they have an agency to do something even if that is a criminal act

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.960
[Guest 1]: They're going towards something a second point that I wanted to add to that

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.480
[Guest 1]: Another metric that you can look at is the number of children in prison, right?

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.720
[Guest 1]: Because often what happens with women, uh is that if they have children

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.560
[Guest 1]: There's no one else to care for

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:50.120
[Guest 1]: Then generally these children get sent to the prison where they grow up with their mother

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean innocent children or mothers who've been convicted grow up in prisons. Yes in india

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.920
[Guest 1]: And you had a fact devika about juvenile homes, right?

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:06.520
[Guest 2]: So the one of my colleagues sarah, she was working on this topic before she joined takshashila and

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.080
[Guest 2]: One of the crazy findings is that

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.640
[Guest 2]: We do not have spaces for uh, juvenile female offenders

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:18.360
[Guest 2]: So, uh instead of sending them to the jail, they're sent to the orphanages

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:25.880
[Guest 1]: So male juveniles get sent to juvie homes female juveniles get sent to orphanages

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:31.320
[Guest 1]: I want you to wrap your head around that for just a minute. But how are you linking this with women empowerment?

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:37.560
[Guest 3]: I'm, sorry. I kind of know this was a fun fact that they become even your other metric about my point in being in

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.640
[Guest 3]: Prison, how are you?

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.000
[Amit Varma]: I I think her broad point is that if more women are in prison

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.440
[Amit Varma]: That's actually a sign of women's empowerment because these are women who are actually going out and doing something instead of sitting at home

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.440
[Amit Varma]: Okay

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.360
[Guest 3]: Regardless of whether it's a proxy

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.400
[Amit Varma]: It's a proxy indicator. Yeah. Yeah

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.400
[Guest 2]: And also the fact that I think one of our colleagues mentioned about white collar crimes

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:07.960
[Guest 2]: The thing is that this is fighting the stereotype that uh women again going back to the fact that women are always right

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.920
[Guest 2]: So they will always be empathetic so they will always do the right thing so they can't read the war news, right?

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:19.160
[Guest 2]: Uh, this goes beyond the fact that you realize that a lot of women are taking up professions which are legal or illegal

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:24.600
[Guest 2]: Uh to and are considered to be a co-conspirator for something which they would generally look for a male

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:30.200
[Guest 1]: So white collar crimes are great because it means that the woman is educated and then she knows how to get around the system

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.320
[Guest 3]: Not well enough. There have been studies which say that

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:40.040
[Guest 3]: Women can be as corrupt as men if there is an opportunity. So there is absolutely no difference in attitude

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:50.440
[Guest 3]: Of you know taking bribes in women and men if there is an opportunity. So since we're never going to get rid of corruption in India, it's an equal opportunity for them to interrupt.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.960
[Amit Varma]: Which brings us to our next category. It's a lovely natural segue

00:51:54.360 --> 00:52:00.760
[Amit Varma]: Women the financial empowerment of women and some of the like Anupam suggested two-wheeler and car ownership

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:07.240
[Guest 2]: Which should be easy data. Which is an easy data. Uh, you have uh data on how many women have

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:13.500
[Guest 2]: Ownership of assets you can do that. Uh, there is bank accounts opened under the women women's name

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.860
[Guest 1]: um

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.260
[Guest 1]: This how many women commit credit card fraud?

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:26.300
[Amit Varma]: How many women have credit cards and under their own names how many pay their own credit card bills how many women like shabani

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.220
[Amit Varma]: Mentioned how many women pay their own phone bills? How many women take loans?

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:35.420
[Amit Varma]: How many women take loans is a great one. Uh, one that nithin mentioned was how many women do property litigation?

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.620
[Amit Varma]: Uh, how many women have property in their names to begin with?

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:44.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, and actually that may also have a flip side in the sense that a lot of men will have their property in their

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:50.940
[Guest 1]: Yeah, yeah for tax and black money purposes, but all of this drives back to the fact that you know

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.180
[Guest 1]: Financial independence is the core of women's empowerment

00:52:55.740 --> 00:53:02.220
[Guest 1]: Um one metric that i've been reading about is that I think two percent of the women in our country live by themselves

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:09.020
[Guest 1]: Um, which is not a very difficult fact to believe unless you're in one of those really privileged elite circles

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.740
[Guest 1]: That it is true women rarely live

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:17.900
[Guest 1]: Amongst themselves right, uh by themselves like if you and that is why it's so difficult for them to get flats to stay in

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.020
[Guest 1]: If they're staying without family and so on the idea of bachelor girls

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:25.100
[Guest 1]: For example is a very unpopular opinion because it means that a woman is

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:31.600
[Guest 1]: Financially independent and therefore can do whatever she wants socially because now she has agency to act coming back to the point that I made

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.160
[Guest 2]: This is this is my definition of a woman empowerment

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.760
[Guest 2]: but

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.760
[Guest 2]: To the point of uh, the flip side of this entire conversation, right?

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.520
[Guest 2]: Financial inclusion in in india right now if you look by numbers might show a different picture than they really are

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:51.520
[Guest 2]: Uh, for example, I might have a bank account on my name, but I do not even have a bank account

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:56.160
[Guest 2]: For example, I might have a bank account on my name, but I do not even know how to use a credit card

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.480
[Guest 2]: Or a debit card, right? So, uh, yes

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.400
[Guest 2]: Households do have more than one bank account and some of them are named account holders are women

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.440
[Guest 2]: But they do not make the decision now. This is a common argument and a well-known argument, right?

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:15.520
[Guest 2]: Uh, my uh contention to this is that this is what I see is a first step that yes

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.320
[Guest 2]: Right now the account that has been opened, uh under the woman's name is of course not that woman's

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.760
[Guest 2]: Uh, but the idea that that woman can

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.080
[Guest 2]: Knows that she has to sign the paper if you want to take that money out of that account

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.560
[Guest 2]: At least gives a sense of authority

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.640
[Guest 2]: Uh, though it's it's highly uh overrated right now

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:41.520
[Guest 2]: Um, most of the financial decisions in a household are completely taken by a man like women are just meant to sign certain documents

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.960
[Guest 2]: And that's it. Uh, they do not get a call same thing with land ownership, right? That's generally tax evasion

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:51.440
[Guest 3]: A lot of these didn't someone also mention that uh women signing their wills

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.160
[Unknown]: Yeah as one of the indicators which means that they want they have property and that they have the agency to actually then decide

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.920
[Guest 2]: Not really, so they have property because their uh husband needed taxes. So i'll tell you this is a grim situation

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.720
[Guest 2]: I know I sound very pessimistic right now and a lot more women right now have access and I agree

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.600
[Guest 2]: But mostly what happens is the man in the family decides who gets to have what property or what are set on their name

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:20.960
[Guest 2]: The man decides what property would be named after the female in the house for tax evasion

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.540
[Guest 2]: Or not for tax evasion or just for the distribution

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:30.000
[Guest 2]: And then that person creates the document the idea is that the woman still does not have access because she does not create that will

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.160
[Guest 1]: She does not decide in that sense

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.400
[Guest 1]: I also agree with you because you have so many schemes for women right if women save

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.760
[Guest 1]: Then it's a better you get tax breaks and so on

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:46.720
[Guest 1]: And what happens is that this is pure nominal representation. It's how political representation and they're deemed by the men in the family

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:51.040
[Guest 1]: They're given by the men in the family, right whenever this is my argument against saying

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.540
[Guest 1]: Oh, you know, we have so many women panchayat

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.640
[Guest 1]: Heads in our country and then I say, okay

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:03.520
[Guest 1]: How many of them are the wives sisters mothers of men who have been panchayat heads or want to be panchayat?

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:09.200
[Guest 3]: Then a good indicator would be women heads of panchayats who do not have any family

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:16.640
[Guest 2]: Yes, uh connections. Yes, and that would be like metric non-existent because who in politics currently it can because I okay

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.200
[Guest 1]: I want you to remember the women's reservation bill that never got passed because on the day

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.160
[Guest 1]: The multiple days that it was supposed to be passed

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:28.480
[Guest 1]: Ministers male ministers stood at the gate saying go home

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:33.440
[Guest 1]: Unless you want to lose power do not come into the parliament to vote today

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:40.720
[Guest 2]: Yeah, but again the reservation doesn't work really like I have a major problem with when we keep on saying it's like, uh

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:46.480
[Guest 2]: Indian way of committee, uh banalo, right like just make a committee if there is a concern in the country right now

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.400
[Guest 2]: Okay, just we have a committee which is making a document on it. Did we ever implement it?

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:55.200
[Guest 2]: It's a cop-out right like yes, i'll create 33 seats

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.520
[Guest 2]: There'll be three women at best two out of which will be there because their husbands were in politics

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.640
[Guest 2]: uh, the idea is that um, whenever we look at a solution from the

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:11.040
[Guest 2]: Suppliers end and not from the demand and this is coming back to economics in the sense that um

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:17.540
[Guest 2]: Look at simple education, right? Why a voucher is better than uh, forcing schools to hire students from certain backgrounds

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.960
[Guest 2]: because uh

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:23.040
[Guest 2]: yes schools will hire that that if you ask them to but does that mean that

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:30.240
[Guest 2]: Those kids are getting that sort of exposure that you expect them to have not necessarily instead if they get to choose so a huge

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.520
[Guest 2]: debate

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:38.960
[Guest 2]: In education sector right now is that should we give vouchers to students and let them choose whatever school they want or uh, should we just?

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.360
[Guest 2]: Uh create enough government schools around and answer generally comes out is government school, which is a bad idea

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.360
[Guest 2]: Yeah, you want to empower them to make the decision and give the same level of quality that the rest of the people have

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.640
[Guest 2]: Right. So similarly if you come to the entire thing of parliament, right?

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.520
[Guest 2]: Uh, you will create a 33 reservation. And yes, uh for first two years

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.920
[Guest 2]: You'll be like four women will enter and be like what a success we have four women in in the parliament

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:08.400
[Guest 2]: But does that mean that on the grassroot? We'll have more women, uh standing up for elections

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.920
[Amit Varma]: And also what I think is reservations are also aren't they a very patriarchal solution?

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.920
[Guest 2]: It's like say hum to me it may see dating

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.880
[Amit Varma]: Rather than that you want women to stand up and say

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:30.000
[Guest 1]: One good metric would be to see how many villages have beyond 50 reservation in

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:36.720
[Guest 3]: Would also be if so, let's see, but this will have to be done in a longer, uh time frame

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:41.200
[Guest 3]: So you let's say you had reservations for 10 years or 20 years wherein, you know

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:48.000
[Guest 3]: So whatever 10 percent 30 percent women, uh reservation was there after that after the sunset clause. How did it pan out?

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.280
[Guest 2]: Did actually women continue to get more seats? We never see the sunset of these clauses

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:57.840
[Guest 1]: Another thing that's here, right whenever uh, this is

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:04.320
[Guest 1]: In politics again in terms of representation women taking women-like decisions. So you say okay

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:11.920
[Guest 1]: We have elected margaret thatcher or indira gandhi and yes, they're women and that's great. Sure, but uh,

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.760
[Guest 1]: A they're considered to be strong leaders because they emanate

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.320
[Guest 1]: male masculine qualities, but

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.120
[Guest 2]: I'll contradict that no. No, what i'm saying is

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:28.480
[Guest 1]: That is one idea that exists and the second is what have they actually done for women empowerment?

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:34.400
[Amit Varma]: What policies what and actually i'm i'm a big fan of margaret thatcher. I think she did a lot. I think indira

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.120
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi was an absolute monster and completely the opposite

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.920
[Guest 2]: What sorry?

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:51.440
[Guest 2]: Okay, no, so my point is that two things one is look at it from a meta angle we correlate all the dominant

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:56.640
[Guest 2]: Uh decision-making systems that nidhi had mentioned right the hard decisions to a male sort of thinking

00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.520
[Guest 2]: Uh, if you are prime minister of a country and you in whatever perspective i'm not taking sides

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:06.720
[Guest 2]: Uh thought that okay emergency is the call of the day. It's not a manly decision

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.840
[Guest 2]: It's the decision that person took at that given point of time

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:17.200
[Guest 2]: Uh, she was thinking like a person she the decisions that you take at such positions are generally hard decisions

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.120
[Guest 2]: You won't be making soft decisions like should I go have vanilla ice cream or not?

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.960
[Guest 2]: Right, it's majorly uh it and they are almost all have very high cost benefit attached to them

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.960
[Guest 2]: So they're none of them are easy decisions

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.360
[Guest 2]: So at this moment if you think that they didn't

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:38.000
[Guest 2]: Act in a womanly manner when they were taking a decision. It's a stereotype that you are both kind of agree and disagree

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.280
[Amit Varma]: Agree in the sense that yes that I don't think gender has much to do with that

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.560
[Amit Varma]: She was driven by a lust for power whatever it takes to get power

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.680
[Amit Varma]: I will do it

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:52.720
[Amit Varma]: But I also think is true and going back to biology is that I think men are hardwired to lust for power more than women are

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Quite simply and therefore it might seem that women who lust for power are behaving in a manly way

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:05.760
[Amit Varma]: And not all of this is socially constructed. It's just it is biological as well. Yeah, it is biological as well

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.920
[Amit Varma]: but I mean they feed into each other and

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.040
[Amit Varma]: You know

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:16.080
[Amit Varma]: Our job as members of society and people who are contributing to culture is to mitigate all these inequalities of human nature

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.760
[Amit Varma]: Which involves also not denying them but regardless, I mean, I basically agree

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:26.640
[Guest 2]: But one of the indicators that we had mentioned was number of women, uh standing in elections or head of states

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:34.420
[Guest 2]: Uh, other than that a number of women, uh related issues in political manifestos, right when parties are coming up with elections

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.580
[Amit Varma]: Um, which is a great metric because you think hey half your voters are women

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:46.660
[Guest 2]: So then they do only prohibition that's done completely for women almost in all states and that's literally counterproductive. Yeah, that is

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.020
[Guest 1]: And the other one is uh, they give you money if you're getting married

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:58.020
[Guest 1]: Right in karnataka. I think there's also a scheme for if you get married, they will give you money which

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.660
[Guest 1]: I think is the most useless

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:07.080
[Guest 1]: Useless allocation of a state's resource if there was one have a smart lady strike to game that

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.960
[Guest 1]: It seems like you can make a lot of money

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.960
[Guest 2]: Policy have you ever considered

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.440
[Amit Varma]: It's a job

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on. So we've done social empowerment. We have done financial empowerment and they feed into each other sexual empowerment

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:28.920
[Guest 3]: Nidhi one metric you suggested was how many women go and buy condoms? Yeah, so if you know, um right now

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:34.120
[Guest 3]: it's the men who are supposed to kind of have the condom with them or go by because

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.400
[Guest 3]: Also, by the way, I don't know if you know this if I were to go and buy sanitary napkins in a pharmacy

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.800
[Guest 3]: They would wrap it in paper put it in a black

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.280
[Guest 3]: Polythene because it can't be shown

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.040
[Guest 3]: Associated with buying sanitary napkins now if as a woman I go and buy condoms

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.640
[Guest 3]: You know, that's just abominable. How can I how can I be sexually active?

01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:01.560
[Guest 3]: So I think if more women go and buy condoms it speaks of empowerment and it speaks of changing

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.220
[Amit Varma]: Attitudes. Absolutely. Maybe we can get ai to look at cctv footages of pharmacies

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:14.760
[Guest 3]: Another proxy could be um, and I don't have any data on this but number of sex toys designed for women

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.480
[Guest 3]: Lovely. Yeah. Yeah, so that would talk of

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.560
[Guest 3]: You were just saying that okay women also can do this for pleasure

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Hmm, but is there a sex toy culture at all in india? For example, even men don't use sex toys, right?

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:26.920
[Guest 2]: there

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.640
[Guest 2]: There are actually sites for women sex toys also by the way

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.880
[Amit Varma]: And actually women would need sex toys more because it's a woman who tend to be more unsatisfied. Yeah

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.640
[Guest 1]: I was actually thinking on your first example

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.720
[Guest 1]: Uh, one of my friends to mitigate the fact that she had to go to a pharmacy decided to use one of those apps that would

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.680
[Guest 1]: deliver

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.360
[Guest 1]: Home stuff so then uh when the person came and she opened the door

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:55.080
[Guest 1]: The delivery boy was staring at her as though, you know an explosion occurred and then she was just like, okay

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.440
[Guest 1]: And then he smiles very sweetly and she got very very creeped out

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:03.720
[Guest 1]: But the idea is that even if you're using delivery services for this the judgment completely exists

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:09.160
[Amit Varma]: And that's in fact another metric how many of these delivery people are male as opposed to female. I mean

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.680
[Amit Varma]: Uh shibani suggested how many women are on tinder? You said the same thing at the same time

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:20.600
[Guest 1]: Yeah, because there is uh, also the idea that there are far fewer women on dating apps than men

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.240
[Guest 1]: And this is very normal that like on tinder for example men would swipe 50 times

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:30.280
[Guest 1]: Whereas a woman will match with anyone who she swipes with simply because there are those few women

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.720
[Guest 2]: So men compensate for the emotional labor women go through in a relationship with some physical labor at the start of it

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:42.040
[Guest 2]: I think also that we are lesser in number in general. It's just absolute numbers. There are lesser women than men not by so much

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:48.760
[Guest 1]: Sure that and also the idea that uh a woman actually going out and saying I don't want an arranged marriage. I

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.080
[Guest 1]: i'm looking

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.440
[Guest 1]: For uh having sex with a total stranger itself seems like a very counterintuitive idea

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.620
[Guest 1]: To a lot of people right so being on a dating app automatically

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:07.020
[Guest 1]: Indicates that you're there because you're looking for something and I guess that in a sort of way is empowerment

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.480
[Amit Varma]: And also it tells you something about how men look at the women they meet on dating apps

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Yes, it's like oh, okay. So if I meet her on tinder, i'm not going to marry her though

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.520
[Amit Varma]: I know for a couple of tender marriages, but you know, that's yeah

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:25.800
[Amit Varma]: Moving on to I think the last category but the biggest category I mean encompasses a lot women given space

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Dash respect by men which could be something as simple as getting rid of manholes

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.360
[Amit Varma]: where you have more women on panels and you try to have

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.560
[Amit Varma]: As much diversity as you can or it could be

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:43.640
[Guest 2]: Women in top positions that yeah, so this is uh, this is a data I have finally

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.520
[Guest 2]: Uh the number of startup founders or co-founders in 2015 in india

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:52.360
[Guest 2]: Uh, the female of them were just nine percent and what was it earlier?

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:57.640
[Guest 1]: Like do we have a sense of what or what is it in the us just to must be much more must be much more

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:03.080
[Guest 1]: But I think devika actually had at one point in time. I don't know if your opinion has changed on this now

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:10.040
[Guest 1]: That uh, you don't look at putting together a manhole. You should not get a token woman on board

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.160
[Guest 2]: I have sent like a token woman and I don't like that

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:18.120
[Guest 2]: I because see now the criteria for a woman is if you look at a panel and you invite it you look for another female

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.440
[Guest 2]: Because otherwise you're the token female then

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.120
[Guest 2]: Are you there because you are so good in your field or are you there because they did not?

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.400
[Amit Varma]: So this becomes a game theory problem

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.440
[Amit Varma]: It's like if there are two potato chips, everyone will take the last one

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.560
[Guest 2]: I know the second last one but not the last one it creates an

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, and I actually have been running the policy course for so long and um,

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.480
[Guest 2]: Frankly in like in a long time that I have been conducting workshops where we call uh speakers

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:48.280
[Guest 2]: Have consciously never thought of the person from the gender and still managed to get really, uh accomplished female

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.560
[Guest 2]: academicians speakers on all uh topics

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:57.500
[Guest 2]: But the idea that the moment you degrade me to my gender rather than my qualification

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.340
[Guest 2]: somehow I find it very insulting that if let's say

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:02.300
[Guest 2]: uh

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.780
[Guest 2]: Humsini is called on the table because you know

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:09.180
[Guest 2]: We are talking about international relations and there are only four women in the country who talk about international relations

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.380
[Guest 2]: She has written one article. Okay. She's done. Nothing. She's just

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.340
[Amit Varma]: Actually, that's a hypothetical

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.900
[Amit Varma]: Example she's written much more than me

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.700
[Amit Varma]: As an editor, I know what an expert she is. Yeah

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:28.380
[Guest 1]: Um, yes, but what they're saying is that it's unfair to me as an academician that you put my gender before you put

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.060
[Amit Varma]: My so the other side of that is yeah

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.580
[Amit Varma]: So I buy the argument that when you're putting together a panel

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.660
[Amit Varma]: You should not condescend to women by having a token woman. But the other side to that is and this is

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:45.100
[Amit Varma]: A revelation i've got from reading philip tetlock's great book super forecasting and it's backed up everywhere. Is that the best decision making?

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:51.740
[Amit Varma]: Uh that good decision making correlates with diversity the greater the diversity in any group which is making decisions

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:59.260
[Amit Varma]: so therefore not for reasons of tokenism or representation, but just from reasons of efficiency of you should

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:05.980
[Amit Varma]: Normatively try to make a group as diverse as possible without resorting to tokenism. And I think there is also

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:10.700
[Guest 3]: Merit in saying that once you have a woman on the panel

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:16.380
[Guest 3]: I'm, you know, I agree to all your points. It creates some aspiration among people who are watching

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:21.820
[Guest 3]: So other girls who are trying to study international relations if they see another woman up there

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:27.740
[Guest 3]: She might be there only for tokenism, but everyone else who's watching, you know, there is this aspirational aspect that hey

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:34.700
[Guest 3]: Even I can be there someday, right and that's how you kind of change the whole ecosystem around this similarly for sports, right?

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.100
[Guest 3]: if I never see any

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.460
[Guest 3]: um

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:41.180
[Guest 3]: world-class badminton players as a

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.180
[Guest 3]: Girl when i'm in my teens and i've just started to you know

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:52.380
[Guest 3]: Learn to play badminton. I would think well I can never get there. But if you know pv sindhu can be there if uh,

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:59.340
[Guest 3]: Saina can be there then I know that he I stand as much a chance to do better in badminton in india

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:05.100
[Guest 3]: As the boys because I see these role models and those role models might have had a very tough journey

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.780
[Amit Varma]: Right, and that's a fantastic point and i'll take a quick detour here

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:13.980
[Amit Varma]: I wrote a profile of sakshi malik a couple of years ago a long feature on her after she won the olympic medal

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:20.460
[Amit Varma]: And the question that I wanted to explore and it really interested me was how come in the most misogynistic state in this country

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:25.420
[Amit Varma]: Which is haryana you have so many female wrestlers coming up. What is traditionally a man?

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:30.140
[Amit Varma]: And the reason for that and the reason for that was uh, pure patriarchy

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:35.900
[Amit Varma]: The reason for that is that around the late 70s early 80s. There were these former wrestlers who were now coaches

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:37.580
[Amit Varma]: Who didn't happen to have sons?

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:41.900
[Amit Varma]: They had daughters and suddenly they found that wrestling has become a medal sport

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:45.740
[Amit Varma]: So it was a way of achieving their aspirations in wrestling

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:51.180
[Amit Varma]: But because they didn't have sons here you got to do it with the daughters and that kind of happened to create a culture of

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:57.100
[Amit Varma]: Wrestling in haryana, but what that means as you correctly pointed out is that regardless of how these women got there

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:01.420
[Guest 1]: They can still be role models for girls. I think one thing is that just

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:10.140
[Guest 1]: Seeing women in public spaces seeing women in uh private spaces where you have not seen them before itself has an aspirational quality

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:16.140
[Guest 1]: Which is why one of the earlier metrics that we came up with is the number of girls in public sports fields, right?

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.300
[Guest 1]: Is that you automatically?

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.660
[Guest 1]: This is not about kinship

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:24.940
[Guest 1]: But the idea is that women are present on your mind space and I think that itself

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:31.740
[Guest 1]: Will provide the diversity in decision making or just in the way society looks at so I mean this is you know

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:37.500
[Amit Varma]: wherever you're listening to this if you just go out on the street in the middle of a day and look around I'll tell

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:41.280
[Amit Varma]: You a lot like I remembered I toured through pakistan when I was covering the cricket tour in 2006

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.700
[Amit Varma]: and I remember going to peshawar and a bunch of us went out and

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:50.220
[Amit Varma]: One of us was a girl and she was literally the only girl we saw that evening in crowded streets

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.980
[Amit Varma]: We went on food walks. We had kebabs

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:57.100
[Amit Varma]: We did things just one the only woman in the place was you mean the non-male the only

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:04.380
[Guest 2]: Very apt and and you see this difference I think even in different parts of cities in different localities

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:09.740
[Guest 2]: How many there are localities where you know as a female you're not supposed to be around there after certain hours, right?

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:15.580
[Guest 2]: Uh, so yeah coming back to the complete circle of my point which and this is where the other argument wins, right?

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:20.380
[Guest 2]: Like I would be that token woman. So as an individual I might be like what am I doing here?

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:26.860
[Guest 2]: I completely agree. It has social benefits for the future. Uh, the same thing as converting all the

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:34.380
[Guest 2]: Sentences where we used he earlier we have started using she pronouns as she's I actually had a problem with that when it started

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.340
[Guest 2]: And then I realized okay

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:40.540
[Guest 2]: this is the same thing right like when your example is a very male oriented example, and then you see she as the

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:45.900
[Guest 2]: Pronoun being used then you're like, okay, maybe as far as possible. By the way, I try to use she I mean, it's it's

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.780
[Guest 2]: Instinctive for me I for me a lot of these things don't come naturally as

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:55.980
[Guest 2]: An answer because I try to break the gender barrier in my thought process itself

01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:00.300
[Guest 2]: So if I was a man, would I be asking myself these questions and no

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.420
[Guest 2]: So why am I asking myself these questions as a female right?

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:08.620
[Guest 2]: Like a man who goes on a panel does not question his credibility as a female when you go to a panel

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:13.500
[Guest 2]: You are like am I here because I did well or am I here because they didn't find a woman

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.220
[Guest 2]: Other than me and that really bothers me a lot

01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:22.140
[Guest 3]: But I do see right like I think i'm going back to amit's point about biology and psychology of women

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:25.820
[Guest 3]: I think i've heard of these studies where they say that when a woman looks into the mirror

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.780
[Guest 3]: She would think oh how i'm not perfect and you know

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:33.980
[Guest 3]: I need to do this to make myself look better as opposed to a man when he looks into the mirror

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.980
[Guest 3]: He sees this perfect handsome

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:39.980
[Guest 1]: Is it amit?

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:44.780
[Guest 3]: All of you are sitting and looking at me and laughing which doesn't do much for my self-esteem

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:50.780
[Guest 3]: And also how women always undersell themselves and men always oversell themselves not just in cvs

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:53.900
[Guest 3]: But also when they go to interviews a woman would think a thousand times

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:58.620
[Guest 3]: Biological or is that social what I would I don't think it's it's you know

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:04.140
[Amit Varma]: What I would say is that all of us men or women are hardwired to be self-delusional because that is the only way we can

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:11.500
[Amit Varma]: Survive in this world and I think that the fact that women often in such situations lack confidence or are questioning themselves all the time

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.260
[Amit Varma]: I think that's more of a social thing and it's a very sad reflection

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:18.220
[Guest 1]: for example if you take um

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:25.900
[Guest 1]: Negotiations for salaries. Uh, I actually was reading uh an article which was talking about the united states of america

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.860
[Guest 1]: but the idea that women negotiate far less for salaries than men do

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:36.540
[Guest 1]: And just intuitively this made a lot of sense for me because I see women as underselling themselves

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.900
[Guest 1]: And I see that as a social construct. I don't see that as them

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:44.220
[Amit Varma]: Putting pitting their self-worth lower just because they're and again it goes back to what?

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.740
[Amit Varma]: You know my friend Uday had said what are you optimizing for and girls are taught to optimize for?

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:53.900
[Amit Varma]: You know pleasantness and acceptability and then assertiveness is a bad thing

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.580
[Guest 3]: Biologically i'm just saying that is how it is

01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.080
[Guest 3]: Psychologically somehow we've been

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.160
[Guest 3]: Cultured and we've been you know, uh, we are told that

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.960
[Guest 3]: You undersell and it's okay to undersell yourself as long as you're getting the things

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:15.040
[Guest 3]: So I think one of the indicators of women empowerment would also be how many women are into the high paying jobs

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.800
[Guest 3]: Right, right and if is there parity

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.960
[Guest 3]: In what a woman ceo earns and what a man, uh, on short answer. No

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.480
[Amit Varma]: No

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean that data we do have

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.160
[Amit Varma]: Moving on with you know the subject of women given space respect by men

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:39.120
[Amit Varma]: Anupam your fellow economist friend. Yeah, Devika came up with generic products that keep women in mind

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:47.120
[Guest 2]: Uh, that was my uh recent crib on social media where uh, if you see phone sizes, they're just getting bigger the pockets for uh,

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.600
[Guest 1]: Female clothing and I mean

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.440
[Amit Varma]: Is going to start with pockets

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.080
[Amit Varma]: So I think that's this is a metric. Yeah suggested pockets in women's traditional clothes

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.560
[Amit Varma]: Like now you can buy salwars which have pockets for example

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.040
[Guest 3]: And not just traditionally even western a lot of women's trousers don't have pockets

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.920
[Guest 2]: Or they have pockets that are so small that nothing will fit into a key or at best a key

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.560
[Amit Varma]: That's that's the size. That's not a 10 rupee note barely

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.520
[Amit Varma]: Not a 10 rupee note because your job is to be an adornment

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.640
[Guest 2]: You don't need function because they're selling me this other product called a purse or a bag and how will they sell me a purse?

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.360
[Guest 2]: Or a bag if I can keep everything on myself

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.880
[Guest 2]: Which is I have a long this is an entire podcast

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.680
[Guest 1]: Yeah, no, but so the idea is that women pay something called the pink tax, right?

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:38.720
[Guest 1]: They uh, just because there are toys or basic things from razors to whatever if it's in pink

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.320
[Guest 1]: It costs more. All right, and this is true across a variety of products. Wow

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.280
[Guest 1]: It's called the pink tax

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.440
[Guest 1]: So if you take razors, for example, and you compare the male and female razors

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:58.000
[Guest 1]: The pink one will cost you twice as much even though it is the same thing with the same blade, but it's pink you guys

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.560
[Amit Varma]: And the crazy thing is before the 1970s actually the colors were reversed blue was for girls and pink was for guys

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.840
[Amit Varma]: Uh, you know another one that um, we were discussing earlier another metric is air conditioning

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.460
[Amit Varma]: You know men and women feel cold at different temperatures

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:19.220
[Amit Varma]: And air conditioning was invented and then evolved and became commonplace in the 50s and 60s

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:24.420
[Amit Varma]: When workplaces were full of men with the token non-male and uh, and and therefore

01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.780
[Unknown]: 18 degrees

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:31.940
[Amit Varma]: And the standard air conditioning temperature evolved at a temperature that men are comfortable with but women feel too cold in

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:34.180
[Unknown]: And it would be interesting to see if that's changing today

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:40.740
[Guest 1]: So if you see women around you constantly wearing like shawls or jackets and they're complaining of feeling cold

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.340
[Guest 1]: Tell them that the society has been gaslighting them for years now

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:50.580
[Guest 2]: I'll tell you something which is less of a premium product than like an ac if you look at local trains in bombay

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:51.700
[Guest 2]: um

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.340
[Guest 2]: The handles where you can which you can hold

01:16:54.340 --> 01:17:00.260
[Guest 2]: Um are usually put at an average height of a man which is uh taller than an average height even in women's compartments

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:05.060
[Amit Varma]: Yes, even in the women's because they create compartments at the same time, right like then they painted pink

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:08.020
[Guest 2]: But before that it's the same compartment

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:13.860
[Guest 2]: So most of the women because of the average height being really uh shorter cannot reach the top handle

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.700
[Guest 2]: It's completely pointless for them

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:19.780
[Guest 2]: So if you are creating an entire compartment for women other than painting it pink

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.620
[Guest 2]: Why don't make the handles a bit lower in like longer in height?

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.620
[Guest 1]: I had the similar point about bathrooms

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:31.060
[Guest 1]: Have you noticed how always the lines to women's bathrooms are long? It's because they're not designed

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:36.340
[Guest 1]: They have so much space they will allocate the same amount of space to men's toilets and women's toilets

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:39.380
[Guest 1]: We can we let's not get into gendering of toilets at all

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:43.940
[Guest 1]: But uh, the idea is that right it's not designed for women

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.980
[Guest 1]: Um, it's not designed keeping them in mind at all

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:52.740
[Amit Varma]: And how about pressure cookers are not designed prestige pressure cookers which nathan jokingly suggested, you know

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.900
[Amit Varma]: the sale of prestige pressure cookers as a

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:59.380
[Amit Varma]: Metric because of what was that line? Will you tell us in your sonorous voice nidhi?

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:06.580
[Guest 3]: Who loves his wife, how can he love his prestige pressure cooker?

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:10.580
[Amit Varma]: Exactly and they should be used in the context of men buying pressure cookers to

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:15.300
[Guest 2]: Cook cook for their wives. How are pressure cookers not painted? Pink is beyond me

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:19.460
[Guest 2]: Like they are sold completely as female products. They should just paint it pink so that we know it's for us

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.860
[Unknown]: You know, it's for you. Yeah. Otherwise, how do we know it's not for us? Like, you know, it's

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.220
[Amit Varma]: We are not that smart

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:29.460
[Amit Varma]: So so now two of you have meetings to get to when we'll have to wind this podcast up soon

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.540
[Amit Varma]: So i'll i'll sort of just buy you

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:35.700
[Amit Varma]: You know in general I have been hopeful about the culture changing

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:40.180
[Amit Varma]: You know in the same way that for example when section 377 got abolished recently

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.540
[Amit Varma]: uh

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:46.980
[Amit Varma]: All I saw and perhaps this is selection bias because of people of what I follow on social media and all that but all I saw

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.340
[Amit Varma]: Was an outpouring of joy and and there wasn't much of uh,

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:56.100
[Amit Varma]: uh, the bigotry and hatred and homophobia that I would have expected maybe a couple of decades ago or even in the 80s when

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:57.300
[Amit Varma]: I was growing up

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:02.820
[Amit Varma]: Uh, which seemed to reflect to me genuine social change or you should open the twitter thread rather than just reading that

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:09.940
[Amit Varma]: Abuse lies below the yeah, so and and I would have assumed that the same kind of social change is happening for women

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:14.820
[Amit Varma]: But am I wrong? I mean are there are you generally optimistic or pessimistic? What gives you hope?

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:19.060
[Amit Varma]: What gives you despair about the state of women in india and we start with you. Devika. Okay

01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:21.060
[Guest 2]: I I am optimistic frankly. I

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:26.100
[Guest 2]: Maybe because from the background that I come from I have mostly got whatever I wanted

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:31.700
[Guest 2]: Uh without having too much of a issue when it came to access, uh, incredibly privileged

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.580
[Guest 2]: Yeah, right like i'm as we call them the one person, right?

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:41.060
[Guest 2]: uh, but even the one person then faces the entire point of uh, you can't leave home post-8 you have to

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.660
[Guest 2]: Keep on calling your parents wherever you are, which men are not expected to so these are but I look at them as not such

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.980
[Guest 2]: so important an issue as

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:56.100
[Guest 2]: I would look at the a the drastically falling rate of women employment. I think that's a really big concern

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:57.620
[Guest 2]: and

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:02.100
[Guest 2]: Not all of it is frankly forced some of it is voluntary, but that is a very little number

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:07.860
[Guest 2]: And no one's looking at it. Seriously. Uh, we we look at women issues as tokens

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:13.940
[Guest 2]: So yes, we will always have like two people who made it to the top, but they did made it despite the system

01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:16.980
[Amit Varma]: That's a survivorship. Yeah, exactly. That's a survivorship bias, right?

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:21.860
[Guest 2]: So I am optimistic to the fact that uh, the social conversations have started changing

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:28.980
[Guest 2]: Uh, the parents which were uh, very of their daughters working are now fine with them working for certain given

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:36.980
[Guest 2]: Restrictions and setup which is always a better move. So on that note i'm positive about it, but I would not consider

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:42.180
[Guest 2]: um small changes, uh in like if a first woman, uh

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.900
[Guest 2]: Prime minister or a president of united states to be a major change. I think that's just

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:53.060
[Guest 2]: That's just token female there. How much like bangladesh has always had a female state of head

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.980
[Amit Varma]: But you see that's not somebody's wife. Somebody's somebody's wife

01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:01.540
[Guest 2]: Somebody's daughter and that's the thing right like women are not seen as individuals is seen as somebody some

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.500
[Guest 2]: male person's uh

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.580
[Amit Varma]: relative

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:13.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, i'm waiting for the day when uh, shoaib malik scores a century and the headline is sanya mirza's husband. Oh, yes

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:19.300
[Guest 1]: I actually saw a tweet that said a deepika paliwal's husband is uh going to board right now and I was like

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:24.660
[Guest 2]: Who's deepika paliwal's husband? I was like, okay, then a fine squash player in her own right. How dare you

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:31.300
[Guest 2]: You're giving me a name. But yeah, i'm one word answer. I'm optimistic. I think social conversations are changing

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:37.940
[Guest 3]: Yeah, maybe what about you i'm optimistic as well that you see so many women going out to work and that you have

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.820
[Guest 3]: You were able to very quickly gather together this panel

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.380
[Guest 3]: um, you know that

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:45.460
[Guest 3]: Yeah tells you that

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:51.620
[Guest 3]: Um, there are enough women now who can talk about their own issues who can you know voice their issues

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.500
[Guest 3]: I'm hopeful also because there are now women in decision making positions

01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:02.900
[Guest 3]: So they're not just being told what to do and how to do but they're actually deciding what to do and how to do

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:08.020
[Guest 3]: And for states, you know, if you're looking at the state machinery, it might be tokenism

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:12.340
[Guest 3]: But look at the private players like look at big corporations. There are

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:17.380
[Guest 3]: Of course, it's still not equal to the number of men in decision making positions

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.580
[Guest 3]: But at least women are climbing up the ladder as well

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:24.900
[Guest 3]: And at some point you'll reach an inflection point where where it'll tip right and then

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:28.740
[Guest 3]: Then what makes me despair is that there is still not equality

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:35.700
[Guest 3]: There's no parity between what is you know, you expect more from women than you do from the same

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:38.340
[Guest 3]: from men in those positions

01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:43.380
[Guest 3]: Uh, you give lesser to women you pay them lesser than you would to a man

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:47.460
[Guest 3]: So that's what makes me despair, but i'm absolutely hopeful that uh, you know

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:52.980
[Guest 3]: We are going to see more and more women being empowered. It's a long journey. I'm sorry. I despair

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:54.180
[Guest 1]: I mean

01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.260
[Guest 1]: uh, I do i'll tell you what, um

01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:59.220
[Guest 1]: A friend of mine and I were talking and he said, you know

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:04.660
[Guest 1]: If you could live in any century before this when would you live and I said, are you crazy as a woman?

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:09.960
[Guest 1]: Why would I want to live in any century before this? This is the best time to live, you know technologically

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:11.780
[Guest 1]: uh

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:16.660
[Guest 1]: Than ever before. Um, and if I had to live earlier as a woman, it would simply be worse

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.820
[Guest 1]: but

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:25.700
[Guest 1]: Just because our time now is better than earlier doesn't mean it's a good time to live just because we're more equal now

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.980
[Guest 1]: Than we were 20 years ago doesn't mean we're equal

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.860
[Guest 1]: we're not and this goes beyond equality in what I see as

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.940
[Guest 1]: Uh, you may win this battle, but you have to fight another one

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:45.700
[Guest 1]: The way I look at women's issues often is that you're just constantly fighting till you figure out what you want

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.660
[Guest 1]: And how to get that and not worry about other things

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.540
[Guest 1]: Because your bandwidth as a human being is limited, right?

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:57.060
[Guest 1]: And after a while, you're just angry at the world for taking so much away from you

01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.740
[Guest 1]: um

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.180
[Guest 1]: so

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.340
[Guest 1]: I would like to believe in a world where we're moving towards parity

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:09.300
[Guest 1]: But I also know that this is not something that will be achievable in any of our lifetimes

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.860
[Amit Varma]: And i'm sorry for that

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:17.220
[Amit Varma]: Very that's very permanent and that kind of reminds me of you know, how as a man I can take my gender for granted

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:22.020
[Amit Varma]: And you can't it's a constant presence and a constant fight. Uh before I thank you all

01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:27.140
[Amit Varma]: Uh nidhi, would you like to you know, three of you work at takshashila, which is a place which had some amazing

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:34.020
[Amit Varma]: Women policy scholars and women students whom you train. So would you like to talk a little bit about your courses? Thanks amit

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:39.800
[Guest 3]: You see public policy is essentially about how government's decisions are made and implemented

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.080
[Guest 3]: And as aware and engaged indian citizens

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.280
[Guest 3]: We must understand how india's domestic and foreign policies affect each one of us

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.120
[Guest 3]: But also for those who are serious about a career in public policy and politics

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:08.440
[Guest 3]: That said even if you don't want to enter politics knowledge of public policy is essential in

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440
