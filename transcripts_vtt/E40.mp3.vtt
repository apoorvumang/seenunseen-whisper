00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I. V. M.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other night.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: I had been called to the PMO for dinner with the Prime Minister.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
[Amit Varma]: Modiji was there, Jaitleyji was there, Hasmukhbhai was there.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.200
[Amit Varma]: Modiji was at his hospitable best, starting me off with some cheese and white wine.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.200
[Amit Varma]: He told me,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.200
[Amit Varma]: We don't serve red wine.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.600
[Amit Varma]: Ha ha ha ha ha.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, once I was suitably lubricated,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.200
[Amit Varma]: Modiji leaned forward and said,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Amit, you are the economic commentator I respect most in this country.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.000
[Amit Varma]: From day one of demonetization, you got it right.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.400
[Amit Varma]: You wrote about what a disaster it was.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.400
[Amit Varma]: For many years, you have been the wisest one.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.200
[Amit Varma]: So now tell me, O great soul, O fountain of knowledge,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400
[Amit Varma]: what is the state of the economy like in India?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.600
[Amit Varma]: I replied,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.200
[Amit Varma]: Namo, bro, I gotta be honest with you.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Things are a mess.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Demon screwed the informal sector and small businesses.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.400
[Amit Varma]: GST with all these slabs and exemptions, even worse.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.800
[Amit Varma]: Red tape has gone up.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.200
[Amit Varma]: Compliance is hard.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.800
[Amit Varma]: A new Inspector Raj is being unleashed.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Amit Varma]: Exporters are suffering.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600
[Amit Varma]: Small businesses are suffering.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.600
[Amit Varma]: It's a mess.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.800
[Amit Varma]: Then he said,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.600
[Amit Varma]: This bloody economy.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.800
[Amit Varma]: I have such great speech writers and social media trolls.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.200
[Amit Varma]: And still the economy is not doing well.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800
[Amit Varma]: It baffles me.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
[Amit Varma]: I need food.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.800
[Amit Varma]: Jaitleyji rang a bell

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.800
[Amit Varma]: and an eminent economist wearing a waiter's uniform walked in.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.400
[Amit Varma]: He said to Modiji,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Kya lau sir?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Whatever you want, I will bring it for you.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.400
[Amit Varma]: Modiji whispered something in his ear.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.200
[Amit Varma]: I couldn't quite make out what he said.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.800
[Amit Varma]: And then he elaborated,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.200
[Amit Varma]: And make sure it's medium rare.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.200
[Amit Varma]: Hare Modiji, I said.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.800
[Amit Varma]: What is it that you're eating?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
[Amit Varma]: Modiji said,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.400
[Amit Varma]: Amit, my boy.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Why so serious? Don't be shocked.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.800
[Amit Varma]: We all worship in our own way.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.200
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.200
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.400
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.000
[Amit Varma]: I want to do a roundup of the state of the Indian economy.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, the economy is not doing very well.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.800
[Amit Varma]: And many of the things wrong with it are the Unseen effects.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.400
[Amit Varma]: Of demonetization and GST.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.200
[Amit Varma]: Before I bring in my guest for today,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.800
[Amit Varma]: I want to spend a little while talking about each of these.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.200
[Amit Varma]: As Modiji mentioned in my dream,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400
[Amit Varma]: I have been writing against demon from day one in publications like

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.800
[Amit Varma]: The Times of India and The Hindu Business Line.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.600
[Amit Varma]: The second episode of The Seen and The Unseen was on demonetization.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.400
[Amit Varma]: My guest in that was Suyash Rai.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.200
[Amit Varma]: You can check out the archives at seenunseen.in.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.800
[Amit Varma]: Some people say that demon was a good idea that was implemented badly.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.200
[Amit Varma]: This is nonsense. It was a terrible idea from the start.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.600
[Amit Varma]: This is mainly because it was not an attack on high denomination notes to begin with.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.600
[Amit Varma]: In 1978, when the last demonetization happened,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.400
[Amit Varma]: the notes that were demonetized were only 0.6% of the notes in circulation.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.800
[Amit Varma]: They were basically used to store money and not to actually spend it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.200
[Amit Varma]: By contrast, this time, 1000 rupee and 500 rupee notes

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.200
[Amit Varma]: constituted 86% of the money supply

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.000
[Amit Varma]: and are used by the common man and the rich.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Used by the common man for daily transactions.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.800
[Amit Varma]: Modiji may not have bought something from a store for a couple of decades

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.600
[Amit Varma]: and probably didn't know this sitting in his ivory tower.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.600
[Amit Varma]: And from the insider accounts I have heard,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.600
[Amit Varma]: he also didn't consult any of the eminent economists who worked with him.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, so overnight there was a shortage of cash

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.800
[Amit Varma]: and hundreds of millions of people had to queue up for hours

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.600
[Amit Varma]: to get a hand on their own money.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.200
[Amit Varma]: This was easily the largest assault on property rights in human history.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200
[Amit Varma]: The informal sector depends on cash and was crippled by this.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400
[Amit Varma]: Small businesses everywhere were hurt.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.200
[Amit Varma]: And as expected, our GDP growth rate suffered as well.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.200
[Amit Varma]: Demon was supposed to attack black money,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400
[Amit Varma]: but it was estimated at the time that only 6% of the black money

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.400
[Amit Varma]: was stored in the form of cash.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.400
[Amit Varma]: And even that got neatly laundered.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.400
[Amit Varma]: Basically, demonetization crippled our economy and achieved absolutely nothing.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.600
[Amit Varma]: For more details on this too, listen to my February episode on this

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.200
[Amit Varma]: with Suresh Rai at cnunseen.in.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200
[Amit Varma]: I've done two episodes on GST,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.200
[Amit Varma]: first with Devangshu Dutta and then with Vivek Kaul.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.200
[Amit Varma]: My episode with Devangshu happened before GST was implemented.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And Devangshu warned that if there were too many slabs and exemptions,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.600
[Amit Varma]: it might defeat the whole purpose.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.200
[Amit Varma]: Vivek did an episode with me after GST was implemented

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.400
[Amit Varma]: and the problems with it were exactly as Devangshu had feared.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.800
[Amit Varma]: Too many slabs and exemptions that made it the opposite of a good and simple tax.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.800
[Amit Varma]: Indeed, there were now so many regulations that compliance was hard and time-consuming

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
[Amit Varma]: and observers feared that a new Inspector Raj may well be on the way.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, my guest on the show today is Vivek Kaul himself,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.000
[Amit Varma]: a prolific author and columnist for Equity Master

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.000
[Amit Varma]: and, much to my good fortune, a frequent guest on The Seen and The Unseen.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, welcome back to the show.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.000
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit, for having me over.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.600
[Amit Varma]: So, Vivek, you've been writing about the economy 4-5 times a week,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.200
[Amit Varma]: more than that, you write so many columns and are prolific across so many websites,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.800
[Amit Varma]: besides the work you do for Equity Master.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.200
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, for the last few months,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.200
[Amit Varma]: you've been coming up with the most detailed, updated reports on what's been going on.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.400
[Amit Varma]: What is the state of the Indian economy right now?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:37.400
[Guest]: I mean, we're probably in the worst state that we have been in almost one and a half years.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:46.200
[Guest]: I mean, the last GDP data that came out for the period April to June 2017,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.200
[Guest]: the growth was at 5.7%.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.200
[Guest]: Now, what this figure does not tell you is that this growth was pumped up

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.200
[Guest]: because of, you know, a dramatic increase in government expenditure.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.200
[Guest]: So, if you strip out the government part of the economy,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:12.000
[Guest]: which typically tends to be around 9-10%, but now is around 13%,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.000
[Guest]: the non-government part of the economy grew by around 4.3%.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.000
[Guest]: So, which is very, very worrying.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.000
[Guest]: And it's fallen from around, it's come down from around 9%,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:31.000
[Guest]: you know, as of March 2016, to around 4.3%.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.000
[Amit Varma]: From 9% to 4.3%.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.800
[Amit Varma]: So, just put this in context for me. Typically, what is the kind of growth rate

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.800
[Amit Varma]: for any given quarter that we've been experiencing over the last few years?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.800
[Guest]: Okay, so this, you know, we grew by around 9% as of March 2016.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.800
[Guest]: And after that, you know, the growth has started to fall.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.800
[Amit Varma]: And to take you a little further back, what was it like during the UPA's time, for example?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.600
[Guest]: So, you really cannot compare because, okay, the UPA for the last three years,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.600
[Guest]: you know, we have data from around, I'll tell you,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.600
[Guest]: we have data from January, no, from March 2012.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.600
[Guest]: So, the growth was around 5% to 6%.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.600
[Guest]: Before that, we do not have data because, you know,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.600
[Guest]: we moved on to a new GDP series in January 2015.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.400
[Guest]: And for that, you know, the data is available only from 2012 onwards.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.400
[Amit Varma]: Right. So, I'm trying to get a sense of how the economy reacted

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.400
[Amit Varma]: after the Modi government took power in 2014.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.400
[Guest]: So, basically, you know, the initial response was good.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:50.400
[Guest]: And then, you know, somewhere in early 2016, the growth started to come down.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.200
[Amit Varma]: Right. And also, one way in which the Modi government has been very lucky is with oil prices. I mean, you've written,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.200
[Amit Varma]: you wrote a piece for this on the website, I added Pragati, I think Pragati.com,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.200
[Amit Varma]: on how a lot of the good economic figures under this government have come fortuitously

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.200
[Amit Varma]: because the oil prices happen to be really low.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.200
[Guest]: Actually, you know, as Amit Shah said, because of technical reasons.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:22.000
[Guest]: So, I mean, so the way it is, you know, imports are a negative entry into the GDP formula.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:30.000
[Guest]: So, if oil prices fall, your oil imports in dollar terms or in rupee terms also fall.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.000
[Guest]: So, the moment that happens, your GDP goes up automatically.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.000
[Guest]: So, as Mr. Shah said, due to technical reasons.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.000
[Guest]: So, this is exactly where these technical reasons come in.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.800
[Amit Varma]: So, now going back into the last 18 months or so, since, you know, the last year and a half,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.800
[Amit Varma]: what has been happening in the economy?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.800
[Guest]: Say, you know, one factor which is people have gradually started to realize

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.800
[Guest]: and which they were not realizing earlier is the fact that we are not creating enough jobs.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.800
[Guest]: Right.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.800
[Guest]: Okay, there are estimates suggest that around a million Indians are entering the workforce every month.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.600
[Guest]: And we've done a podcast on this previously where we discussed it.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.600
[Guest]: So, and, you know, the problem is that this is now, I mean, it's coming to the fore,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.600
[Guest]: wherein, you know, the media is writing about it and people are talking about it.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.600
[Guest]: But nothing seems to be happening, you know, around it on the government front.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.600
[Guest]: I mean, the entire, you know, the explanations that are coming from the government

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.400
[Guest]: seem to be telling us that all is well and, you know, we don't need to worry,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.400
[Guest]: which isn't really true because the numbers don't show that.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:54.400
[Amit Varma]: Right. And how would you sum up the impact of demonetization to begin with and then GST in the economy?

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.400
[Amit Varma]: For example, typically, it takes a long, long time for all the relevant data to actually get in.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.400
[Amit Varma]: And what complicates this further, obviously, is that demon affected the informal sector really hard

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.200
[Amit Varma]: and their data itself is a problem to begin with.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.200
[Amit Varma]: So, how do you begin to estimate what the impact is? What do we have so far?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.200
[Guest]: So, you know, a lot of data has started to come in.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.200
[Guest]: So, the first thing I would like to say is, you know, if you look at the crash in food prices,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.200
[Guest]: the major reason for that is demonetization.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.200
[Guest]: Because most of the agriculture trade in India worked on cash.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.000
[Guest]: And the moment that cash was taken out of the system, the buying and selling simply stopped.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.000
[Guest]: And farmers had to sort of sell their produce at very, very low prices.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.000
[Guest]: So, one of the stories that minted was about this farmer who had to sell his,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.000
[Guest]: you know, he had grown potatoes this year and this was sometime in March.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.000
[Guest]: And he had to sell his potatoes for as low as 9 paisa a kg.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.800
[Guest]: Whereas it takes around 3 rupees to produce 1 kg of potato.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.800
[Guest]: That's one part.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.800
[Guest]: The second part is if you look at the crash in, you know, the price of pulses.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.800
[Guest]: So, you know, what has been, so, you know, we need to understand as to

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.800
[Guest]: how does a farmer actually decide what to produce in a given year.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.800
[Guest]: You know, he basically looks at the prices, you know, last year and then he decides.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.600
[Guest]: So, you know, the price of pulses have been going up for a while.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:38.600
[Guest]: So, this season there was a huge increase in production of pulses.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.600
[Amit Varma]: But there were no buyers. So, the prices...

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.600
[Guest]: And no buyers because basically no cash, essentially.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.600
[Guest]: So, now, then if you remember, you know, the price of tomatoes crossed 100 rupees a kg.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.600
[Guest]: Now, how did that happen?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.400
[Guest]: That happened because, you know, there was a bumper crop of tomatoes in November, December.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.400
[Guest]: And because there was no cash in the system, the prices crashed.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:11.400
[Guest]: So, once the prices crashed, for the next cycle, the farmers simply decided not to, you know, grow any tomatoes.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.400
[Guest]: So, because of that, the prices went up.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.400
[Guest]: So, if, you know, if you were to sort of extend the tomato example into pulses,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.200
[Guest]: my guess is next year, you know, the price of pulses will go up again

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.200
[Guest]: because farmers this year will not plot as much as, you know, they did last year.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.200
[Amit Varma]: And are minimum support prices relevant to pulses?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:39.200
[Guest]: Not really. Minimum support prices are basically relevant to only rice and wheat.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.200
[Guest]: Then there is a third, another kind of price which is set,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.200
[Guest]: I think it's called fair and remunerative price, which is set in case of sugarcane.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.000
[Guest]: So, but that's a different story altogether.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:58.000
[Amit Varma]: So, just to kind of demystify this, would it then be that because there was a massive reduction in the money supply,

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.000
[Amit Varma]: so to say, that had a deflationary effect?

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:08.000
[Amit Varma]: So, now, you know, just to sort of, for the listeners who may not be following monetary economics,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.000
[Amit Varma]: a friend once asked me recently that, hey, you know, if the government needs to spend more money,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.000
[Amit Varma]: why don't they just print more money?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.800
[Amit Varma]: But what typically happens if they print more money is that the number of goods and services are what they are,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.800
[Amit Varma]: but you have more money chasing it, so its demand and supply, the price of everything,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.800
[Amit Varma]: just goes up and the result is inflation.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.800
[Amit Varma]: And when the government prints money, it's basically creating inflation, which is a tax on the poor.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.800
[Amit Varma]: And here this has the opposite effect where you take a lot of money out of the system

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.800
[Amit Varma]: and you have much less money chasing certain goods and services

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.600
[Amit Varma]: and therefore they become much cheaper and in this case hurting the farmers more.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.600
[Guest]: I can give you a better example here.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:55.600
[Guest]: You know, sometime in the Second World War, you know, there used to be prisoners of wars.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.600
[Guest]: So, within the prison, there was no cash going around.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.600
[Guest]: So, cigarettes became a form of money.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.400
[Guest]: So, the prisoners used to get cigarettes through the rations that arrived through the Red Cross

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.400
[Guest]: or, you know, if some stuff got sent by relatives.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.400
[Guest]: So, typically what used to happen was that when the Red Cross rations came,

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:26.400
[Guest]: suddenly everybody had cigarettes and they used to start using those cigarettes to exchange,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.400
[Guest]: you know, for a cup of coffee or tea and so on and so forth.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.400
[Guest]: Now, because there was a sudden increase in the inflow of cigarettes,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.200
[Guest]: the prices of, you know, coffee and tea used to go up

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.200
[Guest]: in the sense that, you know, earlier maybe two cigarettes for a coffee

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.200
[Guest]: and, you know, after the inflow of cigarettes, it used to become three cigarettes for a coffee.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.200
[Amit Varma]: That's one part.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.200
[Guest]: The other part is there used to be, some days there used to be bombings

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.200
[Guest]: or it was simply so cold that people just smoked away their cigarettes.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:01.200
[Guest]: So, then suddenly there was a contraction in the number of cigarettes available in the prison economy

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.000
[Guest]: and the prices used to come down because the holders of, you know, tea, coffee

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.000
[Guest]: or whatever they were trying to sell essentially, you know,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.000
[Guest]: wanted to ensure that their products did not spoil

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.000
[Guest]: and so they had to cut prices in order to attract people

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.000
[Guest]: who were still left with cigarettes to spend those cigarettes.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a brilliant illustration of the money supply and that is actually a good reason,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.000
[Amit Varma]: another good reason to say cigarette smoking is injurious to health

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.000
[Amit Varma]: because, hey, you're burning money, literally in that case.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.800
[Amit Varma]: So, this is one thing that happened that because of money supply,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.800
[Amit Varma]: because the amount of cash in the economy drastically went down,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.800
[Amit Varma]: prices, of course, crashed and farmers got screwed

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.800
[Amit Varma]: and then this changed the incentives for the next cycle of crops.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.800
[Amit Varma]: So, when they couldn't get any money for the tomatoes, for example,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.800
[Amit Varma]: their incentives changed and they didn't grow tomatoes the next time around,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.800
[Amit Varma]: which then led to a scarcity of tomatoes and, you know, by the time…

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.800
[Guest]: So, see, the point here is, you know, when it comes to Indian agriculture,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.600
[Guest]: the markets anyway don't work and whatever little the markets were working,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.600
[Guest]: demonetization essentially ensured that those markets also don't work.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.600
[Guest]: So, if you don't allow the market to work, I mean, there will be a cost to pay at the end of the day.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.600
[Amit Varma]: So, moving from agriculture to the informal sector in terms of small manufacturers

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.600
[Amit Varma]: and businesses and all that, how did demonetization affect those?

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.600
[Guest]: So, this is a very, you know, I mean, we all know that demonetization essentially

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.400
[Guest]: ended up hurting the informal sector particularly in a very bad way,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.400
[Guest]: because informal sector works largely on cash

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.400
[Guest]: and the moment you take that cash out of the market, they essentially collapsed.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.400
[Guest]: Now, so that's that, I mean, that's very well known.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.400
[Guest]: Now, what has happened is, you know, I just noticed this particular data point

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.400
[Guest]: that I'll talk about around a month back.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.400
[Guest]: So, obviously, you know, the country imports a lot of stuff.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.200
[Guest]: India does and our biggest imports are oil and gold.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:03.200
[Guest]: Now, oil we import because, you know, we sort of produce only 20% of the oil that we consume

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.200
[Guest]: and gold we import because we produce almost, you know, nothing.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.200
[Guest]: I mean, so we have to import all the gold that we consume.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:20.200
[Guest]: Now, if you strip out gold, oil and silver from the total import numbers,

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:29.000
[Guest]: what remains with you is, you know, the technical term for it is non-oil, non-gold, non-silver imports.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:35.000
[Guest]: Now, these imports are a very good indicator of consumer demand in the country.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:45.000
[Guest]: Now, if you look at the growth in non-gold, non-oil, non-silver imports since November,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.000
[Guest]: there has been a huge jump.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.800
[Guest]: Before November, these imports were actually in the negative territory.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.800
[Guest]: But after November, they have like really perked up.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.800
[Guest]: Now, what is happening here?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.800
[Guest]: It's a very interesting question as to why, you know, how does the scenario change so quickly.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.800
[Guest]: So, what is happening here is because of demonetization,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.800
[Guest]: the informal sector has sort of been destroyed, the supply chains have been destroyed

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.600
[Guest]: and those, you know, the products that these informal firms were selling

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.600
[Guest]: are now coming into the import route.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.600
[Guest]: So, basically, you know, we have ended up importing stuff

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.600
[Guest]: that we were essentially buying from within the country.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.600
[Amit Varma]: So, it's essentially for all that Modi says about make in India,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.600
[Amit Varma]: what demonetization essentially promoted was don't make in India.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.400
[Guest]: Or rather, you know, make outside India and create jobs outside India.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.400
[Guest]: That's the bigger irony.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.400
[Guest]: So, yeah, now, if this were to sort of stop at this, it would be fine.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.400
[Guest]: But then again, the jump in non-gold, non-silver, non-oil imports

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.400
[Guest]: was one unseen effect of demonetization.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.400
[Guest]: Now, there is an unseen effect of this unseen effect.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.200
[Amit Varma]: So, we are basically in cascading unseen effect.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.200
[Guest]: I mean, you know, this is the double derivative.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.200
[Guest]: So, d dx of dy by dx or something like that.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:23.200
[Guest]: So, anyway, so what has happened is that now because the economy is not doing well,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.200
[Guest]: you know, when the economy doesn't do well,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.200
[Guest]: economists and politicians go back to that, you know, one economist, John Maynard Keynes.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.000
[Guest]: Now, John Maynard Keynes, you know, in 1936, in his magnum opus,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.000
[Guest]: The General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:48.000
[Guest]: essentially suggested that when the economy is not doing well,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.000
[Guest]: when the private sector is not spending enough money,

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.000
[Guest]: the government should cut tax rates.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.000
[Guest]: He also suggested that the governments should spend more money

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.800
[Guest]: during that period than they, you know, than they spend in other periods.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.800
[Guest]: So, this is something that politicians and economists have latched on to since 1936

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.800
[Guest]: and every time an economy is in trouble anywhere in the world,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.800
[Guest]: this is the first suggestion that is given.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.800
[Guest]: Now, it needs to be explained here that, you know,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.800
[Guest]: when Keynes was making these suggestions,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.800
[Guest]: the governments did not run fiscal deficits.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.600
[Guest]: That is what used to happen back then was that their income was equal to their expenditure.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.600
[Guest]: So, Keynes' argument was that you essentially accumulate money when the going is good

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.600
[Guest]: and then you spend it when the going is not so good.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.600
[Guest]: But what happened was people just ran with one part of the argument and,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.600
[Guest]: you know, the government should spend money when the going is not good.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.600
[Guest]: Anyway, so to get back to the point, now with the economy not doing well,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.400
[Guest]: obviously all these economists and, you know, some politicians also have been suggesting

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.400
[Guest]: that the government should spend more money than it is actually spending.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.400
[Guest]: Even though the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.400
[Guest]: which was recently set up, has advised against it.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.400
[Guest]: So, as far as government spending is concerned,

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.400
[Guest]: if you look at data for the first five months of the year,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.400
[Guest]: the government is already spending much more than it usually spends.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.200
[Guest]: So, you get, you know, fiscal deficit data every month.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.200
[Guest]: So, if you look at the period between April to August,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.200
[Guest]: we have already, you know, we are already at 96% of the fiscal deficit

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.200
[Guest]: which was targeted for the entire year.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.200
[Guest]: So, which basically means that the government is spending much more than it actually spends.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.200
[Amit Varma]: And when it spends much more than it actually, than it gets in,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.200
[Amit Varma]: what it's essentially doing is borrowing from future generations, right,

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.200
[Amit Varma]: kicking the can down the road.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.000
[Guest]: So, some sort of stimulus is already, some sort of fiscal expansion,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.000
[Guest]: fiscal stimulus is already on.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:01.000
[Guest]: Now, what remains to be seen is whether the government continues to spend money at this rate.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.000
[Guest]: So, if it continues to spend money at this rate, then, you know,

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.000
[Guest]: the targeted fiscal deficit for the year is around 3.2% of the GDP

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.000
[Guest]: and it will end up at around 4% of the GDP.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.000
[Guest]: Now, that's a call that the government needs to make

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.000
[Guest]: whether they want to increase the fiscal deficit

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.800
[Guest]: or they want to meet the fiscal deficit target.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.800
[Guest]: Now, so typically, you know, the way this works is that

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.800
[Guest]: when the government spends money, you know, somebody's income goes up

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.800
[Guest]: and then that income translates into consumer demand

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.800
[Guest]: and when, you know, consumer demand goes up,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.800
[Guest]: the private sector starts to do well

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.800
[Guest]: and so the economic growth sort of comes back.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.800
[Amit Varma]: That's a theory.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.800
[Guest]: Yes, and I mean, as the sort of private sector does well,

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.600
[Guest]: the government also gets, you know, greater share of taxes and so on and so forth.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.600
[Guest]: The problem here is that, you know, what has happened, you know,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.600
[Guest]: as we all know, in the Indian cases, because of demonetization,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.600
[Guest]: the large part of the small, you know, and medium enterprises

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.600
[Guest]: and the informal sector has been destroyed.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.600
[Guest]: Now, let's say if the government were to continue to spend more money,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.600
[Guest]: okay, what would happen is that, obviously,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.400
[Guest]: it would translate into some sort of consumer demand.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.400
[Guest]: Now, the thing is whether that consumer demand would be met

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.400
[Guest]: through stuff which is produced within the country

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.400
[Guest]: or stuff which is not produced within the country, okay.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.400
[Guest]: Now, given the trend of non-gold, non-silver and non-oil imports going up,

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.400
[Guest]: what that tells us is that up until now, the consumer demand,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.400
[Guest]: a lot of it is not being met through what is being produced in the country, right.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.400
[Guest]: So, if we sort of extend that logic, you know,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.200
[Guest]: the government spending more will end up, you know,

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.200
[Guest]: leading to consumer demand which is fulfilled through imports, okay.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.200
[Guest]: Now, imports, as we know, are a negative entry into the GDP formula,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.200
[Amit Varma]: again, technical reasons.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.200
[Amit Varma]: That's a technical reason.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.200
[Guest]: Technical reasons, as Mr. Amit Shah said.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.200
[Guest]: So, because imports are a negative entry,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.200
[Guest]: what would happen is that, you know,

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.200
[Guest]: the government spending more money instead of leading to

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.000
[Guest]: an increase in economic growth would actually pull it down.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.000
[Guest]: So, this is, you know, one unseen effect on top of

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.000
[Guest]: the other unseen effect of demonetization.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, you know, I would not be against imports at all.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.000
[Amit Varma]: It's perfectly fine, you know.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.000
[Amit Varma]: But what is perverse in this case is that you're destroying livelihoods

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.000
[Amit Varma]: and businesses which were already running within the country

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.000
[Amit Varma]: and then imports go up as a result of that.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And the important thing here to note is that a lot of the small businesses

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.800
[Amit Varma]: or the small enterprises affected by demonetization,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.800
[Amit Varma]: for them it wasn't just a matter of,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.800
[Amit Varma]: oh, we've had two or three bad months and then we'll eventually come back

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.800
[Amit Varma]: and it's short-term pain.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.800
[Amit Varma]: What happens is that on the margins when businesses get wiped out,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.800
[Amit Varma]: you can't come back again.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.800
[Amit Varma]: You're gone.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.800
[Amit Varma]: I think the term economists use for it is a welfare shock.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's a damage which really in some ways is immeasurable.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.800
[Guest]: Yes, because, you know, I mean,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.600
[Guest]: what the government data essentially measures at the end of the day is,

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.600
[Guest]: you know, businesses and firms which are a part of the formal setup.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.600
[Guest]: But the informal setup is really very badly measured.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.600
[Guest]: So at the end of the day, you know,

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.600
[Guest]: we will really never be able to sort of figure out

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.600
[Guest]: as to what was the actual cost.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Right, and as my friend Nitin Pai of the Takshashila Institution

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.600
[Amit Varma]: once pointed out that a 1% rise in GDP

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.600
[Amit Varma]: typically brings 2 million people out of poverty in India.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.400
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the opportunity cost of that rise not happening

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.400
[Amit Varma]: or the GDP growth being less than expected is that

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.400
[Amit Varma]: it has a real impact on real human beings.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.400
[Guest]: Which is true.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.400
[Guest]: I mean, see, it's like, you know, it's very simple.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.400
[Guest]: If India grows at 6% for a year over the next, let's say, 20-25 years

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.400
[Guest]: in comparison to if it grows at 8%,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.200
[Guest]: obviously, you know, many more people will be pulled out of poverty

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.200
[Guest]: if India grows at 8% and then if India grows at 6%.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.200
[Guest]: So what is obviously important here is that, you know,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:07.200
[Guest]: if the government cannot create right situations for economic growth,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.200
[Guest]: they should at least not create situations which hurt economic growth.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting because there is almost a canard spread by some people

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.200
[Amit Varma]: that, oh, look, that, you know, Modi, he's doing so much damage on the social front,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.000
[Amit Varma]: all the lynchings and the cow business and all that, all in the name of development and economy.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.000
[Amit Varma]: But if you actually evaluate his economic performance,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, especially over the last year and a half,

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.000
[Amit Varma]: things have just gone drastically wrong.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.000
[Amit Varma]: He's taking the country backwards.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.000
[Amit Varma]: But leaving demonetization apart,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.000
[Amit Varma]: let's move on to something that we discussed a few episodes ago,

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.000
[Amit Varma]: which is sort of the impact of GST on the economy,

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.000
[Amit Varma]: which is kind of becoming clearer.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.800
[Amit Varma]: And what is your overall take now?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.800
[Guest]: Okay.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.800
[Guest]: So, you know, whatever I said at that point of time continues to be true.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.800
[Guest]: I mean, but, you know, the one new thing that I've realized

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.800
[Guest]: is which is sort of causing a lot of problems

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.800
[Guest]: is the fact that the GST essentially has led to a situation

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.800
[Guest]: where one too many returns need to be filed.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.600
[Guest]: You know, there are people who are perpetually filing returns all through the month.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.600
[Guest]: I mean, like, I need to file three returns.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.600
[Guest]: And even that at sometimes, you know, becomes a pain.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.600
[Guest]: Like, you know, one of the returns is an expense statement that needs to be filed.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.600
[Guest]: Now I need to file my expense statements 12 times a year.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.600
[Guest]: So obviously, you know, one can understand what the government is trying to do.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.600
[Guest]: I mean, they're obviously trying to sort of build a database

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.400
[Guest]: and then figure out, you know, who are the people who are not paying their fair share of taxes.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.400
[Guest]: But then again, you have to be, you know,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:54.400
[Guest]: you have to realize the fact that it takes a lot of time and energy

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.400
[Guest]: from what is actually not a core activity.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.400
[Guest]: I mean, for a businessman or a self-employed individual,

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.400
[Guest]: he would rather sort of concentrate on what he does well rather than on these things.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.400
[Amit Varma]: You're wasting an enormous amount of productive time just doing this.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.200
[Guest]: What has also happened is, again, I mean, this is anecdotal,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.200
[Guest]: and I mean, I don't have agglomerated data to back what I say,

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.200
[Guest]: is that I think chartered accountants are finding it difficult

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.200
[Guest]: to handle the volume of work that GST has created.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.200
[Unknown]: Now to give you a very simple example,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.200
[Guest]: you know, you need a lot of data entry operators now.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.200
[Guest]: I mean, you don't expect a chartered accountant to sit and enter data.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:42.000
[Guest]: So from what I understand, there is a shortage of good data entry operators.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.000
[Guest]: I mean, you know, you need someone who understands some amount of English.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.000
[Unknown]: He understands, you know, this is Excel and, you know, this is basically,

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.000
[Guest]: you know, you need someone who at least you understand a few basic things.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:00.000
[Guest]: And it has become a little difficult to find such individuals.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think over time, the scene effect of this,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.800
[Amit Varma]: and some might pom-pom me to say that, hey, there are more data operators,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.800
[Amit Varma]: and we've created good jobs.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.800
[Guest]: Yes, but then you realize that, you know,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.800
[Guest]: I mean, yes, there are more data operators,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.800
[Guest]: and work has been created for chartered accountants.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.800
[Guest]: But then there are so many people who are not doing what they should be doing,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.800
[Guest]: and, you know, just looking at the fact that the entire return is filed properly.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.800
[Amit Varma]: And the extra money that people are spending on their chartered accountants

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.600
[Amit Varma]: and GST consultants and so on, is money that they would have spent elsewhere

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.600
[Guest]: and would have been put to productive use.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.600
[Guest]: Which is the basic point of the unseen effect anyway.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.600
[Amit Varma]: Which is the basic point of the unseen effect.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:45.600
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, looking forward, what is sort of your prognosis in the, you know,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.600
[Amit Varma]: let's say the year and a half to come, let's say till 2019 when the next elections happen.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.600
[Amit Varma]: Is the worst behind us?

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.600
[Amit Varma]: Because the government at some point will start fixing some of the glitches of GST as well, at least.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.600
[Guest]: Which they have, they have started.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, they have started that and you don't really expect things to really get worse.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.400
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is that the impact of Demon and the…

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.400
[Guest]: See, the, yeah, I mean, economic growth has been falling for six quarters now.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.400
[Guest]: So, six quarters is a reasonably long time.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.400
[Unknown]: Exactly.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.400
[Guest]: I mean, it's not a small…

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:22.400
[Guest]: So, the point is, I mean, a lot of damage has already been done.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.400
[Guest]: Now, whether this damage will continue, I mean, for that,

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.200
[Guest]: I mean, it's difficult to sort of say offhand.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.200
[Guest]: But, you know, if you look at other high frequency data,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.200
[Guest]: I mean, things, some things are improving.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.200
[Guest]: It's not like everything's going to the dogs,

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.200
[Guest]: but a lot of things are in an extremely negative territory.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.200
[Guest]: So, one of the data points which I came across recently is,

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.200
[Guest]: you know, we all know that bank lending is in a bad state.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.000
[Guest]: So, you know, bank lending to agriculture is down, bank lending to retail is flat,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.000
[Guest]: bank lending to industry, you know, has contracted.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:13.000
[Guest]: But bank lending to services this year has fallen more than bank lending to any other sector.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.000
[Guest]: Why is that?

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.000
[Unknown]: I have no idea. I need to dig a little deeper.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.000
[Guest]: Now, the point is that services form around half of the economy

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.000
[Guest]: and if services firms are not borrowing,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.800
[Guest]: there is something which is really not right.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.800
[Amit Varma]: So, I mean, I need to dig a little deeper.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.800
[Amit Varma]: Is it that they are not borrowing because they don't see a scope for expansion?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.800
[Guest]: I don't know. I mean, which could be one reason or I don't know.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.800
[Guest]: I mean, there's no demand.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.800
[Guest]: So, one has to sort of see, I mean, if you, you know, go back to Mr. Modi's speech recently.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.800
[Guest]: So, he said, you know, car sales are going up and motorcycle sales are going up

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.800
[Guest]: and tractor sales went up by 34% in a month.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.600
[Guest]: But then these are not the, you know, he pointed out a spate of positive data points,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.600
[Guest]: but he did not point out a spate of negative data points also, which are there.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.600
[Guest]: Right. I mean, you know, your cement consumption for one,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.600
[Guest]: I mean, I can tell you offhand, has come down.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.600
[Guest]: The real estate sector, which sort of is, you know,

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.600
[Guest]: should have been the main sector to create jobs for the unskilled,

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.400
[Guest]: is, continues to be down in the dumps.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:28.400
[Guest]: So, I mean, so the point is that there are enough, I mean, negative data points going around as well.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:35.400
[Guest]: So, even if there is a recovery, I don't see a fast recovery happening.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.400
[Guest]: I mean, it will be as slow as...

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's probably true even if the government gets everything right from now on.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.400
[Amit Varma]: That, you know, given where we are, it's just really difficult to climb out of this.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:51.200
[Guest]: Yes, I mean, because a lot of these, see, what has typically always happened in India's case

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.200
[Guest]: is that whenever we have done well, you know, grown at 8 and 9 percent,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.200
[Guest]: the structural issues have held us back.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:03.200
[Guest]: So, these are, you know, the structural issues are now coming to the fore all over again.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:09.200
[Guest]: I mean, something as basic as our roads, our turnaround time of our ports.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.200
[Guest]: Because if you realize, you know, globally the economies are doing much better

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.000
[Guest]: than they were, let's say, three years back.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. I mean, in 2011, you could say that, hey, you know, there's a global downswing

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.000
[Amit Varma]: and everyone's doing badly and if India's kind of...

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.000
[Amit Varma]: It's fine, it's understandable.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.000
[Amit Varma]: But right now, the rest of the world is all looking up and India's kind of lagging behind.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.000
[Guest]: So, I mean, so look at something like, you know, the banking crisis.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.000
[Guest]: I mean, it's not like it's suddenly come up.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.000
[Guest]: It's been there from day one.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.000
[Guest]: And nothing's been... I mean, nothing's been done other than getting the companies to sort of...

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.800
[Guest]: Sorry, getting the banks to recognize their bad loans as bad loans.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.800
[Guest]: And even that number keeps going up every quarter.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.800
[Guest]: So, either, you know, if you look at some of these banks...

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.800
[Guest]: So, there are these five associate banks of State Bank of India

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.800
[Guest]: and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, which were merged with State Bank of India.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.800
[Guest]: And State Bank of India, as of March 31st, was the second best, you know,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.600
[Guest]: performing bank among the public sector banks when it came to their bad loans.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:20.600
[Guest]: So, the bad loans were at some 7.15% and after the merger, they've increased to 10%.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:27.600
[Guest]: So, you know, what is the point in merging, you know, five weak banks with a strong bank

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.600
[Guest]: and making that strong bank a weak bank?

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.600
[Guest]: Now, this is a solution which is now being offered, you know,

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.400
[Guest]: wherein the principal economic advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Sanjeev Sanyal, recently said

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.400
[Guest]: that the number of banks will come down to 10 to 15.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.400
[Guest]: But some of these banks, you know, Indian Overseas Bank is one, IDBI Bank,

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.400
[Guest]: they have bad loan rates of 23-24%.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.400
[Guest]: I mean, the question is, why are these banks still in the business of banking?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.400
[Guest]: I mean, if you're losing, you know, one-fourth of all that you're lending,

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.400
[Guest]: I mean, clearly you're not good at what you're doing.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.200
[Guest]: I mean, and if you continue, I mean, you'll continue to lose money

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.200
[Guest]: and the government will have to continue to recapitalize you.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.200
[Guest]: So, you know, you need the government to make some of these big decisions

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.200
[Guest]: which they have not up until now.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.200
[Amit Varma]: And again, NPAs, bank loans, we've discussed this in previous episodes.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.200
[Guest]: I mean, or look at something as simple as, you know,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.200
[Guest]: all the railway accidents that are happening.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.200
[Guest]: Now, people say that, you know, accidents are happening

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.000
[Guest]: and we are building bullet trains.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.000
[Guest]: I don't think that is the right comparison.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.000
[Guest]: The right comparison is that accidents are happening

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.000
[Guest]: and we continue to run Air India

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.000
[Guest]: because the bullet train will be built whenever it will be built, okay.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.000
[Guest]: Air India is there right now.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.000
[Guest]: The organization continues to lose money.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.000
[Guest]: And every rupee that Air India essentially loses

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.000
[Guest]: is money that gets, you know, taken away from something else.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Taken from us, I mean, most people think of government and government money

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.800
[Amit Varma]: as something that has nothing to do with us, but actually it's our money.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.800
[Guest]: No, no, it's taken someone's paying for it.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.800
[Guest]: You and I are paying for it and we are in fact filing those returns three times a month.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.800
[Guest]: I mean, or you look at the fact that,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.800
[Guest]: I mean, this is something that I wrote for Pragati,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.800
[Guest]: wherein, and you gave a great headline on the price of petrol and diesel.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.800
[Guest]: You know, why are there so many taxes on petrol and diesel?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.800
[Guest]: I mean, this is because, you know,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.800
[Guest]: you have the government needs to support companies like Air India

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.600
[Guest]: and this one called Hindustan Photo Films, which we keep talking about.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.600
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, I think you and I have it the wrong way around.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.600
[Amit Varma]: We seem to imagine that the government is there to serve the nation.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.600
[Guest]: No, the nation is there to serve the government.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.600
[Amit Varma]: So, net-net, then would it be fair to say that when the Modi government came in,

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.600
[Amit Varma]: at least on the economic front, there was a lot of optimism among a lot of people

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.600
[Amit Varma]: that they will do a lot of reforms.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.600
[Amit Varma]: And what has happened is that they haven't done most of the reforms we expected from them

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.600
[Amit Varma]: or showed the intent to do them.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.400
[Amit Varma]: And furthermore, with a bad policy like DEMON and a botched implementation of GST,

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.400
[Amit Varma]: they've actually set the nation backwards.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.400
[Amit Varma]: And hopefully, we can now sort of start getting back on track.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.400
[Amit Varma]: And as Modi ji would say, there are some positive indicators.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:13.400
[Amit Varma]: So, if you're listening to this podcast and you can't afford tomatoes, eat tractors instead.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.400
[Amit Varma]: On that note, Vivek, thanks so much for coming on the show.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.400
