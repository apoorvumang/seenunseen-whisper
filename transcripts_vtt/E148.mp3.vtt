00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:48.980
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.980
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.220
[Amit Varma]: with, a kitchen knife. A kitchen knife can also be used to kill people. It can't quite

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.020
[Amit Varma]: destroy an entire neighborhood, but you can take a life or two or three.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.200
[Amit Varma]: My second question to you is, should the knife be banned? I rather suspect that I have the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.820
[Amit Varma]: same answer to these two questions as most of you do. On the question of the bombzooka,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.040
[Amit Varma]: the weapon that costs a thousand rupees and can blow up a neighborhood, yes, I believe

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.380
[Amit Varma]: the government should ban it. On the question of the knife, which is so useful to us, even

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.660
[Amit Varma]: essential to us in so many ways, no, I don't believe a knife should be banned. Ban the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.120
[Amit Varma]: bombzooka, don't ban the knife. But this now brings me to my third question for you. If

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.980
[Amit Varma]: the bombzooka and the ordinary kitchen knife are part of a continuum in terms of the damage

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.900
[Amit Varma]: they cause, somewhere in that continuum is a line that we draw in terms of whether we

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:52.060
[Amit Varma]: ban it or not. Where do we draw that line? And why do we draw that line there?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.460
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.220
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. I hope you had time to think about that third question

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.700
[Amit Varma]: I asked. In case you haven't, pause this episode and think about it for a moment. Where do

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.900
[Amit Varma]: you draw the line between the kitchen knife and the bombzooka and decide that a weapon

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.100
[Amit Varma]: should be banned? My answer is that we draw the line depending on how much damage a weapon

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.980
[Amit Varma]: can cause. With a knife, you can kill at most two or three people before you are stopped,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.580
[Amit Varma]: perhaps even less. With a bombzooka, you can kill hundreds of people, even thousands in

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.240
[Amit Varma]: a crowded neighborhood or a mall or a marketplace. Where would I draw a line in between? Among

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.780
[Amit Varma]: potential weapons that exist at the moment, I would draw the line at a gun. As we have

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.700
[Amit Varma]: seen in recent years, it takes one nutcase to pick up a gun and go on a killing spree

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.060
[Amit Varma]: that can kill 10, 20, 30 people. Also, guns are widely used by people to kill themselves

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.340
[Amit Varma]: as they're an easy, relatively friction-free way to commit suicide. So I draw the line

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.500
[Amit Varma]: there. And I'd argue for the status quo in India where you cannot buy a gun off the counter.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.420
[Amit Varma]: Now, it might seem odd to you that a libertarian like me holds such a position. After all,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.620
[Amit Varma]: libertarians in the USA argue vociferously for gun rights. Well, yeah, but I'd argue

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.660
[Amit Varma]: that there is context there in terms of how the USA evolved, the distrust of the state

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.260
[Amit Varma]: that is embedded in their culture as it should be in every culture, in fact, and that context

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.180
[Amit Varma]: doesn't quite apply to India. Also, my friend and a frequent guest on the show, Shruti Rajgopalan,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.300
[Amit Varma]: once drew a two by two matrix for me on a piece of paper and showed me two kinds of

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.660
[Amit Varma]: equilibria. In one equilibrium, criminals plus cops have guns and so do common citizens

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.460
[Amit Varma]: to defend themselves. In another, neither criminals plus cops nor common citizens have

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.860
[Amit Varma]: guns. The other two possibilities are situations where cops and criminals have guns, but citizens

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.580
[Amit Varma]: don't to defend themselves. And citizens have guns, but cops don't. The argument could be

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.660
[Amit Varma]: made that both of these are unstable situations, and you need to be in one of two equilibria.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.980
[Amit Varma]: Either everyone can have a gun or no one has a gun. The USA is in the first equilibrium,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.660
[Amit Varma]: India is in the second. And while I don't have enough knowledge to take a position on

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.620
[Amit Varma]: the US equilibrium, I believe that India needs to stay in the second one. So my position

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.460
[Amit Varma]: that the sale of guns should not be legal applies to India for now, which is the society

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.580
[Amit Varma]: I live in and know and think I understand. So I speak in this context alone. Now my guests

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.440
[Amit Varma]: in the show are two men who have both studied law and economics, and they both disagree

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.980
[Amit Varma]: with me in different subtle ways. Shubho Roy is a fellow at the NIPFP. Sudhanshu Neema

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.420
[Amit Varma]: works at the Center for Civil Society. In the conversation you're about to listen to

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.740
[Amit Varma]: both of them are going to make great arguments against the position I just outlined. They

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.660
[Amit Varma]: might convince me or they might not. But before we go to the conversation, let's take a quick

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.460
[Amit Varma]: commercial break. Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.700
[Amit Varma]: to have paintings by the artists you like hanging on your walls? Well, worry no more.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.500
[Amit Varma]: Head on over to Indian colors.com. Indian colors is a company that licenses images of

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.420
[Amit Varma]: the finest modern art from some of the best artists in India and adapts them into objects

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.020
[Amit Varma]: of everyday use. These include wearable art like stoles and shrugs, home decor like cushion

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.740
[Amit Varma]: covers and table runners and accessories like tote bags. This allows art lovers to actually

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.940
[Amit Varma]: get fine art into their homes at an accessible price. And artists get royalties on sales

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.940
[Amit Varma]: just like authors do. What's more, Indian colors now has an exciting range of new products,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.340
[Amit Varma]: including fridge magnets with some stunning motifs and salad bowls and platters made of

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.460
[Amit Varma]: mango wood. Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vazvo, Ex Vazvo, Brinda

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.340
[Amit Varma]: Miller, Dilip Sharma, Shruti Nelson and Pradeep Mishra. They accept bulk orders for corporate

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.520
[Amit Varma]: and festival gifting. But even if you want to buy just for yourself or a friend, head

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.860
[Amit Varma]: on over to Indian colors.com. That's colors with an OU. And if you want a 20% discount,

[Amit Varma]: colors.com. Shubho, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you, Amit. So Shubho, tell

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.660
[Guest 1]: me I mean, what's your answer to the three questions I posed? I would like to squirm

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.060
[Guest 1]: around and say the question of banning is a very simplistic understanding of how law

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.540
[Guest 1]: operates. You would argue that the Indian Army should have the bomb Zuka. And that goes

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.820
[Guest 1]: on to say, for example, nuclear weapons, which is correct. But at the end of the day, if

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.780
[Guest 1]: you take a nuclear weapon, bomb Zuka, or some of the weapons that are there, while it is

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.140
[Guest 1]: licensed, it's at the end of the day in the hand of one individual, somebody in the army,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.420
[Guest 1]: somebody in the Air Force, or maybe a group of people in the Air Force or army when it

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.020
[Guest 1]: comes to nukes, because we keep them disassembled, have the system to launch and destroy. And

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.580
[Guest 1]: those are individual citizens of India who have access to weapons of mass destruction.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.540
[Guest 1]: Yes, they have joined the army, but we should not think that the army has complete control

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.980
[Guest 1]: all the time. And on the other hand, on the knife, if you gave a knife to a three year

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.060
[Guest 1]: old child or a five year old child, or your child, you would be put away for child endangerment

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.420
[Guest 1]: in any society. So you see, at both ends, there are exceptions. And we should start

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.060
[Guest 1]: thinking about from this context that the context of ban, absolute clear ban is kind

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.300
[Guest 1]: of extreme in law and usually does not serve our purpose. And that is why, for example,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.100
[Guest 1]: we have legislatures to debate these issues multiple number of times and come with graded

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.020
[Guest 1]: intervention. So even a knife to a child is illegal, and you should go to jail for child

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.740
[Guest 1]: endangerment if you leave a large number, let your child play with knives. And on the

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:50.660
[Guest 1]: other hand, even a bomb Zuka is not illegal in the hands of a fighter pilot or soldier,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.820
[Guest 1]: or somebody who has been licensed and carry has the power to do that. And those person

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:02.220
[Guest 1]: could still go on rampage, but we have created systems and processes hopefully to prevent

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.900
[Guest 1]: that. And so these are the two extremes, but at neither extremes, do you get a clear ban

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.900
[Amit Varma]: or a clear allowance?

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.540
[Amit Varma]: I think when I use the term ban, I mean, these would be commonly understood exceptions. I

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.260
[Amit Varma]: mean, everybody gets it that okay, the army is going to have weapons and you can't give

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:22.300
[Amit Varma]: weapons or even anything that could potentially be used as a weapon to a child. So these are

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.100
[Amit Varma]: kind of understood and also the fact that the army has these weapons and it consists

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:34.060
[Amit Varma]: of individuals who could also have homicidal urges and go berserk is not really an argument

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.180
[Amit Varma]: for letting everybody have them right because the probabilities rise exponentially if you

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.420
[Amit Varma]: let the common citizenry.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.340
[Guest 1]: True. So all I'm saying is that there's a grading.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.340
[Amit Varma]: I get that.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.660
[Guest 1]: And in that grading once I think now I would argue that the guns come in somewhere in that

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.220
[Guest 1]: grading where in the Indian context, we have kind of done it very dumb, that we have done

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.180
[Guest 1]: it very simply and said ban. Instead of that, I would say you do grading for similarly for

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.660
[Guest 1]: guns and the guns fall in that continuum and depending on the usage of the gun, depending

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.180
[Guest 1]: on who has the gun, you do the systems and as you pointed out correctly that the American

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.940
[Guest 1]: system is one end of it, no licensing, no registration. But the Indian system is at

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.580
[Guest 1]: the other extreme of it, that unless some civil servant is convinced that your life

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:26.100
[Guest 1]: is in danger, you cannot purchase a gun. It is not a judicial process. It is not a process

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.220
[Guest 1]: which is subject to review in the normal system that we understand it. You don't get a reasoned

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.580
[Guest 1]: order as to whether your life is in, why your life is not in danger when you apply for it.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.900
[Guest 1]: So it creates a large amount of discretion to that entity which gives you the license.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.660
[Guest 1]: So we do not have a situation where as you pointed out, nobody has guns. We have a large

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.700
[Guest 1]: number of guns in the Indian system floating around. So the interesting statistics here

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:59.420
[Guest 1]: is that there are about 97 lakh registered guns in India, which is one per hundred.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.820
[Amit Varma]: I didn't know that. That's a lot of guns.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:10.060
[Guest 1]: Wait, there are around 7.1 crore total guns in India, which gives you a number of five

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.220
[Guest 1]: per hundred. US is the other extreme just for context is 120 per hundred, but there

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.020
[Guest 1]: are many countries above us. So what we get is around 6 crore guns in this country, which

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:26.220
[Guest 1]: are unregistered. And these people who own them, not all of them are criminals or horrible

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.020
[Guest 1]: people. But because we have created this extreme ban, there are a large number of people who

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.180
[Guest 1]: have guns because they've inherited it or when the law came in, they had the power to

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.460
[Guest 1]: hold guns. They didn't hand it over because they didn't want to or for whatever reasons.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.460
[Guest 1]: And now they're completely criminalized. If they even come willingly to hand over the

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.700
[Guest 1]: guns, they are open to prosecution under the Arms Act, which carries seven years of imprisonment

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.700
[Guest 1]: and which is very dangerous because it's not even a compoundable offense that you can go

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.180
[Guest 1]: and say, look, I'm willingly gave up my gun. So please don't prosecute me. You're totally

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:59.060
[Guest 1]: at the mercy. And this point is very interesting. We have a gun to population ratio of five

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.540
[Guest 1]: guns per hundred people, not that gun free as we think India is.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:09.180
[Amit Varma]: So I have a couple of points to make here, questions to ask rather. One is that it is

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.300
[Amit Varma]: implied in the statistic that listen, actually, it's not that hard to get a gun in India,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:18.340
[Amit Varma]: you can and I understand that, that you can if you want go out in the black market and

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.860
[Amit Varma]: figure out a way to get a gun. But there is a transaction cost, you have to make a certain

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.940
[Amit Varma]: amount of effort, not everyone does that. And so, you know, it is much harder for you

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.300
[Amit Varma]: to get hold of a gun on impulse, whereas otherwise, you know, you could just take it out of your

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:39.220
[Amit Varma]: pocket. Also, the point is that a lot of gun killings, a lot of gun deaths rather that

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.340
[Amit Varma]: happen, even in the US are not sort of shootouts we see in the news, they could be domestic

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.780
[Amit Varma]: disputes and very often and this is a huge problem, they are suicides, there happens

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.420
[Amit Varma]: to be a gun in the house. And again, a gun is an easy way to commit suicide on an impulse,

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.660
[Amit Varma]: you can take a gun, put it at your head and press the trigger. And that happens a lot

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:02.660
[Amit Varma]: apparently. And it's much harder to actually go to a bridge and jump off or hang yourself

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:08.780
[Amit Varma]: with all the elaborate apparatus that involves and the fact that there's a little more effort

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.420
[Amit Varma]: involved in that makes it a little less unlikely. So I mean, I've kind of made two separate

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.460
[Amit Varma]: points, what do you feel about them?

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:21.460
[Guest 1]: So on the point that it is a little difficult to get it and makes it difficult for impulse

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:27.780
[Guest 1]: buyers to get it, I agree with you there. But if you had a fairly robust registration

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:33.380
[Guest 1]: system, where there was no discretion on that part, like whether you are facing a threat

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.220
[Guest 1]: or not, but there is still objective checks that you don't have any previous criminal

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:43.020
[Guest 1]: convictions, you don't have domestic violence complaints against you, you do not have XYZ

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.980
[Guest 1]: things against you're not on parole or something like that, or you're not being charged and

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:52.460
[Guest 1]: tried, you can create those checks and balances to make it a little more difficult to make

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:58.540
[Guest 1]: impulse buys. And it still allows people but once you have made a purchase, you're not

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.340
[Guest 1]: completely criminalized. Today, if you are under stress or think that something bad will

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.260
[Guest 1]: happen, you buy the gun and now you're a criminal forever. So now you have to hide it, you have

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.700
[Guest 1]: to be unsafe about it. But on the other hand, if you did that all of that and for example,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:19.620
[Guest 1]: do a seven day gun safety course, go and do a medical checkup, go and get a NOC from your

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.160
[Guest 1]: wife, spouse or anybody who's living with you at home. These are some of the systems

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.820
[Guest 1]: which other countries do, which sometimes when we look from India seems like a ban,

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.740
[Guest 1]: like Canada does it you have to get a psychiatric checkup before you get it and they talk to

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.500
[Guest 1]: you and they check that you're not there your family has to people living with you have

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.460
[Guest 1]: to give an approval or no objection. And then you get it and that allows for example, to

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:49.060
[Guest 1]: take care of the first problem, which is the impulse buys. On suicide, I think yes and

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:55.100
[Guest 1]: no to that extent. There are many other ways to go and they are very painful. And if you

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.540
[Guest 1]: are a libertarian, you would argue if you want to finish off your life, it is your life.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:04.220
[Guest 1]: I don't subscribe to that point of view. But I think suicide is a mental health problem.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:09.380
[Guest 1]: And there are reasons for suicide. Japan has the highest suicide rate in the world in the

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.940
[Guest 1]: developed world, not much access to guns, people are putting themselves out with carbon

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:21.200
[Guest 1]: dioxide with a lot of other jumping off buildings. So when you have a suicide epidemic in a country,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.420
[Guest 1]: you should start looking at what are the cultural reasons which cause it, I think the US is

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.660
[Guest 1]: also going through some problems which create the suicide epidemic that you see in the US.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:37.260
[Guest 1]: I think it is the retrenchment of the workforce, which is not in the knowledge economy as production

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:43.220
[Guest 1]: goes out. And you know, JD Vance writes interesting things about why we are getting this problem

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:50.900
[Guest 1]: in the US because even mass shootouts are fairly recent phenomena in the US 80s 90s.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:56.140
[Guest 1]: They had guns for hundreds of years, 1776 onwards, they have been owning guns, we didn't

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:01.460
[Guest 1]: have this problem, we have some deep cultural problems there. Similarly, what we have in

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.820
[Guest 1]: Japan probably, which leads to suicide. So we have to start thinking about that point

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:11.860
[Guest 1]: that yes, self harm is a problem with guns. There are a lot of ways to go out yourself

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.420
[Guest 1]: and there I agree. But that is still from a libertarian point of view. That's not a

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:22.460
[Guest 1]: good argument. Because if you will harm yourself, for that people who don't harm themselves

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.740
[Guest 1]: should not leak. One of the easiest ways carbon monoxide poisoning, just turn your exhaust,

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.700
[Amit Varma]: put a pipe in your exhaust and put it in your car.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.940
[Amit Varma]: Sure, that's fair enough. And the one point where you've got me is a libertarian point

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.860
[Amit Varma]: of view where I do believe that if you have the right to life, you have the right to kill

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.540
[Amit Varma]: yourself. And I also believe that suicide is not necessarily a mental health problem.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:43.540
[Amit Varma]: It can, under certain circumstances be quite rational to choose to go out. So I buy that

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.780
[Amit Varma]: part of it. And that's a separate argument entirely, really. But the consequentialist

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.980
[Amit Varma]: argument against guns would involve that suicide rates go up and however high the Japanese

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.100
[Amit Varma]: rate might be, we don't know the counterfactual or what it would have been if guns were more

00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.100
[Amit Varma]: freely available. But we have and I'll come to this a little later when Sudhanshu also

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.220
[Amit Varma]: joins the discussion, perhaps that though I'm waiting for you to kind of let's squeeze

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.780
[Amit Varma]: this argument dry. But you know, the experience in Australia, for example, after they did

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.100
[Amit Varma]: their gun buyback, and they changed their gun laws, is that there are multiple studies

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.300
[Amit Varma]: we show which are which I'll cite, we showed that the rates of suicides drastically went

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.780
[Amit Varma]: down. Obviously, it's not a magic bullet, if I may use that phrase, but we'll come to

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:30.380
[Amit Varma]: that. I also wanted to address what you sort of said about, okay, here's what we can do

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.300
[Amit Varma]: with guns, you are not arguing they should be just sold over the counter, like random

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.580
[Amit Varma]: medicines, like an aspirin or something, but that they should be licensing. I have sort

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:47.740
[Amit Varma]: of two points to make. One is that we don't really have state capacity in India for anything.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.900
[Amit Varma]: So if you're going to say that these are the check, like if I want to buy a gun, these

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.660
[Amit Varma]: are the checks and balances. Number one, there isn't that state capacity to make sure I jump

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.420
[Amit Varma]: through all those hoops. So the system will be perverted in some way, like for example,

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.260
[Amit Varma]: today, you can go to the RTO and get a driving license without actually taking the test.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.820
[Amit Varma]: And I've seen that happen enough. And that's a failure of state capacity and failure of

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:15.220
[Amit Varma]: state capacity is essentially ubiquitous everywhere except when it comes to pure rent seeking

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:21.300
[Amit Varma]: when there is no lack of it. And the other issue there is that, especially with regard

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.500
[Amit Varma]: to India, when state capacity is low, we have seen that any system that can be gamed will

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.420
[Amit Varma]: be gamed. Right. So if you, for example, make it a requirement that okay, you have to get

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.820
[Amit Varma]: a psychiatrist certificate before we get to the gun. Come on, you know, there'll be the

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.220
[Amit Varma]: shop set up where an agent will get you a psychiatrist certificate and take 1000 bucks

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:45.260
[Amit Varma]: or whatever it is. And so that's that's one objection, the state capacity objection. And

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.180
[Amit Varma]: my second objection is also that look, I live in India. Okay. I mean, I've lived in India

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:55.200
[Amit Varma]: all my life, obviously, and I'm 45. And I've never felt the need to have a gun for purposes

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.500
[Amit Varma]: of self defense. Because any dicey situations that I have got myself in, I mean, I've never

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.140
[Amit Varma]: seen a gun really in civil life. There's never been like a shootout where I'm like, if I

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:11.500
[Amit Varma]: had a gun, I could intervene now. That's one that if you make guns freely available, you

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.660
[Amit Varma]: might create a situation where I might feel that need, but then you would be shifting

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:21.340
[Amit Varma]: from this equilibrium in India where nobody has guns to the sort of US equilibrium where

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.660
[Amit Varma]: because anybody can get a gun, you also feel the need to get a gun to defend yourself.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.960
[Amit Varma]: And I am like, why move from this equilibrium to that one? These are sort of my two points

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.620
[Guest 1]: state capacity and the equilibrium. On the question of state capacity, I would argue

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:44.860
[Guest 1]: that lack of state capacity, if it is taken as a reason for accepting reduction of freedom,

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.140
[Guest 1]: then you have to argue that it is okay for Gurgaon police to issue an advisory that women

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.900
[Guest 1]: will not travel after eight o'clock, because Gurgaon police is under manned. And so they

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:59.020
[Guest 1]: are unable to work. So that is first issue that we get that then that is a slippery slope

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:03.380
[Guest 1]: on which you start losing a lot of things. Actually, what has happened is, because of

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:08.840
[Guest 1]: the ban, we haven't developed state capacity. So the ban then becomes justification for

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.580
[Guest 1]: not investing in state capacity. And I would say, if you give the people of a kind, if

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.140
[Guest 1]: the government had the choice, you can ban it, or you can regulate it, they'll always

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:22.660
[Guest 1]: choose ban, because then they don't have to build state capacity to do it. But because

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.220
[Guest 1]: of that lack of state capacity, we already have six crore unregistered guns. So I would

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.860
[Guest 1]: say that, because of that lack of state capacity, we have that problem. And I agree with you.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.780
[Guest 1]: Yes, there were problems. But for example, recently, what Delhi RTO forces, the driving

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.940
[Guest 1]: instructor, one of the RTO officers to take a video of you driving. When I took the driving

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:49.060
[Guest 1]: test recently, they had to make me take a video. And so state capacity develops. Because

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.820
[Guest 1]: we could have said, okay, we'll ban driving, because we don't have state capacity for doing

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.500
[Guest 1]: that. And you could say that, yes, we'll do public transport, we'll do metro and practically

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.420
[Guest 1]: in Delhi, there's a very good argument to make or in Bombay that why do you need a driving

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.340
[Guest 1]: license in Bombay or Delhi. That brings me to the second point about the equilibrium.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:12.700
[Guest 1]: I would argue that equilibrium you face is because of the places you choose to live in.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:17.940
[Guest 1]: I choose to live in Delhi. It has got central armed police forces, it has got Delhi police,

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.820
[Guest 1]: the best police force in the country. It has got large amount of security cordons around

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.500
[Guest 1]: the system. So we live under that security umbrella. But what if you are a person who

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:34.460
[Guest 1]: stood for a panchayat election in Kashmir? What if you are a person who stood up against

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:42.380
[Guest 1]: the Naxals in Dante Vada? Okay, or you're just the local doctor who's being harassed

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.380
[Guest 1]: by goons, people who go out to the villages, people who go out to places where these 6.1

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.340
[Guest 1]: crore unregistered weapons are, they are not in the same equilibrium.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.420
[Amit Varma]: In that case, the lack of state capacity supports your point, because you're saying that if

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.380
[Amit Varma]: the state cannot protect me from Naxals in the village where I live, at least give me

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.980
[Guest 1]: the right to protect myself.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:08.340
[Guest 1]: And I would say also state is always an ex-post actor. That it comes after you have been shot,

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.820
[Guest 1]: it might do some justice and try to put the person in jail. If you believe in vengeance,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.140
[Guest 1]: they can put that person to death penalty also, but that person is gone. And that is

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:23.340
[Guest 1]: taken, that is over for you. So I would always say that you should have a last line of defense.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.780
[Guest 1]: And of course, that should be done reasonably, just like we have public transport in Delhi,

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:33.020
[Guest 1]: but I still want my car. And of course, again, I would argue that there are greater defense

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.340
[Guest 1]: requirements for different people. But it is not always very narrow that you must have

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.820
[Guest 1]: a threat, identified threat. For example, we allow, we have created a nice exception

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.780
[Guest 1]: for parliamentarians. Parliamentarians can buy guns the moment they become parliamentarians.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:52.820
[Guest 1]: We don't adjust the threat of individual parliamentarians. But I would say why just parliamentarians?

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.420
[Guest 1]: I think if you're a parliamentarian from Bombay or Delhi, the risk is much lower than if you

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:01.700
[Guest 1]: just even stood for a Gram Panchayat election in Kashmir, or a headmaster in a school in

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:08.500
[Guest 1]: Dante Wada. So you're caught in the crossfire. It's your last line of defense. And you know,

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:16.140
[Guest 1]: 2008, the Bombay attack, it can happen in India, again and again, it was very successful.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.740
[Guest 1]: I'm surprised. And I am thankful to the Indian state for probably preventing those things

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.540
[Guest 1]: from happening again and again. But 2008, I talked to somebody who said, this is a normal

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.140
[Guest 1]: thing in Kashmir, holding up militants in hotels and then killing because hotels are

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.500
[Guest 1]: a good target. Most people are not residents. It's a very common thing to do in Kashmir.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.660
[Guest 1]: And you were in Bombay at the time that affected you personally?

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.860
[Guest 1]: No, I did not. I was not in Bombay, but I had worked with somebody who got killed in

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:45.820
[Guest 1]: that. And yes, that kind of changed my perception on this issue. And I started reading more.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:51.620
[Guest 1]: And then I went from this nuanced position of from a simplistic position of ban and non

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:57.220
[Guest 1]: ban and allowed to a more nuanced graded position. So if you are one of those people, the other

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:03.140
[Guest 1]: thing I would say is also in this case is federalism. That you can make laws that okay,

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:08.460
[Guest 1]: you can't have guns here, you can have guns there. But those are also options to choose

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.300
[Guest 1]: for the US doesn't have a single gun law, by the way.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.300
[Amit Varma]: Oh, okay. It's all the states.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.980
[Guest 1]: States or even city specific cities can have ordinances. I think we should also think of

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:24.460
[Guest 1]: federalism on that way. But again, what the main judgment in the US which created all

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:30.820
[Guest 1]: this dispute was the Heller judgment, which people misquote. The Heller judgment required

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:37.820
[Guest 1]: residents of Washington DC if they owned a gun to either disassemble the gun or an unload

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:43.240
[Guest 1]: and disassemble the gun or keep the gun loaded and assembled with a lock physical lock and

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.500
[Guest 1]: key on the trigger to prevent it from being used. And the person who wanted was a retired

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.220
[Guest 1]: cop who had investigated mafia systems and he would have to keep a gun with a physical

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:57.700
[Guest 1]: lock on the thing and he said this extreme and the US Supreme Court position is that

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.620
[Guest 1]: you can't put so much restrictions on the right to bear arms that it becomes ineffective.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.820
[Guest 1]: And think of it, the Washington didn't ban it. They put so many restrictions that it

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.060
[Guest 1]: became infeasible. And I think that is where we should start thinking about that. No, let's

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:16.640
[Guest 1]: not put so much restrictions that none of us can. And I would say also there is shooting

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:23.540
[Guest 1]: as a sport. Most of Indian top shooters people don't know this go to Germany to train or

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.660
[Guest 1]: to other countries. Bindra went to Germany to train. Why? It's impossible to import a

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.180
[Amit Varma]: gun in India. High quality guns cannot be imported. And also even trivial things like

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.820
[Amit Varma]: the import duties on bullets and all of that nonsense even for a sportsman like him. Yeah.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:41.020
[Guest 1]: And things like that it made him cheaper to just go outside and practice and I think it

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.860
[Guest 1]: is good to have a amount of population who are trained in firearms. So there are two

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.380
[Amit Varma]: aspects to what you just said. One is there is a philosophical argument of we should have

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:56.020
[Amit Varma]: the right to defend ourselves. And you turn my point of state capacity against me by showing

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.140
[Amit Varma]: that I mean, we have privilege to be in Delhi and Bombay respectively. But if you are in

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:04.740
[Amit Varma]: a smaller part of India where there is effectively no rule of law, and you can't tell a citizen

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.780
[Amit Varma]: that the state won't defend you, but you can't defend yourself either. So that's your sort

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:15.180
[Amit Varma]: of philosophical argument if I stated correctly. And the practical argument, if one may say

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:20.460
[Amit Varma]: comes from the instance of the 2008 attacks, where you're saying that, listen, it is probable

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.580
[Amit Varma]: that if one of the victims or one of the people who was in that space had a gun, it is somewhat

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:30.140
[Amit Varma]: probable that the casualties could have been less because the likelihood of someone fighting

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.220
[Amit Varma]: back is nonzero. And therefore they could have or at least the guards had guns. Oh,

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.780
[Guest 1]: even the guard, even the guards don't have even private security in India can't get guns.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.580
[Guest 1]: At the most one guy has a smooth barrel shotgun, which is legal and all that very difficult.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.620
[Amit Varma]: Even private security guards can't have guns.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.820
[Amit Varma]: So this is an argument that people in favor of gun rights make whenever there is a mass

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.900
[Amit Varma]: shooting that, you know, there were less people would have died if they were guns. So I'm

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:59.940
[Amit Varma]: curious that you obviously have to, I mean, there is a trade off here, you have to weigh

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:04.820
[Amit Varma]: the likelihood of the shooter being stopped before he kills so many people, with the likelihood

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:10.380
[Amit Varma]: of more people dying in a dispersed way, including from suicides or domestic quarrels or misfires,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.460
[Amit Varma]: if a child gets it or whatever, you have to weigh those two. Are there statistics that

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.300
[Amit Varma]: you can use in your favor, leaving the philosophical argument aside, just looking at consequences?

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.940
[Amit Varma]: Are there statistics you can cite in your favor to show that there is a correlation

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.460
[Amit Varma]: between greater availability of guns and less gun violence?

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:33.820
[Guest 1]: No, difficult. The problem with the statistics in this is, as you pointed out, different

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.820
[Amit Varma]: cultural political systems.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.500
[Amit Varma]: So the counterfactuals don't exist.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:44.220
[Guest 1]: Yes, but I would argue that when people say guns are banned in most developed countries,

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.820
[Guest 1]: they are making a very simplistic comparison with the Indian system. And that is not true.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.940
[Guest 1]: In many developed countries, you're allowed to buy guns for home defense. Sportsmen are

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:57.820
[Guest 1]: allowed to buy guns, you're allowed to hold guns for systems with different restrictions.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.220
[Guest 1]: And I would say many of them are far more peaceful than India is. India's homicide rates

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:08.820
[Guest 1]: are pretty high. It's not that low as we would like to think it is. And that's my point on

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.900
[Guest 1]: this issue. If we were to be able to do this, you know, kind of a calculus and come to the

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.900
[Guest 1]: right point, then it doesn't work that way. It is a call you have to take. And there I

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.980
[Guest 1]: would argue where is the origin of our gun law. Our gun law starts in 1878. After the

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:30.780
[Guest 1]: mutiny, where the sole objective of the British rulers were to take away all the guns from

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:36.580
[Guest 1]: Indians because they didn't like what happened the last time Indians had guns. And that was

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:40.940
[Guest 1]: the philosophical basis for our gun law. People make these other arguments for that it is

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.940
[Amit Varma]: not.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.660
[Amit Varma]: But the philosophical basis was an oppressive state wanting to keep its subjects in check.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:51.820
[Guest 1]: Yes. And to that extent that they can't defend themselves at all. And this is an ideological

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:57.180
[Guest 1]: question to answer. And I would say yes, we can differ on this plateau. But we should

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.820
[Guest 1]: start thinking about it. If we were to do an Indian full ban, I would argue with you,

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:06.340
[Guest 1]: then put the state capacity to take out the 6.1 crore guns which are unregistered. And

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.060
[Guest 1]: what do you do with the guys who have registered guns? Manu Sharma shot somebody with a registered

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.220
[Guest 1]: gun. Interestingly, it was registered with his father who was an MP probably. That's

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.940
[Guest 1]: how he got a 22 caliber. And so the people who have registered guns, are we going to

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:25.180
[Guest 1]: do a full blanket ban? I'm okay with a full blanket ban. But then no guns with cops, no

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.140
[Guest 1]: exceptions to the ban by oh, you are in personal danger. So you can get a gun, go and get a

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.900
[Guest 1]: security guard, pay for a cop to guard you.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.860
[Amit Varma]: But despite these statistics of how many guns we have and five for every hundred and so

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:43.620
[Amit Varma]: on, would you broadly agree or disagree with the contention I made at the start of the

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.620
[Amit Varma]: episode that we are in an equilibrium where nobody has guns, which seems broadly and again,

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.580
[Amit Varma]: I'm obviously biased by my privileged existence in Bombay, where I don't see guns around me

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.780
[Amit Varma]: at all and don't feel the need for one. And it's possible that in other parts of India,

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.580
[Unknown]: it's obviously not like that and guns are a part of everyday violence and people are

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:05.940
[Amit Varma]: defenseless against it. So is my contention about that equilibria false to begin with?

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.540
[Guest 1]: I would say it is true for certain parts of India, but not true for large parts of India.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:14.500
[Guest 1]: If you go into the badlands of UP, Bihar, which is a border with Nepal, from where guns

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:19.740
[Guest 1]: can come from China, if you go to Kashmir, where Pakistan has pumped guns into the system,

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:27.460
[Guest 1]: if you go to Northeast, where again, the insurgencies have pumped guns from Myanmar, China, Bangladesh,

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.420
[Guest 1]: that is not true. And there, I mean, because we have a single Indian Arms Act, all over

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:39.100
[Guest 1]: the country, same law, that is you and I are beneficiaries of the equilibria here, but

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.200
[Guest 1]: that reality is not the reality which a lot of people face. And that is something we should

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.940
[Guest 1]: consider and point out and I'm okay for if you think of graded in terms of geography

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:55.740
[Guest 1]: also. You can't have guns here, you can't have guns there. There are some problems with

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:04.100
[Guest 1]: that also because people move freely. But it's not a reality of the system here. And

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:08.460
[Guest 1]: the other question about the murder rate question, more than the absolute number and this is

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:14.100
[Guest 1]: probably a very charged point, it's also important who gets killed. Okay, if murder rate goes

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.220
[Guest 1]: up, but a few more bad people are getting killed, people who are threatening other people

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.140
[Guest 1]: getting killed. Is that a horrible thing to be in?

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.740
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if the data existed, I could consider that argument. But if it's a hypothetical

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:33.300
[Amit Varma]: that you're proposing, then it's, you know, I wouldn't even know how to, like, I came

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:38.800
[Amit Varma]: across some limited studies. And again, I haven't, to be very honest, I did the lazy

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.620
[Amit Varma]: thing of just googling online for arguments against gun rights. I found some studies cited.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.480
[Amit Varma]: So I've just copy pasted the conclusions here. I haven't looked at the studies myself to

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.340
[Amit Varma]: see the methodology as I would do.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.460
[Guest 1]: I've looked at one or two, there's another thing that happens. If you have relatively

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.620
[Guest 1]: freer ownership of guns, violent break-ins fall.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.980
[Amit Varma]: Okay, because it might be the chance that the house owner has a gun and you could...

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:06.620
[Guest 1]: And this has been studied when looking at smaller communities in the US with freer gun

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.620
[Amit Varma]: rights and...

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.100
[Amit Varma]: This is interesting. So what you're saying is you're changing the incentives for criminals

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.260
[Amit Varma]: because they don't know who might fight back. And also you're changing the incentives for

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.260
[Amit Varma]: even terrorists for something like the 2008 attacks.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.420
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I would say terrorist is difficult. Like if you have committed to kill yourself,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.140
[Guest 1]: you will do it, you will do it. And it will be only if somebody has a gun, they'll take

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.580
[Guest 1]: you down. And hopefully that is this outcome you get. But yes, there is a lot of petty

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.100
[Guest 1]: crime or petty violence that happens in India. I would call it petty because in the sense

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:41.060
[Guest 1]: that the person who's doing it is in larger numbers to the victim and is just, you know,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.700
[Guest 1]: taking advantage of his size or numbers, lynchings, breaking-ins, things like that, where the

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.300
[Guest 1]: person is just knows the other person is weak. And there I think gun changes that dynamic.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.420
[Guest 1]: And so you have to start looking at those numbers also. Let's say the murder rate goes

00:31:54.420 --> 00:32:00.740
[Guest 1]: up a little bit. But violent break-ins go down to go down by a lot.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.740
[Guest 1]: How do you calibrate that?

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.660
[Guest 1]: Yeah, and that is a trade off to also start thinking about.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.780
[Amit Varma]: I'll cite some figures anyway. And I think when Sudhanshu comes in, he'll have counter

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:14.180
[Amit Varma]: figures to these. But so in 1983, there was a cross sectional studies of all 50 US states,

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.860
[Amit Varma]: which showed that the six states with the strictest gun laws, according to the NRA,

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.620
[Amit Varma]: had suicide rates that were approximately three out of 100,000 people lower than in

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.500
[Amit Varma]: other states. And at these states, suicide rates were four out of 100,000 people lower

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:34.380
[Amit Varma]: than those of the states with the least restrictive gun laws. This is one study. Then there's

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:40.140
[Amit Varma]: a 2011 study that found that firearm regulation laws in the US have, quote, a significant

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:47.060
[Amit Varma]: deterrent effect on male suicide, stop quote. A 2014 study found in the US found that children

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.660
[Amit Varma]: living in states with stricter gun laws were safer, stop quote. And I don't know how they

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:56.660
[Amit Varma]: define this or find that out. I'm just sort of quoting what I found. Now in Australia,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.020
[Amit Varma]: interestingly, where they changed the gun laws, and they bought back a lot of firearms

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:06.620
[Amit Varma]: and so on. 2004 study found that in the context of these laws, overall firearm related deaths,

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.700
[Amit Varma]: especially suicides declined dramatically. I haven't seen the study. I don't know what

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:16.780
[Guest 1]: they mean. But the interesting part in this is the firearm related death. Okay. Murder

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:21.540
[Guest 1]: rate, how much did it fall? is an interesting question. So London is now the knife injury

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:27.420
[Guest 1]: capital of the world. It is an interesting part to that. That's an interesting title

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:33.580
[Amit Varma]: for a city also we are the knife injury capital. Okay, and another 2006 study in Australia

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:38.460
[Amit Varma]: found that after the law was enacted in 1996 by Australia, the country went more than a

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.460
[Amit Varma]: decade without any mass shootings, and gun related deaths, especially suicides declined

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.060
[Amit Varma]: dramatically. But as you've pointed out, you shouldn't look at gun related deaths, you

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.060
[Amit Varma]: should look at the overall death rate. So what I'm going to ask you to do Shubha before

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:56.020
[Amit Varma]: we bring Sudhanshu in to argue with both of us and convince us that we are wrong, is I

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:01.580
[Amit Varma]: want to make sure that I've given you a chance to sum up your position as completely as possible,

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:06.420
[Amit Varma]: and not kind of leave anything out. So I'll ask you to like, if there's a further argument

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:11.740
[Amit Varma]: you'd like to add, please do that. And state your position for me once that I mean, obviously,

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.860
[Amit Varma]: we can't use the term ban now, because that's too simplistic, as you pointed out. How do

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.460
[Amit Varma]: you think gun availability in India should be regulated and managed? What's your whole

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:25.420
[Guest 1]: view on this? I would say we have to go from that spectrum, that you can't give a knife

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:32.660
[Guest 1]: to a child. And you can't say that, no, the Indian Army cannot own bomb Zookas. And in

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.860
[Guest 1]: that spectrum, we have to start thinking about it. What bans also do is make us intellectually

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:42.620
[Guest 1]: lazy, we don't think about it. So when you start having, I would say that my position

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.140
[Guest 1]: is we should have a graded approach. And of course, depending on situations, we should

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:51.500
[Guest 1]: allow people to own guns, the Indian law does it, but it gives too much discretion on the

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.620
[Guest 1]: part of the officer who gives that system, we should have a system by which you can challenge

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:01.980
[Guest 1]: it or show some systems and we don't have checks and balances on it. So once your threat

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:07.740
[Guest 1]: to life is established, you can get a gun without training, without safety checks, without

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:13.100
[Guest 1]: any ability to whether you store the gun properly or not. And we need to move from that and

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.620
[Guest 1]: say that you have to do all these other steps. And then we will get into situations where

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:22.620
[Guest 1]: we start dealing with guns as a system. So for example, I would like to add something.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:27.580
[Guest 1]: When we have celebratory firings in India, you have to charge the people under nuisance,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.420
[Guest 1]: because we have created this myth that India guns are banned, we don't have a crime of

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:37.180
[Guest 1]: illegal discharge of a firearm, or a dangerous discharge of a firearm. While Manushama went

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:43.100
[Guest 1]: to jail, his dad did not go to jail or anything because the gun, there is no crime for handing

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:49.420
[Guest 1]: your gun to the son. Because we presume that it's banned. So therefore, it is not a crime

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.580
[Guest 1]: for a registered user to hand his gun to the son or even leave it in a place where his

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.580
[Amit Varma]: son can access it easily.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.940
[Amit Varma]: So not only do we pretend it's banned, you're saying the Indian state is in a state of denial

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.300
[Amit Varma]: about the gun ownership that is already there. And therefore, we can't have effective law.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.940
[Guest 1]: And therefore, when things really go bad, we are unable to then deal with it. Can you

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:13.620
[Guest 1]: sue him under Arms Act? No. And that is some of those issues. So you should do, for example,

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.900
[Guest 1]: bullet control. How many bullets do you have? If you fired a bullet, give me the casing,

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.400
[Guest 1]: show me where you fired it. You have to do all of that. And then you can arrest and prosecute

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.300
[Guest 1]: a lot of people for violating those even if you might not have the full evidence of murder.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.860
[Guest 1]: At the end, Manushama was convicted because spent cartridges were found in his car, which

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.940
[Guest 1]: matched the bullet that was shot through Jessica.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:40.380
[Amit Varma]: And your argument is that in the kind of regulated environment you envisage, that would always

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.860
[Amit Varma]: be there, you would be able to trace every gun and every bullet back to the owner, they

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.860
[Amit Varma]: wouldn't be the black market, whatever exists of it. And therefore, you know, you'd have

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.260
[Amit Varma]: a very good handle on things.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:55.660
[Guest 1]: Yeah, UK does it very simple, you get a gun, they shoot a sample one and they keep the

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.300
[Guest 1]: ballistic marks. This will be expensive. I'm not saying this alone, we'll have to build

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:04.540
[Guest 1]: state capacity to do it. But we can't live in the denial of that system. And you know,

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.740
[Guest 1]: if he had that, the Manushama case wouldn't have had, he almost got away with it. He got

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:13.740
[Guest 1]: acquitted by the trial court, because he could not recover the gun. But if he had the bullet

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.540
[Guest 1]: and that bullet matched his gun, or matched his father's gun, I think there should be

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.980
[Guest 1]: some at least some presumption which would lead to some at least lesser, but you go for

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.980
[Guest 1]: seven years, eight years of conviction, you hand over gun to your child, you go for some

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:31.460
[Guest 1]: time of conviction, you do celebratory firings, you go to, so we have to do graded and once

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:35.420
[Guest 1]: we do graded, we'll get into a lot of trouble. But those trouble will then clear up all these

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.260
[Guest 1]: obligations and processes where sometimes the Indian law gets into a vacuum. What do

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:47.300
[Guest 1]: we do with this fact about gun ownership and systems we have this denial of we are living

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.500
[Guest 1]: the ban is officially on paper. But there are six floor guns on the market and we have

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.180
[Guest 1]: to just deal with the problem and first level of dealing is let's accept it and let's make

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.020
[Amit Varma]: reasonable laws around it.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.620
[Amit Varma]: That's an excellent argument and you've given me a lot to think about. But we are going

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:07.140
[Amit Varma]: to have a lot more to think about after a quick commercial break when we are joined

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.580

[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you on with your show.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.340
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Shubho Roy and Sudhanshu Nima

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:16.300
[Amit Varma]: about gun rights. I started this episode by making my argument on why guns should not

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:22.260
[Amit Varma]: be sold openly over the counter in India. Shubho did not agree with me and made a powerful

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:28.180
[Amit Varma]: argument about why no gun should be sold in India, but with certain restrictions and licensing

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.380
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. And now I'll invite my third guest on to the show. Sudhanshu,

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.380
[Amit Varma]: welcome to the show.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:39.740
[Guest 2]: Thank you, Amit. All right. So let me begin with stating my position and then we can go

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:46.460
[Guest 2]: forward from there. So my position is anyone above 18, adult, competent, mentally competent,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:54.700
[Guest 2]: that is, should be allowed to have a gun without any restrictions or licensing. Okay. And my

00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:02.780
[Guest 2]: argument, barring everything which has been discussed, my argument specifically is against

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:08.700
[Guest 2]: the state that I have a right to defend myself against the state. So I'm arguing for the

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:14.860
[Guest 2]: hundred million victims of communism who were killed in China and Russia and Cambodia and

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.780
[Guest 2]: many other countries, the North Koreans, even the Jews in Germany first were disarmed by

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:26.320
[Guest 2]: Hitler and then were killed. So my argument is for those people. And I'm very specific

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:34.060
[Guest 2]: about deontology. I am not going to enter into a consequentialist debate because I think

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:43.420
[Guest 2]: that's a very wrong mechanism to analyze an issue like rights. And as you deal with the

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:48.780
[Guest 2]: question of impulse, that you could commit suicide on impulse with a gun, that is all

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:56.100
[Guest 2]: well and good. But why should my right be curtailed because of your impulse? Right.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:02.580
[Guest 2]: And on the question of bombs, I say let everyone have them because once the state comes for

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:08.620
[Guest 2]: you and you're armless, defenseless, there's nothing for you. The state can starve you

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:14.480
[Guest 2]: to death as we have seen in the Chinese regimes. They can kill you with guns like we have seen

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:22.340
[Guest 2]: Hitler do. They have gulags, special prisons for you. They can do anything to you. And

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.900
[Guest 2]: what will you defend yourself with? Sticks?

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.380
[Amit Varma]: So I'll unpack the points you made for the benefit of my listeners, especially deontology

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:33.700
[Amit Varma]: and consequentialism. And basically, you can make two kinds of moral arguments I'm simplifying

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:38.180
[Amit Varma]: massively. But one is you can come from first principles and say that these are my first

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.900
[Amit Varma]: principles and my entire moral view of the world flows from those. And the other is that

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.200
[Amit Varma]: I don't really have any first principles, except that we should do the greatest good

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.740
[Amit Varma]: of the greatest number or whatever, or we should look at spreading welfare. So we should

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:55.420
[Amit Varma]: look at the consequences of things. So for example, a consequentialist looking at gun

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:59.940
[Amit Varma]: rights would then try to gather data and figure out what kills more people or less people

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:04.060
[Amit Varma]: and whether banning guns helps or it doesn't. And of course, as Shobha pointed out, the

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.740
[Amit Varma]: data is very muddy, it can be misinterpreted in different ways. And this is this does become

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.980
[Amit Varma]: a problem with social science that because you don't know the counterfactuals, you can't

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:18.460
[Amit Varma]: do testing under controlled circumstances. What inevitably happens is that every ideological

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:25.460
[Amit Varma]: party will find some data that appears to support its position. So even in terms of

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.620
[Amit Varma]: consequentialism, even if you were to say that, I believe in that is really difficult

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:35.220
[Amit Varma]: to come to a conclusion if you're willing to reasonably consider both sides of the argument.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:40.060
[Amit Varma]: But what you're saying is I don't care about consequentialism. What you are coming from

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.860
[Amit Varma]: first principles and your first principles are based on the individual's right to self

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.540
[Amit Varma]: autonomy and to defend herself from the state.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:58.060
[Guest 2]: Yes. And also, we can go into the question of how guns are regulated currently, as Shobha

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:04.980
[Guest 2]: pointed out, my concern with licensing or any form of registration with the state is

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:11.140
[Guest 2]: that once the state decides like on one hand, you are saying that this person running the

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:15.700
[Guest 2]: country is a dictator. On the other hand, you are saying that you should not have guns

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:23.140
[Guest 2]: without permission of the state. So in case of let's say, Indira Gandhi during emergency,

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.780
[Guest 2]: all those people who are forced to civilize should not they have guns? How would they

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.660
[Guest 2]: defend themselves once the state comes for you? And if they know you have a gun, be it

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:39.100
[Guest 2]: by registration or licensing, they will have your addresses, they will link it to Aadhaar,

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:44.420
[Guest 2]: you know, and they will come for you first. So disarm you first, then go for the rest

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:51.900
[Guest 2]: of the population. So that is one set of arguments. Second, guns also defend people who don't

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:57.660
[Guest 2]: have guns. So for example, it increases the cost to criminals. So if a rapist in Delhi

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:02.340
[Guest 2]: is looking for a new victim, the cost goes up because they don't know whether this person

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:08.740
[Guest 2]: may or may not have a gun. So the incidence reduces similar to what happens with invention

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:14.620
[Guest 2]: of car alarms, even cars which don't have alarm, the theft goes down. It just does because

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:20.580
[Guest 2]: criminals have to consider the possibility that this car might be alarmed. Right. So

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:28.020
[Guest 2]: that is one thing. And second, we have seen so for example, in US, Chicago tends to have

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:36.220
[Guest 2]: the most regulations on guns. And it's also the city with highest numbers of homicides

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:43.100
[Guest 2]: in the US. Whereas if you look at other parts of us where guns are open carry, mass shootings

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:50.380
[Guest 2]: are much less homicide rates are down. So even from a consequentialist point of view,

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.900
[Guest 2]: we can discuss

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:58.540
[Amit Varma]: But you know, here, I would say that the causation can also go the other way. For example, you

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:03.340
[Amit Varma]: know, Chicago might have more laws restricting guns because they have a greater problem with

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:07.220
[Amit Varma]: crime to begin with. And if the Shubhukt come in, please.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.540
[Guest 1]: So it's very interesting. I've been reading the Illinois gun control laws. And it makes

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:16.900
[Guest 1]: a very interesting point about Chicago. In Chicago, you can keep a gun with yourself,

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:22.260
[Guest 1]: you can keep a gun in your car. You can't get up on the public transport with a gun.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:27.340
[Guest 1]: You can't enter an office or a public building with a gun. Now, what it plays out is very

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:32.660
[Guest 1]: interesting. Let's say you have a nine to five job, you take the metro to the job, and

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.260
[Guest 1]: then you come back and you walk a little bit from the metro station. Can you carry a gun?

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.140
[Guest 1]: No, because you'll have to get on the metro, which is illegal to carry a gun. You have

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:46.620
[Guest 1]: to get into the office, which is again illegal. Now, if you are the gangbanger, and you're

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:52.700
[Guest 1]: just standing outside your street corner entire day, you don't have a job. You are trying

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:57.900
[Guest 1]: to say sell drugs. Can you carry a gun? Yes. Because you're not going to get up on the

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.420
[Guest 1]: metro where there's a metal detector, you're not going to get into office which has a metal

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:06.220
[Guest 1]: detector. Again, at those points, you will be prosecuted for violating Chicago laws on

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:12.220
[Guest 1]: guns. And therefore, you have created this perverse system where citizens with nine to

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:19.340
[Guest 1]: five jobs with normal people, no guns. Criminals are people who don't have a job or a life,

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:23.940
[Guest 1]: which is productive, who are just hanging around selling drugs or doing other activities

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.620
[Guest 1]: or unemployed, they can have guns. That is the twisted things we create when you have

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.260
[Guest 1]: these strict gun laws. And again, therefore, I was also pointing out, if you have different

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.220
[Guest 1]: gun laws across this country, we have to start thinking of some common minimum ones. Because

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.580
[Guest 1]: otherwise you will create these incentives. And these incentives play out very easily.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:45.780
[Guest 1]: We think, oh, we have banned guns on metros. Therefore, we have made metro safe. Yes, you

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:51.020
[Guest 1]: have made metro safe. But you have made the walk from the metro to the home very unsafe.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:56.900
[Guest 1]: And this there's no this one to one correlation between the law and the outcome you will get.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:02.300
[Guest 1]: You will get weird outcomes because people are game theory animals. And it creates these

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:06.020
[Guest 1]: weird situations. So Chicago is a very interesting situation. If you read the law, you realize,

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:12.260
[Guest 1]: oh, oh my god, if you're a complying citizen, and you have to really have a normal life,

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.260
[Guest 1]: you can't carry a gun.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:18.100
[Amit Varma]: That's a great point. So now, both of you actually don't agree on this because Shubho

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:22.420
[Amit Varma]: says that there should be like your view, therefore, it would be that if the citizen

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.020
[Amit Varma]: needs correctly from monks, as I'm sure if I'm stating this, not quite accurately, but

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.740
[Amit Varma]: what I understand of your view is that look, the citizen has a right to defend himself

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:37.580
[Amit Varma]: from the state, as well as others. And therefore, it is perverse for the state to control the

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.500
[Guest 2]: means of this defense by having licensing and so on.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.900
[Guest 2]: Yes, that would be one of my argument. Also, I would like to point out on the question

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:50.460
[Guest 2]: of statistics. So when we were discussing a statistic earlier, it's very easy to get

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.060
[Guest 2]: statistics on how many mass shootings and how many people are killed. But what is statistics

00:48:55.060 --> 00:49:00.260
[Guest 2]: you can't get on how many people were saved because of guns. So let's say a person comes

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.780
[Guest 2]: to me with the intention of robbing me, I pull out my gun. Now I'm not going and that

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.540
[Guest 2]: person runs away. I'm not going to go to the police and report this crime. It's not even

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:15.580
[Guest 2]: a crime because it didn't happen to begin with. Now, how many people are defended like

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:24.380
[Guest 2]: that every day? We don't know. And that hypothetical, we have instances where sometimes this mass

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:30.780
[Guest 2]: shooters are shot by a person who had a gun legally. But we cannot get that statistics

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:35.460
[Guest 2]: on how many people were saved. Millions and millions of them every day. And if you're

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:43.220
[Guest 2]: in a country like in Latin America and Brazil and Chile or Honduras, you have to have a

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:49.020
[Guest 2]: gun because otherwise the state has no capacity to defend you. Same in India. If I'm being

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:53.580
[Guest 2]: robbed, the government is not going to defend me. As our friend points out, a gun in hand

00:49:53.580 --> 00:50:01.420
[Guest 2]: is much better than a cop on the phone. So yeah, but yeah, that is correct position that

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:07.260
[Guest 2]: I want individuals to be able to defend themselves against the state, regardless of time and

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:13.980
[Guest 2]: place and whatever. And I do not see any reason why that kind of restriction should agree,

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:19.060
[Guest 2]: especially given the evidence that in the 19th century alone, we have 100 million people

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.940
[Amit Varma]: killed by the state.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.860
[Amit Varma]: That's a fair point. But you know, I get the point about we don't know the counterfactuals

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.380
[Amit Varma]: of you know, if you defended yourself against a robbery and the guy ran away, we don't know

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:33.500
[Amit Varma]: the good that the possession of guns did. But what we do know is that we can look at

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.900
[Amit Varma]: a few cases, for example, you can look at Australia, which changed his gun laws and

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:42.780
[Amit Varma]: you can look at the crime rates before and after that. And obviously, the the rates that

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:47.900
[Amit Varma]: I just quoted were only of gun related deaths, not deaths overall. So it's not the full picture.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:53.860
[Amit Varma]: But but one can look at data like that and come to some understanding maybe the US states

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:58.340
[Amit Varma]: which have different laws are a kind of sort of natural experiment by itself. Is that so

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:03.940
[Guest 1]: Yeah, so home breaking rates go down. Yeah, that's NRS favorite one. But yeah, it's a

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:08.780
[Guest 1]: tough statistic to counter. Yeah. And it's also a much more personal point. Like if you

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:15.980
[Guest 1]: break into my home, that is a violation, which is far more, you know, stronger as a violation

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:20.900
[Guest 1]: that that you know, if you if you have returned to a home that has been broken in, it is such

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:27.620
[Guest 1]: a shock. So it is I have not been victims of crime that much, but one small theft at

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.780
[Guest 1]: my home for a little because the door was left unlocked by mistake, but it was such

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:36.500
[Guest 1]: a shock. They took away some like broken microwave, which was not working. No monetary loss, but

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:41.940
[Guest 1]: it was such a shock. You get this thing that this is my home, my castle, violated, violated.

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.020
[Guest 1]: And that is a situation which goes down a lot.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:49.620
[Amit Varma]: So I'll come back to you for a moment, Shubham, because I want to sort of understand your

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:54.500
[Amit Varma]: argument bit better. So Langshu's argument, in a sense is simple to understand, because

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.860
[Amit Varma]: he's saying, I don't care about the consequences. I just care about first principles. And these

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:01.220
[Amit Varma]: are my first principles. And so I'm saying that individuals should have the right to

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:06.980
[Amit Varma]: protect yourself. Now, while you agree that it is hard to take a consequentialist position

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:11.580
[Amit Varma]: on this, because the data is quite muddy, and all of that, at the same time, you're

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:16.660
[Amit Varma]: not quite coming from first principles, because you are arguing that the state should have

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.460
[Amit Varma]: gradations of licensing and all of this. So, you know,

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:26.140
[Guest 1]: My point is that even when I come from first principles, you shouldn't, I come from first

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:32.620
[Guest 1]: principles, not first principle. And I would say liberty is one of the principles. But

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:37.100
[Guest 1]: there is also that we live in a society, we will have to manage our differences in society,

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:43.020
[Guest 1]: we have to create disincentives to use violence as the first resort, or extreme violence as

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:48.620
[Guest 1]: the bomb Zuka case in the first resort. So we'll have to come across these are two contradictory

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:53.660
[Guest 1]: principles that I want maximum liberty. But I also don't want to, you know, live on a

00:52:53.660 --> 00:53:01.340
[Guest 1]: hill, 20 kilometers away, depending on the range of your bombs, look away from everybody

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:07.380
[Guest 1]: else. That is not a good life. I love urban living. I love the fact that we can drop into

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:12.660
[Guest 1]: a meeting and all of that and the bomb Zuka kind of makes it impossible if there's freely

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:17.620
[Guest 1]: owned bomb Zuka because somebody having a bad day, as you pointed out, there are suicides,

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:23.580
[Guest 1]: somebody having a bad day may decide not only will I go, I'll go with everybody around me.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.340
[Guest 1]: That is a very dangerous situation where I go. So I think that is where my principle

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:36.380
[Guest 1]: is. But Sudhanshu's point about the state going crazy, there I would say that even if

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:41.580
[Guest 1]: you have registration, if there are substantial number of guns, taking it away is difficult.

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:46.340
[Guest 1]: Today, for example, it is very easy to take away guns, the registered guns, because 97

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:51.860
[Guest 1]: percent of the people have guns, it is okay to take away. But it is infeasible for the

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:55.940
[Guest 1]: government, for example, to take away all the cars in Delhi also. Where will you store

00:53:55.940 --> 00:54:00.620
[Guest 1]: the cars? There's so many cars. So I think if you have reached a level of ownership,

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:06.500
[Guest 1]: which is quite high, then even if the government knows that these people have guns, you still

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:13.060
[Guest 1]: have to come and take it away from me. And that becomes difficult. And I think once that

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:18.820
[Guest 1]: has become a large enough population, I think what went wrong in Germany, in China, in Russia,

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:23.900
[Guest 1]: also, I would say was not enough people had guns. So the few that had guns, the state

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:28.780
[Guest 1]: had enough capacity to take it away. I would say, if a lot of people have simple weapons,

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:33.380
[Guest 1]: and I don't think weapons of mass destruction or things like that, because you can't use

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.500
[Guest 1]: them in an urban setting anyway. So state also can't use it in an urban setting without

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:42.540
[Guest 1]: setting of civil war and all of that, then it's okay, because still some cop has to come

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:46.900
[Guest 1]: up and knock and say, I want to take away your gun. And then if they are doing to every

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:52.740
[Guest 1]: household to your neighbour to you, then the question is, why? How are you doing it? And

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:56.740
[Guest 1]: then it breaks out in the open. But if there are only one in 100 people or two in 100 people

00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:01.580
[Guest 1]: who have guns, that is the number that's possible because what is happening cop has come to

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:06.140
[Guest 1]: somebody's house, but if you have to take away everybody's gun, then it becomes a higher

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:14.940
[Guest 1]: barrier to that question of you know, state going awry and going bad. But by that time,

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.220
[Guest 1]: I would say by the time things have rolled to that level, where state is now going to

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:27.780
[Guest 1]: put people into concentration camps. Guns are not the only defence against it. I think

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:33.260
[Guest 1]: establishing rule of law, establishing democracy, those are hard work. And I think in some ways,

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:37.380
[Guest 1]: I fear that we might become lazy about that then. Because we have guns, we don't take

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:42.940
[Guest 1]: interest in the state. Okay, that is a counterfactual, I would think or hypothetical, we have to

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:48.580
[Guest 1]: think about it, we have to, the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. So we'd have to be vigilant

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:53.860
[Guest 1]: at all levels. So whenever a gun legislation is issued, or any other legislation is issued,

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.700
[Guest 1]: like the debate that we had about the terrorism law, or any of these other laws, those are

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:03.700
[Guest 1]: the things we should work towards to keep the state in check. By the time you have left

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:09.940
[Guest 1]: it to the level that Hitler is, things are doing or by the time Pol Pot has come, things

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:16.100
[Guest 1]: have gone too far. And I think there, the United Nations system is a little better.

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:21.500
[Guest 1]: We have now a system of crime of genocide where other countries come and intervene.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:25.020
[Guest 1]: Though defective, I think it was not there in the First World War, it was after First

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:29.340
[Guest 1]: World War, it was not there. Because after Second World War, we realized the problem

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:35.460
[Guest 1]: and there is some level of pressure not to do that from the states and other states have

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:40.900
[Guest 1]: to come together to prevent one state from going really rogue on its citizens. But yes,

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.820
[Guest 1]: so I think two counters to that one is let's have enough guns so that it becomes infeasible

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:49.260
[Guest 1]: for a state to collect back all of them. But yes, if you kill somebody, I should be able

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:53.220
[Guest 1]: to trace where it came from. I don't want to live in a world where the state can raise

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.300
[Guest 1]: up its arms and say, I don't know who killed it. Just like if a car hits and I have the

00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:01.660
[Guest 1]: number plate and you can't find the number, the owner of the car. That is not a level

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:07.820
[Guest 1]: of freedom I want to give because I'm balancing multiple values and multiple first principles.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:12.420
[Amit Varma]: So Sudhanshu, I have a critical question of my own. But first, I'd like you to respond

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:17.540
[Amit Varma]: to Shubho's implication that you are giving undue primacy to one first principle, that

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:23.300
[Amit Varma]: of liberty, and not considering the other things that we should value and balance that

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.300
[Amit Varma]: against.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:32.340
[Guest 2]: Okay, so, yes, I personally give most amount of value to first principles, that is liberty.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.580
[Guest 2]: Second on the question of large enough number of guns. I would like to point out the Japanese

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:44.300
[Guest 2]: were interned in US and they had a large enough number of guns and had the right for hundreds

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:50.580
[Guest 2]: of years at that point in time. Plus, the question of that state will go gradually from

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:57.260
[Guest 2]: one point to another. I don't think that that is how it works. Indira Gandhi, the judgment

00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:01.860
[Guest 2]: was announced against her at maybe in the afternoon, two, three o'clock. By midnight,

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:07.780
[Guest 2]: we had emergency on that day. And we live under the same constitution. We live under

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:14.420
[Guest 2]: the same government. And we never know. I mean, as recently, government has said 28,000

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.740
[Guest 2]: troops plus in Kashmir.

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:20.860
[Amit Varma]: We're recording this on August 5, but the episode will be released much later. But we're

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.540
[Guest 2]: recording this on August 5, just for context.

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:29.740
[Guest 2]: So you never know how much a state will, a state will never go gradually that you know,

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:35.660
[Guest 2]: we are going to come for you. And we know this many of you have guns, and we'll send

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:40.900
[Guest 2]: this many people to that is not how it's going to happen. It is going to happen in a moment,

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:45.220
[Guest 2]: in a friction of a second, somebody like Indira Gandhi will rise up and say the country is

00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:51.380
[Guest 2]: now under emergency, your fundamental rights are suspended. Your right to life also does

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:58.260
[Guest 2]: not exist to begin with. And we have instances where Supreme Court has gone on to the extent

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:04.440
[Guest 2]: of saying that yes, when you are killed under emergency, you have no right to life at all.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.900
[Guest 2]: And you have no remedy whatsoever. Now that situation is somewhat corrected. But that

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:16.100
[Guest 2]: is not if the government has large enough majority, as the present government has, or

00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:20.340
[Guest 2]: any future government may have, everything is possible in this country and any other

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.180
[Guest 2]: country whatsoever.

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:29.300
[Guest 2]: So just thinking that if people had large enough number of guns, and we have instances

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:35.740
[Guest 2]: in US where the military has fought civilians on US soil with large enough number of guns

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:43.420
[Guest 2]: and killed maybe 2000 of them. We have had multiple such instances, not just one or two.

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:52.700
[Guest 2]: So in, I think in the 70s, militia formed to 3000 people in Midwestern US and they were

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:57.900
[Guest 2]: trying to run a campaign against the federal government in US. The US government just sent

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:04.380
[Guest 2]: army military to deal with them. And they of course had higher grade weapons. Thousands

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:10.860
[Guest 2]: were killed. And that effectively nullifies the argument that once a large enough number

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:14.820
[Guest 2]: of people have guns, that is not how it's going to work because the state will always

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:19.780
[Guest 2]: have more capacity than an individual, especially when it comes to violence.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.620
[Guest 2]: So in which case, why bother at all?

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.820
[Guest 2]: Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.380
[Guest 1]: So I think there again, if everyone has guns, then the paranoia of the state may also lead

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:35.180
[Guest 1]: to disorder. That let's say everybody has bomb zookas. I have a fear that 28,000 troops

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:40.900
[Guest 1]: have been sent to Kashmir and everybody in Kashmir explores their bomb zookas. End game

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:44.740
[Guest 1]: for everybody. The problem with that level of mass destruction is that you create these

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:52.060
[Guest 1]: end game situations where you can't walk back from or deescalate from because of that level

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:57.420
[Guest 1]: of weapons of mass destruction being available in citizens hand because today, any nuclear

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:02.300
[Guest 1]: weapon or something goes through multiple filter before somebody even to that extent,

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.940
[Guest 1]: again, countering my own point. Yes, there are weapons of mass destruction in the hands

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:10.180
[Guest 1]: of individual citizens in the army. But they have been trained, there's a protocol, there's

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:14.260
[Guest 1]: a way to launch them. That gives a lot of time to think about launching weapons of mass

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:19.100
[Guest 1]: destruction. So I think that is how weapons of mass destruction should be used. They should

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:24.140
[Guest 1]: be used as deterrent and there should be protocols and systems. If it is in the hands of citizens,

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:29.460
[Guest 1]: sadly, that structure collapses that. So I might panic one day, I might think the world

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:34.180
[Guest 1]: is coming to an end, which happens a lot of times people start thinking you get cults

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:38.140
[Guest 1]: who commit mass suicide. Now if they get bomb zookas, they want to take the entire town

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:43.620
[Guest 1]: or city with them. That is a problem. So that is the extent I would go. But on the point

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:52.220
[Guest 1]: of Indira Gandhi, I think there was science. I think if you read history back, she started

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:57.580
[Guest 1]: encroaching rights from the 60s. You know, 69 she nationalized banks, she did a lot of

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:06.660
[Guest 1]: nationalizations. She was doing extreme taxation. I mean, looking back, was 77 that big a surprise?

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.220
[Amit Varma]: I don't think so. I mean, hit level.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:13.620
[Amit Varma]: 75 rather, but that's kind of that's also the hindsight bias kicking in. Yes, I think

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:18.980
[Amit Varma]: we also have to believe contemporary accounts where there are enough people who, you know,

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.980
[Amit Varma]: would have seen the science but was still taken by surprise. And also the thing is,

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:28.740
[Amit Varma]: every state is by its nature looking to consolidate power and oppressive to some extent or the

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.700
[Amit Varma]: other. So if you want to look for science, you will always find science.

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:36.540
[Guest 1]: Yeah. And then if you are fully armed, then any sign can be a trigger for you to correct.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:40.860
[Guest 2]: That is amazing. That is amazing. That's how we keep government in check. That's the situation

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:45.220
[Guest 2]: when they would think twice before infringing on even the smallest shred of your liberty.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:49.740
[Amit Varma]: No, that's fair enough. But I am still worried by the fact that any random guy can take a

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.940
[Amit Varma]: bomb Zuka and decide Kima subco legage on and precedent thousands of people die.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:58.580
[Guest 2]: 18 men, I'm sorry, a boy 18 mentally competent, as I said at the very beginning.

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.300
[Guest 2]: Oh, but that's not a guarantee. That's it.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:06.620
[Guest 1]: There's no guarantee in life. No, but I would say no, but that was not in, you know, was

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:11.860
[Guest 1]: not crazy. Hmm. And let's see, you were angry, you killed your wife. Now the cops are coming

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:15.660
[Guest 1]: and you have a bomb Zuka. You're above 18. You are mentally competent. You're going to

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:20.460
[Amit Varma]: press that button because you're going down anyway. Right? Yeah. So you'll be like, whatever,

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:26.260
[Guest 2]: dude, and press the thing. But that would be a very drastic action to take. And I'm

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:35.020
[Guest 2]: very sure all humans are, there may be some psychopathic, but all it takes is one, right?

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:40.500
[Amit Varma]: Of course, but you're saying you don't care about possibility. You cannot infringe on

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:46.580
[Guest 2]: my rights. That is my point that just because you have impulses doesn't mean the state can

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:51.020
[Amit Varma]: take away my rights. Fair enough. Don't look at me like that. I have no impulses. I am

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:55.300
[Amit Varma]: a gentle soul. So let me ask you the question that I was kind of saving for you. And this

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:59.380
[Amit Varma]: is again, something that I'm thinking through and chewing because you know, I can come up

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:04.500
[Amit Varma]: with objections to it myself. And it's just a tough question, which is this, that yes,

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:09.700
[Amit Varma]: we have a right to defend ourselves. However, in our conception, the classical liberal conception,

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:14.820
[Amit Varma]: which at least you and I share, the whole purpose of the state is to defend those rights.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:19.660
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, for that reason, we give it a monopoly on violence and give it the license

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:25.780
[Amit Varma]: to do whatever it takes to defend those rights. Now, if in the interest of maintaining law

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:30.900
[Amit Varma]: and order, and what I'm now going to say has to be taken with a lot of caveats, because

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:36.980
[Amit Varma]: immediately slippery slopes form. But if then the state says that my job is to solely look

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.380
[Amit Varma]: after the rights of my citizens, which no state ever will, the state basically wants

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:44.940
[Amit Varma]: to rule you. But if a state is to say that my job is to solely look after the rights

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:51.460
[Amit Varma]: of its citizens, and the hypothetical possession of bomb Zuccas in the general population could

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:57.780
[Amit Varma]: endanger many of these lives, which I am supposed to be saving, then I should preemptively act

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.900
[Amit Varma]: to protect the citizens I am supposed to protect and therefore I should bomb the banzooka.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:06.900
[Amit Varma]: Now, obviously, I know that this kind of preemptive rationale that I'm doing it for your own protection

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:11.980
[Amit Varma]: can be and would be misused by the state. But leaving that aside, do you think there

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:16.900
[Guest 2]: is some merit to it at all? There is I can see some merit, but then again, the question

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:22.540
[Guest 2]: of where do you draw the line? Right, right. So UK, for example, as Shubham pointed out,

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:28.940
[Guest 2]: Ratan has become the knife capital of the world. In 1953, in UK, they passed a law banning

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:34.460
[Guest 2]: canning of knives in public which are longer than three inches. And it still goes on. So

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:40.100
[Guest 2]: my problem is okay, fine, you want to ban it, ban it. There will be criminals who will

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:44.540
[Guest 2]: obtain access to it anyway. Like, okay, it was illegal for North Korea to obtain nuclear

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:50.180
[Amit Varma]: weapons or for Iran. They got it anyway. But should the state then have the right to act

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:56.020
[Amit Varma]: preemptively to carry out its primary job of safeguarding the rights of its citizens?

01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:00.440
[Amit Varma]: And if a line has to be drawn, so it doesn't become a slippery slope? Where would that

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:04.740
[Guest 2]: line be drawn? Like, what would the parameters be? That is my question. I don't want to draw

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:10.180
[Guest 2]: any lines. But since you two are in favor of drawing lines, that answer should lie with

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:21.620
[Guest 2]: you. That being said, I don't think that there is any legal mechanism you can envisage, which

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:29.060
[Guest 2]: would ban criminals from owning guns. So you can have all possible mechanism as Shubham

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:35.460
[Guest 2]: pointed out, we have 7 crore, 6 crore guns, and 97 lakhs are only legal. So you have this

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:40.220
[Guest 2]: 5-6 crore guns, which are illegal, which are just floating around in India. And I as a

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:46.220
[Guest 2]: law abiding citizen, am defenseless. And you have been very lucky that you have never faced

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:49.740
[Guest 2]: that situation. I've been robbed on knife point in Pune.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.740
[Guest 2]: In Pune?

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:55.540
[Guest 2]: Yes. And in Delhi, I feel very unsafe. Actually, some of my friends carry knives with them.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.540
[Amit Varma]: You know.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:02.740
[Amit Varma]: I know one of them. Yes. And otherwise completely sturdy, reliable citizen. But I feel safe

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:09.500
[Guest 2]: with him. Exactly. In Delhi, I don't feel safe. I just don't. And Paharganj, I'm not

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:14.300
[Guest 2]: going to roam around after 11 o'clock because I'm not, I'm defenseless. And I know the state

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.160
[Amit Varma]: is not going to defend me at all.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.260
[Amit Varma]: And that's you. It's far worse for women.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:22.700
[Guest 2]: Yeah, exactly. And I wish every woman in Delhi has a gun.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:26.860
[Guest 1]: That brings to the other point. You can't go to the assistant of people being beaten

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.820
[Guest 1]: up also in Delhi streets.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:31.100
[Amit Varma]: Because you have nothing. You'll just get beaten up.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.100
[Guest 2]: You might be added to the list of people.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.100
[Guest 2]: Yeah, and they will have guns.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.100
[Guest 1]: Or they may not have guns also. But you can't just draw a gun and say, people, let's calm

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:45.340
[Guest 1]: down. Let the cops come and solve this out. Because you can't even say that much. When

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:50.300
[Guest 1]: somebody is beating people, somebody is becoming a fight. And I think that is a thing which

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:56.740
[Guest 1]: is, for example, that to pass a law to give legal immunity to people who pick up strangers

01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:00.660
[Guest 1]: on the road who have been victims of roadside assistance, because you would get harassed

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.580
[Amit Varma]: by the cops when you brought somebody to the hospital.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.060
[Amit Varma]: The incentives are horrible. And many people still don't know that the law has changed.

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.060
[Guest 1]: So they're still hesitant to help others.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:11.260
[Guest 1]: Even the cops don't know the law has changed. The cops will continue to harass you. So that

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:15.780
[Guest 1]: is an issue that we have. And that is also something we should think about it. But to

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:20.140
[Guest 1]: your point about Bomzuka and Sudhanshu's point there, I would say that is a problem of the

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:25.100
[Guest 1]: 20th century. I would say till before the 20th century, you could not really take out

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:32.580
[Guest 1]: percentages of the population of your city or of your country. You know, so as I see

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:39.660
[Guest 1]: individual person, you could not. I mean, with the birth of new clear weapons, poisonous,

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:47.340
[Guest 1]: I mean, neurotoxin type, the VX poison, chemical weapons and biological weapons, now, an individual

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:54.180
[Guest 1]: can take out half of the world or all of the world. And this is a problem. And this did

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:59.780
[Guest 1]: not exist. And my experience from law is that law takes around 300 years to solve a problem.

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:05.660
[Guest 1]: That's the fastest law works. Look, how long did it take us to find out that everybody

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:11.140
[Guest 1]: should get a right to vote? Okay, it took us 20,000 years of civilization, I would say,

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:16.380
[Guest 1]: to come to democracy, pretty still pretty bad at working. So my rough estimate is it

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:21.660
[Guest 1]: takes about 300 years for law to come to a conclusion about that part. So I think weapons

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:26.740
[Guest 1]: of mass destruction are just too early for us to wrap our head around and solve it. I

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:32.340
[Guest 1]: think we are doing very good at it. We have only used them twice. 50 years, we haven't

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:37.180
[Guest 1]: used them quite surprising. But it seems there's some sense prevailing. I mean, I suspect Sadangshu

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:43.900
[Amit Varma]: would say that that is an argument for deterrence. And that is what but deterrence can work between

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:48.340
[Amit Varma]: states which are by and large rational actors. If you give every human being a bomb Zuka,

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:52.180
[Amit Varma]: I don't know what role deterrence plays there. Some nutcase is going to say

01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:59.460
[Guest 2]: Sanyam Bhutani Of course, that and that is the risk we have to bear. That's I mean, there's

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:03.940
[Guest 2]: no other way. Do you want to draw a line, then show me where you will draw the line

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:09.380
[Guest 2]: and for what reasons, then I might be able to agree with you. As far as I see, I don't

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:14.500
[Guest 2]: see why you should not draw a line at let's say matchstick because I could basically set

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:20.180
[Guest 2]: this studio on fire right away. Are you going to ban matchsticks? Or are you going to ban

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.620
[Guest 2]: spoons because I'm getting fat?

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.340
[Amit Varma]: Sanyam Bhutani That's that's a good point. Are you going

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:28.460
[Amit Varma]: to ban sugar? No sugar is poison, but bloody hell people have a right to consume poison,

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:34.100
[Amit Varma]: the classic libertarian position. So it's been really stimulating conversation for me

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.900
[Amit Varma]: and I'm going to take time to process all of this. So I'm not going to say I've changed

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.260
[Amit Varma]: my mind and you've convinced me and I can't even say that because you guys have actually

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:46.780
[Amit Varma]: made slightly separate arguments. But I am I'm pretty sure Sudhanshu though I have to

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:51.340
[Amit Varma]: say with great regret that I don't think I'll quite go on the line of the bomb Zucca being

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:57.260
[Amit Varma]: available over the counter. But I might get myself to agree with Shubha but that could

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.860
[Amit Varma]: be a failure of imagination on my part. My purpose for this episode really was we were

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.740
[Amit Varma]: chatting over this at dinner the other night and I thought this is a very stimulating discussion.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:10.260
[Amit Varma]: I am being forced to reconsider some of my positions whether I change my mind or not.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:14.420
[Amit Varma]: Let's put these arguments out there on the table. The final question I'd asked before

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:19.660
[Amit Varma]: I sort of ended is that are we discussing that in a utopian world, this should be what

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:24.780
[Amit Varma]: the law should be like? Or are both of you saying that in India today as it is as things

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.700
[Amit Varma]: stand, this is our position. This is what we should do.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.820
[Guest 2]: Sanyam Bhutani So I would say in a utopian world,

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.140
[Amit Varma]: Sadhguru But I'm asking what the India of today.

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.780
[Guest 2]: Sanyam Bhutani Okay. No, no, no. I'll come to both points

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:39.820
[Guest 2]: actually. In a utopian world, yes, every adult should be able to have a gun whether they

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.060
[Guest 2]: want it or not is their problem. Okay. In India, as things stand today, every adult

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:51.980
[Guest 2]: should be able to get a gun because our state is incapable of protecting us. And there are

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:58.100
[Guest 2]: already five, four, seven crores illegal guns roaming around. So I don't see how the number

01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:03.180
[Guest 2]: going maybe 15 crore or 20 crore is going to be a problem.

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:05.580
[Amit Varma]: Sadhguru Right. So that's your position that you're

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:09.380
[Amit Varma]: not talking about utopia. This is your position now. Shobha, what about you?

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.540
[Guest 1]: Shobha So my position is again, if we do bans, we

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:18.100
[Guest 1]: stop thinking about it. Yeah, we can't stop thinking about the citizens right to defend

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:24.500
[Guest 1]: themselves out at all times. I'm not arguing for changing the law today. All I'm asking

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:29.660
[Guest 1]: is the same point that lot more Indians to pay attention to the Arms Act to pay attention

01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:35.180
[Guest 1]: to the debate. And I'm okay with the democratic debate coming up with some solution. I am

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:40.980
[Guest 1]: unhappy with the presumption that a lot of us Indian elites do that the current equilibrium

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:45.700
[Guest 1]: is good and stable. I'm saying let's have a debate. Let's debate and maybe after a debate,

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:50.660
[Guest 1]: we can come back to the same position. But let us have the debate and I would like that

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:56.620
[Guest 1]: debate to be open all the time. Situation change before the Bombay attacks. I think

01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:01.340
[Guest 1]: that situation was different for urban elites, but it was very similar for Kashmiri victims

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:07.420
[Guest 1]: and victims in Naxal prone areas. I think we should have this debate all the time. That

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:11.780
[Guest 1]: is why we have a permanent legislature that we should have this debate and you know, we

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:16.060
[Guest 1]: Indian elites have to carry this intellectualism on this. We can't say the person who says

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:20.180
[Guest 1]: that no, the gun laws in India are bad to just close that debate and I'm thankful that

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.380
[Guest 1]: you're opening the debate here and we'll get nuances.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:27.860
[Amit Varma]: And then my immediate response to that though I meant to end it but what can I do my overactive

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:32.140
[Amit Varma]: brain keeps ticking and my immediate thought to that not a response not an argument against

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:39.380
[Amit Varma]: it is that affairs in human life and even for states are driven largely by inertia,

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.500
[Amit Varma]: that this is a law that exists is going to continue to exist unless there is a crisis

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:48.060
[Amit Varma]: which will make people reconsider it. And the only kind of crisis that I can envisage

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:53.100
[Amit Varma]: that will make people reconsider it is if the state is so oppressive that the need for

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.900
[Amit Varma]: guns is so acutely felt that there is public demand for it which hasn't happened so far

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:02.020
[Amit Varma]: in our history. But then if the state is so acutely oppressive, then there's no point

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:07.660
[Guest 2]: to the public demand. So we kind of start I would argue the state is that kind of oppressive.

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:13.220
[Amit Varma]: Maybe you don't feel it maybe maybe a Kashmiri feels it maybe you don't know I agree with

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:19.620
[Amit Varma]: you and I feel that oppression is normalized, you know, so it is not that you know, one

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:23.340
[Amit Varma]: of you made the point about how everything can change overnight. But I think that oppression

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:28.540
[Amit Varma]: is normalized so much that we don't feel the need to resist. I knew you'd nod your head

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.540
[Amit Varma]: at that.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:34.820
[Guest 1]: I look at it I see the defense against the state as a smaller debate in the gun issue.

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:39.460
[Guest 1]: Okay, more against defense against other bad citizens, other individuals, other individuals.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:44.020
[Guest 1]: And there I think, see the fact that there are five crore unregistered guns is that if

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:48.980
[Guest 1]: it is that some people are sold it amongst themselves without working about the democracy,

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:55.700
[Guest 1]: but I think the role of elites in this country is, I would say magnified, we play a bigger

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:59.540
[Guest 1]: role, we have to make sure the debate happens. And we have to make sure the debate happened.

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:03.800
[Guest 1]: I don't agree with the way you're thinking about democracy that demand will come and

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.440
[Guest 1]: only then the rational solution will come. It's the job of the elites to give good solutions.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.260
[Guest 1]: And to give good solutions, you have to be experts on the topic. And you have to start

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:18.540
[Guest 1]: thinking about it. It's not my primary topic of interest or research, but we have to do

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:22.380
[Guest 1]: these and keep debating them even if we are not changing any law. So at the time when

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:27.180
[Guest 1]: we change laws, we don't go for some other extreme, like I would say, Sudan, choose extreme

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:32.220
[Guest 1]: that you have to be you have to allow extreme weapons or we can have that debate and then

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:36.660
[Guest 1]: let the democracy decide where we want to go about it.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:40.620
[Amit Varma]: And I'll end this episode with I mean, since you pointed out the distinction between self

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:44.380
[Amit Varma]: defense against the state and self defense against others, I'll end this episode by plugging

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:48.140
[Amit Varma]: an old episode of mine, which will be linked from the show notes, where the philosopher

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:54.180
[Amit Varma]: Jason Brennan made an argument on the show that those rights should be exactly equivalent

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:59.500
[Amit Varma]: in any situation where you have a right to defend yourself or others against private

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:04.620
[Amit Varma]: individuals, you should have this exact same right with no added consideration to defend

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:06.500
[Amit Varma]: yourself against the state.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.340
[Guest 2]: Shubham Sudhanshu, sorry, you want to add a point?

01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:16.620
[Guest 2]: I agree with that way of analysis. So I don't see how I can put a primacy over my defense

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:21.060
[Guest 2]: against another individual or my defense against the state. I will treat them equally.

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:25.620
[Amit Varma]: Right. Sudhanshu, Shubham, thank you so much for coming on the scene in the unseen.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:28.620

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:44.900
[Amit Varma]: of a paranoid guy. And do you have one of those six crore unofficial guns with you?

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.580
[Amit Varma]: I can't answer that.
