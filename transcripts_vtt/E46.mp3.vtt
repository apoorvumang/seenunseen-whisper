00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
[Amit Varma]: There was a time when we all agreed on what the facts were.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.800
[Amit Varma]: We all got our news of the world from certain trusted sources.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.480
[Amit Varma]: We may have considered some of them biased, but they were part of a broad consensus on

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.480
[Amit Varma]: the truth.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.920
[Amit Varma]: They all said the earth was round, and we had no reason to believe otherwise.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.600
[Amit Varma]: Today, though, the media is fragmented and there is no consensus on the truth anymore.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.560
[Amit Varma]: The earth is round, and it's also flat, cubical, rectangular, and shaped like a lotus.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.480
[Amit Varma]: News today has become a game of supplying what people want to believe, and we all live

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.440
[Amit Varma]: in our own alternate realities.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
[Amit Varma]: What are we to do?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.720
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.720
[Unknown]: science.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.920
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadma.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.520
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.400
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, I want to discuss the state of the media, and my guest today is

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.520
[Amit Varma]: a man I consider the sharpest media commentator in India, a veteran editor, legendary journalist,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.760
[Amit Varma]: and my close friend, Prem Panikkar.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.840
[Amit Varma]: I recorded this conversation with Prem on the sidelines of the Bangalore Literature

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.720
[Amit Varma]: Festival a few weeks ago, so without much further ado, here we go.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.720
[Amit Varma]: Hi, Prem.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.040
[Guest]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.840
[Guest]: Thanks for having me on, Amit.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.400
[Guest]: You know, I'm not being paid to say this.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.280
[Guest]: Seen and The Unseen is my favorite podcast because there's a lot of issues that should

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.520
[Guest]: be looked at in depth and detail, particularly crucial now when the media has time for neither

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.360
[Guest]: depth nor detail.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.360
[Guest]: And this is just about the only place you get it.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.280
[Amit Varma]: So thank you very much.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.240
[Amit Varma]: That's very kind of you to say that.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.640
[Amit Varma]: And I, you know, I give the credit to all the guests I get on the show, who are usually

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.160
[Amit Varma]: people with deep insight of the subjects, and I can't think of a better example of that

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.160
[Amit Varma]: than you.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160
[Amit Varma]: Like today, what I really want to talk about and something I've been both concerned deeply

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.640
[Amit Varma]: about and saddened deeply by is the state of the media in India.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, we've both been a part of media for a long time.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.160
[Amit Varma]: You've been a journalist since the early 90s.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.600
[Amit Varma]: And you've written a lot of piercing essays about what is going wrong with us today.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.480
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, starting from what the media was like back when you started, and what it

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.520
[Amit Varma]: has become today, what's your journey been like?

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:40.040
[Guest]: Well, the thing is that back when I started, which was 89, actually, with the Indian Post,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.520
[Guest]: you didn't have you had a very clear idea of what any and the caveat here is we're talking

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.680
[Guest]: of the English language media, because the language media is a whole other animal altogether

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.560
[Guest]: and probably outside the scope of the time that we have.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.480
[Guest]: You had a very clear sense of direction simply because you didn't have too many disruptors

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.920
[Guest]: that were constantly shifting the goalposts on you without your, you know, without your

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.800
[Guest]: even knowing it.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.760
[Guest]: I think the seminal moment in this entire thing was when the internet happened.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.800
[Guest]: And even back in the early days, you were a part of this, you know, this, when the internet

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.880
[Guest]: first came to India, you basically had media organizations shoveling their stuff onto onto

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.760
[Guest]: the net as almost a hygiene element.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.200
[Guest]: And you had very few standalone media houses that did not have a print or television equivalent,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.200
[Guest]: American for that you were part of, was a highly niche product with a with a very loyal

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.320
[Guest]: sticky audience reader for the generalist.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.960
[Guest]: And even then, things were very clear, you knew who you were speaking to, you knew what

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.500
[Guest]: your core competence was, and you knew who your audience was.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.160
[Guest]: What has happened now is that this explosion in multiple directions has diffused the landscape

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.440
[Guest]: to such an extent that the goalposts are no longer visible.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.920
[Guest]: It's not even a question of shifting goalposts.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.520
[Guest]: I think the media and you know what, the first thing that that it feels like to me right

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.640
[Guest]: now is the climax of Ridley Scott's Thelma and Lewis.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.000
[Guest]: You've got two people who for you know, prompted by internal fault lines, and external stresses,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.920
[Guest]: drive up a road knowing that it leads to a dead end to a cliff top.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.220
[Guest]: And having got there, there's no place else to go, you just put pedal to the metal and

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.800
[Guest]: drive straight off the cliff knowing what the ending is, but you do it anyway.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.660
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask you to then elaborate that when you say shifting goalposts, can you specify

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.900
[Amit Varma]: what you mean by that?

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.800
[Amit Varma]: What were the goalposts back then?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.520
[Amit Varma]: And in what way have they been shifting constantly?

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520
[Guest]: Right.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.600
[Guest]: So think about the early days of the internet.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.560
[Guest]: Think about Crick Info's core belief or one line mission statement or think about Rediff,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.300
[Guest]: which I was part of.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.700
[Guest]: The idea was very simply this, that there is an entire audience, connected audience

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.760
[Guest]: outside of India, who have very little access to information on India, and who want that

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760
[Guest]: information.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.080
[Guest]: It is not just the Indians living abroad, but also people in the US and elsewhere across

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.160
[Guest]: Europe and stuff like that, who were curious about the so called new India that was emerging.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.640
[Guest]: And who had I mean, the only option was you wait for the newspapers to be airlifted and

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.480
[Guest]: buy it two days later.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.120
[Guest]: So your one line mission statement was, what is happening in India right here right now.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.320
[Guest]: Keep people informed.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.320
[Guest]: It was a fact based storytelling.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.120
[Guest]: It looked at the major stories of the day, it looked at why it was important, and you

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.480
[Guest]: just had to worry about informing people.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.840
[Guest]: Even when the paradigm changed, and the Indian audience started growing in numbers, there

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.760
[Guest]: was still that comfort zone of all you told yourself was, for the Indian audience, you

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.600
[Guest]: need to take them beyond the papers that they read with their morning coffee.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.720
[Guest]: And you need to bring them up to speed on all that has happened so far and also look

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.240
[Guest]: at yesterday's news and elaborate, give them context, give them nuance and stuff like that.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.100
[Guest]: These are goalposts that as journalists, we are trained to identify and to meet.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.040
[Guest]: What happened subsequently is as there was this initial efflorescence of sites coming

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.520
[Guest]: on to the web, and it has a very low entry threshold.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.560
[Guest]: At some point, the Excel jockeys came into the picture, and what they started focusing

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.200
[Guest]: on was page views and unique users and you know, all of that.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.040
[Guest]: If you remember that sequence, initially, we were all told to chase page views.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.520
[Guest]: And we started gaming the system.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.000
[Amit Varma]: We both know how...

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.680
[Amit Varma]: Especially with the disgusting pagination that a lot of the sites had.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.680
[Guest]: Pagination was one.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.440
[Guest]: We took a PTI report, which was about 300 words and split it into 10 slides.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.440
[Guest]: That was one.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.280
[Guest]: We architected our pages in such a way that one page view was actually 10 different page

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.000
[Guest]: views because we loaded various elements separately.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.240
[Guest]: That was another way that we gamed the system.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.800
[Guest]: We started this whole slideshow business simply in order to garner page views.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.320
[Guest]: And so we started chasing page views.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.020
[Guest]: At no point did we step back and say, wait, why are we chasing these page views?

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.900
[Guest]: How is this going to translate either into journalistic sense or even into economic sense?

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.360
[Guest]: What are we going to do with the page views?

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360
[Amit Varma]: Nobody knew that.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.440
[Amit Varma]: It's not improving the user experience, but making it worse in the long run that cannot

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440
[Amit Varma]: work.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.440
[Amit Varma]: It cannot work.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.640
[Guest]: So at some point, we actually discovered that it wasn't working.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:36.440
[Guest]: The readers were unhappy over the fact that they can see gaming when they experience it.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.440
[Guest]: And the advertisers said, look, I mean, you guys are just generating page views.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.080
[Guest]: It means nothing to us.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.760
[Guest]: So then it became unique users.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.160
[Guest]: How do we find audiences?

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.560
[Guest]: Now it's become time spent.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:52.080
[Guest]: And every time we find that a metric that has been identified by the number crunchers,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.040
[Guest]: we chase it for an endless period of time.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.840
[Guest]: And then we find that it makes no sense whatsoever.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.600
[Guest]: And then somebody comes up with this bright idea of chasing another metric.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.240
[Guest]: And ultimately, we have moved from being journalists to being Excel jockeys, who our first job

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.480
[Guest]: in the morning, literally, and I know this from both the last days that I was in Rediff

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.920
[Guest]: and also after working in Yahoo.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.760
[Guest]: The first thing I had to do was look at the numbers of the previous 24 hours and see,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.160
[Guest]: did we meet our targets?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.640
[Guest]: Journalism is not about meeting targets.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.920
[Guest]: It's about informing people.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.800
[Guest]: And somehow we have shifted from a core purpose, the purpose for which we got into this profession,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.640
[Guest]: the purpose for which we are trained.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.960
[Guest]: And we've gotten into something that A, we don't know how to do, B, we don't know why

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.400
[Guest]: we're doing it.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.800
[Guest]: And C, we don't know what the end goal is.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.240
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that, you know, back in the day, it was sort of different because

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.160
[Amit Varma]: the way the broadsheet economy worked was that like, if you got the Times of India every

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.580
[Amit Varma]: morning at home, it just came by itself.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.680
[Amit Varma]: It isn't that you had to attract the reader every day.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.880
[Amit Varma]: It was going to him, you had the reader, he was a captive audience.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.360
[Amit Varma]: And equally, everything was bundled together.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.360
[Amit Varma]: So even if you read only the sports pages, you're still getting the whole paper.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.160
[Amit Varma]: While today, what has happened is that, you know, a guy is not going to a website necessarily

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.160
[Amit Varma]: by default.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.440
[Amit Varma]: Often, a lot of people consume news only through social media and following Facebook links

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.720
[Amit Varma]: and Twitter links, which therefore gain that much in importance and clickbait becomes important.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.480
[Amit Varma]: How do you make someone click there?

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:29.200
[Amit Varma]: And also, you've sort of compartmentalized everything down to the level of the individual

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200
[Amit Varma]: article.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.800
[Amit Varma]: And that whole concept of a bundled offering is really not there to that extent.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.280
[Amit Varma]: And I wouldn't even argue that's a bad thing.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.040
[Amit Varma]: In some ways, it's a good thing, because it empowers the readers, it empowers producers

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.360
[Amit Varma]: of news.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.360
[Amit Varma]: But it also changes the way journalism is done, because it shifts the focus of the journalist

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.560
[Amit Varma]: from just doing a consistent good job in creating quality journalism to actually just trying

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.000
[Amit Varma]: to get clicks, which can result in going for the lowest common denominator.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
[Guest]: Correct.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.480
[Guest]: But to slightly disagree with your point about it's not necessarily a bad thing that the

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.040
[Guest]: bundling of news no longer exists.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.520
[Guest]: Consider what is happening today.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.960
[Guest]: Somebody either because he saw a link on social media or whatever, clicks on a story, which

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.080
[Guest]: could be carried by the Hindustan Times or Times of India or whatever it is.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.560
[Guest]: He sees that story in isolation.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.520
[Guest]: And he promptly reacts to that story.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.360
[Guest]: We get the usual stuff about this is biased, this is slanted, this is done by a prostitute.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.800
[Guest]: But we both worked in newspapers, we know how we put a newspaper together, there is

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.240
[Guest]: a cohesion from the news that we carry top of the page on the first page, all the way

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.200
[Guest]: through to the op-ed pages.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.920
[Guest]: There is a sequential thinking that goes into the choices that we make about what we're

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.160
[Guest]: carrying and stuff like that.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.040
[Guest]: So there is a context to why we think this news is important.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.280
[Guest]: There is an explanation of why this is important.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.160
[Guest]: Here we're seeing, as you as you pointed out, we're seeing bits of news in isolation from

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.920
[Guest]: multiple sources.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.560
[Amit Varma]: There is no overall context.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.080
[Amit Varma]: But I think, I mean, I've never worked in a broadsheet newspaper, I've written columns

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.080
[Amit Varma]: for many of them.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.200
[Amit Varma]: But one of the things I've noted, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that they work in silos

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.200
[Amit Varma]: anyways.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.080
[Guest]: So the pages don't communicate with each other.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.320
[Guest]: But what I also do remember from working in broadsheets, and I did, was that there was

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.040
[Guest]: always the editor and the managing editor who had the spreadsheet of the 26, I mean,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.160
[Guest]: 24 or 28 or whatever number of pages it was.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.440
[Guest]: And there was a constant filling in of these things and the shuffling around of things

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.000
[Guest]: as and you know how news happens as the day progresses, things, the priorities change.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.640
[Guest]: And there was constantly a track on how these shifting priorities were impacting other sections

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.640
[Guest]: of the paper.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.000
[Guest]: There was a uniformity of thought.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.640
[Guest]: Now what you have is an editorial newsroom where the emphasis is simply on, we live in

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.620
[Guest]: the age of the internet, we cannot afford to be to be seen as dated, therefore, something

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.920
[Guest]: has to keep going up every couple of minutes, otherwise, we look stagnant.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.360
[Guest]: And we'll drive away the audience and that is where you get the kind of batched stuff

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.640
[Guest]: like breaking news, Rajnath Singh to hold a press conference.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.320
[Guest]: I mean, the press conference may or may not lead to news, but the fact that he's going

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.460
[Guest]: to address the media is hardly news, forget about breaking news.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.840
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, I'm just, you know, just thinking aloud here, it's led from one kind of tyranny

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.840
[Amit Varma]: to another.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.440
[Amit Varma]: Earlier, you had the tyranny of the news cycle, where, you know, if something broke today,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.880
[Amit Varma]: people would know about it only the next day.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And an opinion piece would probably happen the day after that, and so on.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.340
[Amit Varma]: And you were dependent on the news cycle, and internet publishing, and especially putting

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.200
[Amit Varma]: the tools of publishing in the hands of anybody, which was a great thing in many ways, enabled

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.880
[Amit Varma]: you to break past the tyranny of the news cycle in the sense that, you know, when after

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.360
[Amit Varma]: the 2003 tsunami, when I was going down the coast of Tamil Nadu, you know, I was practically

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.520
[Amit Varma]: live blogging from there, I didn't have to wait to submit something to a paper, I didn't

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.600
[Amit Varma]: have to write something which fit a particular format of a 700 word piece or whatever.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.360
[Amit Varma]: But we move from that tyranny, the tyranny of the news cycle to the tyranny of the immediate,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.400
[Amit Varma]: where there is this hunger, like you just said, of just getting things out there to

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.560
[Amit Varma]: just keep getting clips, keep getting clicks, you know, just...

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.800
[Guest]: Yeah, it's true.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.400
[Guest]: And it has its good side, which is that, like you pointed out with your blog during the

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.920
[Guest]: tsunami, or the kind of work that was done online and on social media during the Chennai

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.360
[Guest]: floods of a couple of years back, or 26-11, if you want to go even further back in time.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.760
[Guest]: Or even the Bombay cloudburst, you know, the kind of work that Peter Griffin did, for example,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.760
[Guest]: our friend.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.760
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.040
[Guest]: What that permitted us to do is information that needed to get to people, got to them

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.480
[Guest]: in time, not the next day, nobody had to wait for the next day to find out which areas were

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.280
[Guest]: stressed and what the problem was and stuff like that.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:52.600
[Guest]: But the problem is that these kind of events that require immediacy, and both detail and,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:59.280
[Guest]: you know, to use, say, the favourite phrase of Gideon, a mile wide and inch deep coverage,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.160
[Guest]: it was logical, that is what is required.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.720
[Guest]: But here the tyranny really is that it is expected on a daily, hourly basis.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.920
[Guest]: And there is nothing happening that demands it.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.600
[Guest]: So you manufacture stuff, just to fill that need or that, you know, to feed the beast

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.600
[Amit Varma]: of immediacy.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.800
[Guest]: Boy falls into a well.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.560
[Guest]: Yeah, boy falls into a well, boy fell into a well, it's okay.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.400
[Guest]: I mean, Radhnath Singh leaves home to reach the press conference is a bit of a reach,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.440
[Guest]: you know, like, I mean, let's not.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.400
[Guest]: And in the process, what we have done is we've undercut ourselves, because we have trivialised

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:40.120
[Guest]: news to such an extent that the audience is pissed off, and that is in turn translating

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.040
[Guest]: or reflecting back on us.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040
[Guest]: Credibility is short to bits.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.760
[Guest]: I mean, if I were to write a piece saying that Radhnath Singh is going to hold a press

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.440
[Guest]: conference this afternoon, I wouldn't expect anybody to read me much after that.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And also what happens is that when you sensationalise the trivial, nothing can be sensational anymore.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, we become numb and inured.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.240
[Amit Varma]: You see something, someone shouting on TV, you don't pay attention because people are

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.840
[Guest]: shouting on TV all the time.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840
[Guest]: Correct.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.080
[Guest]: And also, I mean, a book that I know that you've read, Boorstin talked about this in

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:16.060
[Guest]: 1961, when he talked in the book, The Image, he talked about the fact that the media, which

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:23.760
[Guest]: desperately needs events to play up, has started being complicit in and now actively engaged

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.120
[Guest]: in creating pseudo events, which was the phrase that he used for it, simply in order to find

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.560
[Guest]: stuff to fill up its pages.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.320
[Guest]: He was talking at a time when there was just cable television and print.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.960
[Guest]: And now you have the internet, which is a far hungrier and far more gigantic beast.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.000
[Guest]: So this entire thing has escalated to a process where nobody in a media house, starting with

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.520
[Guest]: the CEO, all the way down to the trainee journalist who joined yesterday, has any idea why we're

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.120
[Guest]: doing the things we're doing and what the end goal is.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.880
[Guest]: And the economy of the media is stressed.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.880
[Guest]: We all know that.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.440
[Guest]: We know we're heading for a disaster.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.900
[Guest]: We don't know how to, how to just reverse the car and drive back down the cliff.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.120
[Amit Varma]: And would it then be fair to say that mainstream journalism has moved from news gathering and

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.880
[Amit Varma]: putting together opinion to event management?

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.400
[Amit Varma]: And by event, I don't merely mean that you manufacture a fake event and report it, but

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.960
[Amit Varma]: that you build a narrative around every damn thing because and you build as sensational

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.320
[Amit Varma]: a narrative as you can, and that is the event per se.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.560
[Amit Varma]: And your whole time goes into sort of building those pseudo events, those pseudo narratives,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.560
[Amit Varma]: so to say.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.840
[Guest]: So you can just keep pumping the sensation.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.840
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.840
[Guest]: Because, I mean, to cite a recent instance, when you were there at the Bangalore Lit Fest,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.340
[Guest]: so was I, right?

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.800
[Guest]: I was doing a panel that had Rahul Dravid on it.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.800
[Guest]: Rahul Dravid, as you know, rarely speaks in public.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.080
[Guest]: He's gun shy of, you know, conversation, but he agreed to come for this.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.400
[Guest]: And he was brilliantly articulate.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.640
[Guest]: He spoke with a lot of nuance and a lot of depth and detail and stuff like that.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.760
[Guest]: And then next day, I was looking at the coverage in the newspapers, and they picked out this

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:10.200
[Guest]: one sentence that Rahul said in a wider context, and that became 800 word stories.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200
[Amit Varma]: Because it gave the headline.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.280
[Guest]: It gave the headline and the headline gave you an opportunity to rant.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:22.480
[Guest]: And all, even the context that Rahul meticulously supplied, because it did not fit into the

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.640
[Guest]: narrative, because it would have desensationalized what he had said in the first place, was conveniently

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.000
[Guest]: ignored.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.560
[Guest]: The people who wrote about it in some veteran writers just decided that that was not relevant.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.040
[Guest]: So yeah, you're right, we, today, if we are putting up something, we first think of the

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.640
[Guest]: headline and we think of whether this headline is going to attract people to click on this

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.480
[Guest]: thing, and will it play on social media?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.440
[Guest]: And how can we sharpen it and stuff like that, instead of thinking of is this first question

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.100
[Guest]: that we used to ask ourselves in the newsroom?

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.800
[Guest]: Is this even worth writing about?

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.560
[Amit Varma]: That question has been forgotten.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.680
[Amit Varma]: So is this partly, like, the journalist there is a good friend of mine and a veteran reporter,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.820
[Amit Varma]: and I admire his work.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.800
[Amit Varma]: And I think some of the blame here might also then have to go to audiences which have a

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.920
[Amit Varma]: short attention span, and they're craving the sensationalism, and they don't have the

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.520
[Amit Varma]: appetite for nuance and detail.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, reporters who are catering to that marketplace, therefore find themselves

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.080
[Amit Varma]: forced to go down those same roads, where they'll watch an event, and they don't really

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.840
[Amit Varma]: care what the broader points being made are, or they don't want to go too deep, their brain

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.680
[Amit Varma]: is just on the lookout for headline.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:42.600
[Guest]: But two things to that, one is, I might be catering to a perceived need.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.560
[Guest]: But at what point do I, as a sentient human being, ask myself, am I committing suicide

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.360
[Guest]: here?

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.160
[Guest]: At some point, I would assume that either as an individual or as an organization, you

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.260
[Guest]: really need to think about that thing.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:02.720
[Guest]: The larger point is, again, to refer to that particular episode, the work, something like

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.400
[Guest]: 500 to 600 people attending that particular session, and sitting on stage, what struck

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:16.160
[Guest]: me was the the kind of applause that Rahul was getting, when he actually provided nuance

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.160
[Guest]: and context.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.100
[Guest]: For instance, he was asked, I asked him, why don't you write a book?

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.400
[Guest]: And he said, Look, if I'm writing something, it has to be honest, there are some things

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.960
[Guest]: that I cannot talk about, and therefore, I'd far rather not write.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.020
[Guest]: It got applause, it is not a headline.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.960
[Amit Varma]: But it was exactly the kind of thing.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.360
[Amit Varma]: And we could argue it's there's a bit of a selection bias there, because a sort of audience

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.640
[Amit Varma]: which would turn up to a lit fest would obviously be a little more demanding.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.000
[Guest]: Fair enough.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.360
[Guest]: But then are we chasing the wrong audience?

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:48.360
[Guest]: Look, I can understand this entire clickbait, headlining and all the rest of it, if it was

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.400
[Guest]: translating into at least an economic goal.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400
[Guest]: Let's face it.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.720
[Guest]: I mean, the days of the philanthropic publisher no longer exist.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.840
[Guest]: Media is a business, it has to be, it has to survive on its own ability to make money.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.240
[Guest]: Now, if you're saying that all of this work that you're doing is resulting in a good bottom

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.280
[Guest]: line and a healthy bottom line, then I can swallow my reservations and say, okay, fine,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.260
[Guest]: you know, at least for the sake of survival and for thriving, you need to do and maybe

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.600
[Guest]: we'll subsidize some good journalism with this precisely.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.440
[Guest]: But what is actually happening?

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.240
[Guest]: No media houses making money, every single one is stressed, they're trying all sorts

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.520
[Guest]: of things, including now, for instance, your money making opportunities have become to

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.100
[Guest]: cite one example, external event management.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.440
[Guest]: You have the conclaves and the thing and all that, and that in turn puts you at the mercy

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.840
[Guest]: of the headliners you need.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.440
[Guest]: One instance, if you remember, the Times of India was about to do a major headline event,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.260
[Guest]: which had both Narendra Modi and Amit Shah headlining it.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.680
[Guest]: Two days before that, Vineet Jain posts something that is vaguely disrespectful, let's say of

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.840
[Guest]: demonetization, or one of those things.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.600
[Guest]: And the next thing you know, both the headliners wait till the last minute and then pull out

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.040
[Guest]: and put the event at risk.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.320
[Guest]: What happens and and imagine now the pressure on the Times of India management, they know

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.240
[Guest]: that their bottom line is their bottom line is at risk, right?

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.640
[Guest]: So the more you chase after something that you cannot monetize, the more you are at the

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.140
[Guest]: mercy of people who will then come and bail you out.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:28.040
[Guest]: And so now you've added an external stress point to this entire thing, and you have not

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.240
[Guest]: gained anything, which is what I keep going back to, I'll, I'll swallow my objections

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:39.360
[Guest]: about clickbait, I'll swallow my reservations about some of this sensational journalism.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.000
[Guest]: And frankly, I mean, we've all been guilty of it at some point or the other, we've hyped

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.600
[Guest]: things and we've, you know, exaggerated all my posts about cows, your posts about cows,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.640
[Guest]: my posts about maybe some fairly ordinary tests in retrospect, which at that time, for

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.200
[Guest]: me, I mean, I was right in the middle of it.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.600
[Guest]: And I thought it was the greatest thing that ever been seen.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.540
[Guest]: All of that would at least be palatable.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.400
[Guest]: If at the end of the day, like you said, there was some money coming into the equation and

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.660
[Guest]: that money could then fund some good journalism.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:14.220
[Guest]: But look at the cycle that we're on a website is started, there is a flurry of excitement,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.800
[Guest]: they say that they have backers and they have this, that and the other, they hire a lot

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.880
[Guest]: of journalists.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.640
[Guest]: The journalists are put on the job of churning out content at incredible rapidity.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:29.720
[Guest]: A good writer who takes time to marinate and to come up with a thoughtful take on something

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.740
[Guest]: is actually told, no, we need five posts from you plus we need 10 social media interventions

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.560
[Guest]: plus we need 10 other things.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.220
[Guest]: The guy has no time to think.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:43.120
[Guest]: He writes the most obvious, which is by definition, what is most obvious to the audience, either

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.200
[Guest]: you're not giving them anything new.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200
[Guest]: You chase this metric.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.040
[Guest]: End of the day, you find you're not making money.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.960
[Guest]: Two years down the line, the next wave starts, which is layoffs.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.760
[Guest]: All the journalists are back out in the field looking for jobs, which don't exist, by the

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.780
[Guest]: way, and lesser staff doing more work.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.640
[Guest]: So your quality deteriorates.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.600
[Guest]: And you see that playing out in website after website after website today.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.960
[Amit Varma]: So that is my question.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.280
[Amit Varma]: If no one in the media is making money, is it possible for the media to be making money?

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.880
[Amit Varma]: Do people really care about it?

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, let me again draw a contrast between how we consume news in the eighties

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.960
[Amit Varma]: and nineties and how we do it today.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.260
[Amit Varma]: Then you were a captive audience, you got whatever newspapers you got, you had whatever

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.200
[Amit Varma]: channels you had and so on and so forth.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.440
[Amit Varma]: And also, and I'll come back to this later, it's a separate thread, but there was a broad

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.220
[Amit Varma]: consensus on the facts.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.080
[Amit Varma]: You might say that papers had this bias or that bias or whatever, but broadly, more or

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.800
[Amit Varma]: less, everybody agreed what the world was like, and there were no deep disagreements

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.320
[Amit Varma]: with that, which is a separate point I want to come back to later.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:47.520
[Amit Varma]: But what we sort of have today is that not only a media sources and the way people get

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.440
[Amit Varma]: their information and entertainment and knowledge of which media is only a small part, a very

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440
[Amit Varma]: fragmented.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.120
[Amit Varma]: So are people's attention spans.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.640
[Amit Varma]: There is a sort of a lot fighting for your attention.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And are we at a transitional phase where the media as it is, does not resemble the media

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.800
[Amit Varma]: which would optimally exist if it were catering to people's preferences?

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.880
[Guest]: So here's the thing.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.000
[Guest]: Every single time this conversation comes up, we treat it as a binary, we say, then

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.520
[Guest]: people read, today people don't read.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.960
[Guest]: But then you're the editor of a site that concentrates on depth and detail and nuance.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.960
[Guest]: And you know that it's not that you don't have an audience, it is that your audience

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.680
[Guest]: cannot be measured in the hundreds of millions.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.920
[Guest]: It can be measured in the hundreds of thousands.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.520
[Guest]: But that is equally important.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.680
[Amit Varma]: These hundreds of thousands of people who want nuance.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.680
[Amit Varma]: It's a long tail.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And in India, every niche is a big niche.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.920
[Guest]: So not to be scoffed at.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.560
[Guest]: So if the focus was on that, and if the awareness was that, look, there is an audience that

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.040
[Guest]: does clickbait, and there is an audience that wants depth and detail, then you can find

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.400
[Guest]: that sweet spot that you're referring to.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.360
[Guest]: And it may not necessarily be one at the expense of the other.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.960
[Amit Varma]: My point is that no one's making money.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.560
[Guest]: So aren't we all getting it wrong?

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.960
[Guest]: So the moneymaking part of it is the other part.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:16.640
[Guest]: If your focus is entirely on page views and audience acquisition, you haven't found a

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.560
[Guest]: way of monetizing that audience for one fundamental reason.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:27.960
[Guest]: The audience is shifting from print to online, there is almost a zero, you know, disagreement

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.360
[Guest]: about that fact.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:35.080
[Guest]: Print at least in the English thing is stagnant or slipping.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.840
[Guest]: The audience increasing online, however, has not been matched by a corresponding movement

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.520
[Guest]: of your advertising dollars, right?

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:48.480
[Guest]: And on the internet, additional tripwire is that of the advertising dollars that are flowing

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:54.720
[Guest]: to the internet, your lunch is basically being eaten by Google and Facebook, which in the

00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:00.360
[Guest]: advanced markets account for 70% of all the advertising dollars that are being spent.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.880
[Guest]: That is true of the UK, that is true of the US.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:09.720
[Guest]: So your big source of your big platforms are basically not merely your platforms, they

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.840
[Guest]: are cannibals that are taking away your revenue.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:19.040
[Guest]: So increasingly, more and more sites are fighting for less and less share of a very small pie

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.580
[Guest]: to begin with.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.580
[Guest]: Can you make money?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.960
[Guest]: Yes, because one of the things that the media has forgotten, or the media probably never

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.080
[Guest]: knew in the first place, because there used to be this Chinese wall between those who

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.000
[Guest]: wanted to sponsor content and the creators of that content.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.600
[Guest]: And there was a reason for that wall to be in existence.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.520
[Guest]: But my argument is that it's probably time to break through that wall if you're not going

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:49.440
[Guest]: to find philanthropic supporters of the media, people who have money and say, look, it is

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.720
[Guest]: in my interest and in the country's interest for there to be a good independent media source

00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:01.380
[Guest]: and I will back it, which animal clearly does not exist today.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.400
[Guest]: Then you need to start thinking elsewhere and you need to start saying, look, there

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.960
[Guest]: are brands that are happy to spend money on creating content.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:15.360
[Guest]: Now if I create content that is very obviously advertorial content, it's not going to work.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:23.360
[Guest]: But if I create, if I use the brand's money to create content that will be enriching for

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.840
[Guest]: the audience, then there's no reason why this won't work.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.360
[Amit Varma]: I mean, look, that's sort of another name for sponsorship, in a sense, or advertising.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.360
[Guest]: But news has always been sponsored.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.360
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.400
[Amit Varma]: So I'm saying it's that's not really a new concept per se.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.400
[Guest]: It isn't.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.840
[Guest]: But it's a concept that hasn't been explored is my point.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.000
[Guest]: It has not been explored to the extent that it is possible to explore.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.120
[Guest]: Look, I mean, your ideas are your IPR and I keep getting accused of giving them away.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.280
[Guest]: So I'll do that one more time.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.560
[Guest]: So we keep talking of this new India.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.720
[Guest]: What do we know of this new India?

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.520
[Guest]: I mean, you drove through the tsunami affected areas.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.280
[Guest]: You must have realized and one of the big learnings for you at that time and from what

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.080
[Guest]: I remember of your blog, you were constantly struck by the things you were seeing that

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.160
[Guest]: you didn't know, even the things that should have been obvious.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.920
[Amit Varma]: The things that were unknown, unknowns for me, really, I had no idea they could exist.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920
[Guest]: Precisely.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.860
[Guest]: And imagine that on an all India scale, right?

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.120
[Guest]: So why don't we have something called, let's say the rediscovery of India, where what we're

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.080
[Guest]: doing is putting four cars in the four corners of the country, we're staffing them with people

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:34.720
[Guest]: who can see and who can absorb and who can listen and let them meander through the country.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.520
[Guest]: Let them blog as they go.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.040
[Guest]: Let there be a photographer slash videographer who's also telling visual stories, taking

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.480
[Guest]: you there, showing you what's going on.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.160
[Guest]: And let them take six months exploring this India and creating an online archive of what

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160
[Guest]: this new India is like.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.920
[Guest]: I'm not saying just look at the major tourist attractions.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.160
[Guest]: I'm saying look at what is happening on the ground, good, bad and indifferent.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.160
[Guest]: Record that.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.800
[Guest]: Now you have a project that you can take to an automotive manufacturer for sponsorship.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.960
[Guest]: You can take it to a smartphone manufacturer because nowadays nobody bothers about whether

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.240
[Guest]: the phone can make and receive calls and messages.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.860
[Guest]: It's always about the visual ability, the photographs and the videos and stuff.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.560
[Guest]: You can go to the tourism ministry because you're covering the whole of the country.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.520
[Guest]: You can go to the hospitality industry because these guys are occasionally going to be thing

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.000
[Guest]: and you have natural sponsors, multiple sponsors for something like this.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.480
[Guest]: And it is compelling content.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:36.880
[Guest]: It is sticky content and it enhances any media house in this country that you can think about.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.880
[Guest]: But here's the irony.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.800
[Guest]: I first proposed this to Yahoo on January 10, 2010.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:48.960
[Guest]: I've since talked about it to at least three other editors and to two major branding houses.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.240
[Guest]: Nobody has even touched this.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.160
[Amit Varma]: And I can sort of imagine why, because while this is something that I would follow avidly

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.880
[Amit Varma]: and read avidly, it still seems somewhat niche to me to begin with, and especially in these

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.520
[Amit Varma]: days where you look at the kind of content people are consuming and there's nothing sensational

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.520
[Amit Varma]: about this.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.200
[Amit Varma]: This is something that as a reader or a consumer, you have to immerse yourself in.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.520
[Amit Varma]: But going back to your earlier point about, you know, where is the money?

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.560
[Amit Varma]: It seems to me that the industry is ripe for disruption and I don't know where it's going

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.560
[Amit Varma]: to come from.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.160
[Amit Varma]: For the simple reason that everyone who spends time reading a news article online is actually

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.160
[Amit Varma]: spending money because time is money.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.560
[Amit Varma]: There is an opportunity cost to that and they are spending their time voluntarily and willingly

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and they would probably not mind even paying.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.480
[Amit Varma]: But where is a mechanism to capture that is a question and advertising therefore seems

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:46.600
[Amit Varma]: to me to be a really clumsy tool to transfer some of the money that the reader is willing

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.880
[Amit Varma]: to pay for a piece that he values reading.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:55.800
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, I know that Ken is doing a very interesting subscription kind of effort, which,

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, and they're a good magazine and I hope it works out.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.920
[Amit Varma]: But there is something missing here in the marketplace, which some genius really needs

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.920
[Guest]: to come out.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.920
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.360
[Guest]: And what is missing is the last mile thinking.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.400
[Guest]: Earlier we talked about how the chase for page views became the chase for unique users.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.920
[Guest]: And all of these come from the brands.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.000
[Guest]: They come from the sponsors.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.320
[Guest]: The sponsors are the ones who said at some point, we're no longer interested in page

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.320
[Guest]: views.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.300
[Guest]: We want to know how many readers you have, how many unique users you have.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.160
[Guest]: The same sponsors then came back and said, we're not even interested in the number of

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.160
[Guest]: users.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.240
[Guest]: We want to know how much time an individual user spends on your site.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.760
[Guest]: Because like you said, time is money.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.640
[Guest]: Somebody is investing his time on the site.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.440
[Guest]: The longer he spends there, the more of an opportunity I have to sell him something was

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440
[Guest]: the thinking.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.520
[Guest]: But they haven't figured out how to convert my ability to attract a reader and hold a

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.540
[Guest]: reader to his ability to sell him something when that's going on.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.360
[Guest]: And that is because even though the sponsors are still thinking in terms of conventional

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:05.720
[Guest]: branding, put a logo and a short message, at best get a click through to some fulfillment

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.000
[Guest]: site and stuff like that, which might work for an Amazon, because it is about fulfillment.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
[Guest]: It's immediate.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Guest]: It's instinctive.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.420
[Guest]: So you can have those kinds of sites doing that.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:20.280
[Guest]: But for the broad mass of advertisers, the last mile thinking still remains missing.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.640
[Amit Varma]: I think this economic puzzle is something that you and I are probably too old to figure

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.640
[Amit Varma]: out.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.480
[Amit Varma]: It'll need some real innovator thinker to come out and disrupt that.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.520
[Amit Varma]: I want to, you know, shift the subject to the nature of media itself.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.240
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, like I mentioned earlier, back in the day, every the mainstream media

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.400
[Amit Varma]: was a gatekeeper of information and news.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.720
[Amit Varma]: That's where you got it all from.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.960
[Amit Varma]: And maybe they were biased once in a while and all of that.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.900
[Amit Varma]: But broadly, there was a consensus on what the facts are.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.560
[Amit Varma]: And there was a consensus on what the world is like.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.640
[Amit Varma]: Now I want to refer back to another book, which I know is a favorite of yours and has

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.800
[Amit Varma]: been a deep influence on me, Walter Lipman's Public Opinion, which was published in 1922.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.640
[Amit Varma]: And I'd really urge all the listeners of the show, if they care about the subject, to read

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.720
[Amit Varma]: that book.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.960
[Amit Varma]: And it's published in 1922.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:08.440
[Amit Varma]: The first chapter of the book is called, if I remember correctly, the world as it is in

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.200
[Amit Varma]: the world inside our heads.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And it makes a very valuable point that the world as it is, is a beast that no one really

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.680
[Amit Varma]: knows.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.200
[Amit Varma]: We just carry a world inside our heads, and because of media, the world inside our heads,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.800
[Amit Varma]: because you know, when you had all your information filtered through mainstream media, you went

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.880
[Amit Varma]: through the same education system, the world inside everyone's head was very, very similar.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.040
[Amit Varma]: And what has happened now with the internet, and which I think is a huge net positive and

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.440
[Amit Varma]: a great empowering effect.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:45.880
[Amit Varma]: So I'm not criticizing it and don't get me wrong, but what has happened now is that on

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:52.440
[Amit Varma]: the internet, discourse has become very polarized, and it's become possible to find all kinds

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.600
[Amit Varma]: of people you could not have for geographical reasons, who might share your worldviews,

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:04.680
[Amit Varma]: or your fetishes, or your love for conspiracy theories, or your proclivities or inclinations,

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:10.080
[Amit Varma]: and therefore then form echo chambers, where people share broadly the same worldview, but

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.120
[Amit Varma]: they're impervious to anything that challenges that.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:20.200
[Amit Varma]: And as discourse gets more and more polarized, you have an ecosystem of these echo chambers,

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.200
[Amit Varma]: and it's incredibly hard to break through them.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And there's a confirmation bias in play, they will believe what they want to believe, they

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.560
[Amit Varma]: will consume what feeds into their existing preferences.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:37.200
[Amit Varma]: And what that's done is that it's dispersed the number of sources of news and information,

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.720
[Amit Varma]: like I would argue that WhatsApp today with this million dispersed content creators is

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.600
[Amit Varma]: way more influential than any broadsheet could possibly be.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.880
[Amit Varma]: And then the question then comes is that in this environment, what is journalism?

00:34:51.880 --> 00:35:00.000
[Guest]: So you're totally bang on about calling WhatsApp the strongest possible vector for the spread

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.760
[Guest]: of information, which also includes misinformation, deliberate disinformation, the whole lot,

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:12.080
[Guest]: which which then puts an added burden on journalism, because how the hell do you combat that?

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.640
[Guest]: There is no intersect between the media, I mean, you or I could start a WhatsApp group,

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:21.200
[Guest]: but then again, fairly soon, what will happen is it will fill with like minded people.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.200
[Guest]: It will be a bubble of our own what purpose, it doesn't serve a purpose.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:31.960
[Guest]: But here's the deal, though, if you look at the last three and a half years, and I refer

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:38.760
[Guest]: to this, because I recently wrote a piece arguing this precise case, we now are talking

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.480
[Guest]: about how is the narrative changing?

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:46.360
[Guest]: Look, WhatsApp groups have only grown in size, the groups that are fanboys, for instance,

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:53.840
[Guest]: of the present regime have proliferated, all of that is moving in one direction.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.320
[Guest]: And yet, people have started even within those groups started perceiving a certain dissonance,

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.560
[Guest]: a certain criticism of the government that they're no longer able to refute.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.200
[Guest]: You can see signs of that, for instance, in the decrease in actual trolling, because somebody

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.120
[Guest]: or the others figured out at the establishment level that this is actually now proving counterproductive.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.160
[Guest]: You can see that in people who earlier just dismissed you now reaching out and saying,

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.960
[Guest]: can you talk about that a little bit more?

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.360
[Guest]: Because that doesn't compute with what I have in my head.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:31.200
[Guest]: The thing that has happened is because of one or two important events that have led

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:37.920
[Guest]: to pointed nuanced criticism, a little bit of this bubble is breaking, or at least there

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:44.000
[Guest]: is a slight drip drip of fact and information into these little bubbles.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.240
[Guest]: Our problem is that if we are looking for an instant solution, it's not going to happen.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.440
[Guest]: All that has happened is that it has put journalism in this place where against the odds, against

00:36:53.440 --> 00:37:00.080
[Guest]: the run of both economics and what is called media management, good sense, we are having

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.520
[Guest]: to fight harder and harder to create the sort of impact we could create much more easily

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.200
[Guest]: a decade ago, a couple of decades ago.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.000
[Guest]: So the point is not that we cannot break through.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.760
[Guest]: The point is that it has become an incredibly arduous process.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:20.340
[Guest]: And that has put an additional stress on newsrooms, which neither have the ability, the resources

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.480
[Guest]: or the appetite for that kind of ongoing struggle.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.880
[Guest]: I mean, I'll turn the question right back to you.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.800
[Guest]: Why would you do a Pragati?

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.320
[Guest]: It is basically an attempt.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.200
[Guest]: If it is to create a bubble, I'm sure that, you know, none of the people, none of you

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.720
[Guest]: guys who are involved in it, and I know you all, would even be attempting this because

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.360
[Guest]: how easy is it for us to create a bubble if we won't, why take all this trouble?

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.980
[Guest]: What we're doing now is trying to get across, trying to break past the binaries that now

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:52.960
[Guest]: govern our thinking and try and find a middle ground of just get back to fact, get back

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.560
[Guest]: to proper analysis.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:01.780
[Guest]: And hopefully the trickle down effect will, I mean, we will attract the fence sitters

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:06.400
[Guest]: and it's constantly forgotten in this media binary that ultimately the largest audience

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.360
[Guest]: is those guys in the middle, who are neither this way nor that.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.360
[Guest]: These two bubbles are fine.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.040
[Guest]: They're going to exist and they've existed pretty much as long as there has been a media.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.880
[Amit Varma]: I think there are multiple bubbles, not just two.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.880
[Amit Varma]: And I think, you know, Pragati, of course, to briefly address that was set up because

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.040
[Amit Varma]: the discourse was so polarized and we thought we should create a bipartisan site which does

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:31.760
[Amit Varma]: dispassionate analysis of public policy without either attacking or supporting parties or

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.760
[Amit Varma]: people.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.080
[Amit Varma]: My impassioned editorials are a different matter, but broadly all our other content

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.360
[Amit Varma]: is, looks at policy dispassionately and tries to speak to everyone without compromising

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.360
[Amit Varma]: anywhere.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.120
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, to get back to the kind of positive feedback where you now say the tide

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.920
[Amit Varma]: might be turning, I'd say that one, I mean, I hate to be cynical about this, but I'd say

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.820
[Amit Varma]: that one, the people we know, it's a very self-selected kind of group and, you know,

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.440
[Amit Varma]: in purely economic terms, I'd look more at revealed preferences.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.540
[Amit Varma]: How do people actually act?

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:07.320
[Amit Varma]: And the UP election was actually an eye opener for me because demonetization was devastated

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.320
[Amit Varma]: the economy.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:13.080
[Amit Varma]: We all know that there is no disputing that now, despite the efforts of useful idiots

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.040
[Amit Varma]: in various places, it devastated the economy.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.920
[Amit Varma]: And yet many people in UP itself, many people who lost jobs, whose businesses shut down,

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.680
[Amit Varma]: who were deeply hurt by it, nevertheless voted for Modi ji.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:31.080
[Amit Varma]: And therefore there was a disconnect between, to use Lipman's phrases, the world as it is

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.040
[Amit Varma]: and the world in our heads, where what happens in the real world may not really matter.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.400
[Amit Varma]: You may be one of those 1 million people who is coming into the workforce and there's no

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.760
[Amit Varma]: job for you because the economy has been mishandled so badly.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.480
[Amit Varma]: And yet you become a Hindutva warrior fighting against Love Jihad, because that's the narrative

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.240
[Amit Varma]: that is inside your head.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.560
[Amit Varma]: And that narrative cannot be fought through facts.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:58.000
[Amit Varma]: So the problem isn't that there is fake news and we need to fight it with facts.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.920
[Amit Varma]: The problem is that facts are incapable of fighting those kinds of narratives and, you

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.680
[Amit Varma]: know, which I don't have any answers to, but how do you respond to that?

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.720
[Guest]: One of the things is, and I know you've read the book as well, and so have I, Prashant's

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:19.920
[Guest]: wonderful book on how the BJP's election machinery, it's a, it's a must read for political analysis

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:25.900
[Guest]: in general, and to understand the BJP's worldview in particular, you use the word narrative.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:32.120
[Guest]: And for me, all the post-UP narrative talked about this miracle of look, Modi devastated

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:37.780
[Guest]: everybody's lives in practice, but he was still able to sell this whole thing of I am

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:42.280
[Guest]: a poor man doing it on behalf of the poor man and against the rich man.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.860
[Guest]: He sold that whole story.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.880
[Guest]: And it worked wonderfully well, along with all the other sub stories of Love Jihad and,

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.520
[Guest]: you know, the Muslim oppression and all of that.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:58.280
[Guest]: My point is, even at that point, for the people who are actually affected and ultimately look

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:02.400
[Guest]: the voter is going to make up his mind on the basis of whether his life has gotten better

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.400
[Guest]: or worse.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:08.520
[Guest]: He doesn't give a damn for all the macro stuff that we keep talking about and obsessing over.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.600
[Amit Varma]: His thing is, am I living better today than I was?

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.840
[Amit Varma]: I actually disagree, even if you're living worse, you know, it's almost political ideology

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.440
[Amit Varma]: has almost become like a religion, even if the circumstances get worse, they will still

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.440
[Guest]: vote in the same way.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.440
[Guest]: Right.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:26.840
[Guest]: But my argument is, you need to allow some time between a policy and its results percolating

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:32.080
[Guest]: before you interpret a particular election as being influenced for or against by that

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.200
[Guest]: particular policy.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.380
[Guest]: And UP happened too close to demonetization for there to be an alternate narrative.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:43.040
[Guest]: What I'm looking forward to is the five or probably six elections that have to happen

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:48.720
[Guest]: between say, December of this year, and December of next year.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.200
[Guest]: Because now you've had time for demonetization to actually play out on the ground.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.240
[Guest]: You've had time for the buzz around this being an anti-rich move.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.360
[Guest]: I mean, if it is an anti-rich move, where is all the wealth that's come back from black

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.360
[Guest]: money?

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.360
[Guest]: It clearly hasn't.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:09.080
[Guest]: And therefore, the civil society, which should have benefited from that, because you have

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:13.440
[Guest]: excess money, you can pump it back into your, you know, societal interventions.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.040
[Guest]: None of those things are materializing.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.480
[Guest]: Now I want to see and which is why I said, yeah, I will agree with the basic premise

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.640
[Guest]: that demonetization and the UP election played out exactly the opposite of what pretty much

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.680
[Guest]: all the punditry thought it would.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.560
[Guest]: You thought it would have a major impact, it did, but it had the impact in the opposite

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560
[Amit Varma]: direction to what we assume.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.920
[Guest]: If at all there is that causation, I mean, the causation correlation is not in the first

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.960
[Guest]: place 100% clear.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:45.640
[Guest]: But as these serial elections play off, that would probably be a better time to step back

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:50.560
[Guest]: and analyze whether a narrative that is sold in the heat of the moment survives contact

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.560
[Guest]: with reality.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:57.320
[Guest]: And which is why I think it is still important, despite the feeling that you're Sisyphus rolling

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:02.360
[Guest]: this rock constantly up the hill, you still need to keep doing this, because what is your

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.360
[Guest]: alternative?

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.960
[Guest]: Are you going to cede the ground entirely?

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:10.080
[Guest]: Because you're saying, look, I mean, I work from morning 8 o'clock till midnight 12, and

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.080
[Guest]: nobody listens.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.360
[Guest]: They live in their own bubbles.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:19.200
[Guest]: I agree with the concept that Lippmann wrote about and that you're talking, even in the

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.200
[Guest]: halcyon days of the media, we still lived inside our own worlds.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.720
[Guest]: I mean, that's that's human nature.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.880
[Guest]: Our worlds were very similar, though, mostly.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:34.640
[Guest]: And as you pointed out, this was written in 1922, and it was relevant then.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:40.600
[Guest]: But you also pointed out that at that point, at least the world inside our head was based

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:45.840
[Guest]: on a similar set of facts to the world externally, because the media, pretty much like you said,

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.480
[Guest]: there is a consensus on what fact is.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.320
[Guest]: That consensus breaking down today is what is causing a lot of the dissonance.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.160
[Guest]: But then I would think it is doubly imperative for the media to go right back to first principles

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.640
[Guest]: and say, important news will be fact.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.640
[Guest]: The rest of it, the noise, the opinion, yeah, rant away for all you want.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.920
[Guest]: And it's great fun.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:11.000
[Guest]: And sometimes a well argued rant from the left or the right actually shapes your own

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
[Guest]: thinking.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.480
[Guest]: But that is for, or that is not for the vast majority of people who just want to consume

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.040
[Guest]: some news, some fact and move on.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.080
[Amit Varma]: I think the other, again, thinking aloud, the other interesting thing that strikes me

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.040
[Amit Varma]: here is that the people have their own hierarchies of facts.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.760
[Amit Varma]: There are different kinds of facts which are in conflict with each other.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.000
[Amit Varma]: So you might, for example, there might be the fact that, okay, GST is hard to comply

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
[Amit Varma]: with.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.880
[Amit Varma]: But there is also a fact competing with the tension that, oh, there are very few jobs

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.040
[Amit Varma]: and you know, the othering of the Muslims, for example, you're competing with people

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:51.720
[Amit Varma]: who are not like you for the same sort of resources and in a very poor country with

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.320
[Amit Varma]: so many things, including jobs are so scarce.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:59.880
[Amit Varma]: And there is a whole universe of facts in different, coming from different directions.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.400
[Amit Varma]: And the common guy will have therefore have his hierarchy of what facts matter to him

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.600
[Amit Varma]: and what facts don't.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:13.640
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, does that make every journalist who claims allegiance to facts also an activist

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:21.120
[Amit Varma]: and a crusader of sorts, because he is necessarily propagating a foregrounding of facts according

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.560
[Amit Varma]: to his hierarchy of facts.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.320
[Guest]: It does, but it always has.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.400
[Guest]: I think that's, that's pretty much been how the media has always functioned.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.400
[Guest]: So nothing much has changed over there.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:39.480
[Guest]: And I still would argue that it is easier to account for bias if, as you say, the individual

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.240
[Guest]: reporter, the individual media house looked at facts and yeah, it'll look at it from its

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.240
[Guest]: filters.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.960
[Guest]: We know, for instance, that the Indian Express will always almost invariably look at something

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.160
[Guest]: from an anti-establishment filter and the Times of India will look at it from a pro-establishment

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.160
[Amit Varma]: filter and stuff.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.920
[Guest]: All my columns against demonetization, many of them came in the Times.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.680
[Guest]: So there are counter-intuitive arguments on both sides.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.520
[Guest]: There are some stories in the Indian Express that could have been written by a PR consultant,

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.520
[Guest]: for instance.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:12.960
[Guest]: But broadly speaking, or at least put it this way, that we as readers assume certain stances

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:18.000
[Guest]: and certain biases in the media houses, and we then look for the commonalities and we

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.640
[Guest]: say, okay, these seem to be facts that pretty much everybody's agreed on and stuff like

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.640
[Guest]: that.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.680
[Guest]: Which still brings me back to the thing that I keep talking over and over again in J School

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.160
[Guest]: talks and when I meet friends from the media and all that, isn't that doubly important

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:39.560
[Guest]: then to get back to facts and cut this crap out that is not, at least I can understand

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.960
[Guest]: if it's putting money on your thing and good luck to you, it is not.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.140
[Guest]: So what are you doing this for?

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:49.840
[Guest]: And to your point about people who have a predefined set of facts in their head and

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.520
[Amit Varma]: who are unwilling to break past.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.920
[Amit Varma]: I wouldn't say predefined set of facts, I'd say a hierarchy of facts.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.720
[Amit Varma]: Some facts matter more than others.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:02.120
[Amit Varma]: So to someone, it may matter more that, you know, that Muslims in his neighborhood are

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:08.200
[Amit Varma]: marrying Hindu girls, and that may matter more to him than, for example, how the economy

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.360
[Amit Varma]: is doing.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.880
[Amit Varma]: And I'm simplifying massively, because it's like far more complex than that, but people

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.320
[Amit Varma]: live within their own social realities.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And some facts may matter more than other facts.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:25.800
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, sometimes I worry that when, you know, we talk against coercion and imposition,

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.920
[Amit Varma]: for example, I mean, you're not a libertarian like me, but those things, we can agree on

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.920
[Amit Varma]: that.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.360
[Amit Varma]: Both of us are against coercion and imposition.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:39.800
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, we try to impose these values of, you know, imposition being a bad

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.980
[Amit Varma]: thing on society at large, which is, you know, almost like a paradox.

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.160
[Amit Varma]: But anyway, that's leaving that aside.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.280
[Guest]: No, I just, the point that you started this, I was thinking of a personal anecdote, when

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:57.040
[Guest]: I got back to writing about politics, and that pretty much was after Gauri Lankesh,

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.720
[Guest]: when I realized that not enough people were openly speaking out, I'm not saying you should

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:07.480
[Guest]: take a take up a sword and start, you know, chopping up the right wing, but at least address

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:11.560
[Guest]: the issues of the day and stuff like which is when I started writing again on politics,

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.360
[Guest]: particularly on my blog.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.960
[Guest]: And then I would probably put a link on my Twitter stream.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:20.360
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, a few of those links are beneath the page of this podcast episode.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.040
[Guest]: So please do follow them and check them out.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.040
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.920
[Guest]: And one of the funny things that happened was, I had this constant pushback, both on

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:33.180
[Guest]: Twitter and on my blog, and a couple of comments saying, yeah, you talk about all this.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:37.320
[Guest]: But let's see you talk about you know, how your home state of Kerala has become a killing

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:41.960
[Guest]: ground and Hindus are being massacred in large numbers and stuff.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:47.400
[Guest]: Now, like any other consumer of news, I had seen these headline stories of BJP worker

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.280
[Guest]: hacked to death and Arun Jaitley is visiting this that and the other and it occurred to

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.720
[Guest]: me, that I hadn't tried to see what the dots were forget about connecting them.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.400
[Guest]: All I did was a basic Google search for the last 10 years.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.720
[Guest]: And I just listed all the incidents that were recorded, both in the Malayalam press and

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.480
[Guest]: in the English press of killings.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.720
[Guest]: And then I found an India spend article which showed that the killings matched each other.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.780
[Guest]: There's one dead CPM worker for every dead BJP worker.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.080
[Guest]: So it is not a case of one party doing the killing and the other party just being the

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.680
[Guest]: killed.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:29.000
[Guest]: All I did was just list this particular thing saying, look, enough people are talking about

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.760
[Guest]: the BJP being the ones killed.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.680
[Guest]: Here is a list of all the violence that happened in the last two years against CPM members.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:42.440
[Guest]: The same guy who accused me of completely ignoring the Kerala thing, he, the first comment

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.640
[Guest]: that he posted on that blog, and later on Twitter, because I didn't respond to the blog

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.600
[Guest]: comment, I didn't see it was, can you tell me how you found these facts?

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.320
[Guest]: Because I didn't think of it this way.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.240
[Guest]: It took a hell of a long time to put that together.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.280
[Guest]: But one mind change somewhere.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.120
[Guest]: And that's kind of the job of the media.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.560
[Guest]: And if one mind is, it's not even that the mind is changed, but at least he is not thinking

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.760
[Guest]: in that one set fashion anymore.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.840
[Guest]: I would take that as a win.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.680
[Amit Varma]: I would take that as worth the three or four hours.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.760
[Amit Varma]: I just ignore all water bowlery, because my sense is that, you know, focus on the argument,

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.200
[Guest]: don't shift the attention to the person.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.440
[Guest]: But in this case, I mean, the reason why I followed it, because it raised the question

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:22.160
[Amit Varma]: in my own head, not about whether I was ignoring things that related to my home.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.160
[Amit Varma]: Is he right?

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Does he have a point?

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.160
[Guest]: What was exactly happening?

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.160
[Guest]: And that worked.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.200
[Guest]: So somewhere along the way, I think, if we say that there is a dissonance in the audience

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.480
[Guest]: about what is fact anymore, then I think it is doubly important for us to then identify

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:40.000
[Unknown]: that, yeah, to identify that fact and put it up in a way that you can't dispute.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And just do the best we can.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I always worry about this sense of, you know, journalism as a calling with its

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.760
[Amit Varma]: own values and so on that both of us have and journalism as a profession and it's part

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.840
[Amit Varma]: of a business and it needs to make a profit and, you know, and that conflict is always

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.960
[Guest]: something we try to navigate in our own ways.

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.280
[Guest]: Actually, I've never felt that conflict for me.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.000
[Guest]: I mean, journalism is something that I want to do, because I love meeting people, I love

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.840
[Guest]: understanding what's going on and I love writing about it.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.480
[Guest]: But it's also a profession I'm in because I know that I've made a good living out of

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.480
[Unknown]: it.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.480
[Unknown]: Right.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.920
[Guest]: If it wasn't, if I was still being paid the 250 bucks that I got in the beginning, I'd

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.760
[Guest]: have been out of here ages ago, because at the end of the day, you have to pay your rent.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.760
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.400
[Guest]: And I don't see what is wrong with getting a proper wage for a proper job.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.120
[Amit Varma]: And when they go together, that's great when, you know, the calling and the profession go

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.320
[Guest]: together and there's no conflict and that's great.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.320
[Guest]: But it is.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.240
[Guest]: And it's like you could flip the argument to any other profession.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.720
[Guest]: I mean, medical profession is supposed to be a calling.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.440
[Guest]: It's supposed to be about saving lives, but you try walking out of a doctor's thing without

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.120
[Amit Varma]: paying for it and see how far you get.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.760
[Guest]: So, you know, the incentives have to be right.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.760
[Guest]: They have to be properly.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.320
[Amit Varma]: That's, that's the way human nature is.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:49.560
[Amit Varma]: I want to end with, in my usual systematic way, four questions, which I won't ask all

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.560
[Amit Varma]: of them at the same time.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.560
[Amit Varma]: I'll go one by one.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.760
[Amit Varma]: When you joined journalism, or when you first wanted to join journalism, when you got that

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.040
[Amit Varma]: spark as a young person, why did you have that spark?

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.720
[Guest]: What did you expect from it?

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.200
[Guest]: There was an internal and an external thing.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:09.680
[Guest]: The external drive was that, you know, Moor Market, which used to be famed for second

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.720
[Guest]: hand books in Tamil Nadu, used to be a haunt for first my father and then I developed the

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.000
[Guest]: habit as well.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.740
[Guest]: Dad used to buy books.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.800
[Guest]: I was intrigued by some of these magazines that you could find.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.480
[Guest]: Ancient copies of Esquire and so I'd never heard of these.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.760
[Guest]: And unlike today, we don't have a reference point.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.920
[Guest]: So it was a random copy of the New Yorker, a random copy of Esquire, in fact, random

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.040
[Guest]: copies of newspapers sometimes.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:41.760
[Guest]: And this was my first exposure to something that was not called the Hindu, which is the

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.760
[Guest]: paper that for some reason, ubiquitous Chennai paper, Chennai paper, because your parents

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.520
[Guest]: tell you that you read the Hindu in order to improve your English, which is probably

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:55.080
[Guest]: the worst advice that they can, could have given at that time, but all that apart.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:59.320
[Guest]: And when I read it, I looked at things that I vaguely heard about here and there and the

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:03.840
[Guest]: way it was read out and all that, it fascinated me.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:09.080
[Guest]: And then I compared it with what I was getting in the domestic press.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.880
[Guest]: And I was like, look, there is so much more that can be done.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:17.440
[Guest]: And coincidentally, around the same time, I found myself at a party where there was

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.000
[Guest]: this editor Aditi Dey, who was then with the Indian Express back in Chennai.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.960
[Guest]: And she saw some, I mean, we were arguing about something or the other and my usual

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.280
[Guest]: passionate mid-twenties, explosive sort of language and all that.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.640
[Guest]: And she suddenly tapped me on the shoulder and said, listen, why don't you write this

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.360
[Guest]: as an essay for me?

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.360
[Guest]: I tried doing that.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:43.920
[Guest]: I love the process of thinking through something and testing it for stresses at various points

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.440
[Guest]: in the argument and finding some kind of answer.

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.520
[Guest]: Somebody once said that I write to figure out what I'm thinking.

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.120
[Guest]: I found that process then.

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.040
[Guest]: And this kind of hooked me into it.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:02.160
[Guest]: And I pretty much I think at that point, you know, when in 70s India, if you're a college

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:07.440
[Guest]: dropout with no marketable skills you did, I realized this is what I wanted to do.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:14.720
[Guest]: And you know what, after all this, I don't look back at those 29 years as a journalist,

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:20.280
[Guest]: another three years as a freelancer, occasionally getting gigs with even the slightest tinge

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280
[Guest]: of regret.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.680
[Guest]: It wasn't worth it because of, you know, the kind of things that you're exposed to and

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.920
[Amit Varma]: the kind of.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.960
[Amit Varma]: And it was as much personal self-discovery is, you know, exactly right.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:37.280
[Amit Varma]: My second question then is that if you were 18 years old today, would you want to be a

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.280
[Amit Varma]: journalist?

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.280
[Amit Varma]: And if so, why?

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.280
[Guest]: Yes.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.360
[Guest]: And I keep getting this question in the colleges that I speak in.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:48.800
[Guest]: One of the thing is, you know, today when you speak in a college, the questions are

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.960
[Guest]: all pessimistic.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.200
[Guest]: The last time I spoke at a journalism college, for instance, the first question that I got

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:59.840
[Guest]: was in this era of declining media credibility, how do I ensure that at least my personal

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.440
[Guest]: credibility is built and protected?

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.960
[Guest]: It's a startling question to get from a 19 or 20 year old kid.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.960
[Guest]: But that's...

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:14.560
[Amit Varma]: Who, by the way, are way smarter than we were when we were 18 or 19, so you know, that alone

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.880
[Guest]: should give you some hope.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.480
[Guest]: The answer I constantly make is, yeah, if I was in your position right now and I had

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:25.960
[Guest]: to make this choice all over again, I would still choose journalism because everything

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:32.960
[Guest]: that you're seeing and hearing and every development that you see around you, it reinforces the

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:41.480
[Guest]: thought that nothing can be more important in a democracy than the job of providing accurate

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.920
[Guest]: information.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.600
[Guest]: It is dichotomous for us to constantly talk of this as the age of information, the era

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.600
[Guest]: of data, the era of information and all of that and say, look, is there any value to

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.160
[Guest]: providing information in the first place?

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.400
[Guest]: We have not been able to monetize this thing.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.400
[Guest]: That's a whole other argument.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:02.080
[Guest]: And like you said, hopefully there's some 20 year old somewhere who's working on that

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.080
[Guest]: and will crack it.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.600
[Amit Varma]: Who will get his idea at the end of this podcast.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:09.200
[Guest]: But I cannot think, in fact, if I thought of whether it was more important for me to

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:14.160
[Guest]: be a journalist in the same 90s as opposed to today, I would say today, it's it's

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:18.960
[Amit Varma]: So you'd say that then you were driven by the need for personal self-discovery and what

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.240
[Amit Varma]: it did to you.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.920
[Amit Varma]: And today you'd be driven more by that.

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:23.920
[Guest]: This is required.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.120
[Guest]: This is an awareness of what happens if this didn't happen.

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.000
[Guest]: What happens if we didn't do what we do or the larger media universe didn't do what it

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.240
[Guest]: ideally should.

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.720
[Guest]: The dangers are far more obvious now than they they were to me, at least at that point

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.720
[Amit Varma]: in time.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.640
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask you my last two questions together and you're probably expecting it.

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.720
[Amit Varma]: One, what makes you hopeful about the future of media and the future of India?

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.320
[Guest]: And two, what worries you?

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.320
[Guest]: What worries me?

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:55.840
[Guest]: I'll take that first is the is the general if it's still talking about the media, what

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.040
[Guest]: worries me is the general it's not cluelessness.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:05.280
[Guest]: I speak to editors and I realize they know precisely what the flashpoints are, precisely

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:09.080
[Guest]: what the fault lines are, precisely what they need to do to address it, precisely what they

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:13.320
[Guest]: need to do for their own and organizational credibilities.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:18.640
[Guest]: And then they rationalize not doing it very systematically.

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:24.760
[Guest]: And I listen to them talk and I'm thinking to myself, you know what he's saying is wrong.

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:30.560
[Guest]: And in a private off record conversation is still trying to justify the indefensible.

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.960
[Guest]: And that worries the hell out of me.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.320
[Guest]: Because if these are the people who are the thought leaders and these are the people who

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.920
[Guest]: are shaping this industry.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.760
[Guest]: And if they have gotten to a point where they've just given up and now are looking only for

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.560
[Guest]: self justification, then we have a major problem.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:47.160
[Guest]: If there is at least the internal awareness and the willingness to recognize that something

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.080
[Guest]: is going wrong and we need to think of solutions, like you said earlier, the two of us in this

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.280
[Guest]: podcast are not going to solve the media's economic problems, but we at least need to

00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:01.520
[Guest]: understand that the economic problem is fundamental to the larger problem.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.640
[Guest]: If that is not happening, yeah, that makes me despair.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:10.880
[Guest]: What makes me hopeful for this business or this industry in particular is again to go

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:15.080
[Guest]: back to the fact that I've lately spent a lot of time either teaching or lecturing at

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.480
[Guest]: colleges and stuff like that.

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:22.000
[Guest]: And I would think this is the last possible or the worst possible moment in time for a

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.740
[Guest]: young, hopeful, smart graduate to get into a postgraduate course on journalism.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.200
[Guest]: But the numbers keep growing.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:37.280
[Guest]: I'm astonished when I go, for instance, to an ACGA and find that there are 300 students

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.000
[Guest]: in the digital media stream.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.880
[Guest]: And they are young, they're enthusiastic, they're not saying, you know, let's just get

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.760
[Guest]: in there and be Rajeev Sardesai or Arnab Goswami.

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.440
[Guest]: The questions they ask and the kind of things that they want to know.

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.600
[Amit Varma]: They really want to figure it out.

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.600
[Guest]: Yeah, they want to figure it out.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:57.760
[Guest]: They want to say, how do we tell good stories is one of the most common questions we get.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.920
[Guest]: And if this generation is still thinking that way, at least not all the 300 may make it

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:08.760
[Guest]: to a position of influence, but enough of them will actually be doing the kind of work

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.920
[Guest]: they want to do.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.580
[Guest]: And hopefully they will break through some of the stuff.

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:17.480
[Guest]: And I'll also point you at this other phenomenon, which doesn't get noticed enough, that a lot

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:22.360
[Guest]: of the bright young journalists who came after us, the next generation journalists, take

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:28.240
[Guest]: the Priyanka Dubey's or the Snigdha Poonam's and people like that, they seem completely

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:33.040
[Guest]: comfortable moving out of the mainstream media space, going and doing the kind of stories

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.880
[Guest]: they want, and then going to the media and saying, look, I'm doing the story, do you

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:40.580
[Guest]: want it or no, and they're getting published, and they're doing brilliant work.

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.720
[Guest]: So on the one hand, in the existing system, there are enough people saying, look, I mean,

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.680
[Guest]: I don't want to be part of this mass marketing of bullshit.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:51.320
[Guest]: I want to do the stories that matter, or the stories that should matter.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.580
[Guest]: And then there is the next generation saying, I want to be part of this business.

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.280
[Guest]: And I want to know how to do it right.

00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.600
[Guest]: And I want to know how to do it with credibility and quality.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.080
[Guest]: And that, for me, makes me slightly hopeful.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.520
[Amit Varma]: Okay, again, it's the optimist in me speaking, but...

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.680
[Amit Varma]: It's a great note of hope to end on, you know, old fogies like us have more questions than

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.680
[Amit Varma]: answers.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.120
[Amit Varma]: And here's hoping that the young people studying journalism today in more than just a formal

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.320
[Amit Varma]: sense, come up with some of those answers, which we desperately need.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.120
[Guest]: Prem, it's been an honor to have you on the show.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120
