      "[00:44.120 --> 00:48.680]  better. We understand our different organs, the way nature reacts upon us, the origin\n",
      "[00:48.680 --> 00:53.360]  of diseases. And sure, there's still a lot to figure out. But we know the methods and\n",
      "[00:53.360 --> 00:58.620]  the mindset we need to keep progressing. The method is scientific, where everything must\n",
      "[00:58.620 --> 01:04.080]  be evidence-based and open to falsification. The mindset is humble, curious, sceptical.\n",

      "[01:37.560 --> 01:42.480]  Abbey Phillips. I first heard of Abbey from Dinesh Thakur, who recorded a memorable episode\n",
      "[01:42.480 --> 01:48.000]  with me called The Dark Side of Indian Pharma. Abbey is known as the liver doctor on Twitter,\n",
      "[01:48.000 --> 01:52.560]  and he is a fearless rationalist. For years now, he has been debunking different kinds\n",
      "[01:52.560 --> 01:58.120]  of quackery that calls itself alternative medicine. The term is a misnomer. Modern medicine\n",
      "[01:58.120 --> 02:03.600]  is evidence-based medicine. And the so-called alternative medicine systems are not evidence-based.\n",
      "[02:03.600 --> 02:09.000]  They're not medicine at all. Abbey has been attacked both by big corporations peddling\n",
      "[02:09.000 --> 02:14.200]  nonsense products and by the Ministry of Ayush. But he continues his crusade because it is\n",
      "[02:14.200 --> 02:19.240]  important. As a liver doctor, he's seen countless patients whose livers have been damaged because\n",
      "[02:19.240 --> 02:24.480]  they popped what they thought was a harmless herbal supplement or an Ayurvedic medicine,\n",
      "[02:24.480 --> 02:29.640]  etc. etc. The myths around these are many. But lives are at stake and those myths must\n",
      "[02:29.640 --> 02:34.240]  be fought. I've admired the way in which Abbey has done that. And I've written various articles\n",
      "[02:34.240 --> 02:37.840]  about the dangers of homeopathy and Ayurveda as well. I'll link them all from the show\n",
      "[02:37.840 --> 02:42.520]  notes as well as some excellent books on the subject by the likes of Ben Goldacre and Simon\n",
      "[02:42.520 --> 02:47.680]  Singh. Abbey flew down to Mumbai a few weeks ago to record this episode. And we only spoke\n",
      "[02:47.680 --> 02:52.400]  about quackery in the second half. In the first half, we spoke about Abbey's journey,\n",
      "[02:52.400 --> 02:57.240]  what the medical ecosystem in India is like, the incentives doctors deal with, the trade-offs\n",
      "[02:57.240 --> 03:02.520]  they face, the ethical dilemmas they encounter, and why Abbey chose not just to be a doctor,\n",
      "[03:02.520 --> 03:08.440]  but to be a scientist as well. He's published 165 papers and done pioneering work in reversing\n",
      "[03:08.440 --> 03:13.040]  liver cirrhosis. There is much wisdom in this episode. And it's an important episode that\n",
      "[03:13.040 --> 03:17.520]  can affect lives. So please do listen to it and please share widely, not just among doctors\n",
      "[03:17.520 --> 03:22.040]  and medical students, but among all of us. I mean, we all have bodies, and we should\n",
      "[03:22.040 --> 03:25.320]  all embrace science and shun dangerous dogma.\n",
      "[03:30.320 --> 03:34.720]  One of the ways in which I've changed my life is that I try to understand my body better.\n",
      "[03:34.720 --> 03:39.160]  And science has brought us to a place where we can finally begin to understand our own\n",
      "[03:39.160 --> 03:43.800]  programming. This episode is sponsored by MapMyGenome, a pathbreaking company that gives\n",
      "[03:43.800 --> 03:48.560]  you different kinds of insight about your own body. And I'm specifically interested\n",

      "[05:22.360 --> 05:26.320]  the sort of quackery that we are surrounded with in different contexts, I want to know\n",
      "[05:26.320 --> 05:30.400]  more about you. Tell me a bit about you know, what was your childhood like? Where did you\n",
      "[05:30.400 --> 05:34.560]  grow up and so on? Oh, yeah, I mean, and this is going to be very nostalgic for me, because\n",
      "[05:34.560 --> 05:41.600]  I miss those days. Actually, I was actually born in a small town called Kuthattukulam\n",
      "[05:41.600 --> 05:47.120]  that's in Kottayam in Kerala. And my dad is a doctor. He's a senior gastroenterologist.\n",
      "[05:47.120 --> 05:51.600]  And my mom is a housewife. So I'm the third of four. I have an elder brother, an elder\n",
      "[05:51.600 --> 05:58.040]  sister and a younger sister. And most of my childhood, I mean, till the fourth grade,\n",
      "[05:58.040 --> 06:03.240]  I spent in Chungam, in a place called Chungam. And my father used to work in this hospital\n",
      "[06:03.240 --> 06:08.680]  called Devamada Hospital in Kottayam, in Devamada Kuthattukulam. And he used to visit us maybe\n",
      "[06:08.680 --> 06:14.360]  twice a week. He used to stay there and work there. And a lot of my childhood was actually\n",
      "[06:14.360 --> 06:20.000]  seeing my father's work, the doctors that come to our houses. I mean, he never used\n",
      "[06:20.000 --> 06:24.680]  to bring his work home. That was something my father did. But he was always very passionate.\n",
      "[06:24.680 --> 06:29.840]  So a lot of my childhood was actually with my siblings. You know, we had a very good\n",
      "[06:29.840 --> 06:34.960]  time. It was those times where, you know, sip ups were the greatest thing. I mean, you\n",
      "[06:34.960 --> 06:41.840]  have these frozen orange drinks and you suck it out of that. You know, it's not a sip up\n",
      "[06:41.840 --> 06:46.360]  during those times. I think it's obsolete now. You don't get it. It's extinct now. So\n",
      "[06:46.360 --> 06:51.480]  those are our little joys. So I was born in Kottayam. And then we moved to Cochin in 1992\n",
      "[06:51.480 --> 06:56.640]  when my dad joined this hospital called as PVS Hospital. And further from there onwards,\n",
      "[06:56.640 --> 07:03.840]  we've been in Cochin. And since 92, I've joined, I did my schooling in this place called Chinmaya\n",
      "[07:03.840 --> 07:08.640]  Vidyalaya. So I've done my school, schooling everything in a Hindu school where we used,\n",
      "[07:08.640 --> 07:14.320]  we had to learn Sanskrit and, you know, we used to do the Vishnu Sahasranama every Thursday.\n",
      "[07:14.320 --> 07:22.240]  And my schooling till 12th was there. Fantastic place. I just loved it. And post 12th, I actually\n",
      "[07:22.240 --> 07:27.480]  tried for medicine because my brother directly jumped into computer engineering and he left\n",
      "[07:27.480 --> 07:33.760]  the country and he's now currently settled in the US. His name is Augustine. My sister\n",
      "[07:33.760 --> 07:38.760]  became an artist. So after her master's in art, she moved to the US and now she's in\n",
      "[07:38.760 --> 07:45.000]  LA and she runs an independent art installation services there. And my younger sister, she\n",
      "[07:45.000 --> 07:49.400]  became a musician and left the country. So I was the, I was the medicine or engineering\n",
      "[07:49.400 --> 07:56.960]  scapegoat who was in, who stayed back. So then I tried getting into MBBS after my 12th,\n",
      "[07:56.960 --> 08:01.200]  but I did not get through. A lot of my classmates got through, which was devastating for me\n",
      "[08:01.200 --> 08:05.760]  because we all went to the same coaching center. So at that time there was, there were no major\n",
      "[08:05.760 --> 08:09.800]  coaching centers like we have now. We have Cerebellum, Prapaladar, Marrow, a lot of stuff\n",
      "[08:09.800 --> 08:14.680]  happening now. But at that time we just had one place called as P.C. Thomas coaching classes\n",
      "[08:14.680 --> 08:20.160]  in Thrissur, another town in another city in Kerala. And we used to go there every Sunday,\n",
      "[08:20.160 --> 08:25.200]  attend the classes and come back. And unfortunately I did not get through the first time. I think\n",
      "[08:25.200 --> 08:29.880]  I did not study well. I was not, I was not very serious about studies at that time. And,\n",
      "[08:29.880 --> 08:34.640]  but then when I saw that my friends actually went into the next phase in their life and\n",
      "[08:34.640 --> 08:40.400]  I was still stuck there, I joined P.C. Thomas coaching classes as a full-time student. And\n",
      "[08:40.400 --> 08:46.360]  I studied for about a year there, staying in their hostel. That hostel was like a military\n",
      "[08:46.360 --> 08:50.520]  hostel. And I think it actually helped me realize, you know, the importance of discipline\n",
      "[08:50.520 --> 08:56.560]  in life. So that is where I actually started spending time reading. And through that, I\n",
      "[08:56.560 --> 09:01.280]  got through after two years of attempts, I got through for MBBS at St. John's Medical\n",
      "[09:01.280 --> 09:08.560]  College in Bangalore. And I completed my MBBS in 2007 from St. John's. And again, it's again,\n",
      "[09:08.560 --> 09:12.640]  I mean, the whole aspect of Indian medicine is, I mean, Indian medical system is to, you\n",
      "[09:12.640 --> 09:16.800]  know, you have to keep studying, keep studying because you're not going to go do well with\n",
      "[09:16.800 --> 09:22.480]  a basic degree. So the next was to go for MD in internal medicine, because I never liked\n",
      "[09:22.480 --> 09:27.760]  surgery. I can't stand the sight of blood and I cannot stand for long hours and do work.\n",
      "[09:27.760 --> 09:33.400]  So I was going to go for medical field, not a surgical field. So I again, and it's all\n",
      "[09:33.400 --> 09:37.840]  about again, sitting and attempting, you know, again, a competitive examination, like what\n",
      "[09:37.840 --> 09:43.920]  we have neat now, we had AIPGMT at that time, All India Postgraduate Entrance Test. And\n",
      "[09:43.920 --> 09:49.480]  I gave it, did not get through the first time, gave a second time, did not get through. And\n",
      "[09:49.480 --> 09:54.680]  ultimately, I think on my third attempt, I got through in general medicine at Nirlathan\n",
      "[09:54.680 --> 10:00.120]  Sarkar Medical College through a government merit. And I started my MD in general medicine\n",
      "[10:00.120 --> 10:05.600]  there. So I did three years in Calcutta. And after three years, it's again, you know, you\n",
      "[10:05.600 --> 10:10.120]  have to do something super specialization, you're not going to do really well in your\n",
      "[10:10.120 --> 10:15.440]  life with just a MBBS or an MD degree. So then I was totally lost. I did not know what\n",
      "[10:15.440 --> 10:22.840]  to do. So I mean, my dad was, he's a gastroenterologist. So he, I mean, he is very important for me,\n",
      "[10:22.840 --> 10:30.160]  because what he tells me through my, I mean, at each and every important phase of my life\n",
      "[10:30.160 --> 10:36.600]  where I wanted to make a decision, I think his words actually was the most important.\n",
      "[10:36.600 --> 10:40.960]  So he actually told me to, you know, if you get into a government medical college, take\n",
      "[10:40.960 --> 10:46.880]  it. So that is how I ended up in Calcutta. And I think Calcutta was the most important\n",
      "[10:46.880 --> 10:53.160]  phase of my life. That is where I actually understood what diseases can do to families\n",
      "[10:53.160 --> 11:01.000]  and what poverty is and how it is to work with minimal or no resources for people. And\n",
      "[11:01.000 --> 11:06.400]  that is where I understood that it's not just medicine or prescriptions, but a kind word,\n",
      "[11:06.400 --> 11:13.320]  a good deed, a pat on the shoulder, a hug, all these matter for patients and the family.\n",
      "[11:13.320 --> 11:17.640]  And that actually changed everything. And my professors were so, I mean, I think they\n",
      "[11:17.640 --> 11:22.000]  are like a dying breed. You don't get professors and teachers like that anymore. They never\n",
      "[11:22.000 --> 11:27.240]  let us do any unnecessary investigations or tests. In my three years in Calcutta, only\n",
      "[11:27.240 --> 11:33.440]  thing I think I've probably done about three or four MRI of the brain. That's it. Otherwise,\n",
      "[11:33.440 --> 11:37.240]  it's just clinical examination and identifying where exactly the problem is in the brain.\n",
      "[11:37.240 --> 11:42.200]  And that is how they teach you. So all of this happened in Calcutta. And when my dad,\n",
      "[11:42.200 --> 11:47.000]  I mean, I was very, very happy that, I mean, it was very difficult for me to actually cope\n",
      "[11:47.000 --> 11:52.920]  with the life in Calcutta initially, because when I did my MBBS, it was all very nice because\n",
      "[11:52.920 --> 11:57.320]  St. John's Medical College is very cool, very beautiful campus and things are so nice there\n",
      "[11:57.320 --> 12:01.680]  for students. So when I went into a government medical college, initially, I mean, we were\n",
      "[12:01.680 --> 12:07.360]  like four of us in a room along with rats and cats and everything around. And it was\n",
      "[12:07.360 --> 12:11.880]  so difficult for me, but then I had to adjust to it. And when I adjusted to it, I understood\n",
      "[12:11.880 --> 12:17.120]  that, you know, these things are not at all important, your work and your, your profession,\n",
      "[12:17.120 --> 12:24.120]  your career, the way you think and help people out in need is more important. So all of that\n",
      "[12:24.120 --> 12:30.320]  actually, you know, came to a very nice climax. It was not an anti-climax in Calcutta. So\n",
      "[12:30.320 --> 12:36.280]  after that, when I was thinking of doing my DM, that is a super speciality in gastroenterology,\n",
      "[12:36.280 --> 12:40.000]  my dad told me, you know, please don't do gastroenterology. But I said, you know, you\n",
      "[12:40.000 --> 12:44.600]  are a gastroenterologist. It's like, you know, you have to be a gastroenterologist. So he\n",
      "[12:44.600 --> 12:48.840]  said, no, absolutely not. Because gastroenterology is now going to get very soon going to get\n",
      "[12:48.840 --> 12:53.040]  saturated like cardiology is because now everybody is going to split out into cardiology. Like\n",
      "[12:53.040 --> 12:58.440]  there is some, there are super specialities inside cardiology now. Like you have people\n",
      "[12:58.440 --> 13:03.560]  taking care of only arrhythmias and rate problems, heart and rhythm problems, people looking\n",
      "[13:03.560 --> 13:07.840]  into surgeries, people who are only into intervention and things like that. So he said that gastroenterology\n",
      "[13:07.840 --> 13:14.240]  is going to get saturated. So please go for hepatology. So after my MD, what happened\n",
      "[13:14.240 --> 13:18.720]  was that, I mean, I mean, just before my MD, I mean, just after my MBBS, well, I was just\n",
      "[13:18.720 --> 13:23.280]  loafing around, not getting in anywhere. My dad actually sent me to Delhi and he said\n",
      "[13:23.280 --> 13:29.040]  there is this person called Professor Shiv Sarin at GB Panth Hospital. He is one of the\n",
      "[13:29.040 --> 13:33.120]  top guys in gastroenterology and hepatology. Actually, he is actually one of the pillars\n",
      "[13:33.120 --> 13:37.640]  of hepatology in the country. Please go and be with him, talk to him and work under him\n",
      "[13:37.640 --> 13:42.960]  and see how you like hepatology. So I went there as a junior research fellow. So, I mean,\n",
      "[13:42.960 --> 13:48.720]  very, very charismatic man. He took me in and he made me a JRF, a junior research fellow\n",
      "[13:48.720 --> 13:55.400]  and I started working under him in basic sciences. So there was no clinical exposure at all.\n",
      "[13:55.400 --> 13:59.760]  But what happened was that because it was all basic sciences and I was never, never\n",
      "[13:59.760 --> 14:04.520]  interested in basic sciences. I used to actually hate basic sciences subjects in my MBBS and\n",
      "[14:04.520 --> 14:10.960]  during preparation for my MD, I actually went into depression there. So I was staying alone\n",
      "[14:10.960 --> 14:17.280]  in some place in Karol Bagh and I was alone at the, this room was very close to the terrace,\n",
      "[14:17.280 --> 14:22.560]  attached to the terrace and when it rains, my room used to get flooded and I had to keep\n",
      "[14:22.560 --> 14:27.240]  cleaning my room. And I did that for about three months and I got very depressed. I stopped\n",
      "[14:27.240 --> 14:33.400]  eating and that was the first time I actually understood what depression was because I did\n",
      "[14:33.400 --> 14:38.600]  not want to go to GBPAN. I did not want to work there. I just hated the whole thing.\n",
      "[14:38.600 --> 14:43.720]  But I said, you know, but my dad said, you know, if, if you actually go and start taking\n",
      "[14:43.720 --> 14:47.840]  interest in what Professor Serene was going to teach you, maybe you will find something\n",
      "[14:47.840 --> 14:53.000]  good out of it. So I tried for another month, but then I was really losing it. So one day\n",
      "[14:53.000 --> 14:58.120]  I told my dad and mom, you know, I think I'm really going into depression. I don't, I can't\n",
      "[14:58.120 --> 15:04.320]  actually get myself up out of the bed to go out in the morning. And I started taking sedatives\n",
      "[15:04.320 --> 15:09.000]  myself to go to sleep and things like that, because it was really tough for me. So he,\n",
      "[15:09.000 --> 15:14.760]  my dad came there and the moment I said that I'm not getting things in the right sense,\n",
      "[15:14.760 --> 15:21.640]  he came there the next day. He took me, got a flight and took me back to Cochin. And then\n",
      "[15:21.640 --> 15:25.960]  he said, okay, you do something. Joined for coaching in, you know, in Thrissur, there\n",
      "[15:25.960 --> 15:30.760]  is this Thrissur medical college, alumni association. They do a coaching for post-graduates like\n",
      "[15:30.760 --> 15:36.680]  for, for MD exams. So I joined there and very, I mean, surprisingly, and I was very happy\n",
      "[15:36.680 --> 15:41.080]  that one of my colleagues, my batch mates from MBBS actually was also coming there.\n",
      "[15:41.080 --> 15:47.560]  So we both got a room and we started studying together and I spent about nine to 11 months\n",
      "[15:47.560 --> 15:51.760]  there in Thrissur. I mean, the first time I spent was at PC Thomas for MBBS. And again,\n",
      "[15:51.760 --> 15:56.440]  I went back to Thrissur to study for my MD also. And I spent about 11 months there and\n",
      "[15:56.440 --> 16:00.760]  both of us wrote the exam. And that is when I cracked the exam and got into Calcutta,\n",
      "[16:00.760 --> 16:06.840]  near the Sarkar Medical College. Now the best part is when I left Delhi, as a research fellow,\n",
      "[16:06.840 --> 16:11.400]  I told my sir, I don't think this is for me. I want to do, I want to be a clinical doctor\n",
      "[16:11.400 --> 16:18.000]  and not get stuck in basic sciences. Sir told me, you know, I want you to come back to me\n",
      "[16:18.000 --> 16:23.800]  because it's the whole aspect of gastroenterology and hepatology is not about just clinical\n",
      "[16:23.800 --> 16:28.640]  practice or skill. If you know, and if you love basic sciences, then you can actually\n",
      "[16:28.640 --> 16:32.320]  make a difference for your patients. He just told me that. And I said, I'm always here.\n",
      "[16:32.320 --> 16:38.280]  If you want to do this, please come back to me. So after the MD exams got over and I was\n",
      "[16:38.280 --> 16:43.120]  looking at taking up gastroenterology and my dad said, you know, no, you take up hepatology.\n",
      "[16:43.120 --> 16:48.120]  And he said, you know, Professor Sareen has now moved out of GB Panth and he started this\n",
      "[16:48.120 --> 16:51.760]  new, he became the director and started under the government, a new institute known as Institute\n",
      "[16:51.760 --> 16:57.440]  of Liver and Biliary Sciences, ILBS at Vasant Kunj in Delhi. So he said they have a DM hepatology\n",
      "[16:57.440 --> 17:03.880]  program now and go, go there and be with him and see what he, what he has for you. So I\n",
      "[17:03.880 --> 17:10.200]  went to ILBS and I again met with Professor Sareen. So he said, see, paths have come again\n",
      "[17:10.200 --> 17:14.120]  and across again. So what, what I did was that I joined as a senior resident there that\n",
      "[17:14.120 --> 17:19.360]  is post MD, you are a non-academic resident. You actually work like in a salaried position,\n",
      "[17:19.360 --> 17:23.520]  but you're not part of the academic program yet. And I worked there for a whole year and\n",
      "[17:23.520 --> 17:28.720]  I just fell in love with hepatology because the stuff that they were doing there was something\n",
      "[17:28.720 --> 17:35.360]  so different from what I have been seeing in MBBS or MD. The kind of research work,\n",
      "[17:35.360 --> 17:41.240]  the kind of work that actually changes perspectives in patient management, cutting edge work was\n",
      "[17:41.240 --> 17:47.200]  being done there. Small animal experiments, cellular tissue based experiments, pure clinical\n",
      "[17:47.200 --> 17:52.080]  research experiments. I mean, this was like a completely different form of clinical medicine\n",
      "[17:52.080 --> 17:57.480]  that I have experienced. And then, and there I decided, you know, hepatology is the place\n",
      "[17:57.480 --> 18:03.480]  because hepatology is one of the most extreme forms of internal medicine. If you take general\n",
      "[18:03.480 --> 18:07.720]  medicine, hepatology is the most extreme format because you have to know about every system\n",
      "[18:07.720 --> 18:13.120]  to actually practice hepatology. And what I did was I, at that time gave them, I mean,\n",
      "[18:13.120 --> 18:16.720]  they have an entrance exam. So I gave the entrance exam for the, for ILBS Institute.\n",
      "[18:16.720 --> 18:20.840]  And also I gave entrance exam for All India Institute, AIIMS. That I had to give because\n",
      "[18:20.840 --> 18:24.720]  everybody's giving it. You know, it's like you're, you know, you have to give AIIMS.\n",
      "[18:24.720 --> 18:29.040]  If you don't give AIIMS, that means you are not deserving. So I gave AIIMS just like that,\n",
      "[18:29.040 --> 18:34.840]  but I got into ILBS and then I did my DM, super speciality in ILBS. And I completed\n",
      "[18:34.840 --> 18:43.760]  that in 2016, 2015, 2016. And in 2016, I came back home and started working as a counselor\n",
      "[18:43.760 --> 18:51.600]  in hepatology in Cochin. So this is my journey from a small town in Kottayam and back to\n",
      "[18:51.600 --> 18:56.520]  Cochin, then to Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi, and back to Cochin.\n",
      "[18:56.520 --> 19:01.520]  It's such a fascinating story. And there are many things I want to double click on. I want\n",
      "[19:01.520 --> 19:05.920]  to sort of take you back in a sense to your childhood, but the theme that I want to ask\n",
      "[19:05.920 --> 19:13.040]  you on kind of plays across. I want to ask you about, as a doctor, where does one get\n",
      "[19:13.040 --> 19:19.200]  one's values from? And not just as a doctor, I think in any profession, we see that there\n",
      "[19:19.200 --> 19:23.120]  are people who are just going through the motion, there's a career for them, they have\n",
      "[19:23.120 --> 19:29.240]  ladders to rise up. And, you know, you can actually lose all engagement with what you\n",
      "[19:29.240 --> 19:33.760]  are really doing, which in your case is human beings, I guess, in a sense, and you can lose\n",
      "[19:33.760 --> 19:37.780]  that engagement and go through the motions and climb that path. But there are others\n",
      "[19:37.780 --> 19:42.160]  who have this deeper conviction that there is a greater meaning to what I am doing. And\n",
      "[19:42.160 --> 19:46.120]  you can see this in journalism, where most journalists might be going through the motions,\n",
      "[19:46.120 --> 19:50.560]  but a few will be no, it is a higher calling. Perhaps you can see it in the law, you can\n",
      "[19:50.560 --> 19:56.200]  definitely see it in medicine, you know. So we'll hear about how, for example, these days\n",
      "[19:56.200 --> 20:00.680]  the incentives are tailored in such a way that doctors are asking for test after test\n",
      "[20:00.680 --> 20:05.280]  after test, because, you know, they get more money and so on and so forth. But as you pointed\n",
      "[20:05.280 --> 20:11.720]  out in Calcutta, when you were learning that was discouraged. And what I see from, you\n",
      "[20:11.720 --> 20:16.320]  know, first time we've met, but from what I see from following you on Twitter and elsewhere,\n",
      "[20:16.320 --> 20:20.120]  is that there's a deep engagement with your work, you really care about the thing that\n",
      "[20:20.120 --> 20:26.040]  you're doing, right? So tell me a little bit about where you think this comes from, like\n",
      "[20:26.040 --> 20:30.280]  how much did your father have to do with this? Tell me a bit about your father, what, you\n",
      "[20:30.280 --> 20:35.040]  know, what kind of values that you grew up with just outside of the medical context also,\n",
      "[20:35.040 --> 20:36.040]  you know?\n",
      "[20:36.040 --> 20:42.840]  Yeah, I mean, I think we can have a whole episode on my dad. Yeah, so my dad, his name\n",
      "[20:42.840 --> 20:49.520]  is Philip Augustine. He is actually, I'm actually searching for words, you know, because he's\n",
      "[20:49.520 --> 20:54.800]  such a complex man, in the sense that, you know, he's dedicated his life completely to\n",
      "[20:54.800 --> 21:00.000]  medicine and people. And what I have actually seen him do is that I mean, I don't think\n",
      "[21:00.000 --> 21:05.200]  I can be like him ever, because he's he's him. And I cannot be like him. People actually\n",
      "[21:05.200 --> 21:10.120]  can't expect me to be like him also, because he's him. What happened? I mean, when I look\n",
      "[21:10.120 --> 21:15.180]  at him and his work, he's actually one of the first gastroenterologists in the country.\n",
      "[21:15.180 --> 21:18.920]  And actually one of the first gastroenterologists to actually went into interventional gastroenterology\n",
      "[21:18.920 --> 21:25.160]  doing endoscopies and procedures like endoscopies and procedures like ERCPs, first time in the\n",
      "[21:25.160 --> 21:31.560]  state doing very, very expert procedures like transjugular liver biopsies, that is where\n",
      "[21:31.560 --> 21:35.960]  you actually go through a vein, a vessel and go into the liver and take a tissue of the\n",
      "[21:35.960 --> 21:42.600]  liver and then come out through the same vessel out. So these kind of extreme liver biopsies,\n",
      "[21:42.600 --> 21:46.920]  extreme procedures, he was actually the first to do it in the state. And he's one of the\n",
      "[21:46.920 --> 21:53.520]  founding fathers of gastroenterology in the country. He's also a Padma award winner. And\n",
      "[21:53.520 --> 21:58.800]  all of that is because of the quality and the dedication that he has actually shown\n",
      "[21:58.800 --> 22:05.520]  to his work. So what I have seen him do is that he brings when I when I initially said\n",
      "[22:05.520 --> 22:11.440]  that he does not bring his work home, it's in the sense that he does not bring his burden\n",
      "[22:11.440 --> 22:16.960]  of work home. But he's always available for his patients at all times. I have actually\n",
      "[22:16.960 --> 22:23.360]  seen him pick up phone calls at 2am and 3am in between his sleep, and talking to patients,\n",
      "[22:23.360 --> 22:28.080]  patient families, bystanders and telling them what needs to be done. And he's always available\n",
      "[22:28.080 --> 22:35.120]  24 seven on that phone. When I if I do that now, make myself available 24 seven, I mean,\n",
      "[22:35.120 --> 22:39.560]  I think I just have to be in the hospital. I mean, I can't do that at home, because people\n",
      "[22:39.560 --> 22:44.480]  will keep calling me and you know, but for him, that's not a burden. He actually takes\n",
      "[22:44.480 --> 22:50.800]  it as a duty, something that he's bound to do and which he enjoys. And he I mean, I have\n",
      "[22:50.800 --> 22:55.720]  seen him always helping out he never says no to a phone call from a patient or or I\n",
      "[22:55.720 --> 23:00.800]  mean, I've actually seen him take calls and from total strangers and give them advice\n",
      "[23:00.800 --> 23:04.480]  on the phone saying that you know, you need to do this test and do that and then come\n",
      "[23:04.480 --> 23:09.040]  back to me and then we'll take a decision on it. You know, I see an unknown number,\n",
      "[23:09.040 --> 23:14.200]  I don't pick it up. I mean, that's that's a normal behavior, but not for him. Because\n",
      "[23:14.200 --> 23:18.800]  he feels that that number he has to pick up because they want some help or they are in\n",
      "[23:18.800 --> 23:24.360]  need and he has to do it. So that's that that's the kind of person my father is. So I think\n",
      "[23:24.360 --> 23:28.960]  that compassion part comes from him. Because deep inside, I've seen him help people and\n",
      "[23:28.960 --> 23:34.880]  how satisfied he is with his life. My dad has actually I mean, if you look at from the\n",
      "[23:34.880 --> 23:40.920]  point of my dad's story is actually quite bittersweet. He was actually a pure academician\n",
      "[23:40.920 --> 23:47.160]  at one point, had one of the best publications ever. At that time, it's it's not not so easy\n",
      "[23:47.160 --> 23:52.800]  like we do publications now here we just upload electronically. And then they send us revisions\n",
      "[23:52.800 --> 23:55.800]  and we do everything through the computer. But at the time there was no computer there\n",
      "[23:55.800 --> 24:00.200]  was everything was a typewriter. So he used to actually type everything all his publications\n",
      "[24:00.200 --> 24:04.200]  and then send it to the journal as a hard copy. Then after months, they correct and\n",
      "[24:04.200 --> 24:08.000]  send it back. Then again, he makes corrections and then sends it back. So publication used\n",
      "[24:08.000 --> 24:13.240]  to take months and months and months at that time. And it's all in type through the typewriters.\n",
      "[24:13.240 --> 24:18.240]  And he used to be dedicated in that. And what happened was that once he moved to Cochin\n",
      "[24:18.240 --> 24:22.720]  and he started and his practice actually started flourishing because he's a he's a people's\n",
      "[24:22.720 --> 24:29.400]  doctor and obviously other doctors don't actually refer to him much. The first time I've actually\n",
      "[24:29.400 --> 24:34.400]  seen that in my life is patients referring other patients. So his patients when they're\n",
      "[24:34.400 --> 24:37.840]  satisfied, they go back and they bring more patients for him. So that was a patient to\n",
      "[24:37.840 --> 24:42.320]  patient referral. And it was like, it was like that was a peak of his game at the time\n",
      "[24:42.320 --> 24:48.800]  when he used to see about 120 patients a day. He still does, by the way, without any complaints.\n",
      "[24:48.800 --> 24:53.800]  And what what happened was that at that point, he started talking thinking about entrepreneurship.\n",
      "[24:53.800 --> 24:59.680]  So he wanted to create an environment where health care was going to be affordable and\n",
      "[24:59.680 --> 25:04.920]  it was going to be lightning quick. So that is when he created this through a lot of I\n",
      "[25:04.920 --> 25:10.200]  mean, he actually went to a lot of places to a lot of people got a lot of people in\n",
      "[25:10.200 --> 25:16.160]  they funded. It was a public funded company and he made a Lakeshore Hospital. It was one\n",
      "[25:16.160 --> 25:20.440]  of the top. I mean, it's still it is still there. It was a top hospital in Cochin Lakeshore\n",
      "[25:20.440 --> 25:25.080]  Hospital Research Center Limited. And he was a director, a managing director of the hospital\n",
      "[25:25.080 --> 25:30.560]  for a very long time, more than 10-12 years. And it was flourishing like anything. So I\n",
      "[25:30.560 --> 25:36.280]  was actually doing my MBBS and MD at the time. And what happened was that when something\n",
      "[25:36.280 --> 25:44.120]  actually becomes really good and really big, somebody has to ruin it. So this company,\n",
      "[25:44.120 --> 25:50.680]  a conglomerate from the UAE came in, and they did a lot of work behind my dad, and they\n",
      "[25:50.680 --> 25:55.680]  actually got the hospital under them. And he was actually checked out of the position\n",
      "[25:55.680 --> 26:01.200]  of managing director, and somebody else was instilled above him. And they brought in that\n",
      "[26:01.200 --> 26:05.920]  old style corporate kind of work into the hospital where he was. I mean, during his\n",
      "[26:05.920 --> 26:10.280]  time that was unheard of the corporate kind of work in Lakeshore Hospital. But they came\n",
      "[26:10.280 --> 26:16.880]  in, they slowly moved him around. And this was like a coup, a complete coup. Without\n",
      "[26:16.880 --> 26:21.560]  his knowledge, all of these things happened. And this is just when I was finishing my DM.\n",
      "[26:21.560 --> 26:27.960]  And what happened was that that hospital was his baby. And he quit. He just quit. And what\n",
      "[26:27.960 --> 26:32.440]  he did was he was like a fish out of water then because that was his home and that was\n",
      "[26:32.440 --> 26:37.920]  his that was everything for him. I wanted to work more in Delhi with Professor Serene.\n",
      "[26:37.920 --> 26:42.520]  And I wanted to actually do some fellowships and training and get to do more of basic science\n",
      "[26:42.520 --> 26:47.240]  work and research fellowships in basic sciences out of the country, probably in the US or\n",
      "[26:47.240 --> 26:51.260]  Europe. So that was my plan. Because I was actually speaking at the moment from basic\n",
      "[26:51.260 --> 26:58.880]  sciences work at ILBS. At that time, my dad had to get out of Lakeshore. He had to quit.\n",
      "[26:58.880 --> 27:04.880]  And once he quit, he was alone. So I had to go back to him. So what he planned was he\n",
      "[27:04.880 --> 27:09.560]  was he made a company, a consultancy group known as Philip Augustine Associates. And\n",
      "[27:09.560 --> 27:14.080]  it was just the two of us, me and my dad. And my mom is also there. I mean, she's very\n",
      "[27:14.080 --> 27:19.960]  helpful with everything that we do and every decision my dad makes. I think my mom is the\n",
      "[27:19.960 --> 27:24.880]  silent person who actually tells him, yes, this is the right thing to do, not just my\n",
      "[27:24.880 --> 27:29.440]  dad. So it's both of them. And ultimately, we made this consultancy group. And I came\n",
      "[27:29.440 --> 27:34.600]  back and I asked him, what should we do now? Because we have nowhere to go. So initially\n",
      "[27:34.600 --> 27:39.400]  when he came to Cochin from Kottayam, he was working in this place called PVS hospital\n",
      "[27:39.400 --> 27:44.240]  that was also in Cochin. And he had asked them if they would like, I mean, they asked\n",
      "[27:44.240 --> 27:48.320]  him if he would come back to them because that hospital was doing very bad at the time\n",
      "[27:48.320 --> 27:53.200]  because once he left from there to Lakeshore, it was crumbling. So I mean, we had nowhere\n",
      "[27:53.200 --> 27:57.840]  else to go. He said, OK, we'll come there, but then you'll have to give us the chance\n",
      "[27:57.840 --> 28:02.760]  and opportunity like we were doing in Lakeshore and we'll get it done. But things did not\n",
      "[28:02.760 --> 28:08.560]  work out in PVS also. I also worked there. And that was the time when I actually faced\n",
      "[28:08.560 --> 28:14.400]  a lot of professional harassment in the sense that professional enmity. I mean, I never\n",
      "[28:14.400 --> 28:19.800]  knew doctors could become really bad to other doctors because what happened was that I was\n",
      "[28:19.800 --> 28:25.960]  a hepatologist. So I was the second hepatologist in the state. Before me, there was another\n",
      "[28:25.960 --> 28:32.640]  hepatologist who was trained from PJ Chandigarh and he was working in a hospital in Alua.\n",
      "[28:32.640 --> 28:36.320]  And but he was doing both gastroenterology and hepatology. But I was a core hepatologist.\n",
      "[28:36.320 --> 28:41.920]  I used to do only hepatology work and my work was actually well known also at the time before\n",
      "[28:41.920 --> 28:48.040]  I came down to Cochin. And once this happened, a lot of liver patients actually started coming\n",
      "[28:48.040 --> 28:53.200]  towards me and a lot of liver patients started getting out of the other gastroenterologists\n",
      "[28:53.200 --> 28:57.800]  who were working as liver specialists there. A lot of them did not like it. So they made\n",
      "[28:57.800 --> 29:04.240]  my life hell there. And ultimately, even that hospital, it was not not I mean, for us, it\n",
      "[29:04.240 --> 29:07.960]  was not a good environment to work with, even though they did everything for us. The management\n",
      "[29:07.960 --> 29:13.320]  was very considerate, but it was not going to be a long term thing. So we got out of\n",
      "[29:13.320 --> 29:21.080]  that place. And again, we were like, like fish out of water. And that is when this small\n",
      "[29:21.080 --> 29:26.200]  setup called Arunachala Medical Center, they said they wanted to improve on their activities.\n",
      "[29:26.200 --> 29:29.960]  So they wanted us, our consultancy group to completely take over gastroenterology and\n",
      "[29:29.960 --> 29:34.560]  hepatology work there. So a lot of the work that we did in the last four years, a lot\n",
      "[29:34.560 --> 29:38.640]  of my research work, clinical work, everything happened in Arunachala Medical Center. So\n",
      "[29:38.640 --> 29:42.800]  me and my dad, we went there and we started working there. And we worked there for about\n",
      "[29:42.800 --> 29:47.560]  three and a half to four years. And it became saturated because I was not able to do more\n",
      "[29:47.560 --> 29:52.560]  of my work. And dad wanted me to actually increase my output from a research point of\n",
      "[29:52.560 --> 29:56.960]  view. And that was not happening there. And that is when we moved to Rajagiri Hospital,\n",
      "[29:56.960 --> 30:04.080]  which we are in now currently. So coming back to that question, everything that I have done\n",
      "[30:04.080 --> 30:08.840]  is somewhere or the other related to what my dad has been directly telling me or indirectly\n",
      "[30:08.840 --> 30:17.400]  telling me. And that compassion, the reason why I developed a strong bonding with the\n",
      "[30:17.400 --> 30:26.360]  kind of, with my profession, that is hepatology, is because he has shown me that working for\n",
      "[30:26.360 --> 30:34.000]  patients and their families actually may not get me the money that my friends and all are\n",
      "[30:34.000 --> 30:39.520]  getting in other professions, but it actually helps me sleep well at night. It's very satisfying\n",
      "[30:39.520 --> 30:44.720]  to come back home when you do that kind of work. I mean, imagine you're helping out somebody\n",
      "[30:44.720 --> 30:49.600]  who's really in need. Even if you cannot help that patient, the patient might die. It's\n",
      "[30:49.600 --> 30:54.280]  not up to you. I mean, you are not, we are not gods to save everybody. People die. But\n",
      "[30:54.280 --> 31:00.280]  the process, the journey that the patient and the family is on, and if you can become\n",
      "[31:00.280 --> 31:06.360]  part of that journey, there is nothing more satisfying than that in the medical profession.\n",
      "[31:06.360 --> 31:11.840]  So medical profession is not about seeing 120-200 patients a day or doing 500 colonoscopies\n",
      "[31:11.840 --> 31:19.440]  and 300 endoscopies a day or, you know, getting a first car or, I mean, I still haven't bought\n",
      "[31:19.440 --> 31:24.200]  my first car. The car that I drive now is partly funded by my father-in-law and partly\n",
      "[31:24.200 --> 31:31.080]  by my father. I still can't buy myself a car, but I'm happy because I'm able to come back\n",
      "[31:31.080 --> 31:35.880]  home and have a peaceful sleep. I mean, I get maybe four hours of sleep only per day,\n",
      "[31:35.880 --> 31:42.600]  but it's good sleep. So that kind of compassionate work actually gave me that important aspect\n",
      "[31:42.600 --> 31:48.800]  in life that when you are in a profession, the core values of that profession is what\n",
      "[31:48.800 --> 31:54.400]  drives you. It's nothing else. That is why I don't lose focus. And my dad has actually\n",
      "[31:54.400 --> 32:01.080]  shown me, even my dad, he is very well to do after 65 years of age, I think. You know,\n",
      "[32:01.080 --> 32:05.920]  he actually became comfortable in life, monetarily also, I think, beyond 65 years of age. But\n",
      "[32:05.920 --> 32:10.400]  he was always a happy man. And that is purely because of the kind of work that he was doing\n",
      "[32:10.400 --> 32:14.960]  and he was satisfied with that kind of work. And that actually is what fuels me also to\n",
      "[32:14.960 --> 32:22.000]  do, to actually commit myself to in-depth, that compassion and care that I want to show\n",
      "[32:22.000 --> 32:28.600]  towards my patients and family. So yes, my dad's story and his work definitely has helped.\n",
      "[32:28.600 --> 32:33.320]  My professors who has taught me in my master's degree has definitely helped. And definitely\n",
      "[32:33.320 --> 32:40.000]  my main teacher is, my mentor is Professor Shiv Sarin. And his approach to patient care\n",
      "[32:40.000 --> 32:48.100]  is, I mean, it's something so different, where he actually puts in, applies new thoughts\n",
      "[32:48.100 --> 32:54.040]  and new research opportunities to make things better. So he was like, you know, you, you\n",
      "[32:54.040 --> 32:58.440]  are doing something, you're following guidelines. You have an option to follow the guidelines.\n",
      "[32:58.440 --> 33:03.280]  Or you have an option to change the guidelines for the better. So changing the guidelines\n",
      "[33:03.280 --> 33:07.360]  for the better is more satisfactory. So that is why we do a lot of, that is how I fell\n",
      "[33:07.360 --> 33:11.760]  in love with clinical research also. And falling in love with clinical research is actually\n",
      "[33:11.760 --> 33:17.560]  one of the most important aspects of compassionate care for the patient. Because you do, you\n",
      "[33:17.560 --> 33:21.920]  think out of the box for the patient and family, not for yourself, for your work. So when you\n",
      "[33:21.920 --> 33:25.480]  say clinical research, people say that, what is there in clinical research? But I think\n",
      "[33:25.480 --> 33:31.080]  clinical research is one of the most compassionate and core aspects of medical science.\n",
      "[33:31.080 --> 33:36.240]  Fascinating. Lots I want to double click on. But before you know, we go further, tell me\n",
      "[33:36.240 --> 33:39.560]  and my listeners, what is hepatology precisely? Like,\n",
      "[33:39.560 --> 33:45.680]  Yes, okay. Hepatology is basically study and management of diseases associated with the\n",
      "[33:45.680 --> 33:51.480]  liver. So you have the liver, you have everything to do around the liver. So for example, you\n",
      "[33:51.480 --> 33:56.200]  have the gallbladder, you have the bile ducts inside the liver that makes bile and the gallbladder\n",
      "[33:56.200 --> 34:01.320]  stores it. Then when you eat food, the gallbladder propels the bile into the small intestine\n",
      "[34:01.320 --> 34:05.200]  and that's how digestion happens. So anything to do with the biliary system, that is the\n",
      "[34:05.200 --> 34:10.240]  gallbladder and bile ducts and everything, plus the liver as an organ is what hepatology\n",
      "[34:10.240 --> 34:15.560]  is all about. And it's just one organ. My brother used to say, why are you so stressed\n",
      "[34:15.560 --> 34:19.600]  out in your life? It's just one organ. You have so many other organs. I tell him that\n",
      "[34:19.600 --> 34:24.920]  this is the most complicated of all organs. The largest organ in the body is skin. But\n",
      "[34:24.920 --> 34:28.440]  and the second largest solid organ, I mean, the largest solid organ could be is definitely\n",
      "[34:28.440 --> 34:34.320]  the liver. And it's such a complex organ and has to do with everything. So your immunity,\n",
      "[34:34.320 --> 34:38.920]  the proteins that you make in your body, the hormones that you metabolize, the hormones\n",
      "[34:38.920 --> 34:44.200]  that you convert in your body, you know, your digestion, your metabolic, everything happens\n",
      "[34:44.200 --> 34:48.520]  inside. I mean, everything is controlled by the liver. You definitely need a beating heart\n",
      "[34:48.520 --> 34:54.760]  to survive. But ultimately, what what keeps you going is the liver. So this is what hepatology\n",
      "[34:54.760 --> 35:00.240]  is all about. And hepatology is also an additional point is that there is something more to it\n",
      "[35:00.240 --> 35:04.880]  than from gastroenterology point of view and that is transplantation. So you have transplant\n",
      "[35:04.880 --> 35:08.720]  medicine also coming in other than directly management of patients with liver disease.\n",
      "[35:08.720 --> 35:14.720]  So there is transplant medicine, post transplantation also in as part of core practice in hepatology.\n",
      "[35:14.720 --> 35:18.840]  So you know, let's go back to values and continue down that road. One of the things you mentioned\n",
      "[35:18.840 --> 35:23.600]  about Calcutta is how you were kind of one living four to a room as far as your personal\n",
      "[35:23.600 --> 35:27.880]  circumstances were concerned, the facilities given to you and two, you spoke about how\n",
      "[35:27.880 --> 35:34.280]  people were so desperately poor and you came face to face with poverty and all of that.\n",
      "[35:34.280 --> 35:40.680]  And you know, what part did that play in, you know, developing sort of empathy in you?\n",
      "[35:40.680 --> 35:46.520]  And the other broader question there is that I think a danger for all people, not just\n",
      "[35:46.520 --> 35:51.400]  doctors, is that you tend to forget other people are people in the sense that you are\n",
      "[35:51.400 --> 35:56.520]  the chief character in a play inside your head. Everybody else is a prop for your amusement.\n",
      "[35:56.520 --> 36:02.280]  Everybody everything else is instrumental, right? And you have to keep reminding yourself\n",
      "[36:02.280 --> 36:06.560]  that other people are people too and to relate to them as human beings and all of that. And\n",
      "[36:06.560 --> 36:11.760]  I think we often fall into a default mode where, you know, people are instrumental.\n",
      "[36:11.760 --> 36:17.320]  And I would imagine that for a doctor, this is even a greater danger because you're always\n",
      "[36:17.320 --> 36:23.240]  thinking of the body and the organ and the processes and your inner sense, you're dehumanizing\n",
      "[36:23.240 --> 36:28.840]  all of those and, you know, those become things that you study. And you know, when a patient\n",
      "[36:28.840 --> 36:34.000]  is with you, it could be tempting that that patient becomes a sum of their charts and\n",
      "[36:34.000 --> 36:38.680]  their ailments and whatever is happening inside their body. But there is a person there who\n",
      "[36:38.680 --> 36:43.720]  might be anxious, who might be terrified, who might be perhaps even reacting with aggression\n",
      "[36:43.720 --> 36:47.880]  towards you simply because they're confused and they don't know how to navigate this shit.\n",
      "[36:47.880 --> 36:52.720]  So and you mentioned that Calcutta was important for you for your kind of coming to terms with\n",
      "[36:52.720 --> 36:56.880]  all of that. So take me a little bit through your journey, thinking about these things\n",
      "[36:56.880 --> 37:00.520]  and sort of avoiding those traps in yourself, as it were.\n",
      "[37:00.520 --> 37:06.720]  I think this part is, I think, most important when it comes to me as a doctor and taking\n",
      "[37:06.720 --> 37:13.560]  responsibility for my patients and their family. In Calcutta, what happened was that, I mean,\n",
      "[37:13.560 --> 37:17.040]  it was general medicine. So we used to get all kinds of cases there from snake bites\n",
      "[37:17.040 --> 37:21.440]  to, you know, uncontrolled diabetes, infections, I mean, strokes, anything you say, anything\n",
      "[37:21.440 --> 37:26.400]  you can actually think of. All the old world diseases also we have seen, the rabies, tetanus,\n",
      "[37:26.400 --> 37:33.920]  you name it. And what was striking was that there was this particular patient who came\n",
      "[37:33.920 --> 37:40.600]  with uncontrolled diabetes. And when you have, I so clearly remember this, when you have\n",
      "[37:40.600 --> 37:44.680]  very high levels of sugar, glucose in your body, you go into a particular condition known\n",
      "[37:44.680 --> 37:51.040]  as diabetic ketoacidosis, which is life threatening. And that is usually associated with an infection.\n",
      "[37:51.040 --> 37:55.080]  So you have very high amounts of sugar in your body that gets converted to ketones and\n",
      "[37:55.080 --> 38:00.280]  that ketones start harming you and you start having organ failures. So you have to treat\n",
      "[38:00.280 --> 38:05.800]  that quickly with insulin, bring down the sugars and make sure that patient does not\n",
      "[38:05.800 --> 38:11.720]  go into organ failures. At one point, we did not have, I mean, at one point patients were\n",
      "[38:11.720 --> 38:18.440]  so poor, the patients with diabetic ketoacidosis that I actually admitted in the night, that\n",
      "[38:18.440 --> 38:24.720]  patient was so poor that they could not afford, I mean, they could not even afford a simple\n",
      "[38:24.720 --> 38:30.120]  gas medicine. You know, I mean, there are some medicines which are not in stock in government\n",
      "[38:30.120 --> 38:35.000]  hospitals and you ask these people to actually go and buy it. Unfortunately, on that day,\n",
      "[38:35.000 --> 38:39.960]  we did not have insulin in the hospital and we asked them to buy a vial of insulin from\n",
      "[38:39.960 --> 38:43.560]  outside. They did not have money for that. And without insulin, this man was going to\n",
      "[38:43.560 --> 38:49.960]  die. And it's not easy to be in that situation because you know that without that particular\n",
      "[38:49.960 --> 38:55.400]  drug, that patient is going to die. And there was no other means for us to, you know, get\n",
      "[38:55.400 --> 39:00.120]  insulin for them because it's a government setup. And so what we do is we hydrate these\n",
      "[39:00.120 --> 39:04.920]  patients immensely, bring down the ketosis with good fluid therapy and things like that.\n",
      "[39:04.920 --> 39:09.160]  But at one point, you know that this patient is going to die without insulin. So I still\n",
      "[39:09.160 --> 39:14.520]  remember me running around the female general ward, male general wards, the chronic wards\n",
      "[39:14.520 --> 39:19.040]  and we have chronic and acute wards there, looking at other people who would share their\n",
      "[39:19.040 --> 39:23.840]  insulin. And at some point, I actually got a little bit of insulin for us to use for\n",
      "[39:23.840 --> 39:30.480]  this patient. And ultimately, we gave him insulin. He was there. The ICUs were full.\n",
      "[39:30.480 --> 39:35.680]  So we managed him in the ward. And a couple of days later, he died. And we did everything\n",
      "[39:35.680 --> 39:40.200]  that we could. They did everything they could. But so poor, they could not even afford basic\n",
      "[39:40.200 --> 39:45.920]  medicines. But we did keep him alive for two days with just the minimal resources that\n",
      "[39:45.920 --> 39:54.000]  we had. At one point, I was, I was actually angry at them. Because I was like, why don't\n",
      "[39:54.000 --> 39:58.920]  they have money? You know, they should find money. If they don't have money, they should\n",
      "[39:58.920 --> 40:05.000]  find money. People do that all the time. You find, you find stuff. Then I realized that,\n",
      "[40:05.000 --> 40:10.680]  you know, they, they don't have that luxury to even find money, no help, nothing. There\n",
      "[40:10.680 --> 40:16.040]  are, there are people like that. And the best that you could do for them is to tell them\n",
      "[40:16.040 --> 40:20.960]  that, you know, you have, you are doing everything that you can for this patient. No stones are\n",
      "[40:20.960 --> 40:25.000]  left unturned. You have come to the right place. We are the right people. And we are\n",
      "[40:25.000 --> 40:30.600]  also helping you, supporting you. That becomes, that's like a closure for them. Because it's\n",
      "[40:30.600 --> 40:36.120]  not like they have not done anything for the patient. And when I spoke to them about this\n",
      "[40:36.120 --> 40:41.880]  part, when that, when that man died, and I can actually see, they were from a Muslim\n",
      "[40:41.880 --> 40:46.600]  community and they were actually from Murshidabad. I spoke to them and I told the son that, you\n",
      "[40:46.600 --> 40:51.720]  know, you have done everything that you could and we did everything we could. He was actually\n",
      "[40:51.720 --> 40:58.580]  happy to hear it from me. You know, even though it ended with his father dying, he was actually\n",
      "[40:58.580 --> 41:04.600]  happy that, you know, they did something that everybody is supposed to do. They did not\n",
      "[41:04.600 --> 41:08.840]  do anything that is off charts. It's not like it's not their fault. So I told them, it's\n",
      "[41:08.840 --> 41:13.040]  not your fault. So that is when I understood that, you know, money plays such an important\n",
      "[41:13.040 --> 41:18.600]  part in India, in management of patients. Those who have money, they can go to any extent,\n",
      "[41:18.600 --> 41:24.800]  but those who don't have money, they cannot afford to save somebody in the family. So\n",
      "[41:24.800 --> 41:28.760]  I took the, I mean, and that's just not one episode, multiple episodes like that happened\n",
      "[41:28.760 --> 41:34.240]  throughout my studies in MD. And when I actually came back and started working in, I mean,\n",
      "[41:34.240 --> 41:38.680]  and I saw, I mean, in Delhi, it was a different scenario because a lot of people who used\n",
      "[41:38.680 --> 41:43.440]  to come there were affluent. They could afford, very few who could not. And Delhi has a very\n",
      "[41:43.440 --> 41:47.960]  good policy where the below poverty line patients used to get free treatment and free transplant.\n",
      "[41:47.960 --> 41:52.560]  So things were okay. There was a machinery moving around and things were fine. But when\n",
      "[41:52.560 --> 41:57.280]  I came back here and I'm working in a private setup, a lot of these people, patients don't\n",
      "[41:57.280 --> 42:03.400]  have any medical claim or insurance and they have to pay out of pocket. What I did initially\n",
      "[42:03.400 --> 42:08.640]  was that the first patient I sent for a liver transplant was a young man. He was an alcoholic.\n",
      "[42:08.640 --> 42:13.080]  No, we don't call them as alcoholic. It's alcohol associated or alcohol misuse because\n",
      "[42:13.080 --> 42:17.920]  it's stigma associated with it. So he was actually an alcohol associated liver disease\n",
      "[42:17.920 --> 42:21.840]  patient and with deep jaundice. And he was actually going to die within a few months\n",
      "[42:21.840 --> 42:26.840]  if they did not get a new liver. I did not bother asking the family about their deep\n",
      "[42:26.840 --> 42:31.920]  into their financial status. I just told the wife, she had two small children. I mean,\n",
      "[42:31.920 --> 42:34.680]  they had two small children and I told them that, you know, without a transplant, he's\n",
      "[42:34.680 --> 42:40.320]  going to die for them. That's that that is the point that strikes, you know, you need\n",
      "[42:40.320 --> 42:45.760]  a transplant. Only a transplant can save that man. And I did not know how this was done.\n",
      "[42:45.760 --> 42:52.360]  But what happened was that they actually had no money at all. So they took a bank loan\n",
      "[42:52.360 --> 42:57.240]  and there was a little bit of land that they had. This man had saved up and they actually\n",
      "[42:57.240 --> 43:04.040]  put that land as mortgage for the bank, for the loan. And they did the transplant and\n",
      "[43:04.040 --> 43:08.440]  the transplant. And he was so sick during the transplant because they took a long time\n",
      "[43:08.440 --> 43:12.840]  to get that money, everything done. And by the time this patient was so sick and ideally,\n",
      "[43:12.840 --> 43:18.320]  I told them that, you know, this time that we decided to do a transplant earlier and\n",
      "[43:18.320 --> 43:21.840]  the time for transplant now, that's a lot of difference. You know, the benefits are\n",
      "[43:21.840 --> 43:26.200]  going to come going to be less. But they said, so we tried so much. We have come this far.\n",
      "[43:26.200 --> 43:29.720]  We want to do the transplant. So they did the transplant. It was somewhere around 18\n",
      "[43:29.720 --> 43:34.760]  to 19 lakhs at the time. And he was doing fine for the first one week. From second week\n",
      "[43:34.760 --> 43:39.520]  onwards, he started getting infections because he was already having so many infections before\n",
      "[43:39.520 --> 43:44.200]  transplant. That is a very high risk factor for infections after transplant. And the infections\n",
      "[43:44.200 --> 43:48.560]  that he actually got after transplants were quite bad because you actually see a lot of\n",
      "[43:48.560 --> 43:54.800]  weird and strange organisms infecting an immunosuppressed individual. And it was fungus infection and\n",
      "[43:54.800 --> 44:01.240]  he died. And post-transplant for us to actually keep him alive for about a couple of weeks,\n",
      "[44:01.240 --> 44:06.440]  they had to spend another four to five lakhs. And by the time everything was done, he died.\n",
      "[44:06.440 --> 44:12.440]  They took his body and a couple of weeks or maybe three weeks later, one of the neighbors\n",
      "[44:12.440 --> 44:16.720]  came back for some documents from me. So I said, how are they doing? How's the wife and\n",
      "[44:16.720 --> 44:23.400]  kids doing? They said, sir, the whole family is now completely in a mess because they borrowed\n",
      "[44:23.400 --> 44:29.640]  so much of money. And this patient died and they actually overshot the bank loan. They\n",
      "[44:29.640 --> 44:34.080]  lost the land. And that land was actually the only thing the father had kept for the\n",
      "[44:34.080 --> 44:40.720]  two female, I mean, the girl, the girl children. It's all lost there. And I think, I mean,\n",
      "[44:40.720 --> 44:45.600]  he told me that, you know, they actually moved to their parents or grandparents someplace\n",
      "[44:45.600 --> 44:50.120]  and they're trying to make ends meet there. And this was like a shocker to me because\n",
      "[44:50.120 --> 44:56.880]  I did not know that there is this aspect of treatment. From that time onwards, every time\n",
      "[44:56.880 --> 45:02.680]  I have to decide on an advanced treatment option for the patient, I look at the family.\n",
      "[45:02.680 --> 45:07.960]  I look at the family status. I talk to them in depth about everything. How many children,\n",
      "[45:07.960 --> 45:12.240]  how, how, how are they studying? What is your financial status? What about their education?\n",
      "[45:12.240 --> 45:18.120]  I look at everything together and I make a calculation in my mind that, you know, if\n",
      "[45:18.120 --> 45:22.720]  these patients, if I take them for a surgery, advise them for an advanced procedure like\n",
      "[45:22.720 --> 45:28.760]  a transplant or something else, and if they can't afford it, and if they overshoot it,\n",
      "[45:28.760 --> 45:33.720]  if that is going to affect them as a family after this man, I mean, you have, you can't\n",
      "[45:33.720 --> 45:38.420]  guarantee anybody's life after procedure. I mean, you have that few risks here and there.\n",
      "[45:38.420 --> 45:42.640]  Somebody can die. Some patients can actually have complications that you don't even expect\n",
      "[45:42.640 --> 45:47.440]  to happen. So if I feel that, you know, they cannot afford and they're actually going to\n",
      "[45:47.440 --> 45:52.640]  do something out of something that, that is going to stress them out for that financial\n",
      "[45:52.640 --> 46:00.360]  aspect, I tell them, don't do it. Because see, whatever we can do, we'll do it medically.\n",
      "[46:00.360 --> 46:05.160]  If you are comfortable with getting finances, and if you're comfortable getting finances\n",
      "[46:05.160 --> 46:09.100]  that you live in, take care of complications, then yes, let us do it. Because otherwise\n",
      "[46:09.100 --> 46:13.200]  you will lose the patient and you will lose your life. You will lose the future of your\n",
      "[46:13.200 --> 46:16.920]  children. You will lose your land, you will lose your house, you will lose everything.\n",
      "[46:16.920 --> 46:21.820]  It should not be like that. So make sure that financial stability is there. Make sure they\n",
      "[46:21.820 --> 46:26.440]  can afford it. Otherwise take them through the journey where ultimately the patient might\n",
      "[46:26.440 --> 46:32.200]  die. But then they will have that, that, that feeling that they have done everything medically\n",
      "[46:32.200 --> 46:36.680]  for that patient. And we have also done everything medically for that patient. But ultimately\n",
      "[46:36.680 --> 46:43.160]  we could not do much, but there is no financial burden on them. And there is no extra stress\n",
      "[46:43.160 --> 46:48.280]  on that family. So once I started doing this for my patients, I found out that they were\n",
      "[46:48.280 --> 46:52.920]  more satisfied with that kind of treatment rather than me telling them, do this, do that,\n",
      "[46:52.920 --> 46:58.360]  do this, like exactly what you said. You are sitting there and giving orders, not thinking\n",
      "[46:58.360 --> 47:03.720]  about things other than that particular organ. Like for example, if I just think about the\n",
      "[47:03.720 --> 47:08.120]  liver and saving the liver, it's always a transplant. You know, I just keep pushing\n",
      "[47:08.120 --> 47:12.080]  patients for transplant, make sure, I mean, I don't care about how they're going to do\n",
      "[47:12.080 --> 47:16.680]  it. They will do it somehow. It's good money for the hospital. They'll let them do it.\n",
      "[47:16.680 --> 47:20.640]  And because I want the transplants to be done, that is medically what is right. No, you cannot\n",
      "[47:20.640 --> 47:25.880]  think like that as a doctor. You actually have to think beyond that. If the transplant\n",
      "[47:25.880 --> 47:31.160]  is going to get them into a trouble, much more than that they bargained for with just\n",
      "[47:31.160 --> 47:36.880]  the disease. I think it's, it's always good to openly discuss this with the family and\n",
      "[47:36.880 --> 47:40.680]  the bystander and say that, you know, this is, these are the risks. You're going to be\n",
      "[47:40.680 --> 47:45.160]  financially struggling after this. If something happens, if you want to take that risk, please\n",
      "[47:45.160 --> 47:49.680]  do. Some of them say, yes, sir, we will do that. We will take that risk. Financially,\n",
      "[47:49.680 --> 47:53.400]  if whatever happens, we have to sell our land, we have to sell our homes. We don't mind,\n",
      "[47:53.400 --> 47:57.440]  we'll do it. And for such patient, I say, okay, fine. That's your decision. Others will\n",
      "[47:57.440 --> 48:01.720]  actually come and tell me that, sir, because you have told us this, we do not know how\n",
      "[48:01.720 --> 48:05.800]  to do it. And if we do this, we know we are going to get into a lot of trouble. And we\n",
      "[48:05.800 --> 48:10.720]  know that this patient can also have a lot of complications. He might die also without\n",
      "[48:10.720 --> 48:15.920]  doing it, but then there is no way that we can do it. And because you told us this openly,\n",
      "[48:15.920 --> 48:21.360]  we can make the decision clearly. So if I don't talk to them about that particular aspect\n",
      "[48:21.360 --> 48:27.040]  that, you know, it is okay to not take the best option, which is given to you because\n",
      "[48:27.040 --> 48:34.000]  you cannot afford it. It is okay. It is fine. It's not like you have to do a transplant,\n",
      "[48:34.000 --> 48:38.880]  spend that much amount of money to save that patient for you to have some success. It's\n",
      "[48:38.880 --> 48:43.200]  not like that. Sometimes the best decisions may not be the best decision, best option\n",
      "[48:43.200 --> 48:46.440]  for the patient, but it's definitely the best decision in the interest of the patient and\n",
      "[48:46.440 --> 48:51.160]  the family. And this is what I have been doing in the last many, many years. And actually\n",
      "[48:51.160 --> 48:57.560]  my patients have been actually doing quite well with that. And a lot of my patients have\n",
      "[48:57.560 --> 49:02.680]  been improving also medically. Because what happens is that some doctors will say that,\n",
      "[49:02.680 --> 49:06.680]  you know, do a transplant. They'll say that, sir, we cannot afford a transplant. So for\n",
      "[49:06.680 --> 49:11.120]  that doctor, that's the end of it. So this guy is not going to do a transplant. So he's\n",
      "[49:11.120 --> 49:15.520]  going to die. So just, you know, treat him like that. Give him something here and there.\n",
      "[49:15.520 --> 49:21.240]  Anyway, he's going to die. So they don't actually bother treating them to their best efforts.\n",
      "[49:21.240 --> 49:25.440]  This guy's anyway going to die. They know it. I know it. So why bother? But when you\n",
      "[49:25.440 --> 49:30.520]  actually say that, you know, all of us know that he is going to die because they cannot\n",
      "[49:30.520 --> 49:35.840]  afford the best option, it makes you do much more for the patient medically. And when that\n",
      "[49:35.840 --> 49:41.920]  medical effort comes in really at that particular really good level, that actually improves\n",
      "[49:41.920 --> 49:47.040]  the patient also better. So somebody who's going to die without a transplant in six months\n",
      "[49:47.040 --> 49:50.720]  have seen them survive for more than two and a half to three years on medical management\n",
      "[49:50.720 --> 49:56.000]  alone. So that extra three years for that family is like, it's a great thing. It's a\n",
      "[49:56.000 --> 49:59.800]  great thing. So some patients tell me that, sir, you told us that without a transplant,\n",
      "[49:59.800 --> 50:03.860]  he's going to die in six months. But medically, you have given us another two and a half years.\n",
      "[50:03.860 --> 50:10.800]  That is enough for us. So that is where this aspect of what I studied in Calcutta was extrapolated\n",
      "[50:10.800 --> 50:12.120]  to my current work here.\n",
      "[50:12.120 --> 50:18.040]  Wow. So how would you have handled that original case differently?\n",
      "[50:18.040 --> 50:22.720]  That original case, I mean, if I look back, see, I have a lot of regrets in during my\n",
      "[50:22.720 --> 50:28.520]  initial part of my profession, because I was just a young graduate. I mean, I just got\n",
      "[50:28.520 --> 50:33.840]  out of hepatology and I never knew what real life is going to be because I was always under\n",
      "[50:33.840 --> 50:38.560]  the umbrella of my institute. So we have professors, associate professors, they make decisions.\n",
      "[50:38.560 --> 50:43.880]  We just have to listen to what they want us to do. That's it. And you're not responsible.\n",
      "[50:43.880 --> 50:48.040]  The whole institute is responsible. So we don't get into trouble. But when you practice\n",
      "[50:48.040 --> 50:52.100]  alone, your responsibility is much, much different from the responsibility that you actually\n",
      "[50:52.100 --> 50:57.120]  face in your training. And in that sense, I have a lot of regrets. And one of that is\n",
      "[50:57.120 --> 51:02.720]  that sometimes I overdo a lot of things for my patients initially, a lot of things I used\n",
      "[51:02.720 --> 51:10.240]  to overdo because I was scared. As a doctor, initially, I was not very good on confidence.\n",
      "[51:10.240 --> 51:15.200]  And I was I used to do a lot of things for my patients from both investigation point\n",
      "[51:15.200 --> 51:19.920]  of view and medical treatment point of view, thinking that something will hit somewhere.\n",
      "[51:19.920 --> 51:25.240]  And if somebody comes and accuses me, so initially, the kind of practice that I used to do was\n",
      "[51:25.240 --> 51:30.960]  to save myself, you know, not the patient. I'll do everything that I can. And I'll say\n",
      "[51:30.960 --> 51:35.040]  that if the patient dies, I'll say that, you know, I've done everything. I actually done\n",
      "[51:35.040 --> 51:38.920]  things that I should not have even done. So that was the kind of practice that initially\n",
      "[51:38.920 --> 51:44.880]  I did. And that is that is why even the transplant happened, because I wanted them to do the\n",
      "[51:44.880 --> 51:51.120]  transplant and they did the transplant. But then I would also want to blame them because\n",
      "[51:51.120 --> 51:56.560]  it was their decision. They did the transplant and they knew that the patient can also die\n",
      "[51:56.560 --> 52:01.280]  with the transplant. So it's basically like gaslighting. And I used to gaslight my patients\n",
      "[52:01.280 --> 52:07.560]  initially and it was it was bad. And I learned from it because when I when my when when this\n",
      "[52:07.560 --> 52:12.880]  patient actually was a very young man, I still remember his face. And when he died and I\n",
      "[52:12.880 --> 52:18.480]  knew that they lost a lot of money, they lost everything that actually changed the way I\n",
      "[52:18.480 --> 52:25.000]  actually practice medicine. So if I wanted to change anything for that particular patient,\n",
      "[52:25.000 --> 52:29.880]  I would not have let them do the transplant. I would have actually done more for him medically\n",
      "[52:29.880 --> 52:33.040]  instead of just pushing them into transplant and making them waste their money. I would\n",
      "[52:33.040 --> 52:37.440]  have actually told them that, you know, we'll try medically as much as possible, which is\n",
      "[52:37.440 --> 52:42.240]  low on finances for you, but maybe very good on the patient because medical management\n",
      "[52:42.240 --> 52:47.040]  is not an inferior management. When you look at transplant, some patients do do well. And\n",
      "[52:47.040 --> 52:51.920]  that would have actually, I think, probably given them another maybe two years. But instead\n",
      "[52:51.920 --> 52:56.760]  of that, he died in six months. It was exactly the opposite what I had planned for them.\n",
      "[52:56.760 --> 53:02.600]  So he died earlier than we expected him to. And he died in a way. I mean, he died increasing\n",
      "[53:02.600 --> 53:07.160]  the financial burden on that family, the debt burden on that family. So I would not have\n",
      "[53:07.160 --> 53:10.840]  transplanted him in the state that he was actually going in for transplant. I would\n",
      "[53:10.840 --> 53:15.760]  have actually told them not to do it because I would I would know I now know that taking\n",
      "[53:15.760 --> 53:20.480]  a patient like that for a transplant is a very high risk transplant. And there is no\n",
      "[53:20.480 --> 53:25.720]  need to take that risk because every risk is associated with financial burden. Also,\n",
      "[53:25.720 --> 53:29.640]  if they had a medical claim or medical insurance, fine, it's fine. They can do it, but not not\n",
      "[53:29.640 --> 53:34.020]  like this, not putting everything else into trouble. Right. So that I would have done\n",
      "[53:34.020 --> 53:38.800]  definitely different. And I don't think I have done a single I've made a single wrong\n",
      "[53:38.800 --> 53:43.660]  decision. I mean, is what I feel. I have not because this is what I get. I mean, I get\n",
      "[53:43.660 --> 53:47.640]  feedbacks from my patients and families also, even the ones who die, the ones who survive.\n",
      "[53:47.640 --> 53:52.800]  I do get feedbacks from everyone. And what I feel is that I've been doing right by them.\n",
      "[53:52.800 --> 53:58.280]  You know, I may not be able to save a lot of my patients without a transplant, but ultimately\n",
      "[53:58.280 --> 54:03.880]  we are all on the same page and people are happy. Patients are happy. The families are\n",
      "[54:03.880 --> 54:09.960]  happy when I tell them black and white that, you know, I'm sorry, but I feel that this\n",
      "[54:09.960 --> 54:14.920]  is not going to work out and this is going to end up badly for you. And I don't want\n",
      "[54:14.920 --> 54:19.520]  that to happen to you, even though this is going to end up badly for the patient, you\n",
      "[54:19.520 --> 54:24.200]  know, it, we had to compromise somewhere. You either compromise on your future stability\n",
      "[54:24.200 --> 54:28.720]  or you compromise on your patient right now, that is up to you. And when that openness\n",
      "[54:28.720 --> 54:33.520]  happens from doctor's point, when, from the doctor's side, I think patients actually love\n",
      "[54:33.520 --> 54:38.680]  that from doctors. The problem comes when doctors are not so open because see, I have\n",
      "[54:38.680 --> 54:44.040]  fears. I have, I have doubts. And when I tell about my fears and my doubts to my patients\n",
      "[54:44.040 --> 54:49.560]  and their family, we are all on the same page. And that is when patients and families, they\n",
      "[54:49.560 --> 54:55.800]  don't get violent towards you. I've had two episodes of violence against me from patient\n",
      "[54:55.800 --> 55:01.440]  families. But other than that, in my last seven years, never, ever, ever have I faced\n",
      "[55:01.440 --> 55:06.320]  a bad episode from a patient family because I've been very open to them. And the two violence,\n",
      "[55:06.320 --> 55:09.960]  I think maybe we can talk about it later on. The two violent episodes that I faced actually\n",
      "[55:09.960 --> 55:15.400]  was because of poor communication. And I completely blame myself for that and not the patient.\n",
      "[55:15.400 --> 55:19.640]  And how, I mean, I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of that patient and just thinking\n",
      "[55:19.640 --> 55:23.880]  that, you know, how do those patients react when you tell them that look, you know, a\n",
      "[55:23.880 --> 55:28.560]  transplant can save you, but you can't afford it. So you have to make a choice for your\n",
      "[55:28.560 --> 55:34.960]  family's future and all of that. How do patients respond? How do families respond? Because even\n",
      "[55:34.960 --> 55:39.120]  his family must be then feeling incredibly guilty at having to make a choice like that.\n",
      "[55:39.120 --> 55:45.240]  The patient himself must feel incredibly conflicted. So what I do is that whatever decisions that\n",
      "[55:45.240 --> 55:50.240]  we make in the open or whatever things that I want to tell them openly, I don't do that\n",
      "[55:50.240 --> 55:56.720]  much with the patient. I want my patient to be happy. So a lot of the complex decisions\n",
      "[55:56.720 --> 56:02.800]  that I take is only with the family. And we don't have to tell the patient everything,\n",
      "[56:02.800 --> 56:06.200]  you know, I mean, he does not need to know that he's going to die in six months. It's\n",
      "[56:06.200 --> 56:10.320]  absolutely wasted information for him. Why should somebody know that they're going to\n",
      "[56:10.320 --> 56:15.880]  die? Absolutely not needed. So what we do is that the families, of course, families,\n",
      "[56:15.880 --> 56:22.240]  I mean, there are, in my clinical practice, what I have found out is that within the family,\n",
      "[56:22.240 --> 56:26.320]  there is an alpha, you know, it can be the wife, it can be the mother, it could be a\n",
      "[56:26.320 --> 56:31.020]  nephew, it can be a cousin, could be the daughter. But there is an alpha personality who actually\n",
      "[56:31.020 --> 56:35.880]  understands and imbibes everything and helps others take decisions. So I always look out\n",
      "[56:35.880 --> 56:40.520]  for the alpha when I talk because when I make when I discuss in depth, I don't discuss with\n",
      "[56:40.520 --> 56:44.840]  one person. No, I don't say that, call the wife and just talk to the wife. I'll call\n",
      "[56:44.840 --> 56:48.840]  the wife, she'll come with her sister, the mother. So there'll be a group of people who\n",
      "[56:48.840 --> 56:54.200]  I talk to. It makes things easier for everybody to, you know, it's supportive for them also.\n",
      "[56:54.200 --> 56:58.240]  I never separately call the patient's bystander and say that, you know, he's going to die\n",
      "[56:58.240 --> 57:01.880]  and these things, we have to make a decision. I never do that. That's like harassment. It's\n",
      "[57:01.880 --> 57:06.120]  like torture for them. So it's always in a group. So I always look at who the alpha is\n",
      "[57:06.120 --> 57:09.360]  because when I talk to them in a group, there'll be one person who will be asking me a lot\n",
      "[57:09.360 --> 57:16.680]  of questions to make a decision. And when that happens, what they do is they, as a group,\n",
      "[57:16.680 --> 57:22.960]  they try to diffuse that tension within themselves. And ultimately, it's difficult for them to\n",
      "[57:22.960 --> 57:26.920]  come to terms. I mean, I understand that. I mean, I cannot actually imagine. I mean,\n",
      "[57:26.920 --> 57:33.280]  if you put me in that patient's wife or family's position, I don't know what I will be, what\n",
      "[57:33.280 --> 57:38.160]  my thinking will be. It's not going to be easy. But what they do is they ultimately\n",
      "[57:38.160 --> 57:42.480]  make a decision in such a way that it is not a single person making the decision. So that\n",
      "[57:42.480 --> 57:46.080]  is the importance of talking to a group of people in the family. So it'll be a collective\n",
      "[57:46.080 --> 57:51.960]  decision. And once that happens, a single person does not feel guilty. And it's a collective\n",
      "[57:51.960 --> 57:56.760]  decision. Everybody is on board. It's a family. We are all on the same page. And the patient\n",
      "[57:56.760 --> 58:00.720]  does not need to know about all of that. So what we tell the patient is that, see, we\n",
      "[58:00.720 --> 58:04.760]  have made a collective decision for you. And this is what we are going to do. We are going\n",
      "[58:04.760 --> 58:09.840]  to try medical management for you at the highest level possible. Keep your hopes up. We are\n",
      "[58:09.840 --> 58:15.000]  keeping our hopes up. We'll hope everything goes well. We give him a good life. We take\n",
      "[58:15.000 --> 58:20.200]  him on that journey. I mean, it is towards his death, but we make sure that journey is\n",
      "[58:20.200 --> 58:25.440]  worth it for him. And I think this works out well. So when you have a happy patient, and\n",
      "[58:25.440 --> 58:30.040]  then you have a collective decision making within the family, I don't think there is\n",
      "[58:30.040 --> 58:34.600]  any guilt associated with it. And how do you manage how much to tell the patient and all\n",
      "[58:34.600 --> 58:39.080]  of that? Because if I was a patient, I would be like, hey, I'm mature enough to handle\n",
      "[58:39.080 --> 58:43.080]  it. I need to know, you know, I don't want to get things kept from me. I've had patients\n",
      "[58:43.080 --> 58:49.320]  actually asked me separately, what is going to happen to me. So I tell them, I tell them\n",
      "[58:49.320 --> 58:55.120]  in a way that I feel for them. You know, I feel with them, in a sense. For example, I\n",
      "[58:55.120 --> 58:58.960]  don't tell them that, you know, actually, we decided that, you know, we'll go with medicine\n",
      "[58:58.960 --> 59:02.360]  because you don't have much money. And ultimately, without a transfer, you're going to die. No,\n",
      "[59:02.360 --> 59:08.520]  it's not like that. He'll ask me directly, but I will diffuse the situation and provide\n",
      "[59:08.520 --> 59:13.280]  him with more compassionate and caring words. And he'll forget about the actual question.\n",
      "[59:13.280 --> 59:16.800]  So I confuse a lot of my patients like that when they ask me directly. But there are patients\n",
      "[59:16.800 --> 59:20.120]  who are very adamant who wants to know what is going to happen to them. For example, patients\n",
      "[59:20.120 --> 59:24.480]  with cancers, liver cancers, because they know it's liver cancer, and they really want\n",
      "[59:24.480 --> 59:28.480]  to know what is going to happen to them. So I tell them, so I tell them from an evidence\n",
      "[59:28.480 --> 59:32.800]  point of view. So we have a lot of these studies on liver cancer, we have stages of liver cancer,\n",
      "[59:32.800 --> 59:37.320]  we actually know how much how long a patient is going to survive at each stage. And I show\n",
      "[59:37.320 --> 59:41.820]  him the statistics. And I tell him that, see, these are statistics. And I tell examples\n",
      "[59:41.820 --> 59:46.120]  from my own personal treatment choices that I made for my patients. I tell them, let's\n",
      "[59:46.120 --> 59:50.600]  see, there is this patient who had exactly your stage of cancer. And I told him that,\n",
      "[59:50.600 --> 59:55.160]  you know, he'll survive for only two months, but he survived for two years. There was another\n",
      "[59:55.160 --> 59:59.440]  guy who I said will survive for two years, but then he survived for only two days. So\n",
      "[59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.600]  we are not going to talk about when you're going to die, because I'm not God. I don't\n",
      "[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.600]  know if I'm going to sit on this chair tomorrow. I don't know if I'm going to die of an accident\n",
      "[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:12.600]  today. I don't know. So who am I to tell you when you're going to die? I'm nobody. So let\n",
      "[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.320]  us not ask that question to each other. So I just let it rest there. So they don't they\n",
      "[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:21.400]  don't bother about asking me such questions after that. And they're happy with the treatment\n",
      "[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.260]  that I give them.\n",
      "[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:27.840]  So you mentioned that one of the sort of good things about having a system of values and\n",
      "[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.680]  caring about people is that you go home and sleep well at night. But even then, if you're\n",
      "[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.000]  dealing with cases like this all the time, I don't know how I would sleep at night because\n",
      "[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.160]  at some level, you're going to feel a connection for these people. You know, at some level,\n",
      "[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.460]  you're going to feel bad when someone goes at some level, it can't be nice that somebody's\n",
      "[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:51.040]  come for a particular visit and they're looking a particular way. And the next time they come,\n",
      "[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.880]  it's visible the deterioration you kind of you can. So how do you deal with that at an\n",
      "[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.880]  emotional level?\n",
      "[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.120]  I think this is such an important question. My quality of sleep threshold is actually\n",
      "[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:08.840]  quite low. I mean, when I say quality of sleep for a normal person, that's really bad sleep.\n",
      "[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.120]  But for me, it's good sleep in the sense that, you know, I want to sleep for eight hours\n",
      "[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.120]  continuously without any breaks and without any thoughts, but that is not going to happen.\n",
      "[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.960]  But when I say a good sleep, it's not like, you know, I sleep deeply without any thoughts\n",
      "[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:29.280]  about my patients. I do think about them, especially patients who are, you know, patients\n",
      "[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.240]  who are fighting chance to survive. And we have to give them, we have to take that fight\n",
      "[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.640]  to them. Those are the patients who make me actually lose my sleep at night. And I keep\n",
      "[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:43.480]  thinking about them. But even then, if you ask me, that is actually a good quality sleep\n",
      "[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.440]  for me because I'm not wasting any time there sleeping. I'm lying down and I'm thinking\n",
      "[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.960]  about what to do for that person next day. And if that works out well, I'm happy. I mean,\n",
      "[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.500]  two hours of sleep, I get one hour of planning that I did and that worked out for that patient.\n",
      "[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:04.900]  That's good quality sleep for me. So it's not about the hours of sleep. It's much more\n",
      "[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.640]  than that. So my good quality sleep actually threshold is very low, which for a normal\n",
      "[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.280]  person is really bad sleep.\n",
      "[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.000]  There's this great book, which I'll recommend to all my listeners and link from the show\n",
      "[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.240]  notes called why we sleep by Matthew Walker. And as a doctor, you know, that lack of sleep\n",
      "[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.760]  does hurt you, right? Increase cortisol levels and all the other things. So, you know, how\n",
      "[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.760]  do you?\n",
      "[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:29.960]  I mean, I am. I mean, if you ask me, are you healthy? I'm not. I'm not healthy. I have\n",
      "[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.760]  I am depressed. I am stressed. I lack good sleep. I have put on a little bit of weight.\n",
      "[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.040]  I think the last few months, there is no good exercise. I mean, even though I've started\n",
      "[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.760]  hitting the gym in the last one month. So if I mean, that is what you said is perfectly\n",
      "[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.880]  true. And I think doctors are the ones who are the most unhealthy among the lot. I would\n",
      "[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.120]  say that actually by quoting a study, which the Indian Medical Association did in Kerala,\n",
      "[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.240]  where they found out that when you compare doctor population to general population, doctors\n",
      "[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.800]  died 10 years before general population.\n",
      "[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800]  Wow.\n",
      "[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:09.240]  Yeah, a decade before. So somebody has a life expectancy of about 72. If you look at from\n",
      "[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.720]  the doctor's population in that same with the same characteristics, doctors are dying\n",
      "[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:20.400]  at 62. So this is very true. Doctors die much younger because of a lot of factors and definitely\n",
      "[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.640]  sleep and even the food patterns. And I have two meals a day. I have an early breakfast\n",
      "[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:31.080]  and an early dinner. And I drink loads of coffee in between. That is the only thing\n",
      "[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.480]  that I have in between. But if you look at from common man's or a layperson's perspective,\n",
      "[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.440]  that's really unhealthy eating habit, you know, but I'm going on with that. And it's\n",
      "[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.040]  been there for a long, long time. So I've got adjusted to it. My body's got adjusted\n",
      "[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.720]  to it. So it's very difficult. I mean, a doctor's life, I don't think if somebody\n",
      "[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.160]  asked me, I mean, right out there, I mean, if they don't have a good family presence\n",
      "[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.440]  of doctors, and they have some support to become a doctor, and if somebody right off\n",
      "[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.320]  the bat is interested in going for medicine, I would discourage them. If you ask me, I\n",
      "[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.280]  would discourage them because either you have to be compassionate and you have to be like\n",
      "[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.440]  a burning candle. You know, your whole life is going to be like that. You have to just\n",
      "[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.200]  keep burning and you will melt and go away. That is how it is going to be for you. It's\n",
      "[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.760]  not going to be all floral. It's going to be a tough life. So if you want that kind\n",
      "[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.760]  of life, yes, be a doctor. But otherwise, I don't think this is a profession that you\n",
      "[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.320]  should actually jumpstart from a fresh perspective. It's tough.\n",
      "[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.320]  Do you wish that someone had given you this advice when you were much younger?\n",
      "[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:39.400]  A lot of people gave me this advice, including my father's professor. So at that point, see,\n",
      "[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.000]  I mean, we don't know what is happening when it comes to real practice of medicine, right?\n",
      "[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.560]  So I was so astonished and I actually tweeted about this once, I think probably about six\n",
      "[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.080]  months back. There was this very senior professor from Delhi and he was my father's teacher.\n",
      "[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.960]  My father took me after my 12th grade when I did not get through. There were a few months\n",
      "[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.760]  we had, I was free from studies. He took me to, I think, Delhi for some medical conference,\n",
      "[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:09.640]  gastroenterology conference to help me get a feel of what a gastroenterology conference is.\n",
      "[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.440]  So I went there and then he introduced me to this elderly man and he said, what are\n",
      "[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:17.600]  you planning to do? I said, I'm trying for my MBBS. I'm going to start my coaching. Then\n",
      "[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.720]  he just told me, young man, this is the biggest mistake you're going to do in your life. Don't\n",
      "[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:28.080]  do it. I just looked at my dad. My dad is like poker faced. And I looked at him and\n",
      "[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.960]  he was like really serious. I thought he was joking. No, he was very serious. And I was\n",
      "[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.320]  like, my God, this guy is so dumb. I want to become a doctor and he's discouraging me.\n",
      "[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.480]  I thought about it at that moment like that. But right now I'm saying if somebody comes\n",
      "[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.760]  and asks me, I'll say never, never, never become a doctor.\n",
      "[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.760]  Do you regret it?\n",
      "[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.080]  Absolutely not. I love it.\n",
      "[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:56.240]  So tell me about a particular kind of trade-off that I see here that, you know, you've pointed\n",
      "[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:01.120]  out how it's important to look at all your patients as human beings, right? Where you\n",
      "[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.360]  try to figure out their circumstances, their mentality to the extent that within a family,\n",
      "[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:10.320]  you're looking for an alpha and so on and so forth. And therefore, you have to give\n",
      "[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.040]  them time. Therefore, it seems that you cannot then have a cookie cutter approach to the\n",
      "[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:20.740]  thing. Whereas what we find in modern medicine, what many people including doctors often complain\n",
      "[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:26.920]  about is that they don't have a choice that you know, you have to maximize for the number\n",
      "[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.480]  of patients you see because there is so much pressure and therefore you minimize on the\n",
      "[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.520]  time that you give them. And therefore, you're basically using what economists would call\n",
      "[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:38.280]  fast and frugal heuristics with each patient where you're not really going deep. You're\n",
      "[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:42.120]  kind of whatever patterns you discern based on that you're saying, okay, take this medicine,\n",
      "[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:47.520]  take this test and all of that. And that's not necessarily a bad approach in the sense\n",
      "[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.240]  that you're seeing more people and therefore helping more people, but giving them less\n",
      "[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.000]  time and therefore the quality of the treatment suffers because of that. And somewhere in\n",
      "[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.680]  the middle, there is some line which is perfection. But basically, as a doctor, you constantly\n",
      "[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.640]  then have to deal with the trade off that either the quality for each patient will be\n",
      "[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.560]  good, but you'll see less patients or the other way around. So is this sort of a fair\n",
      "[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:17.280]  characterization and would it also be fair to say that the natural rational tendency\n",
      "[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.680]  for a doctor is to see as many people as possible because that's how you make the most money?\n",
      "[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:27.400]  I mean, in our community, I mean, if you look at India, I mean, the whole country, like\n",
      "[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.840]  you said, there are there are these two kinds of doctors. One is the doctors who are seeing\n",
      "[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:40.600]  a lot of patients, but just superficially scratching the surface. And the second is doctors who\n",
      "[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.320]  actually see very few patients, but they see them thoroughly. They may not be able to accommodate\n",
      "[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:52.520]  every patient in need at that time. The whole point is that if you look at India per se,\n",
      "[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:59.680]  a lot of good quality medical, you know, work is done in the private sector. You know, if\n",
      "[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:05.360]  you look at liver transplants in Kerala, only the private hospitals do it, not a single\n",
      "[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.640]  government hospital does it. So when the quality of work is actually more in the private sector,\n",
      "[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.960]  what happens is that patients actually rush more into the private sector. It's not like\n",
      "[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.480]  government hospitals don't have patients. They do have patients, a lot of patients.\n",
      "[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:23.080]  But the problem is that if they want a different level of treatment, they all rush into the\n",
      "[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:30.160]  private sector. So doctors are actually completely stressed with this huge patient load in hospitals.\n",
      "[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.160]  And doctors can't take a decision on how many patients they're going to see because it's\n",
      "[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:39.520]  not their hospital. Somebody else is running it. So this is the corporate thinking that\n",
      "[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.840]  you have to actually maximize on the patient load. And these doctors are made to see. So\n",
      "[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.840]  I don't think any doctor wants to actually see 100 patients a day because it's tiring\n",
      "[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:55.080]  for them. I don't. I see 25 patients a day and I have fixed it. I am talking from a privileged\n",
      "[01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:00.680]  position because even though I work at Rajagiri Hospital, it is our consultancy group that\n",
      "[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.840]  is giving the service. So we are just affiliated to Rajagiri, they don't employ us. So we can\n",
      "[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:09.120]  make our rules. So what we have done is my dad wants to see 100 patients, otherwise he'll\n",
      "[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.840]  go into withdrawal. He's that kind of a person. So he sees 100 patients, he'll see the first\n",
      "[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:18.680]  patient and the 100th patient the same way with the same energy. He does that because\n",
      "[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:24.800]  he knows how to do that. Me, on the other hand, if I see a 26th or a 28th patient, I'm\n",
      "[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:30.000]  half dead. My fuel is out, my battery is out by 4.35 o'clock. I can't see more than that.\n",
      "[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.960]  But I'm drained out because I spend a lot of time with these patients. So somebody sees\n",
      "[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.800]  200 patients and me seeing 25 patients is actually equal when it comes to the energy\n",
      "[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:46.960]  spent on it. But every doctor cannot be like me in the sense that they cannot make decisions\n",
      "[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.120]  like me and they work in setups. For example, in a government hospital, you have to see\n",
      "[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.200]  every patient that comes to you. You cannot say, no, I'm not going to see that patient.\n",
      "[01:09:54.200 --> 01:10:02.160]  You have to see it's part of the whole job profile. So I think doctors are not rationally\n",
      "[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.360]  made to actually see many patients and maximize on it. I think doctors really want to take\n",
      "[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:13.200]  it easy and see patients to their heart's content. But that is not happening here because\n",
      "[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:18.720]  of multiple factors. One is the patient burden, the doctor to patient ratio, the kind of services\n",
      "[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.280]  that is available in the public and private sectors, and also the demand from the patient\n",
      "[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.800]  community. For example, I see a lot of patients come to the hospital unnecessarily. They don't\n",
      "[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.920]  need to come to the hospital. Some of them just come because they're over-concerned.\n",
      "[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.680]  A lot of them have various other problems and it's not like they really need treatment.\n",
      "[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.640]  They just need a little bit of counseling and they're all fine. So I think if you can,\n",
      "[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:48.320]  if people are actually informed a little more about when to actually go to a hospital, get\n",
      "[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.640]  proper treatment and checkups done, that level of burden actually on the doctors can also\n",
      "[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:59.720]  reduce. For example, I'll tell you a classical example where I had this patient from this\n",
      "[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:05.440]  place called Malappuram. It's North Kerala, a huge Muslim population area. And he came\n",
      "[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.320]  to me because his brother was having cirrhosis. Actually, his cousin brother. So they're all\n",
      "[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.000]  the same family. So his cousin brother has cirrhosis. So he came to me and asked me that\n",
      "[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.280]  you please check me up. I think I have cirrhosis. He has no problems, no symptoms, nothing.\n",
      "[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:25.200]  He just came to me and said, OK, let us check. And he came. I did an ultrasound. I did some\n",
      "[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:31.080]  specific tests for him and he actually did have cirrhosis. So he had chronic liver disease,\n",
      "[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:37.560]  but he was OK because he was very obese and he had a diabetes that was undiagnosed. So\n",
      "[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.640]  we diagnosed it. We diagnosed liver disease and fat liver disease, everything. And then\n",
      "[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:46.200]  I gave him all the treatments and I sent him home. The next few days, you won't believe\n",
      "[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:55.480]  the whole family, about 28 to 29 of them landed up on the OPD doorstep for health evaluation\n",
      "[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.000]  and none of them had any problem. So that that that is a huge burden on on my practice\n",
      "[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.840]  because they're all OK. They're fine because this guy had an unexpected cirrhosis diagnosis\n",
      "[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.680]  and his brother already had cirrhosis. They were all I mean, people are health conscious,\n",
      "[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.280]  obviously, but that that kind of that kind of approach and attitude towards health care\n",
      "[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:21.960]  services is very much predominant in our country because people want to get checked up even\n",
      "[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:27.120]  if even if they don't have any issues, they just want to visit a doctor and increase the\n",
      "[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.640]  patient burden in the hospitals. So I think that is one small aspect of, you know, increased\n",
      "[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.560]  work from the from a doctor's point of view. And also because, you know, doctors are not\n",
      "[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.680]  owners of the hospital and their job profile warrants them to see more patients. And that\n",
      "[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.800]  is classical corporate tactics. You see more patients, it's more business for the hospital.\n",
      "[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.640]  And is there also a problem that there's an undersupply of doctors? Like I'd done an episode\n",
      "[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.880]  a long time back about the Medical Council of India, which I think no longer exists or\n",
      "[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.760]  the rules have changed or whatever. This was, I think, one of the first episodes I did six\n",
      "[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.840]  years ago. But my guest there, Pawan Srinath, spoke about how the Medical Council of India\n",
      "[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:12.840]  would restrict supply of doctors by, you know, only certain hospitals, only certain, certain\n",
      "[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:18.440]  number of colleges, certain number of whatever. So it's an artificial restriction on the supply\n",
      "[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:22.640]  of doctors. And then that would inevitably result in this where you are flooded with\n",
      "[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.640]  patients.\n",
      "[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.600]  Yeah, I mean, definitely, there is a big skew in the number of doctors that we actually\n",
      "[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:31.200]  need and cater to a particular patient population. There's a definitely big skew. And a lot of\n",
      "[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:36.520]  that is happening because a lot of people are going out of the country. So if you if\n",
      "[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:42.840]  I look at my batch, MBBS batch, I think just a handful of us are here in India. Majority\n",
      "[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:48.480]  of them are in the US and UK. And because of which a lot, I mean, even after this neat\n",
      "[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:53.280]  PG fiasco and everything is happening, a lot of students are going out of the country.\n",
      "[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.600]  And I think not just limited seats that are available. So the MBBS seats have been increasing,\n",
      "[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:04.960]  but the MD and DM seats are not fully increasing. So you have a huge number of doctors who are\n",
      "[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.920]  trained at the basic level only. You don't have doctors above that. You don't have specialists\n",
      "[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.840]  and super specialists. And they are the ones who will actually cater to quality patients\n",
      "[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:19.560]  at some point. And that is not happening. And because of that, we have stagnant doctors\n",
      "[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:24.000]  who are who can, you know, see patients, manage them superficially, but they're not going\n",
      "[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  to cater to the real needs of a patient. And that is actually causing a lot of trouble.\n",
      "[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.560]  So definitely, we have a problem with doctor patient ratio, even if even though the government\n",
      "[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.360]  would not, I think, because the last time the government actually brought out a statistic\n",
      "[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.560]  and said that now we have reached the WHO level of definition of good doctor to patient\n",
      "[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.960]  ratio, they actually include all the Ayush practitioners also in that.\n",
      "[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.400]  We'll talk about that later as well.\n",
      "[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.160]  So that is how they got that particular value in. But I don't think we, I still think we\n",
      "[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.040]  have a problem with the doctor patient ratio.\n",
      "[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.600]  So you know, one of the things I wanted to double click on at the start when you were\n",
      "[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:08.920]  talking about, you know, your early years is also how one's interests develop, in the\n",
      "[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:14.240]  sense that, you know, some people will go in for a career like medicine or engineering\n",
      "[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.400]  because it's expected, maybe the parents are in it, it seems a respectable thing to do,\n",
      "[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.400]  they go in, but they're not truly interested, not truly committed. Some people will have\n",
      "[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:28.040]  interests, but one, they might find out when they begin to do it that those, you know,\n",
      "[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.520]  the subject they thought they were interested in is really not that interesting, their interest\n",
      "[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.920]  lies elsewhere.\n",
      "[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.240]  And then gradually over a period of time, your interests can develop in different directions\n",
      "[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240]  for different reasons.\n",
      "[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.080]  Like you pointed out how you were not interested in like that basic science aspect of it.\n",
      "[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.360]  And elsewhere, I think you mentioned how initially you were not interested in statistics.\n",
      "[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.320]  But over time, you got interested in both of those because, you know, something else\n",
      "[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:57.240]  happened you got a different view of why they are important and the difference that they\n",
      "[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.360]  can make.\n",
      "[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.080]  Give me a mapping of your sort of interest.\n",
      "[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.600]  Like, you know, I find your Instagram page really refreshing, because it has nothing\n",
      "[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.720]  to do with medicine.\n",
      "[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:11.000]  You know, you're crazily into food, it's got beautiful photographs of food, you're enjoying\n",
      "[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.120]  yourself with your family, which is so charming.\n",
      "[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.200]  You're taking photographs of Kochi at night, or you went to Istanbul and you took pictures\n",
      "[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.200]  there.\n",
      "[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.200]  And I've also been there.\n",
      "[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.320]  So I was also looking for familiar things there.\n",
      "[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:27.320]  And so, you know, so what are your other interests like, what were how did your interests within\n",
      "[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.780]  medicine bringing you to hepatology?\n",
      "[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.980]  How did that kind of evolve?\n",
      "[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.160]  And how do you maintain a balance?\n",
      "[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.720]  Like just a couple of days ago, somebody I forget who apologies was talking about how\n",
      "[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:47.440]  one advice they always give people is that in life, whatever your work is, always have\n",
      "[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.240]  a hobby, always have a hobby that you go deeply into, because that is what, you know, keeps\n",
      "[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.280]  you alive in a different kind of way.\n",
      "[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:59.840]  So tell me a little bit more about your interest both within and outside of medicine.\n",
      "[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:00.840]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:05.960]  So within medicine, like you said, I mean, when do we actually decide on what we want\n",
      "[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.960]  to do within medicine?\n",
      "[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.960]  Right.\n",
      "[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.960]  So I think that actually comes up comes in internship.\n",
      "[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.080]  So you finish your MBBS training, and then you have a compulsory one year internship\n",
      "[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:20.240]  rotation in all the departments, you know, and you have you can actually have internship\n",
      "[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.560]  rotations in specific optional areas also, like, for example, forensic medicine, somebody\n",
      "[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.720]  likes forensic medicine, they can opt for that for an internship rotation there.\n",
      "[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.760]  So in internship, what I found out was that from my own personal perspective, is that\n",
      "[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:41.520]  I did not like any of the surgical subjects, you know, long time standing, you know, it\n",
      "[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:47.280]  was so stressful surgery, when you look at being a physician, and I immediately lost\n",
      "[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.560]  my interest in surgery.\n",
      "[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.560]  I mean, I did not like general surgery, I did not like transplant surgery.\n",
      "[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:56.160]  At that time, I was posted in in a kidney transplant unit.\n",
      "[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:01.360]  And it was so so scary, because of the surgery takes many, many hours.\n",
      "[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.080]  And after the surgery, the surgeon has to rest.\n",
      "[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.900]  So he goes home, and then he puts me in in the with the patient to monitor the patient.\n",
      "[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:12.240]  And every time I have to see how much of urine is coming out, because they have put in a\n",
      "[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.400]  new kidney.\n",
      "[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.320]  And the most important aspect is that the urine should come out properly.\n",
      "[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.600]  So every hour I'll sit there and look at the urine, how much ML is coming and I message\n",
      "[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.240]  him this much ML has come.\n",
      "[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:27.480]  So I found that that was it's too stressful for me, the surgical, the surgical part.\n",
      "[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.760]  And so I fell in love with the medical part.\n",
      "[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:37.560]  And in within medicine, I liked to work with adult medicine, instead of pediatrics, because\n",
      "[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:43.480]  in pediatrics, it's kind of it's I mean, I mean, I don't know how best to put it, but\n",
      "[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.720]  it's kind of like, like in veterinary medicine, you know, the dogs, the cats, they don't,\n",
      "[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.480]  they can't tell you their complaints.\n",
      "[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.840]  Same with these little kids, they just either cry, or they don't.\n",
      "[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840]  It's so scary.\n",
      "[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:59.200]  There is nothing in between either they cry, or they're like, flabby, and they don't they\n",
      "[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.200]  don't respond.\n",
      "[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.240]  And, and you have to figure out what the hell is happening to them.\n",
      "[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:07.160]  And all you have other parents, and the parents are so stressed out there.\n",
      "[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.880]  I mean, I must give it to pediatricians.\n",
      "[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:14.120]  I mean, I have, I just salute them, pediatricians and neonatologist, the ones with which who\n",
      "[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:18.480]  work with the littlest neonates and, and other children.\n",
      "[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:22.360]  I mean, I don't know how they do it, because I can't, it's too much.\n",
      "[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:27.440]  And because of that, I wanted more interaction with my patients and their family, I fell\n",
      "[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.320]  in love with the adult medicine part.\n",
      "[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:36.360]  And in adult medicine, the what I found out was that you need to have variety, you know,\n",
      "[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.640]  and that's that's how, you know, dermatology and psychiatry and everything went off, because\n",
      "[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.080]  it's, it's, it's more focused into a particular aspect.\n",
      "[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.960]  So general medicine was the best option for me, because in medicine, you see everything,\n",
      "[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.120]  you know, you see psychiatric patients, you see dermatology, you see stroke, you see cardiac,\n",
      "[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.280]  everything you see, you have the whole bunch mixed back there.\n",
      "[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:59.440]  So it's very, very exciting and very interesting, challenging too, because you'll not know what\n",
      "[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.600]  you're going to see next day.\n",
      "[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.440]  So it's always exciting to work.\n",
      "[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.520]  So that is why I took internal medicine.\n",
      "[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:09.120]  And once I finished internal medicine, then the rest of the decisions on as to which is\n",
      "[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:14.200]  the best for me or which particular aspect of medicine I will, I will appreciate all\n",
      "[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.560]  my life.\n",
      "[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.080]  That was not singularly my decision.\n",
      "[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.520]  Like I said, it was a lot to do with my father's advice also, because he wanted me to do something\n",
      "[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.640]  more than just being a doctor nine to five.\n",
      "[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.720]  So he was like, he's like a nine to five doctor, he goes and sees maximum number of patients,\n",
      "[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.640]  spends time with them and he's fine with that.\n",
      "[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:40.160]  But he knew that there was another part of me where I wanted to do or understand new\n",
      "[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.400]  things about my patients.\n",
      "[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400]  And that is where clinical research comes in.\n",
      "[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:48.520]  So that is why exactly why he wanted me to and get a get a feel of hepatology.\n",
      "[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:53.040]  And that is how I understood the importance of hepatology and its practice because I found\n",
      "[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:57.720]  out that I loved adult medicine, I loved internal medicine, hepatology is the most extreme form\n",
      "[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.160]  of internal medicine.\n",
      "[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.640]  And plus it has a lot of clinical research opportunities.\n",
      "[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.700]  This is how I, I went into hepatology in that sense.\n",
      "[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:11.840]  But I have had a lot of my friends who actually enter into one particular stream, for example,\n",
      "[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.120]  they do general surgery and they've actually dropped it because they could not go on with\n",
      "[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.600]  it and then tried for another.\n",
      "[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.920]  And many of them, there are a lot of them who actually completely dropped becoming clinical\n",
      "[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:29.160]  doctors that is after BBS or right through MD and MS, they have stopped studying or stopped\n",
      "[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.080]  that particular training and they have gone and done MBA and hospital administration and\n",
      "[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.960]  gone into entrepreneurship and things like that.\n",
      "[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:37.200]  There are there are a lot of my friends who do that.\n",
      "[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.360]  So I think it's it's not easy.\n",
      "[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:43.200]  It's not like black and white, which everybody can say that, you know, I want this at some\n",
      "[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.200]  point.\n",
      "[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.440]  I think it's a process.\n",
      "[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.740]  So you have to journey through that phase, like MBBS, absolute confusion.\n",
      "[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.080]  What is happening?\n",
      "[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.160]  MD, you understand that now you actually are a doctor, you know, after MBBS, you don't\n",
      "[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160]  feel like a doctor.\n",
      "[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.520]  In MD, you actually feel like, yeah, I think I'm a doctor.\n",
      "[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.080]  And when it comes to DM, you'll say that, yeah, now I'm a doctor and I'm confidently\n",
      "[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.240]  I'm going to work for my patients.\n",
      "[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:11.160]  So I think everybody should go through that and ultimately decide there will be a point\n",
      "[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.120]  where you it strikes you that, you know, this is what I like.\n",
      "[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.960]  There are very few people who actually say that, you know, this is what I want, because\n",
      "[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:26.200]  they have a lot of that kind of, for example, I know a person whose family is full of cardiologists.\n",
      "[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.200]  So he has his brother as a cardiologist, his brother-in-law is a cardiologist, he's a cardiologist,\n",
      "[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.520]  his dad is a cardiologist, his mom is a cardiologist.\n",
      "[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.280]  So they do cardiology.\n",
      "[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.880]  So that I mean, there are there are there are families like that.\n",
      "[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.600]  So that that decision already made, it'll never go away.\n",
      "[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:45.600]  But for me, and I think for the for a person who starts off with medicine as a career,\n",
      "[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:49.120]  I think the journey will take the person to the destination.\n",
      "[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.760]  And nothing is predetermined.\n",
      "[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.440]  Everything comes in its own pace and time.\n",
      "[01:22:54.440 --> 01:23:00.120]  And tell me about the importance of statistics, which you said you sort of realized later.\n",
      "[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:05.400]  Statistics and I would I would definitely want every young doctor to learn statistics,\n",
      "[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.280]  because there is this subject called community medicine.\n",
      "[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.600]  And community medicine is where you actually learn statistics in MBBS.\n",
      "[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.960]  And that is a chapter which nobody bothers about.\n",
      "[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:18.720]  And if I find a I mean, when in my MBBS exams, when I find a statistic question, I just leave\n",
      "[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.720]  it.\n",
      "[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.280]  Because I know I can make it up in some other question.\n",
      "[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.800]  I don't want to bother about statistics.\n",
      "[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:30.760]  But what I found out is that if you are going to be a clinical researcher, a large part\n",
      "[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.280]  of research is on analysis, you have to analyze data.\n",
      "[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:38.520]  Without analyzing the data, you have no results and no outputs and you have no conclusions\n",
      "[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.760]  to your study.\n",
      "[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.600]  And analysis is purely statistics.\n",
      "[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.920]  And it was not like before.\n",
      "[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.480]  Now we have very good softwares that actually help you do analysis so easy from scratch.\n",
      "[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:52.240]  You don't actually have to sit and study statistics, you just need to know how to operate the software.\n",
      "[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.840]  And which particular statistic to apply at which point, for example, if you're doing\n",
      "[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:04.400]  two group analysis or a single group analysis, you have specific sets of analytical scores\n",
      "[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.840]  that you should apply, and you just need to know that.\n",
      "[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:07.840]  So it's very easy.\n",
      "[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.800]  But even that people are not interested in, but they should be if they actually want to\n",
      "[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.960]  take up a career as a clinician scientist.\n",
      "[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:21.200]  So there are clinicians who will purely work on the ground like doctors nine to five, there\n",
      "[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.240]  are scientists who have no exposure to patients, but they will work with data only, and bring\n",
      "[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.080]  out basic science work.\n",
      "[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.960]  And there are clinician scientists, which is actually a very rare breed, which my sir\n",
      "[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.940]  is Professor Shiv sir is a clinician scientist, and he trained me to be one.\n",
      "[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.840]  And I think every doctor should strive to be a clinician scientist.\n",
      "[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.280]  And to become a good clinician scientist, you have to know statistics, there is no other\n",
      "[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.280]  way.\n",
      "[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:50.720]  And what I say is why I say that is see there is there are two ways to it.\n",
      "[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.120]  If you're working in a big university, you'll have a statistician there, he'll help you\n",
      "[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.120]  out.\n",
      "[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:58.800]  But problem is that you have something in your mind that you want to do for your patients\n",
      "[01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800]  or analyze.\n",
      "[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.940]  And it's not going to be so easy for you to make that person understand what you want.\n",
      "[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:07.840]  But if you know statistics, it's so easy for you, it's it won't waste your time, you can\n",
      "[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.740]  directly jump into it and get your results done.\n",
      "[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:15.420]  So you will be like self it's like a self contained unit, if you know statistics and\n",
      "[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.520]  clinical research becomes part of you.\n",
      "[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.800]  So that is why I say statistics is, is very important.\n",
      "[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:26.360]  And coming to that second part of the question, out of medicine, I think everybody if you\n",
      "[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:32.000]  ask me, I mean, go back and ask me that what do you actually wanted to become that question\n",
      "[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  never came.\n",
      "[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.880]  I would say that I wanted to, I actually wanted to become a screenwriter.\n",
      "[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:37.880]  Wow.\n",
      "[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.800]  Yeah, I love the media.\n",
      "[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.280]  I love the movies.\n",
      "[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.200]  I wanted to become a graphic novelist.\n",
      "[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.200]  Wow.\n",
      "[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.200]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.480]  Because I don't read big, big books.\n",
      "[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.200]  If you see my library, it's all graphic novels.\n",
      "[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.000]  And that is the only medium that I love to read.\n",
      "[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.720]  And I wanted to become a graphic novelist and a screen and a screenwriter.\n",
      "[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.880]  And that was my initial love.\n",
      "[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.480]  But then it went down the drain and somewhere in the line, somewhere down the, you know,\n",
      "[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:06.680]  the hectic aspect of studies and everything, I think it just got lost.\n",
      "[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.960]  But I think it's coming back.\n",
      "[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.920]  You know, in the sense that now that writing part, the giving life to data through research\n",
      "[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:22.600]  and publications is something that I really love because I love writing to start off with.\n",
      "[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.580]  So I think it's catching up with me.\n",
      "[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:28.640]  So out of medicine, this is what I actually loved.\n",
      "[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.960]  And as a hobby, I love writing.\n",
      "[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.600]  So I used to write for my college.\n",
      "[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:40.040]  I used to now I'm writing for some media houses also, and now I'm going to write a book also\n",
      "[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.740]  I've got a good deal.\n",
      "[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:46.600]  And so all that is now coming back to me, and I don't think everybody knows you actually\n",
      "[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.400]  lose what you love.\n",
      "[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.840]  It will definitely come back to you in some other form, and you'll be satisfied with it.\n",
      "[01:26:52.840 --> 01:27:00.000]  And I make it a point that, you know, I don't bring my work home, which is why I have a\n",
      "[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.480]  totally different profile altogether on Instagram.\n",
      "[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:08.880]  And out of my medicine, three things I love is that I love to travel on weekends hunting\n",
      "[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.960]  for new food places in and around Cochin.\n",
      "[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.180]  That is why you see a lot of new food photos every weekend.\n",
      "[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:18.120]  And the second thing is I love to catch up on some movies.\n",
      "[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.280]  And I don't see mainstream theater movies, I want to see some unique kind of movie.\n",
      "[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.280]  So I am a big fan of Korean movies.\n",
      "[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.920]  So that is something I love.\n",
      "[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.360]  I see a lot of Korean movies.\n",
      "[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.400]  And the third aspect is photography.\n",
      "[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.960]  So I'm not a professional photographer, but I love to take a picture of something good.\n",
      "[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.400]  And it's almost always food.\n",
      "[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:45.000]  And these three things actually keep me alive out of medicine.\n",
      "[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.560]  And obviously, this is all with family.\n",
      "[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.520]  So that gives it extra sweetness.\n",
      "[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520]  You cook also?\n",
      "[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.320]  No, I don't cook.\n",
      "[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:55.920]  But I think I used to love cooking.\n",
      "[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.120]  But I don't cook.\n",
      "[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.600]  But if you give me an opportunity, I'll definitely cook.\n",
      "[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.460]  But my wife doesn't give me that because she wants everything to be done by her style.\n",
      "[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.040]  And I love it because her food is like the best.\n",
      "[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.040]  So I let her cook.\n",
      "[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.120]  I don't want to ruin that.\n",
      "[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.920]  So and you're also a gamer, apparently.\n",
      "[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.880]  Yeah, that is actually my stress busting part.\n",
      "[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:21.080]  So what I do is, it's not every time, but usually mostly on the weekends, I'm an avid\n",
      "[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.080]  PC gamer.\n",
      "[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:27.520]  So I have a custom built PC at home, and in my studio, and I don't have a console.\n",
      "[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.280]  So I'm like, no, I'm not for a console gamer.\n",
      "[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.320]  But sometimes I play a lot of first person shooters, because it's very, it's stress busting,\n",
      "[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.320]  you know.\n",
      "[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.520]  And that that happens maybe once or twice a week.\n",
      "[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:44.560]  And it's really enjoyable because you just go into another world and it's totally, totally\n",
      "[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.560]  de-stressing.\n",
      "[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.820]  And I do that maybe for an hour, not more than that.\n",
      "[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.820]  And you aim for the liver?\n",
      "[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:51.820]  No, it's always headshots.\n",
      "[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:56.880]  So what also struck me when I went to your Google Scholar page is the remarkable number\n",
      "[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.880]  of papers you've written, which I'm sure makes your dad very proud.\n",
      "[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.880]  I think more than 60 papers you've written.\n",
      "[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.880]  Yeah, 165.\n",
      "[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.880]  165 papers.\n",
      "[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.880]  Oh, my God.\n",
      "[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.440]  So you know, what is, and I'm guessing you would call yourself a clinical scientist as\n",
      "[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.440]  well, right?\n",
      "[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.440]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.440]  Right.\n",
      "[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:16.360]  Yeah, because I do a lot of basic science work and I publish in basic sciences, which\n",
      "[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.600]  is why that term sticks.\n",
      "[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:23.320]  It's not purely patient oriented papers, it's I do a lot of basic science work with respect\n",
      "[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:27.720]  to gut microbiome, the bacteria inside our body, genetic studies, these things I've done\n",
      "[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.920]  and we have published also.\n",
      "[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:34.160]  And I have a good backup lab and facilities who help me do that kind of work.\n",
      "[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:39.560]  So the paper publications actually happen because I have a very good team that supports\n",
      "[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.000]  me and help me in data collection.\n",
      "[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.160]  And would you say that all clinicians and all scientists should be clinician scientists?\n",
      "[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.940]  Because, you know, if you are a clinician, if you are a practicing doctor, understanding\n",
      "[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:56.860]  the basic science helps you in your work and equally if you are doing basic science sciences,\n",
      "[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:01.320]  that interface with real life and real patients also helps you think better about the fundamental\n",
      "[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320]  problems.\n",
      "[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.320]  Yes, it does.\n",
      "[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:09.640]  I think if you know basic sciences, you are able to simplify things.\n",
      "[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.440]  So for example, I mean, if you look at my professor, Professor Shiv Sarin, I mean, he's\n",
      "[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.760]  been working on hepatitis B and I mean, a lot of liver diseases from basic aspects to\n",
      "[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.840]  clinical aspects for decades.\n",
      "[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:26.400]  And I would expect that if I sit in as a talk of his, I'm not going to understand anything\n",
      "[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.320]  because he's such a big person and he knows so much about basic stuff.\n",
      "[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:34.980]  But if you actually sit in his talk, he'll tell you stuff like you're going to read Amar\n",
      "[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:35.980]  Chitra Katha.\n",
      "[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.880]  It is going to be that simple.\n",
      "[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:42.480]  He can simplify such complex matters because he knows basic science stuff.\n",
      "[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.960]  And that is exactly what he's taught me also.\n",
      "[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:50.860]  And that is exactly why I am able to talk about diseases, management and prognosis in\n",
      "[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:54.080]  very simplified terms to my patients and their family.\n",
      "[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.840]  I don't use any medical terms when I talk to them at all.\n",
      "[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:03.160]  And I make it a point that I don't use any medical terms, no scientific jargons.\n",
      "[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.160]  And without using medical terms and scientific jargons, my patients understand the same level\n",
      "[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.900]  of stuff that I understand about the disease equally.\n",
      "[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:16.660]  So if I know something about alcoholic liver disease to the highest extent, the same thing\n",
      "[01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:18.240]  my patient will also know.\n",
      "[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.480]  I make sure we are all on the same page and he will know because I have simplified it\n",
      "[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:29.640]  for him and why could I simplify that because I love the basic science part of it.\n",
      "[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:33.560]  And this is the only way you can simplify medicine for patients if you know basic science.\n",
      "[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.960]  If you know basic science, that means you know the subject.\n",
      "[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.320]  And that's a great point and that ties in with another point I often tell my writing\n",
      "[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:44.980]  students that if you force yourself to write clearly, you will become a better thinker\n",
      "[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:47.780]  because you can only write clearly if you're thinking clearly.\n",
      "[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:53.080]  So just trying to write like if you have to explain in layman's language to a patient\n",
      "[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:58.080]  who might not have the same level of education as you do, you're only able to do that if\n",
      "[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.080]  you really know the subject inside out.\n",
      "[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.080]  Exactly.\n",
      "[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:06.400]  Because when I had to take my child for a particular disease management, when I spoke\n",
      "[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.120]  to the pediatrician, because I am a doctor, I could understand what my pediatrician was\n",
      "[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.520]  telling me.\n",
      "[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.760]  But my wife, she did not understand anything.\n",
      "[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:19.400]  And she was so stressed out because she thought that this person was actually telling me a\n",
      "[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.280]  lot of bad stuff and things are very bad.\n",
      "[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.280]  It was nothing.\n",
      "[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.760]  It was just an allergy thing.\n",
      "[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.520]  And but the way they spoke with a lot of scientific terms, my wife was so stressed out and she\n",
      "[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:31.720]  came home and she was like, what were they saying?\n",
      "[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.380]  And I said, it's just simple stuff.\n",
      "[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:35.040]  It is this, this, this.\n",
      "[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.040]  That's it.\n",
      "[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:41.160]  So from that point, I know, I mean, I always strive to think, I mean, like you said, you\n",
      "[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:47.160]  can only think clearly if you know that stuff at the at the most clear part, I mean, at\n",
      "[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.340]  the basic level of that particular disease progression.\n",
      "[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:55.160]  And even genetic diseases, the toughest to explain to people, even that we can very easily\n",
      "[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.240]  explain in layman's terms to people.\n",
      "[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:01.840]  I mean, when there is a disease called Wilson's disease, which is because of copper overload\n",
      "[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.920]  in the liver, and that is a genetic condition.\n",
      "[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:09.560]  And all of my Wilson's disease patients, they exactly know even which gene is affected.\n",
      "[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:10.760]  They'll tell you which gene is affected.\n",
      "[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:14.420]  They know the whole pathway, everything, because we have been discussing it so clearly in our\n",
      "[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:16.800]  routine follow-up visits.\n",
      "[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.800]  And that's you.\n",
      "[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:20.360]  But is that a feeling in many other doctors?\n",
      "[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:26.120]  I do feel so, yes, because a lot of doctors, one thing is a lot of doctors don't spend\n",
      "[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:30.720]  enough time discussing with the patient or their family.\n",
      "[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:35.360]  And the time that they actually spend discussing, they maybe use a lot of scientific terms,\n",
      "[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.040]  because when you use a lot of scientific terms, patients and family get put off.\n",
      "[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:42.200]  They'll say, OK, fine, and they'll just go.\n",
      "[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:47.400]  But if you actually start telling them nicely, they'll sit and hear you out and ask you questions.\n",
      "[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.320]  So this is one of my litmus test.\n",
      "[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.480]  So if a patient listens to me or a family listens to me and they have a lot of questions\n",
      "[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.100]  for me, that means it's worked.\n",
      "[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.600]  That means they want to know more about it and they're getting a feel of it.\n",
      "[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.440]  They understand what I'm trying to tell them.\n",
      "[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:04.280]  But if I say something and they just look at me blankly and they just get up and go,\n",
      "[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.800]  that means I have failed.\n",
      "[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.880]  And a lot of patients who actually come to me for second opinion, come to me because\n",
      "[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.880]  of this.\n",
      "[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.840]  They just want to know what they have.\n",
      "[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.440]  The doctor has given them the right medications and everything, but they have no clue what\n",
      "[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.440]  they have.\n",
      "[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.440]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:21.120]  So I explain to them and then they stick with me.\n",
      "[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.480]  Wow.\n",
      "[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:26.320]  The only previous doctor I've had on the show practicing medical doctor is Lancelot Pinto.\n",
      "[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.320]  You must have heard of him.\n",
      "[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.320]  Yeah, I know.\n",
      "[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320]  Yes.\n",
      "[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.320]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.320]  Wonderful guy.\n",
      "[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:33.420]  And he even treated me for Covid after we recorded when I happened to get it.\n",
      "[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:39.080]  And one of the things that I found impressive about him, which is also true of you, obviously,\n",
      "[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:44.960]  is that he made this effort to keep himself up to date with the latest research on his\n",
      "[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.080]  subject.\n",
      "[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:51.240]  And one of the things that I notice about many doctors otherwise is that fine, they've\n",
      "[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:56.600]  got their medical education whenever they got it, 90s, 80s, whenever, and they did well\n",
      "[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:58.160]  and they were good students.\n",
      "[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.240]  But they don't, after that it's a daily grind and they're not really keeping themselves\n",
      "[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:09.120]  up to date as much as they should, which is a problem because, A, the science is changing\n",
      "[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.320]  in many fields like nutrition, for example, where the conventional wisdom of the 90s is\n",
      "[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.520]  like almost the opposite of today.\n",
      "[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.920]  And B, you know, when something new comes about like Covid, your traditional knowledge,\n",
      "[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:24.200]  you know, you have to all stay on top of it, look at the latest research, look at the latest\n",
      "[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.920]  numbers and use your, you know, statistical mind there as well.\n",
      "[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:32.200]  So when you look around you at the profession, I mean, you've written 165 papers, obviously,\n",
      "[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.920]  to make an effort to keep in touch.\n",
      "[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.640]  But how intentional is the effort in terms of how much time do you think a good doctor\n",
      "[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.960]  should give to looking at the latest research in her field, say every week or whatever,\n",
      "[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:49.880]  and I know it will differ from area to area, you know, and do you find that too many doctors\n",
      "[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.040]  don't do this?\n",
      "[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.440]  I think a majority of doctors don't do this.\n",
      "[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.020]  They don't read, they apply what they have been taught, and they just follow the guidelines.\n",
      "[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.840]  And some of them actually don't even follow the updated guidelines.\n",
      "[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.520]  So that's that's even worse.\n",
      "[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:10.040]  What I do is that I read every day an hour, I spend one hour on I mean, because we have\n",
      "[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.360]  so many journals, and every journal has different different contents.\n",
      "[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:17.360]  I mean, in hepatology itself, we have multiple journals, and every journal will have some\n",
      "[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:18.820]  good content in it.\n",
      "[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:22.520]  It's not going to be easy for you to, you know, read every journal towards the weekend.\n",
      "[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:28.560]  So what I do is I target I take one journal a day, go through the latest additions on\n",
      "[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.680]  the in their online new issue.\n",
      "[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.480]  And I read one paper from that every day.\n",
      "[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.320]  If I don't find anything interesting, and that that day is free for me, I don't do anything,\n",
      "[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:42.600]  but I still look for new data every day.\n",
      "[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.680]  And I have trained myself to do that.\n",
      "[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.520]  And which is why I can help.\n",
      "[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.640]  I mean, I can get updated much faster and easier, instead of waiting for somebody to\n",
      "[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.640]  update me.\n",
      "[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.840]  Another way of getting updated is to attend conferences, and that to really good academic\n",
      "[01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.840]  conferences.\n",
      "[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:03.760]  For example, I'm yet to actually see a very good academic conference in India, because\n",
      "[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.640]  in India, medical conferences are, it's like a Bollywood song.\n",
      "[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.520]  It's just you know, people partying and all that.\n",
      "[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:16.360]  And I mean, if you look at conferences from the liver societies that is done from outside\n",
      "[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:22.080]  from Europe and in the US, they just they just stick to academic work, they just want\n",
      "[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.440]  to get updated and they they provide and produce the latest stuff there.\n",
      "[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:32.520]  And I always I mean, before the COVID came every year, I used to go for the American\n",
      "[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:37.840]  the liver meeting, and the International Liver Congress, that is the Europe one, and get\n",
      "[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.360]  myself updated there.\n",
      "[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.680]  But it's not easy to travel now every year.\n",
      "[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.600]  So I have started doing this journal reading stuff now.\n",
      "[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.040]  But what doctors who cannot do that can do is to attend such academic conferences, because\n",
      "[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.080]  that's like one short updation for everything.\n",
      "[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.000]  And you have annual conferences, maybe once or twice for some institutes, I mean, for\n",
      "[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  some societies, they have double conferences, and all I mean, specific single topic conferences\n",
      "[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.420]  and annual conferences, which gets you very good updated data.\n",
      "[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:08.920]  But doctors don't even do that.\n",
      "[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:11.840]  You know, they go for conferences to have a good time.\n",
      "[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:16.480]  If you actually see Indian comics so funny, they'll, you'll have academic sessions going\n",
      "[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.640]  on, but there'll be some boat cruise and some dance happening.\n",
      "[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.280]  People are all there, nobody's in the in the hall.\n",
      "[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:27.720]  And I think that that kind of environment within the Indian academia must change, you\n",
      "[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:33.480]  know, you don't have to make all conferences very Bollywood style, you can actually focus\n",
      "[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.720]  on good academic input so that people actually get good academic outputs for their patients.\n",
      "[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.800]  And that is what we should strive for.\n",
      "[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.120]  And the third aspect is that doctors actually they overwork.\n",
      "[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:49.220]  I mean, like I said, somebody who sees 120 patients a day, I don't think he has he has\n",
      "[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:51.800]  any energy left to come and read.\n",
      "[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.880]  And people work here on Saturdays also.\n",
      "[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.360]  And Saturday is just like any other weekday for a lot of doctors.\n",
      "[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.760]  They see patients from nine to five, come home at seven or eight.\n",
      "[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.200]  And Sunday is just the one day and I don't think any doctor is going to sit and read\n",
      "[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.240]  on a Sunday because they've been working from Monday to Saturday.\n",
      "[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.560]  So I think the work profile also matters regarding the updation part.\n",
      "[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:15.680]  A lot of general practitioners and super specialists, they're all working day in and day out.\n",
      "[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.400]  So they forget to update themselves.\n",
      "[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.600]  And I see that some of them do update themselves when they actually are faced with a crisis.\n",
      "[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:29.280]  So you have a patient who actually is challenging you with a diagnosis or a management, then\n",
      "[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:33.000]  I think many doctors go back and read and see what they can do for that.\n",
      "[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.240]  So there are doctors who update from that point of view also.\n",
      "[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:40.040]  For example, in my practice also, when I started seeing a lot of different types of causes\n",
      "[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:44.760]  for acute hepatitis, I went back and started reading differently on those issues.\n",
      "[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:48.980]  So that kind of updation can also happen, which is case by case based.\n",
      "[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:54.560]  But otherwise, a protocol based, daily based updation, for updation sake, I don't think\n",
      "[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.520]  Indian doctors are doing it much.\n",
      "[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.920]  And can you think of a concrete way in which that helped you in the sense that, that something\n",
      "[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.460]  you read recently actually helped you treat somebody which otherwise you may not have\n",
      "[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:09.000]  known of or thought about?\n",
      "[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.560]  I think classical example, I think the most classical example is that I had, I mean, if\n",
      "[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:19.940]  you look at, I tweeted about this and I had a lot of backlash.\n",
      "[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:22.280]  So I had a tweet which went really viral.\n",
      "[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:28.380]  I had like 6k likes on it and I tweeted a few points and one of the point in that was\n",
      "[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:34.120]  that tweet had multiple points and one of the point was that cirrhosis is reversible.\n",
      "[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.680]  It can be reversed.\n",
      "[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.040]  So I just mentioned that.\n",
      "[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:43.520]  A lot of doctors actually wrote as a response under that saying that what nonsense are you\n",
      "[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.520]  speaking?\n",
      "[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.920]  Go open your textbooks and see what is the definition of cirrhosis.\n",
      "[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:54.080]  The definition of cirrhosis is a structural change to the liver, that is structural means\n",
      "[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:59.280]  both vascular, that is your blood vessel count part and the liver mass.\n",
      "[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.320]  Changes happen structurally which cannot be reversed.\n",
      "[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.520]  That is what is written in the textbook.\n",
      "[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.000]  An irreversible change to the structural aspect of the liver is cirrhosis.\n",
      "[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.440]  So they are saying that definition is this and you are saying cirrhosis can be reversed.\n",
      "[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.080]  What nonsense is this?\n",
      "[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:16.160]  So that is the problem with not getting updated.\n",
      "[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:19.840]  So what happened was that initially when we used to talk to patients, when I used to talk\n",
      "[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.200]  to patients initially about cirrhosis and they asked me, sir can this get cured, doctor\n",
      "[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:25.200]  can this get cured?\n",
      "[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.840]  And I said cirrhosis cannot be cured, you know you can actually arrest it at a particular\n",
      "[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.960]  stable stage and that's about it.\n",
      "[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.080]  Some people progress and once they progress you will end up with a transplant at some\n",
      "[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:41.700]  point which is actually for a patient if you hear that it's quite depressing.\n",
      "[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:46.000]  What happened was that there was this study when I came across, there is a study, I mean\n",
      "[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  fibrosis is a process where your liver gets scarred, I mean medically speaking fibrosis\n",
      "[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.720]  is when your liver is scarred and once that fibrosis progresses at the stage 4 of fibrosis\n",
      "[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.000]  is when your liver becomes cirrhotic.\n",
      "[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.720]  So that is when it becomes irreversible actually.\n",
      "[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:07.040]  Fibrosis can also happen in the lung that is known as pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
      "[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.840]  So there was a study where doctors, I mean pulmonologists actually used a particular\n",
      "[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:16.760]  molecule known as spurfinidone and they actually treated pulmonary fibrosis and saw that the\n",
      "[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.640]  fibrosis was reversing.\n",
      "[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:23.720]  Basically the drug dissolved the scars and the lungs were improving structurally.\n",
      "[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.920]  So I said the fibrosis process in the lung, if you look at the basic science part of it,\n",
      "[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:32.080]  molecular level is the same that happens in the liver.\n",
      "[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:36.480]  The same kind of chemicals and the same kind of enzymatic reactions and everything is happening\n",
      "[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.480]  in the liver also.\n",
      "[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.280]  So the fibrosis part is equal.\n",
      "[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:44.720]  So what if this molecule, if I give it to a cirrhosis patient, will it reverse cirrhosis?\n",
      "[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:51.480]  So what we did was we did a small pilot trial and I asked 3 patients if they are willing,\n",
      "[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.760]  if they would give me consent to start this particular molecule to see if cirrhosis gets\n",
      "[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.160]  reversed.\n",
      "[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:01.640]  And they were all fatty liver disease patients, obese with cirrhosis, stable cirrhosis, no\n",
      "[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.640]  other issue.\n",
      "[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.160]  So I did a biopsy first, proved that there is cirrhosis and I gave them this drug spurfinidone\n",
      "[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:09.200]  for 3 to 6 months.\n",
      "[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.560]  And I did a repeat biopsy and I saw that the cirrhosis actually was reversing in these\n",
      "[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.480]  patients with the use of this drug.\n",
      "[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:21.060]  So medically with a drug, you can reverse cirrhosis and this was proven.\n",
      "[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:25.960]  And we published this in the Journal of Clinical and Transnational Hepatology and the use of\n",
      "[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.080]  purfinidone as an agent to reverse cirrhosis.\n",
      "[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:33.000]  So that whole idea of cirrhosis cannot be reversed is out of the window now, traditionally\n",
      "[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.760]  thought is out of the window.\n",
      "[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:39.360]  Now when you go back and look at other, because liver disease is not because of a single cause,\n",
      "[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.840]  you can have multiple causes, for example, hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis, these are\n",
      "[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:45.340]  all alcoholic liver disease can all cause cirrhosis.\n",
      "[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:50.040]  So when I look back at the literature, I saw that the same molecule was used by a group\n",
      "[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:55.680]  in South America and they treated hepatitis C patients and found out even their cirrhosis\n",
      "[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:56.840]  was getting reversed.\n",
      "[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.100]  The fibrosis was getting reversed.\n",
      "[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.840]  So we have more data on it.\n",
      "[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:04.280]  So I said, okay, this is something really new because nobody was talking about it.\n",
      "[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:11.000]  Then I found out that 25 years back, there was a paper written by this brilliant pathologist\n",
      "[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  called Ian VanLess.\n",
      "[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  Ian VanLess is one of the biggest names in liver pathology and in the liver histology\n",
      "[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  we say, you know, you look under the microscope and see.\n",
      "[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.360]  So he was a great liver pathologist.\n",
      "[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:28.680]  So he has actually written a paper where he has mentioned that cirrhosis can regress provided\n",
      "[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.200]  you actually halt the cause of cirrhosis.\n",
      "[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:36.080]  For example, what he did was when he looked at patients who were on hepatitis B medications\n",
      "[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:40.520]  before and after, he found out that patients when they took hepatitis B medications for\n",
      "[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:46.720]  longer duration, the cirrhosis and the fibrosis scars were actually resolving with just hepatitis\n",
      "[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:51.760]  B management and patients who are on alcohol, when they stopped alcohol, their fibrosis\n",
      "[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.800]  was reversing.\n",
      "[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:57.080]  So he wrote a big paper at that time, which was like two decades back.\n",
      "[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:02.600]  And he mentioned that cirrhosis is reversible and it goes into something known as regression\n",
      "[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.320]  and new liver cells actually are regenerated in areas where the fibrosis and the scars\n",
      "[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.600]  get dissolved.\n",
      "[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:13.840]  So which means the traditional thinking of cirrhosis not getting resolved was there since\n",
      "[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:18.680]  two and a half decades before and people still don't realize that and they are still stuck\n",
      "[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:21.520]  with the dogma saying that cirrhosis is reversible.\n",
      "[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.200]  So this is something new that I could do for my patients.\n",
      "[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:29.160]  When I look back at the literature in the immediate and the past, this aspect of reversing\n",
      "[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:34.120]  cirrhosis was there initially, but now we have another molecule which we can actually\n",
      "[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.200]  use to reverse cirrhosis.\n",
      "[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.240]  So this is the important aspect of getting to know the basic science behind a particular\n",
      "[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240]  disease.\n",
      "[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.240]  You can do new things for your patients.\n",
      "[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:45.520]  And you mentioned the word dogma and that reminds me of two things and one is of course\n",
      "[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:50.640]  a classic story of Ignaz Semmelweis, the doctor who realized in the middle of the 19th century\n",
      "[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.400]  that all you need to do to avoid the majority of infections in hospitals is wash your hands\n",
      "[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.440]  properly.\n",
      "[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.480]  And he was outcast from the profession.\n",
      "[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.640]  I think he spent time in an asylum or whatever, very sad life.\n",
      "[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:05.560]  But basically he was a complete outcast because people refused to buy that and countless lives\n",
      "[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:08.640]  were lost because no one paid attention to him.\n",
      "[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.400]  And similarly, so I was diagnosed with type two diabetes last year, very overweight, cholesterol,\n",
      "[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:17.640]  type two diabetes, all of that partly because, you know, sedentary lifestyle during COVID\n",
      "[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.080]  and I let it happen to myself.\n",
      "[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:24.720]  Now, intellectually, I knew what I kind of need to do to sort of reverse it because people\n",
      "[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:27.120]  used to say type two diabetes is irreversible.\n",
      "[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.520]  And I felt that the science now shows that that's not the case.\n",
      "[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:34.480]  And I initially I went to a doc, he gave me some medication.\n",
      "[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.160]  But in three, four months, I realized that that's not the way to go.\n",
      "[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.600]  I stopped the medication, decided to only focus on my diet, and I reversed it.\n",
      "[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.880]  Like my HbA1c was 7.7, now it's 5.7, right?\n",
      "[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:50.960]  It's through diet and lifestyle, basically keto plus intermittent fasting for diabetes.\n",
      "[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:54.640]  It's not a hammer that can be used for every nail as you pointed out on Twitter.\n",
      "[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.920]  But for that, and again, you know, to just to mention this, you get dogmatic resistance\n",
      "[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.840]  from people whose conception of medicine is somewhat older.\n",
      "[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:08.240]  They're like, no, you can only manage diabetes, you can't reverse it, and so on and so forth.\n",
      "[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:12.800]  And I'll be giving them books and trying to explain and giving links to research and saying,\n",
      "[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.840]  no, read this paper, read that paper.\n",
      "[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:19.080]  How dangerous is how dangerous is this kind of dogma?\n",
      "[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.000]  Because I think a lot of the medicines that 10 years ago would have been standard and\n",
      "[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.160]  say something like type two, actually don't do anything for the problem at all, they might\n",
      "[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.360]  even make it worse.\n",
      "[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:29.680]  That is true.\n",
      "[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.080]  I think this this kind of traditional beliefs, I mean, I'm talking about scientific, you\n",
      "[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:39.200]  know, traditional, older scientific traditional beliefs, where you actually say that, you\n",
      "[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:43.400]  know, cirrhosis cannot be reversed, or I mean, like, for example, diabetes cannot be reversed\n",
      "[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.520]  or controlled just with diet and things like that.\n",
      "[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:53.040]  It impacts the patient population, because the new information is always hopeful for\n",
      "[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.040]  the patient.\n",
      "[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:58.480]  For example, if I keep saying that cirrhosis is reversible, 10 years, 20 years down the\n",
      "[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.520]  lane, that is going to affect my patients negatively.\n",
      "[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:06.080]  But if I tell them that, you know, there are studies that say that this particular drug\n",
      "[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.320]  can reverse your cirrhosis.\n",
      "[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:11.200]  And there are studies which say that if you lose weight, or if you stop drinking, or if\n",
      "[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.400]  you take treatment for hepatitis B, your cirrhosis can get reversed.\n",
      "[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.840]  So they have something to look forward to, they have something to add on from their own\n",
      "[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.480]  point of view, instead of just prescription medicines.\n",
      "[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:24.960]  You know, medicine is not just about pushing pills into the patient, it's a lot of things.\n",
      "[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.160]  And I think getting to know something that is updated in a particular area, which we\n",
      "[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:34.040]  thought was redundant or stuck like that for life.\n",
      "[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.160]  It's like a fresh breath of air for both the doctor and the patient.\n",
      "[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:42.640]  So when that particular doctor actually, he was a nice guy, I mean, on Twitter, he initially\n",
      "[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.720]  came out a little bit of in the sense that like I was a clown, you know, he was joking\n",
      "[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.920]  with me saying that, you know, you what are you saying, you're actually going against\n",
      "[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:54.600]  what is the current belief in medical practice, are you calling yourself a scientist and things\n",
      "[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.600]  like that he was telling.\n",
      "[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:00.200]  Then I showed him the data in the DMs, I messaged him, I did not do it on this thing, I messaged\n",
      "[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:02.800]  him in the DM saying that my paper is this and this.\n",
      "[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.560]  He was like shell shocked.\n",
      "[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:09.920]  He was like, I never knew this stuff actually existed and you can actually reverse cirrhosis.\n",
      "[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:15.200]  And he is now a better doctor than before, because he's going to tell his patients and\n",
      "[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.840]  he's going to know, I mean, and his patients are going to know more about their disease\n",
      "[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:22.560]  conditions in a better way now.\n",
      "[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:27.540]  But there are other doctors who still won't take my or even open my research links.\n",
      "[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:30.220]  And they still keep talking, saying that, you know, I'm wrong.\n",
      "[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:33.560]  And cirrhosis is irreversible because it is written in a textbook.\n",
      "[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.440]  Textbooks are not everything, you know, you have journal entries, which are updated textbooks\n",
      "[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.240]  get updated every five or six years only.\n",
      "[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:41.200]  So it's not like the final word and everything.\n",
      "[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:44.860]  And those kind of doctors are actually harmful for the patient society.\n",
      "[01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:49.120]  And I'll say this without any percussions, I mean, any regrets.\n",
      "[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.440]  I don't think such doctors deserve being doctors continuously like this.\n",
      "[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:59.000]  I mean, every doctor must strive and look for something new for their patients.\n",
      "[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.160]  And which is why I keep saying that, you know, a doctor should not be a doctor, should be\n",
      "[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:03.680]  a doctor scientist.\n",
      "[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.400]  And that actually helps the patient.\n",
      "[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.840]  Because when you are actually looking at the clinical research point of view, it makes\n",
      "[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:13.320]  you a better person from your patient's perspective, because you're always looking at something\n",
      "[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.720]  new for your patients.\n",
      "[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:20.840]  And this is exactly what happened when I started doing work on alcoholic liver disease.\n",
      "[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:26.400]  So we have a group of patients where they have severe alcoholic liver disease known\n",
      "[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.320]  as alcoholic hepatitis.\n",
      "[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:32.520]  And alcoholic hepatitis patients, if you look at the recommended treatment or approved treatment,\n",
      "[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.520]  there is none.\n",
      "[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:37.720]  There are no approved treatments for severe alcohol associated hepatitis.\n",
      "[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.600]  There is a recommended treatment, which is a short course of steroids that will reduce\n",
      "[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:46.440]  their jaundice and hepatitis, and it will give them benefit for one month only.\n",
      "[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.600]  Beyond one month, they're back to square one, a lot of them will require a liver transplant.\n",
      "[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.600]  So the only curative treatment is a liver transplant.\n",
      "[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:56.880]  Now the problem is that these patients are heavy drinkers.\n",
      "[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:02.440]  They're sick, and a liver transplantation may not be a good option to start with, because\n",
      "[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.440]  they can get infected.\n",
      "[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:07.480]  Like my first patient, he was actually an alcoholic hepatitis patient.\n",
      "[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:13.400]  And what happened was that when I looked at such patients, and Kerala is replete with\n",
      "[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.480]  alcoholic liver disease, because it's one of the states where there is maximum amount\n",
      "[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:17.480]  of drinking.\n",
      "[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:23.280]  I think we have about three or five times more drinking than the national average in\n",
      "[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:24.600]  Kerala.\n",
      "[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:27.640]  And alcoholic hepatitis is always a challenge to treat.\n",
      "[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:33.240]  So what happened was that a few years back, I think this was in 2015-2016, when I entered\n",
      "[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:39.800]  into DM, we are given the choice of, option of choosing our thesis topics.\n",
      "[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:45.040]  So I mean, every DM, super specialty course has one thesis topic.\n",
      "[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.040]  We had two.\n",
      "[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.640]  So we had to select two thesis topics.\n",
      "[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:54.520]  So when I, when my professor, Sarin told me to look at things out of the box, I was just\n",
      "[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:57.200]  looking at alcohol, hepatitis and things like that.\n",
      "[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:05.200]  And I got two papers from Europe, both the authors were women, one, her name is Lopez,\n",
      "[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:13.160]  Lopez and colleagues, and another lady from France, they did some work in animal models\n",
      "[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.760]  and showed that in the presence of alcohol.\n",
      "[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:19.360]  So what they did was they fed these small animals, I mean, you actually feed, there\n",
      "[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:25.520]  is a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease where you feed a mouse alcohol intermittently\n",
      "[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:28.760]  and they develop alcoholic liver disease and then you can study it.\n",
      "[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:33.560]  So they started feeding animals, small animals, a little bit of alcohol, and they found out\n",
      "[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:39.800]  that while the alcoholic hepatitis was developing in these animals, the change that they actually\n",
      "[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:45.040]  found out was that the bacteria inside their intestines were also changing.\n",
      "[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:50.000]  So the good bacteria became bad bacteria in the presence of alcohol and that bad bacteria\n",
      "[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.440]  and its functions and its metabolites and its products, that is what harmed the liver\n",
      "[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:57.300]  to cause alcoholic hepatitis.\n",
      "[01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:03.880]  So what they did was they gave good bacteria to these animals and found out that the alcoholic\n",
      "[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.360]  liver disease actually reduced.\n",
      "[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:11.400]  So this is what later on became stool transplantation in my patients.\n",
      "[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:15.020]  So I took that basic science data and I applied it in humans.\n",
      "[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:19.520]  So what we did was we took about 8 to 10 severe alcoholic liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:25.200]  patients and we took healthy people, we took their stool, collected their stool, healthy\n",
      "[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:31.240]  people's stool and we processed the stool and we gave that stool through a tube to the\n",
      "[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.740]  alcoholic hepatitis patients.\n",
      "[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:36.960]  So this was known as a stool transplantation and I was the first to do it in the world\n",
      "[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:37.960]  in liver disease.\n",
      "[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:38.960]  You were the first to do it in the world?\n",
      "[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:39.960]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:40.960]  Wow.\n",
      "[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:44.580]  So we did the first alcoholic stool transplantation in severe alcoholic liver disease in the world.\n",
      "[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:49.480]  And what we found out was that the patients who received a healthy stool, rich in good\n",
      "[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:55.240]  bacteria from healthy donors, their jaundice reduced, their hepatitis reduced, their alcoholic\n",
      "[01:53:55.240 --> 01:54:00.400]  liver disease reversed and they came out of the transplant listing.\n",
      "[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:04.060]  So they never needed liver transplantation after that.\n",
      "[01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:07.940]  So the stool transplantation protocol was born there as part of my thesis.\n",
      "[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:12.440]  So that is published in the official journal of American Gastroenterological Association\n",
      "[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.240]  known as Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology in 2018.\n",
      "[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:20.440]  So we published that paper and from there onwards we started this work on modulating\n",
      "[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:24.920]  the intestinal bacteria to improve outcomes in alcoholic liver disease and I think we\n",
      "[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:28.660]  have published more than four to five original papers on that topic.\n",
      "[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:33.160]  And the American Gastroenterology Association has actually mentioned that in patients with\n",
      "[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:38.320]  severe alcoholic liver disease, if there are no options for medical treatment and they\n",
      "[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.880]  have no options for a liver transplant, this is a salvage option.\n",
      "[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:47.200]  So you can actually save them, prevent them from dying by giving stool transplantation.\n",
      "[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.080]  And this happened because we went back and looked at basic science.\n",
      "[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:52.080]  This is mind blowing.\n",
      "[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:55.280]  You know, some of my friends were speculating the other day that which of my guests is going\n",
      "[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.800]  to win the Nobel Prize first and all the names we came up with, you know, Karthik Mullidharan\n",
      "[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:03.440]  and Ajay Shah was all economics related names, but I'm feeling that, hey, you know, maybe\n",
      "[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.440]  you're the guy medicine.\n",
      "[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:09.560]  I mean, I mean, this is something new from a liver disease perspective, but I would like\n",
      "[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:15.480]  to say that stool transplantation was actually done by traditional Chinese monks many, many,\n",
      "[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:16.720]  many, many centuries ago.\n",
      "[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:17.720]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:22.680]  So what they used to do was they wanted to treat sick kids with dysentery or diarrhea.\n",
      "[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:27.360]  They used to give fresh stool samples from healthy kids, just put them in water and feed\n",
      "[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.360]  them.\n",
      "[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.160]  That was known as yellow soup at the time.\n",
      "[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.800]  And they used to directly consume the stool from healthy kids.\n",
      "[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:35.480]  And this is well documented in Chinese traditional Chinese literature.\n",
      "[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:36.600]  So I'm confused about this.\n",
      "[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:40.520]  I can understand now how it worked, like why it worked.\n",
      "[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:43.400]  But what was their theory for why they are doing this?\n",
      "[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:45.800]  I think it was as observation.\n",
      "[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:49.040]  I mean, everything like if you look at any of the traditional practices, everything was\n",
      "[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.040]  observation.\n",
      "[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.280]  So I think at some point they observed that if you actually, I mean, everything has to\n",
      "[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:59.120]  I mean, if you look at the principles that guide treatment long back, it's mostly everything\n",
      "[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.240]  was gut derived.\n",
      "[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.320]  So they say that, you know, the fire in your belly is not good or the fire is too much.\n",
      "[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.480]  So you have to extinguish the fire.\n",
      "[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:08.280]  I mean, these are the kind of treatments that used to matter, the humoral theory, things\n",
      "[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:09.280]  like that.\n",
      "[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:16.040]  So as part of that, I think a dysentery or a diarrhea sick child had some abnormal humors\n",
      "[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.240]  and fire in the belly.\n",
      "[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:22.040]  So to improve that, they gave good fire from the other kid, you know, maybe that is how\n",
      "[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:23.320]  they thought at that time.\n",
      "[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:27.600]  But now we know why it works because of the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria.\n",
      "[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.840]  And there is this surgeon.\n",
      "[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:32.000]  What he did was in 1950s.\n",
      "[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.880]  He was seeing a lot of patients post-surgery on antibiotics who are developing something\n",
      "[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:42.280]  known as pseudomembranous colitis, which is an opportunistic infection that happens in\n",
      "[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.680]  patients in the post-surgical period, critically ill patients in the ICU.\n",
      "[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:51.760]  So your large intestine gets infected by this particular bacteria known as Clostridium difficile.\n",
      "[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.480]  C. difficile is its name.\n",
      "[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:58.240]  And it causes torrential diarrhea and a lot of patients actually die with it because of\n",
      "[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.280]  that severe diarrhea and infection.\n",
      "[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.560]  Their large intestine gets completely ulcerated and destroyed.\n",
      "[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:06.720]  So what his name is Ben Iceman, the surgeon's name.\n",
      "[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:10.960]  So what Ben Iceman did was he took this idea from traditional Chinese medicine.\n",
      "[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:17.320]  And what he did was he took fresh stool samples from his, I mean, the family members made\n",
      "[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:23.640]  it into an enema and gave this fresh, good stool enema to these patients and found out\n",
      "[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:28.120]  that their diarrhea drastically reduced and their Clostridium difficile infection reduced\n",
      "[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:29.120]  and they survived.\n",
      "[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:30.800]  They did not die.\n",
      "[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:32.480]  And he published that.\n",
      "[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:38.920]  Now fast forward few decades, two to three decades later, a lot of work at the basic\n",
      "[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:43.400]  science level was happening on gut microbiota, which is basically the total name that we\n",
      "[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.900]  give for all the microorganisms in the gut.\n",
      "[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:49.360]  So when this work happened, they found out that, you know, patients with Clostridium\n",
      "[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:55.540]  difficile infection had a totally different kind of gut microbiota versus a healthy person.\n",
      "[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:59.560]  So they decided that, you know, there is this particular group of Clostridium difficile\n",
      "[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:02.400]  infection, which do not respond to medicines at all.\n",
      "[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.080]  So you give them antibiotics, they get worse, they don't improve.\n",
      "[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:06.360]  It comes back again and again.\n",
      "[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.440]  And those are the patients who die.\n",
      "[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:13.440]  So what they did was they did a randomized, I mean, this is like how we test a hypothesis,\n",
      "[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:14.440]  right?\n",
      "[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.800]  You do randomized control trials.\n",
      "[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:22.000]  So this young physician from Belgium, her name is Els Van Nood, she and her group did\n",
      "[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.040]  a randomized control trial and they gave one group of patients with recurrent severe C\n",
      "[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:33.000]  difficile infection, healthy stool through a tube put in the nose or through the endoscope\n",
      "[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.920]  into the small intestine, fresh stool samples with good bacteria, and another group they\n",
      "[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:41.000]  gave placebo, which is sham treatment.\n",
      "[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.520]  They actually stopped that trial halfway through before they actually reached the sample size\n",
      "[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:52.120]  because every person who received good stool showed immense improvement, rapid improvement\n",
      "[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:56.280]  from their symptoms and complete resolution of C difficile infection.\n",
      "[01:58:56.280 --> 01:59:01.240]  And so the stool transplant actually was first approved by the FDA for recurrent C difficile\n",
      "[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.720]  infection.\n",
      "[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.640]  And later on, when other scientists started looking at liver disease patients, they found\n",
      "[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:10.600]  out that this gut microbiome thing works in liver disease also.\n",
      "[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:15.040]  And that is where those two other researchers found out that alcoholic liver disease can\n",
      "[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:20.160]  improve with good bacteria, which I applied first in humans.\n",
      "[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.220]  So this is the story of stool transplant.\n",
      "[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:26.360]  So this is actually already approved by FDA for a particular condition, not recommended\n",
      "[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:30.080]  for any other condition, but we are doing it as a research protocol and as a salvage\n",
      "[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:34.080]  therapy to keep patients alive in severe alcoholic habitats.\n",
      "[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:37.640]  Yeah, you know, I've always said that, hey, I don't take shit from anyone.\n",
      "[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:41.400]  But you know, if I ever get lizard liver disease, maybe I will.\n",
      "[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:45.280]  Couple of questions before we go into the break, just to sort of finish these strains\n",
      "[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:46.280]  of thought.\n",
      "[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:50.520]  And one is that you mentioned how, you know, the hypothecation, doctor scientist, how it's\n",
      "[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.600]  a good thing.\n",
      "[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:56.880]  And would it be fair to say that doctor student, a different hypothecation, doctor student,\n",
      "[01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:01.080]  like if you're learning all your life, if you're making that effort, that's also important\n",
      "[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:06.280]  that all of us, regardless of what field we are in, should have that hunger for learning,\n",
      "[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:08.800]  because that's how we'll be the best at what we do.\n",
      "[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:13.000]  Yeah, I think doctors are all inherently students for life.\n",
      "[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.760]  I mean, every doctor should be.\n",
      "[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:20.560]  I think what differentiate being a student from being a scientist is that the student\n",
      "[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:24.120]  will learn what is given to that, what is given to you.\n",
      "[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:27.680]  So you'll go read guidelines, you'll go read things like that.\n",
      "[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:30.540]  But a scientist will actually be more curious.\n",
      "[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:34.000]  So they will want to actually challenge the guidelines or think out of the box.\n",
      "[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.540]  So I think that is the difference between being a student and being a scientist.\n",
      "[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:41.280]  And every doctor should be a student because you have to read about new stuff, new treatment\n",
      "[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:42.960]  options, everything they'll have to do.\n",
      "[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:47.800]  For example, in liver diseases also, every day new new trials come, new new treatments\n",
      "[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:48.800]  come.\n",
      "[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:54.080]  For example, hepatitis C, a decade back, it was so difficult to treat, it was a painful\n",
      "[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.080]  treatment.\n",
      "[02:00:55.080 --> 02:01:00.120]  You have to take multiple injections called interferon, lasting 24 to 48 weeks, severe\n",
      "[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:01.380]  side effects and everything.\n",
      "[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:08.280]  And then suddenly one day, direct acting antivirals came, DAA, which are just simple capsules.\n",
      "[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:13.040]  You pop in once or twice a day for three months and your virus is gone.\n",
      "[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.680]  So that kind of learning is there as a student and doctors know about it because nobody treats\n",
      "[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:19.560]  hepatitis C with those injections anymore.\n",
      "[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:22.000]  Every doctor treats with this particular capsule.\n",
      "[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.140]  But what is different is that how can you improve on these treatments?\n",
      "[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:29.360]  So that if you have a scientist mind, only you can do.\n",
      "[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:30.360]  That's wonderful.\n",
      "[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:34.600]  And finally, before we go in for the break, you know, one of the eloquent pieces you've\n",
      "[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:38.360]  written for the Morning Context, and I'll of course link all your columns and your YouTube\n",
      "[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.000]  channel and all of that from the show notes.\n",
      "[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.240]  But one of the powerful pieces you wrote for them was about alcohol and you've been speaking\n",
      "[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:48.440]  about, you know, alcoholic sort of liver disease and all of that.\n",
      "[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:52.400]  And a point that you've made eloquently is that there is no amount of alcohol which is\n",
      "[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:53.400]  good for you.\n",
      "[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:57.160]  You know, there is this myth that ha, you know, one tipple a day is fine, is good for\n",
      "[02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:59.760]  the health, is good for the heart, all of that.\n",
      "[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:03.240]  And the point that you are making forcefully having studied it and worked with patients\n",
      "[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:06.560]  all your life is that no, you know, no amount is good for you.\n",
      "[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.880]  Tell me a little bit about that.\n",
      "[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:12.400]  So when we talk about the traditional belief that moderate consumption of alcohol, especially\n",
      "[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:19.680]  wine, people say, or even spirits, proper hard liquor, about one or two drinks a day\n",
      "[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:21.520]  is going to be, is going to be good for you.\n",
      "[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:23.640]  It's good for your health, they say, everybody.\n",
      "[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:26.480]  But you have to define what it is good for, right?\n",
      "[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:31.400]  So studies have shown that it is good for only a particular condition, which is basically\n",
      "[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:33.800]  your coronary artery disease, your heart disease.\n",
      "[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:38.160]  A particular aspect in heart disease is what it is found to reduce.\n",
      "[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:43.360]  But the same amount or even the, even a lesser amount of that alcohol can actually promote\n",
      "[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.740]  10, 20 other problems in you.\n",
      "[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:51.720]  So if you look at alcohol, yes, there may be some benefit that you've seen in studies,\n",
      "[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:54.040]  but the risk far outweigh the benefits.\n",
      "[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:57.400]  So when you look at something that is, when you say that something is going to be useful\n",
      "[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.160]  for you, it has to be from risk benefit ratio.\n",
      "[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:08.360]  Like for example, 10 people drive without a seatbelt and 10 people drive with seatbelt.\n",
      "[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.960]  And you look at the 10 people who drive without seatbelt, they get into a crash, eight of\n",
      "[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:13.960]  them died.\n",
      "[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:17.200]  And out of the other 10 who had a seatbelt, all of them survived.\n",
      "[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:20.860]  So if you look at the risk benefit ratio, wearing a seatbelt is always good.\n",
      "[02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:27.120]  If it's just the opposite, like for example, if you have, I always say this to my patients,\n",
      "[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:33.480]  like if you, if you have a particular intervention, for example, in this situation, we're talking\n",
      "[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:34.880]  about alcohol, drinking alcohol.\n",
      "[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:39.320]  So if you have a particular intervention, if you have to look at everything that happens\n",
      "[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:43.680]  around that intervention, right, alcohol is not the only thing that we are not just looking\n",
      "[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:47.360]  at the heart, we're looking at the liver, we're looking at other organ systems also.\n",
      "[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:51.840]  And studies have actually shown that single exposure to alcohol in women, that is even\n",
      "[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:57.880]  one drink per day, or even up to three drinks or three to four drinks in a week, can actually\n",
      "[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:01.640]  substantially increase the chances of getting cancer, breast cancer.\n",
      "[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.480]  So are you going to protect your heart at the risk of getting breast cancer?\n",
      "[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:07.640]  I mean, that risk is still there.\n",
      "[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:12.440]  So that is why I say there is no safe level of alcohol, because you cannot call it safe,\n",
      "[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:16.720]  you can only call it safe, if it actually is going to have that single impact, which\n",
      "[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:19.680]  is going to protect your heart without any other issues.\n",
      "[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:21.680]  But it's not like that you have it will protect your heart.\n",
      "[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:25.400]  Yes, maybe in some studies, it has shown, but it will cause umpteen other problems around\n",
      "[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:26.400]  it.\n",
      "[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:28.800]  So that is why I say no alcohol level is safe.\n",
      "[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:29.800]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:35.640]  And I'm going to ask all my listeners to please, especially if they drink, to, you know, read\n",
      "[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:37.320]  that article, which I'll link from the show notes.\n",
      "[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.160]  And that's a great point that it might help you in one thing, but you got to look at all\n",
      "[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:42.000]  the other shit that it's doing.\n",
      "[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.520]  Now, my question then is that, you know, while reading about diet and nutrition, one of those\n",
      "[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:52.840]  sort of big scandals I came across was all through the 50s and 60s, a lot of the studies,\n",
      "[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:58.440]  which showed that sugar was fine, and fat was an enemy was funded by the sugar lobby\n",
      "[02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:01.280]  in the US, which, you know, no one at the time knew.\n",
      "[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.120]  And is it then the case that today, the alcohol lobby might be funding the publication of\n",
      "[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:11.520]  news pieces like this, which will, you know, cherry pick one sort of particular context\n",
      "[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.120]  in which alcohol may be good for you, but not talk about all of the others.\n",
      "[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:16.320]  So is that part of the case?\n",
      "[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:17.960]  Or is it just sloppy journalism?\n",
      "[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:23.960]  Um, I mean, if at all it was funded, or paid for, we would never know, because I don't\n",
      "[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:25.800]  think anybody would disclose so much.\n",
      "[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:32.280]  But I think a lot of it has to do with sloppy journalism, 100% like, for example, smoking.\n",
      "[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:37.240]  Smoking actually reduces your chances of getting Alzheimer's disease is great, right?\n",
      "[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:43.000]  But then it causes so much of the other cancers, you'll die of lung cancer before you get Alzheimer's.\n",
      "[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  Exactly.\n",
      "[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.520]  Or you will, you will have enough to remember that you're dying of lung cancer, you know,\n",
      "[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:50.360]  you'll not lose your memory.\n",
      "[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:51.720]  That's even worse.\n",
      "[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:53.300]  And same same thing.\n",
      "[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:58.120]  If you look at there was a study on beer, and there is a study on wine.\n",
      "[02:05:58.120 --> 02:06:02.040]  And very interestingly, there was a study that was published in Lancet, which actually\n",
      "[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:09.080]  said that if you if people who are above the age of 40, if they have moderate alcohol consumption,\n",
      "[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:14.040]  it actually improves their chances of getting reduces their chances of getting metabolic\n",
      "[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:16.720]  syndrome and other heart related problems.\n",
      "[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:22.400]  But if you drink, if you're drinking when you're below age of 40, it causes more trouble.\n",
      "[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:24.400]  So that distinction also they made.\n",
      "[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:27.800]  But the problem is that all of these studies are all observational.\n",
      "[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:31.440]  It's not like they're actually asking people to drink and then following them up.\n",
      "[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:33.600]  You cannot have a prospective trial on alcohol use.\n",
      "[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:34.600]  It's impossible.\n",
      "[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:36.120]  So these are all observational trials.\n",
      "[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:38.320]  And a lot of confounders are there.\n",
      "[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:41.840]  So for example, they might not have looked at other issues that are propping up in these\n",
      "[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:45.760]  patients, for example, cancers, how many of them develop cancers, how many of them developed\n",
      "[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:49.760]  other complications of alcohol use, I mean, none of these actually looked into that part\n",
      "[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:52.500]  is not spoken about.\n",
      "[02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:53.880]  That is the problem with that study.\n",
      "[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:59.060]  Now when a journalist actually looks at that study, they will not talk about these issues.\n",
      "[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:01.560]  They will just talk about what the study conclusion is.\n",
      "[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:05.000]  If you are more than 40, drinking alcohol will help you.\n",
      "[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:10.120]  This is the biggest problem because as journalists, I think, I mean, especially as medical journalists,\n",
      "[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:15.560]  what they should do is to, they should know, learn how to critique that paper also.\n",
      "[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:16.760]  That is exactly what we do.\n",
      "[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:20.120]  So you can actually see that in a lot of these journals, they have a section known as letter\n",
      "[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:21.400]  to editor.\n",
      "[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:26.840]  So when the letters to editor are actually critiques of published papers, and it's brilliant,\n",
      "[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:30.560]  you can actually see a lot of strengths and weaknesses in those letters to editor.\n",
      "[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:35.600]  So every journalist who is going to report on a particular study, especially with controversial\n",
      "[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:39.880]  topics like alcoholism or smoking, I think they should first learn how to critique the\n",
      "[02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:46.280]  paper and then give a balanced view from the paper point of view and the weaknesses also\n",
      "[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:50.440]  because good authors always mention the weaknesses of the study also.\n",
      "[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:53.440]  There will be a limitation section in that.\n",
      "[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:55.960]  But a lot of these journalists don't even bother reading that.\n",
      "[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:59.040]  They'll just read the abstract, I think, probably, and they will not include anything from the\n",
      "[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:00.240]  limitations part.\n",
      "[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:04.640]  But once that is done, there'll be clarity because the whole aspect of moderate alcohol\n",
      "[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:08.960]  is good for you, good for you is being continuously propagated over the decades through media\n",
      "[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:13.680]  and everything without actually talking about the limitations of the study or problems around\n",
      "[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:14.680]  it.\n",
      "[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:16.680]  People still believe that a little bit of alcohol is fine.\n",
      "[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:20.600]  Actually people get offended when I tell them to, you know, stop.\n",
      "[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:22.560]  I mean, not even stop, reduce.\n",
      "[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:23.920]  They get so offended.\n",
      "[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:29.080]  So one of my friends, Prem Panekar, often talks about how one key aspect of the crisis\n",
      "[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:35.440]  in Indian media today is because of falling budgets and because of falling profitability,\n",
      "[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:39.160]  you have less and less journalists doing more and more work, which means those journalists\n",
      "[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:40.740]  are actually generalists.\n",
      "[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:42.760]  They don't know anything about any one subject.\n",
      "[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:48.200]  So they, you know, quite often in many newspapers, your person reporting on medicine and vaccines\n",
      "[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:52.280]  and all that will actually not have any understanding of medicine and it's not necessarily their\n",
      "[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:53.280]  fault.\n",
      "[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:55.560]  It's just their understanding that go and write a story and oh, you got to do two more\n",
      "[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:56.560]  stories today.\n",
      "[02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.960]  So just kind of get it done.\n",
      "[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:02.760]  And there's a phrase I love called Gelman amnesia, like Michael Crichton coined it for\n",
      "[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:07.440]  his friend Murray Gelman and Gelman amnesia is that I'll read something in the newspaper\n",
      "[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.480]  on a subject I know something about, you know, and I'll be like, what shit is this?\n",
      "[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:12.960]  They don't know what they're talking about.\n",
      "[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.080]  But everything else in the newspaper, which I can't scrutinize myself, I will take it\n",
      "[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:18.600]  as gospel, right?\n",
      "[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:20.920]  And which is the amnesia that kind of happens.\n",
      "[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:23.760]  So do you see that with medical reporting?\n",
      "[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:28.680]  Like at one level, obviously, every medical reporter cannot know as much as a specialist\n",
      "[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:29.680]  like you.\n",
      "[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:34.040]  But at another level, there is a basic degree of understanding they should have and they\n",
      "[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:36.040]  should be responsible with their words.\n",
      "[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:39.880]  So what when you read medical reporting in India, like, is it frustrating?\n",
      "[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:41.520]  What is your kind of sense?\n",
      "[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.080]  It is very frustrating.\n",
      "[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:49.720]  I mean, I don't actually read any, I mean, I don't read on a regular basis medical reporting\n",
      "[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:56.160]  in India, I mean, because but because I can understand myself about medical science, what\n",
      "[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:57.760]  is what is new and what is not.\n",
      "[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.560]  But from a common person's point of view, it's it's actually very frustrating because\n",
      "[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:07.920]  I mean, take take the example of COVID I mean, the kind of disinformation from the headlines\n",
      "[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:13.720]  to the conclusions that a lot of media pushed were actually all completely wrong.\n",
      "[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:18.800]  And I don't think any there were any good articles on pro vaccine.\n",
      "[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.760]  The pro vaccination articles were actually absolutely, I mean, almost zero in India,\n",
      "[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:23.760]  if you look at it.\n",
      "[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:29.480]  But if there was a vaccine death, a rare cause of vaccine side effect, that was like headline.\n",
      "[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:34.640]  So this is this is the problem with and that particular side effect would have happened\n",
      "[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:35.760]  one in a million.\n",
      "[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:40.120]  And that's a lack of understanding of statistics also journalists also have to, you know, understand\n",
      "[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:41.120]  it.\n",
      "[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:45.760]  Yeah, so I mean, they don't they don't know how to analyze that data from from a public\n",
      "[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:47.080]  health perspective.\n",
      "[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:52.440]  So journalism in medical journalism, I think they should inherently have something I say\n",
      "[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:55.260]  they should inherently have a compassion for public health.\n",
      "[02:10:55.260 --> 02:10:57.160]  It has to be pro public health.\n",
      "[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:00.360]  But what is happening here is everything is fear mongering.\n",
      "[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:02.840]  And I think that is what people also want to read on.\n",
      "[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:05.520]  I think I don't know if mentality has changed or something.\n",
      "[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:10.400]  But pro public health, if they keep that in mind, then they can actually give good information\n",
      "[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:13.480]  and they can stop with this disinformation that is going on.\n",
      "[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:18.120]  And a lot of that actually has to do with repeated reading and reporting on such articles.\n",
      "[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:22.280]  So I think there is no consistency in medical journalism.\n",
      "[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:26.720]  That is that I have seen, like, for example, if I mean, I can take an example of Priyanka\n",
      "[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:27.720]  Pulla.\n",
      "[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:28.960]  I mean, she is she is there on Twitter.\n",
      "[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:30.760]  She is focused on one particular aspect.\n",
      "[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:32.040]  And she does it so well.\n",
      "[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:33.040]  She's really good.\n",
      "[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:34.040]  She's excellent in that.\n",
      "[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:36.200]  I mean, she'll do that because she knows about it.\n",
      "[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.760]  She'll not go here and there.\n",
      "[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:41.320]  But if you look at other women journalists, what they do is they'll talk about one thing\n",
      "[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.320]  Monday, they'll talk about another thing another day.\n",
      "[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:46.480]  So that consistency in reading and understanding is not there.\n",
      "[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:50.240]  And I think every journalist should have a basic science understanding, a medical health\n",
      "[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:54.280]  understanding, just like a basic level doctor, like an MBBS doctor, they should know something\n",
      "[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:55.840]  about it to report it properly.\n",
      "[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:56.840]  Fair point.\n",
      "[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.600]  Let's let's take a quick commercial break.\n",
      "[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:04.200]  And when we come back on the other side, lots, lots more to talk about.\n",
      "[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:07.280]  Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?\n",
      "[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:08.680]  Well, I'd love to help you.\n",
      "[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:13.560]  Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of Clear Writing.\n",
      "[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:16.720]  An online community has now sprung up of all my past students.\n",
      "[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:21.000]  We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community\n",
      "[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  interaction.\n",
      "[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.160]  In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know\n",
      "[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:28.360]  about the craft and practice of clear writing.\n",
      "[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.280]  There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of\n",
      "[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:33.280]  it.\n",
      "[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:37.380]  The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150 and is a monthly thing.\n",
      "[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:42.280]  So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiauncut.com slash clear writing.\n",
      "[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:45.080]  That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing.\n",
      "[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.880]  Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard\n",
      "[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:53.440]  and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.\n",
      "[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:56.040]  I can help you.\n",
      "[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:57.240]  Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.\n",
      "[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:00.640]  I'm chatting with Dr. Abby Phillips on on all of his work.\n",
      "[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:06.640]  And you know, the reason I first heard about you is we were I was, you know, Dinesh Thakur\n",
      "[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:11.680]  was on my show, we did a phenomenal episode where he spoke about our medical industry.\n",
      "[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.040]  And while we were chatting after the show or in the break, or whenever we were, you\n",
      "[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:19.880]  know, both ranting and raging against the quacks that surround us, and he said, I must\n",
      "[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:21.800]  check your work out.\n",
      "[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:27.040]  And I've sort of been following you since then and intending to invite you on the show.\n",
      "[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:32.400]  And you know, before we get to talking about quacks, because I've also written against\n",
      "[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:37.000]  homeopaths and Ayurveds for a decade and a half and gotten into trouble for it.\n",
      "[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:43.560]  But before we get down to talking about that, I want to first talk about what medicine is\n",
      "[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:49.600]  like one thing which infuriates me is when we talk about medicine and alternative medicine.\n",
      "[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.960]  And my hope, the point I keep making is that there is no such thing as alternative medicine.\n",
      "[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:57.600]  There is medicine which works, which is modern medicine.\n",
      "[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.740]  And there is medicine which doesn't work or quote unquote, this stuff that doesn't work,\n",
      "[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.040]  we shouldn't even call it medicine.\n",
      "[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:09.840]  You know, this equivalence that people try to imply irritates me, I'm also for that reason,\n",
      "[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:15.120]  I hate the word allopath, because it was coined by the homeopaths as a pejorative term.\n",
      "[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:19.620]  And it makes you feel as if there is some kind of equivalence that these are two schools\n",
      "[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:20.840]  of thought.\n",
      "[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:24.440]  And no, they are not two schools of thought, you know, one is modern medicine that works\n",
      "[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:27.280]  evidence based medicine and one is not.\n",
      "[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:32.920]  So give us an understanding of what medicine means to you, what do we mean by modern medicine\n",
      "[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:35.160]  by evidence based medicine?\n",
      "[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.160]  What is medicine?\n",
      "[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:37.260]  What are our standards?\n",
      "[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:43.520]  So I think the term that everybody uses is allopathy, which is actually very wrong.\n",
      "[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.280]  I think from even doctors use it, even modern medicine doctors call themselves as allopaths,\n",
      "[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.040]  which is actually very wrong.\n",
      "[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.040]  Media uses it.\n",
      "[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:54.600]  You see everywhere in the papers, it's written allopathy, which is actually wrong.\n",
      "[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:58.560]  So what we are actually doing is, I mean, I would just call it as medicine.\n",
      "[02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:59.880]  That is what it is.\n",
      "[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:03.960]  And if they want, I mean, if people want a little more clarification on that, then I\n",
      "[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:07.880]  can call it as science based medicine or scientific medicine or evidence based medicine.\n",
      "[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:09.680]  But it is medicine.\n",
      "[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:15.600]  And medicine is something that or science based medicine is something that we have evidence\n",
      "[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.600]  for its use.\n",
      "[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:19.880]  We don't use it because we believe that it could help.\n",
      "[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.620]  We don't use it because it has been used for thousands of years.\n",
      "[02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:28.620]  And we don't use it because somebody has gotten some personal improvement or gratification\n",
      "[02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:29.620]  by using it.\n",
      "[02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:31.000]  That is not how medicine works.\n",
      "[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:38.680]  So we have a particular drug, call it as drug A, and we want to know if it reduces headache.\n",
      "[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:41.920]  So we first look at what the drug is.\n",
      "[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:46.200]  So we have a drug and we know that this drug is going to act on that particular receptor.\n",
      "[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:49.760]  And that particular receptor is going to modulate the pain.\n",
      "[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:54.120]  And what we want to know, and this we know from basic science studies and animal, small\n",
      "[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:55.120]  animal studies.\n",
      "[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:57.440]  Now we want to know if it works in humans too.\n",
      "[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:02.720]  And we apply it in small group of humans first to see if it actually reduces pain.\n",
      "[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:07.920]  If it does, then we do a larger trial, either compare it with placebo, which is a sham treatment,\n",
      "[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.480]  or compare it with a standard of care to see if it is equal to standard of care or better\n",
      "[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.180]  than that or inferior.\n",
      "[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:16.520]  And that happens with randomized control trials.\n",
      "[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:20.120]  And once you do that, what you're actually doing there is that you're controlling for\n",
      "[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:23.800]  every other factor that can actually affect the patient outcome.\n",
      "[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:25.800]  So for example, this is the problem with testimonials.\n",
      "[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:29.800]  There's a lot of people say that, oh, I've taken this drug and my throat pain has gone.\n",
      "[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:32.180]  So you take it.\n",
      "[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:36.920]  That is not right because that person could have had improvement in that throat pain even\n",
      "[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:41.240]  without taking that drug because of other factors, which we are not talking about in\n",
      "[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:42.240]  that particular story.\n",
      "[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:43.620]  That is the problem with the testimonial.\n",
      "[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:46.600]  But in a randomized control trial, such stories don't happen.\n",
      "[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:49.480]  We are controlled environment and we know exactly what is going to happen.\n",
      "[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:51.040]  And this is what we hypothesize.\n",
      "[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:53.640]  So you give the drug and it reduces pain in the humans.\n",
      "[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.640]  But side by side, we also look at other things that the drug is doing.\n",
      "[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:01.840]  It reduces pain, but is it causing any other problems for that particular group of patients?\n",
      "[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:03.660]  So we look at safety also.\n",
      "[02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:07.360]  So we have efficacy, which is effectiveness of that particular drug.\n",
      "[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:10.080]  And then we also look at the safety of that particular drug.\n",
      "[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:14.800]  Now we know that this drug has some safety issues, but it's not too bad.\n",
      "[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:19.640]  We can still use it because its effectiveness is much, much bigger than the risk associated\n",
      "[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:20.640]  with it.\n",
      "[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:22.320]  So now we start approving it.\n",
      "[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:27.600]  So we have multiple randomized trials done and then we synthesize all of these randomized\n",
      "[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:34.000]  trials known as systematic review and meta-analysis, which is actually the highest level of evidence.\n",
      "[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.560]  Some people actually go one step higher and do meta-analysis of meta-analysis, which is\n",
      "[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:40.160]  even greater evidence.\n",
      "[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:45.440]  And once that comes and that goes into recommendations or treatment guidelines.\n",
      "[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:49.720]  So people look at meta-analysis and systematic reviews and they say that this drug is good\n",
      "[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:50.720]  for headache.\n",
      "[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:53.000]  It has good effects and very minimal risk.\n",
      "[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.040]  And your FDA or whoever the regulatory authorities approves it.\n",
      "[02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.800]  Now people start taking this drug for headache.\n",
      "[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:00.800]  It doesn't end there.\n",
      "[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:02.160]  So now you have phase four.\n",
      "[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:05.720]  So in phase four, you do post-marketing surveillance.\n",
      "[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:10.040]  Because in a controlled environment, you're controlling for so many factors.\n",
      "[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:15.680]  And sometimes you're controlling it so much that you'll have a feeling of false safety\n",
      "[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:16.680]  in that.\n",
      "[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:21.120]  So when you actually give it out in the real world, you might actually find more side effects.\n",
      "[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:25.840]  And what happens is that in post-marketing, the drug companies, the regulatory authorities,\n",
      "[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:29.640]  they all see the number of patients who are developing any other major issues with that\n",
      "[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:30.640]  drug.\n",
      "[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:34.060]  And if some major new issues come, then that drug is then recalled.\n",
      "[02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:35.660]  So you don't give it anymore.\n",
      "[02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:37.520]  It goes out of the guidelines also.\n",
      "[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:39.720]  So this is what science is all about.\n",
      "[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:42.240]  Science is all about correcting itself.\n",
      "[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:44.640]  It never says that, yes, I can cure this.\n",
      "[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:45.640]  It never says that.\n",
      "[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:48.080]  That is what that term quackery comes.\n",
      "[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:50.120]  Only a quack can say that I can cure this.\n",
      "[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:51.880]  No, science never says that.\n",
      "[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:54.680]  Science will say this is the best option.\n",
      "[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:56.000]  There could be a better option.\n",
      "[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  We are finding it out.\n",
      "[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.600]  And when the better option comes, the best option is out of the window.\n",
      "[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:02.240]  And this keeps happening for ever and ever and ever.\n",
      "[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:03.240]  That is how science is.\n",
      "[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:04.400]  It's evolutionary medicine.\n",
      "[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:06.760]  This is what scientific medicine is.\n",
      "[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:10.720]  And there are a lot of drugs that have been taken out of the market because they were\n",
      "[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:13.560]  actually good in first phase one, phase two, phase three trials.\n",
      "[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:18.460]  But when it came to real world scenario, it was found to be not useful or maybe more adverse\n",
      "[02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:21.400]  events happened and it was recalled and thrown off.\n",
      "[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:26.120]  This particular aspect, the alternative medicine industry actually uses against science saying\n",
      "[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:29.920]  that, you know, look at Ayurveda and homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:32.480]  No drug has been recalled ever.\n",
      "[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.680]  But in modern medicine, you see how many drugs have been recalled.\n",
      "[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:38.920]  This is actually wrong because if there is no medicine recalled, that means you are not\n",
      "[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:39.920]  evolving.\n",
      "[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:42.800]  You are stuck in a time point.\n",
      "[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:44.280]  It's primal and primitive.\n",
      "[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:48.200]  The real medicines evolve and older medicines get chucked out.\n",
      "[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:52.420]  So this is the difference between a scientific medicine or what we call as actual medicine.\n",
      "[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:57.600]  And this is what actually is evidence based and beneficial for people.\n",
      "[02:19:57.600 --> 02:20:01.960]  So let me try to summarize, you know, why this process is important and what it used\n",
      "[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:03.400]  to be in the past.\n",
      "[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:07.880]  In the past, before science evolves, you know, we make sense of the world by telling ourselves\n",
      "[02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:09.240]  stories about it.\n",
      "[02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:11.280]  So initially you have a sun god.\n",
      "[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:14.560]  But then when you realize the earth goes around the sun and there is a solar system, you don't\n",
      "[02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:19.160]  need the sun god and you keep updating your frame of looking at the world, you keep updating\n",
      "[02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:20.160]  your stories.\n",
      "[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:25.240]  Now, initially, medical systems evolved at a time where science was nowhere near this\n",
      "[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:29.800]  advanced, no germ theory, no understanding of infections and bacteria and viruses and\n",
      "[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:31.480]  genes and all of that.\n",
      "[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:36.220]  So you come up with kind of primitive stories and you come up with kind of primitive ways\n",
      "[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:37.680]  of treating people.\n",
      "[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:43.680]  Now, people begin to believe in some of this medicine because of the following reasons.\n",
      "[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:46.720]  One of course is a placebo effect, which we know is really powerful.\n",
      "[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:50.880]  This is classic case of Henry Beecher, an American anesthetist in the World War Two\n",
      "[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:54.200]  who ran out of morphine and use salt water instead.\n",
      "[02:20:54.200 --> 02:20:58.760]  And the patient didn't know this salt water worked, which is a classic placebo effect.\n",
      "[02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:00.000]  Placebo is incredibly powerful.\n",
      "[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  That's one.\n",
      "[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.760]  The other factor that comes into play is reversion to the mean, like if I have a common cold\n",
      "[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:09.640]  is going to get better on its own, but it's you know, it's going to reach a peak, it's\n",
      "[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:12.600]  a bell curve is going to reach a peak is going to go back down is going to get better on\n",
      "[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:13.600]  its own.\n",
      "[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:17.840]  If and it is at its worst, I pop some sugar pills or I pop whatever I think is medicine\n",
      "[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:20.120]  at the time, and then it gets better.\n",
      "[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:24.600]  I will ascribe causation to that and say, I did this, it's fine.\n",
      "[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:28.600]  And the other is a confirmation bias that if you have a belief that something works\n",
      "[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:33.000]  for me, you will notice the times it works, but you will ignore the times it doesn't work\n",
      "[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:34.980]  and you will say, oh, that was whatever.\n",
      "[02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:39.440]  So a lot of this anecdotal belief that oh, this has worked for me, that has worked for\n",
      "[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:41.320]  me is a combination of these things.\n",
      "[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:45.720]  Some of the time it was placebo, some of the times it just got better on its own as most\n",
      "[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:49.600]  things do, because the human body can be self healing in so many ways.\n",
      "[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:53.040]  And some of the time you're noticing the time something worked and something doesn't.\n",
      "[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:57.640]  Now what science does is that it takes these human frailties and these other factors like\n",
      "[02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:02.440]  the placebo effect out of the window, where, you know, if you have, say, a double blind\n",
      "[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:09.280]  placebo control trial, right, what that essentially means is that, you know, you have two groups,\n",
      "[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:13.960]  one is given placebo, one is given the medicine you're testing, and it's double blind, because\n",
      "[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:15.280]  neither knows what they're getting.\n",
      "[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:18.100]  So the placebo effect, the power of belief can't come into play.\n",
      "[02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:21.040]  And then you got to beat placebo, or as you pointed out, then you got to beat whatever\n",
      "[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:25.980]  the standard treatment is, if that is being measured against.\n",
      "[02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:31.000]  And this goes through various phases, you have multiple trials, you have meta studies,\n",
      "[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.320]  after the medicine is released, you see what it's doing in the real world.\n",
      "[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:38.840]  And alternative medicine does not put itself through this, it hides behind the veil of\n",
      "[02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:43.160]  tradition and say that, oh, it's always, you know, this stuff has always worked and all\n",
      "[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:44.160]  of that.\n",
      "[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:47.640]  And, you know, is this kind of a correct summation of\n",
      "[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:49.920]  This is exactly the right summation.\n",
      "[02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:56.320]  And I think alternative medicine, to some extent, has been studied in randomized control trials,\n",
      "[02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:58.080]  and has failed it.\n",
      "[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:02.280]  And there are no good meta analysis also, I mean, you don't have the highest level of\n",
      "[02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:05.720]  anything in alternative medicine, because alternative medicine to start with, they don't\n",
      "[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:07.400]  have a proper hypothesis.\n",
      "[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:13.120]  Because if I give an example of homeopathy, for example, homeopathy practitioners are\n",
      "[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:17.320]  not competent to diagnose the disease, because what they do is they treat the symptoms that\n",
      "[02:23:17.320 --> 02:23:20.120]  because that is what they say, right, like cures like.\n",
      "[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:24.120]  So if a substance causes that particular effect in the human, that substance will actually\n",
      "[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:25.120]  cure it.\n",
      "[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:26.120]  That is what they say.\n",
      "[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:30.200]  So they essentially treat a group of symptoms, and they call it as totality of symptoms.\n",
      "[02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:35.080]  And that has been wrongly interpreted as root cause, which is not the root cause.\n",
      "[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:39.600]  And when they treat only the symptoms, you are actually missing the forest for the trees.\n",
      "[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:45.920]  And that actually, what happens is that when you treat based on homeopathy principles,\n",
      "[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:50.640]  for example, you want to treat, let's say, hepatitis B. So hepatitis B virus can present\n",
      "[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:54.760]  with cirrhosis, it can present with jaundice, it can present with a fluid in the abdomen,\n",
      "[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:59.640]  which is known as ascites, it can present in very different ways, even as liver cancer,\n",
      "[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:00.720]  it can present.\n",
      "[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:05.960]  So if you ask a homeopath to apply their principles and treat for hepatitis B, they can never\n",
      "[02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:10.080]  treat hepatitis B, because they will not know that this is the virus that is causing it.\n",
      "[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:14.360]  They'll be just treating what the patient will have as a symptom.\n",
      "[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:19.480]  And you cannot apply that in a scientific study setting, because when you actually study\n",
      "[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:22.920]  scientific medicine, you need to have a proper aim, you have to have an objective, you have\n",
      "[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:25.680]  to have a primary outcome and a secondary outcome.\n",
      "[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:31.000]  And when you apply these homeopathy principles, you can never actually materialize these outcomes\n",
      "[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.420]  and primary measures and everything because you are actually only treating the symptoms.\n",
      "[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:39.080]  So that is why when people say that research is lacking in homeopathy or Ayurveda, it is\n",
      "[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:40.080]  not lacking.\n",
      "[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:41.600]  It is because you can't research it.\n",
      "[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:43.960]  You can't research it because it is unscientific.\n",
      "[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:46.000]  We can only research scientific principles.\n",
      "[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  And just for the sake of our listeners, just take us into what the methodology of homeopathy\n",
      "[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.700]  because what I find so amusing is that their idea is that the more you dilute a substance,\n",
      "[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:03.040]  the more powerful it is, which of course, if you've studied basic chemistry, you know\n",
      "[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:04.360]  it as nonsense.\n",
      "[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:10.000]  And James Randi once asked a mathematician, Martin Gardner, that what it amounts to a\n",
      "[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.720]  particular kind of dilution.\n",
      "[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:17.000]  And this is what Martin Gardner said, where Martin Gardner said, quote, that's equivalent\n",
      "[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:22.240]  to taking one grain of rice, crushing it to a powder, dissolving it in a sphere of water\n",
      "[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:26.520]  the size of the solar system, with the sun at the center and the orbit of Pluto at the\n",
      "[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:31.520]  outside, and then repeating that process 2 million times, stop quote.\n",
      "[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.880]  So you know, the classic homeopathic dilutions for what are supposed to be the strongest\n",
      "[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:40.360]  medicines, it won't even be a single molecule of the substance, which is supposed to be\n",
      "[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:41.360]  treating you.\n",
      "[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:44.000]  You've got the memory of water and other woo-woo.\n",
      "[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.880]  And my first point about all of these systems, homeopathy is still relatively recent among\n",
      "[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:54.840]  the middle of the 19th century, but the rest of the stuff is centuries old, is that, and\n",
      "[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:58.120]  it's a point that you and Krishnashok have made in this great Instagram video, which\n",
      "[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:02.880]  I'll also link to from the show notes, is that all of these systems are okay as observational\n",
      "[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:09.120]  systems, but they cannot possibly have a theory of the world that is accurate, because there's\n",
      "[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:15.560]  no germ theory then, there is no understanding of bacteria, viruses, the human body, how\n",
      "[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:21.600]  genes work, you cannot have a theory of how something works, and if you have, if all your\n",
      "[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:26.480]  first principles are wrong, if they're all fiction, how can you treat anything?\n",
      "[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:27.960]  How can you even test it?\n",
      "[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:32.140]  So that is the whole point about homeopathy, homeopathy is actually, I mean, it's wonderful\n",
      "[02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:37.040]  if you want to actually have some entertainment, if you read about homeopathy, it's fascinating,\n",
      "[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.800]  because I mean, when Samuel Hahnemann, who actually invented homeopathy, he did it from\n",
      "[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:47.680]  a good perspective, because at that time, allopathy, the real allopathy was treating\n",
      "[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:55.360]  patients with very hardcore practices, for example, they made people vomit, induced vomiting,\n",
      "[02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:00.120]  induced diarrhea, letting out blood, making them bleed, trepanation, that is burying,\n",
      "[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.920]  putting holes in the skull, you know, a lot of, a lot of such primal, primitive practices\n",
      "[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:10.360]  is what allopathy was, to add to that, it is still practiced in Ayurveda, by the way,\n",
      "[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:15.400]  so if somebody has to call something as allopathic, please do that to Ayurveda, because in Ayurveda,\n",
      "[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:19.600]  there is something known as panchakarma, where they actually induce vomiting and diarrhea\n",
      "[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:23.880]  and put leeches on the body to suck out blood, bad blood and good blood and stuff like that,\n",
      "[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:25.440]  which is actually allopathy.\n",
      "[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:29.760]  So allopathy exists, yes, but that is in Ayurveda, it's not modern medicine.\n",
      "[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:34.480]  And coming back to homeopathy, so he, Samuel Hahnemann saw that and that was actually harming\n",
      "[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.480]  and hurting the patients more, so he wanted a very soft version of that.\n",
      "[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:44.120]  So instead of giving strong stuff, he decided that he will give everything in a very dilute\n",
      "[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:46.160]  manner so that people can tolerate it.\n",
      "[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:49.400]  And they did, because he diluted so much that there is nothing left in it.\n",
      "[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:50.960]  So people tolerated it.\n",
      "[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:54.200]  But the whole principles were actually wrong.\n",
      "[02:27:54.200 --> 02:28:01.200]  So what happened was that, if you follow Professor Edzard Ernst on Twitter, he has written brilliantly\n",
      "[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:07.880]  that the whole aspect of like cures like came with Hahnemann's exposure to Sinkhona.\n",
      "[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:13.240]  So what happened was that, he said that if you take, for example, for malarial fevers,\n",
      "[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:16.840]  you have fever and nausea and rigor and everything.\n",
      "[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:22.720]  And when he took Sinkhona, he actually felt that, he had rigor and nausea and everything.\n",
      "[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:24.680]  But that was actually because of Sinkhonism.\n",
      "[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:28.500]  That is because of he took additional Sinkhona and that was Sinkhona poisoning.\n",
      "[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:30.680]  It is not because like cured like.\n",
      "[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:35.700]  So the whole aspect of like cures like was actually based on a mistake, a misunderstanding.\n",
      "[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:37.200]  And from there came homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.440]  So the basic principle is fallacious.\n",
      "[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:41.040]  And like can never cure like.\n",
      "[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:42.040]  It is impossible.\n",
      "[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:43.040]  Number one.\n",
      "[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:48.000]  Second is, Hahnemann said that if you dilute the substance more, then it becomes more potent.\n",
      "[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.320]  The stronger the substance is, it is less potent, which is actually wrong.\n",
      "[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:54.400]  It is against chemistry and physics principles.\n",
      "[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:55.560]  And the third thing.\n",
      "[02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:00.920]  So when people started using homeopathy and patients started getting better, better because\n",
      "[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:04.200]  of maybe placebo effect, everybody asked, how does homeopathy work then?\n",
      "[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:07.400]  I mean, there has to be a principle of mechanism of working.\n",
      "[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:11.280]  So then came the third part, which is theory of vitalism.\n",
      "[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:15.880]  He says that there is something known as vital force inside the body, which gets completely\n",
      "[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.560]  imbalanced because of whatever disease process.\n",
      "[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:22.960]  And if you do this, like cures like and, you know, give a high potency, which is high potency\n",
      "[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:26.800]  means very, very dilute stuff to people, the vital force gets balanced.\n",
      "[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:30.600]  And that is how homeopathy works, which is absolutely nonsense because you cannot measure\n",
      "[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:32.000]  or see vital force.\n",
      "[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.960]  There is nothing called vital force.\n",
      "[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:37.600]  So this vital force theory became obsolete because nobody could prove the vital force\n",
      "[02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:39.200]  theory.\n",
      "[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:42.680]  Then homeopaths thought long and hard and decided that, you know, you have to come up\n",
      "[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:43.680]  with a mechanism.\n",
      "[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:45.840]  Other people will start disbelieving them.\n",
      "[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:47.080]  Then came the water theory.\n",
      "[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:53.200]  So they said that, you know, you are succussioning the stuff so much in the vehicle, either water\n",
      "[02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:54.200]  or alcohol.\n",
      "[02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:59.320]  The active substance may not be there, but its essence is there and the water understands\n",
      "[02:29:59.320 --> 02:30:03.160]  that essence and that essence is what treats.\n",
      "[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:11.560]  So to confirm this, very interestingly, they did some theoretical and practical studies\n",
      "[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:14.360]  on it, but could never prove it, that water has memory.\n",
      "[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:15.880]  Nobody has proved it.\n",
      "[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:18.440]  So the water theory went out of the window.\n",
      "[02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:25.200]  Then science progressed and homeopaths understood that there is now something known as nanoparticles.\n",
      "[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:28.080]  So they said that, you know what, actually we were wrong about the water theory.\n",
      "[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:29.800]  It's actually nanoparticles.\n",
      "[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:30.800]  Nanoparticles is what is doing it.\n",
      "[02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:33.360]  OK, so now we can show that there are nanoparticles.\n",
      "[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:41.000]  So there was a study from IIT Bombay and this is a hilarious study where IIT Bombay experts\n",
      "[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:46.920]  showed that if you look at the most ultra-diluted homeopathic forms, it contains nanoparticles\n",
      "[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:51.640]  and the nanoparticles, they identified through some major experiments and showed that nanoparticles\n",
      "[02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:52.640]  are present.\n",
      "[02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:55.320]  So this is the reason why homeopathy works.\n",
      "[02:30:55.320 --> 02:31:03.520]  Now that same set of experiments was redone by another group in Belgium, a group of homeopaths\n",
      "[02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:07.480]  in Belgium, because even they want to know, because a big thing, right, homeopathy finally\n",
      "[02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:09.060]  has a mechanism.\n",
      "[02:31:09.060 --> 02:31:11.940]  So they did it and they found out nanoparticles.\n",
      "[02:31:11.940 --> 02:31:16.800]  But what they actually found was that when the, I mean, if you know how the homeopath\n",
      "[02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:21.120]  prepares that medicine, you know that they shake it vigorously to and fro and multiple\n",
      "[02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:22.120]  times.\n",
      "[02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:24.800]  So they found out that the nanoparticle was actually not part of the medicine.\n",
      "[02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:26.200]  It was actually part of the bottle.\n",
      "[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:30.600]  Your silica particles from the bottle and it has nothing to do with the medicine.\n",
      "[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:33.280]  So nanoparticle failed there.\n",
      "[02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:36.160]  So they didn't have nothing to hold on to.\n",
      "[02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:40.040]  Now they have brought out quantum physics.\n",
      "[02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:42.000]  So now there is a quantum theory of homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.200]  There are a lot of theories coming up.\n",
      "[02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:49.080]  So I think now once 5G comes, 7G comes, I think they'll use those terms also as a part\n",
      "[02:31:49.080 --> 02:31:50.460]  of mechanism of homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:52.480]  So this is the story behind homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:59.360]  Even now, homeopaths don't know, patients who improve personally with homeopathy don't\n",
      "[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:01.140]  realize how it worked.\n",
      "[02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:02.640]  So we don't have a mechanism.\n",
      "[02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:07.760]  We have three principles that are completely bogus, and we have medicines that contain\n",
      "[02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:09.080]  no medicine.\n",
      "[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:10.600]  So this is the story of homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:15.440]  And if people actually understand this, I don't think they will actually go for homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:17.440]  The problem is people don't understand homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:19.260]  They don't know in depth about homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:32:19.260 --> 02:32:22.400]  So if you know about it, I don't think people actually will go for it.\n",
      "[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:29.880]  So when I first came to Bombay in 94, I think around 1995, I must have fallen ill when I\n",
      "[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:34.440]  think I worked in Channel V, and I had a very bad case of chronic bronchitis, or bronchial\n",
      "[02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:35.440]  asthma.\n",
      "[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:37.600]  And it came and for two or three months, it was really bad.\n",
      "[02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:42.420]  I tried proper medicine, sad I should have to use the word proper, but we have to distinguish\n",
      "[02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:44.920]  now for this conversation and that didn't work.\n",
      "[02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:48.440]  And somebody then said, go to a homeopath and in those days, I wasn't that well read,\n",
      "[02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:49.920]  I hadn't read up so much.\n",
      "[02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:53.680]  So I went to a homeopath and after some trial and error, my thing went away.\n",
      "[02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:56.880]  So for a couple of years, I was a believer, I ascribed it to that.\n",
      "[02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:00.360]  Then later, of course, I read about it and I figured out that okay, what happened was\n",
      "[02:33:00.360 --> 02:33:05.440]  either placebo, or the thing got would have gotten better anyway over the course of time\n",
      "[02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:08.000]  as it tends to do, I also realized.\n",
      "[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.540]  So it kind of wasn't that at all.\n",
      "[02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:15.220]  But I run into so many people who are otherwise rational, who will say no, no, but it worked\n",
      "[02:33:15.220 --> 02:33:16.520]  for me, it worked for me.\n",
      "[02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:24.080]  And you know, if you just think a little deeper, you know, how can it possibly work for you?\n",
      "[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:29.040]  And one of the great myths about homeopathy is that, hey, it won't harm you.\n",
      "[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:32.840]  You know, even though sugar is poison, so sugar pills, but leaving that aside, they\n",
      "[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:34.400]  say, hey, it won't harm you.\n",
      "[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:38.280]  But my point is that if you put the economist hat on, we have a term called opportunity\n",
      "[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:43.200]  cost, you know, where you know, and there is an opportunity cost, if instead of taking\n",
      "[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:47.480]  proper medicine, which you should take, you take these useless sugar pills, then it can\n",
      "[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:51.800]  harm you because of that you should have gotten a particular treatment instead, you've relied\n",
      "[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:54.480]  on these and whatever disease you have get worse.\n",
      "[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:58.440]  And this happened in Australia where a few years ago, there was this homeopath couple\n",
      "[02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:03.840]  of Indian origin, their daughter, their child, I forget the gender, the child had eczema,\n",
      "[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:07.600]  and they tried to treat the child with homeopathy and the child died.\n",
      "[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:09.440]  And thankfully, they were imprisoned.\n",
      "[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:15.880]  But even then, it's an incredibly tragic story of how it almost sort of becomes ideological\n",
      "[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:20.880]  in the same way that if you believe in a religion, or if you adopt an ideology, you know, our\n",
      "[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:24.680]  sense of self is so tied up with it, that we cannot take a challenge to it.\n",
      "[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.120]  It is a personal challenge.\n",
      "[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:32.320]  And and you know, and I think beliefs in you know, the story we tell ourselves about the\n",
      "[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:36.760]  world can contain religion or ideology or it can contain that, hey, homeopathy is good\n",
      "[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:39.920]  for you, or Ayurveda really works and all of that.\n",
      "[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:46.000]  So when did you like, talk a little bit more about this myth, because even beyond opportunity\n",
      "[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.480]  costs, there are ways in which homeopathy is harmful and such belief is harmful.\n",
      "[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:50.480]  Tell me about that.\n",
      "[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:54.720]  I think I mean, there are three ways that homeopathy can be harmful.\n",
      "[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:59.840]  One is like you said, it drives the patient away from the real treatment.\n",
      "[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:05.720]  So for example, everybody who says that, you know, they have benefited from homeopathy\n",
      "[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:09.640]  for whatever diseases, they should understand that every disease has something known as\n",
      "[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:11.400]  a natural history.\n",
      "[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:16.840]  So for example, if you take COVID, majority of patients with COVID, they it resolves only\n",
      "[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:21.120]  if a small proportion actually develop severe COVID and there are reasons for it, risk factors\n",
      "[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:22.120]  to it.\n",
      "[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:27.880]  But otherwise, influenza or a viral infection, it happens, it takes a few days, peaks, and\n",
      "[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:32.640]  then by the seventh day, you're okay, you have cough and cold and things, it goes away.\n",
      "[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:38.400]  Now what happens is that people need outcomes and results quickly, right?\n",
      "[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:42.080]  So they'll do a lot of things initially, they'll go for all these proper treatments, everything\n",
      "[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:43.920]  in the first five days.\n",
      "[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:47.280]  And once it starts peaking, they say that, you know, we have taken this stuff for five\n",
      "[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:49.400]  days and the sixth day it is still bad.\n",
      "[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:52.080]  So now let us drop this and let us go for homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:56.440]  So they take homeopathy on the sixth day, but automatically the disease is supposed\n",
      "[02:35:56.440 --> 02:35:58.680]  to come down on the seventh day, it goes down on the seventh day.\n",
      "[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:00.440]  So there is a post hoc fallacy there.\n",
      "[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:03.160]  They think that homeopathy is what actually decreased it.\n",
      "[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.960]  Now you extrapolate this to a real disease.\n",
      "[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:07.960]  I mean, these are self limiting diseases.\n",
      "[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:11.200]  So the natural history of self limiting diseases is that they will limit themselves at some\n",
      "[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:16.080]  point and some of them will limit in a few days, some in a few weeks, some in a few months.\n",
      "[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:20.920]  But if you actually treat a disease which really requires treatment, for example, if\n",
      "[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:25.640]  I talk about hepatitis B virus infection, which actually requires antiviral treatment\n",
      "[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:30.480]  and you give homeopathy, that disease is going to flare and that disease is going to kill\n",
      "[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:33.480]  the patient because there is no proper treatment given.\n",
      "[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:37.320]  So real diseases, if you give homeopathy, you are actually driving the patient away\n",
      "[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:40.480]  from real treatments and that lands the patient in trouble.\n",
      "[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:45.560]  And second is that this is an unregulated area of alternative medicine.\n",
      "[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:47.480]  Nobody has standardized homeopathy medicines.\n",
      "[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:49.960]  A lot of companies make it, governments make it.\n",
      "[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.480]  There is no standard saying that, you know, this homeopathy from this company is equal\n",
      "[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:55.080]  to that homeopathy from that company.\n",
      "[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:56.080]  There is no standard.\n",
      "[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:57.080]  It's unregulated.\n",
      "[02:36:57.080 --> 02:37:01.520]  So we have a lot of homeopathy medicines which are either adulterated or contaminated.\n",
      "[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:07.760]  So a sensible homeopath knows that it's just water, there is no active molecule.\n",
      "[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:11.520]  And he knows that you need something active in it to work.\n",
      "[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:12.520]  So they adulterate it.\n",
      "[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:13.520]  And this is very common.\n",
      "[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:17.360]  There are a lot of studies on it, papers published on it saying that alternative medicines, especially\n",
      "[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:21.720]  homeopathy is heavily adulterated and they decide what to adulterate it with.\n",
      "[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:24.420]  So if they want to treat fever, you will have a paracetamol in it.\n",
      "[02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:28.980]  If you want to treat arthritis or some allergies, there will be steroids in it.\n",
      "[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:30.240]  So they adulterate it.\n",
      "[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:34.220]  Now the problem is that they don't actually know proper pharmacology.\n",
      "[02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:39.360]  So what they do is they adulterate it to extents that it is toxic or they adulterate it with\n",
      "[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:44.200]  old world drugs, for example, old world painkillers or anabolic steroids and things like that,\n",
      "[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:45.440]  which actually harms the patient.\n",
      "[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:50.840]  So that is how, secondly, homeopathy harms because of adulteration and contamination.\n",
      "[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:53.680]  Third is something known as poor manufacturing practices.\n",
      "[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:57.160]  So you have 200 C dilution means it's just plain water.\n",
      "[02:37:57.160 --> 02:37:59.360]  It's so diluted, you'll get nothing in it.\n",
      "[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:01.480]  But sometimes they don't actually dilute it so much.\n",
      "[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:06.160]  The manufacturing will be actually problematic, poorly manufactured and it will actually have\n",
      "[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:09.560]  parts of the mother tinger in it, the mother compound, which is actually alcohol and the\n",
      "[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:11.020]  active ingredient.\n",
      "[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:16.880]  So you'll have arsenic or lead or some toxic herb in it and that actually can produce toxicity\n",
      "[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:19.920]  in the human and this leads to adverse events.\n",
      "[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.840]  So you'll have poor manufacturing, contamination, adulteration and because homeopathy was given\n",
      "[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:30.240]  for a real disease which required real medical management, patients get harmed.\n",
      "[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:34.800]  The commonest, if you look at all the patient stories who have improved from homeopathy,\n",
      "[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:37.360]  I think number one will be allergy.\n",
      "[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:41.560]  Number one will be allergy, bronchial asthma or something to do with the skin.\n",
      "[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:46.760]  You know, that's what commonly homeopaths treat and it'll be in a child mostly.\n",
      "[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:48.720]  You know, my child got relieved with homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:51.520]  That's the commonest testimonial that you get.\n",
      "[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:56.760]  And it's very important to realize that bronchial asthma or childhood asthma or childhood allergies,\n",
      "[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.100]  they go away after eight to nine years of age.\n",
      "[02:39:00.100 --> 02:39:01.800]  So what they do is they'll give two years.\n",
      "[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.200]  First two years is when the allergies is very bad, they'll give modern medicine, everything\n",
      "[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:06.640]  is not going away.\n",
      "[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:09.680]  And the homeopath will say that homeopathy is a long drawn process.\n",
      "[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:11.960]  You have to keep giving it for years, it'll go away.\n",
      "[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:15.080]  So by the time they are five years old, they'll start homeopathy, three years they'll give,\n",
      "[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:18.000]  by the time the child is eight, nine years old, the allergy is gone.\n",
      "[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.080]  And they think it is because of homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:25.360]  So every homeopathic testimonial is actually linked to the natural history of the disease.\n",
      "[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:32.520]  Tell me any patient who has had a lung cancer or an infection with a bacteria or an infection\n",
      "[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:38.800]  with a virus like HIV or hepatitis B or hepatitis C treated with homeopathy and virus is gone\n",
      "[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:39.800]  or cancer is gone.\n",
      "[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:41.220]  You will never hear such stories.\n",
      "[02:39:41.220 --> 02:39:42.220]  You will never hear.\n",
      "[02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:47.400]  You will hear it when homeopathy is used along with cancer medication as an integrative medicine.\n",
      "[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:49.560]  That is the next fraud that they do.\n",
      "[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:50.560]  Integrative medicine.\n",
      "[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:56.400]  You mix something that works with something that doesn't work and attribute the whole\n",
      "[02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:58.200]  thing to the thing that doesn't work.\n",
      "[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:01.560]  So you have chemotherapy and radiotherapy going on and then you add homeopathy to it\n",
      "[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:03.900]  and you say that, you know, homeopathy also worked.\n",
      "[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:10.920]  So that integrative medicine part is also another story which they spin to mislead people.\n",
      "[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:17.600]  And one thing that I find kind of bizarre is that so many people treat homeopathy as\n",
      "[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:21.240]  if it is something that is a part of our tradition, right?\n",
      "[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:25.440]  It originated in Germany, Hanuman and all that, but they treat it as if it is part of\n",
      "[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:31.400]  our tradition and that you're somehow being less Indian by, you know, taking modern medicine\n",
      "[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:32.400]  from the West.\n",
      "[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:35.320]  And how do you think that happened?\n",
      "[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:36.320]  How did it?\n",
      "[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:42.320]  So I think once the alternative medicine industry is a single unit, you know, they don't distinguish\n",
      "[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:46.880]  between Ayurveda, homeopathy, even we have an Ayush, so H is at the end and A is at the\n",
      "[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:47.880]  beginning.\n",
      "[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:48.880]  So everything is together.\n",
      "[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:53.960]  So they all practice together because they have only each other to hold on to and no\n",
      "[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:55.400]  science there.\n",
      "[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:59.960]  And a lot of people wrongly attribute homeopathy as a traditional practice and they actually\n",
      "[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:02.760]  don't know about its origins or its principles.\n",
      "[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:03.760]  It's only 200 years old.\n",
      "[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:07.840]  I mean, homeopathy was written at a time when the light bulb was not invented.\n",
      "[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:09.040]  It is that old.\n",
      "[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:14.240]  But Ayurveda was like pretty much older, 2000, 3000 years back, but they all club it together.\n",
      "[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:18.160]  So you have that fake sense of traditionality that it originated from our place.\n",
      "[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:19.920]  And that is how it is being promoted also.\n",
      "[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:24.880]  You know, you promote Ayush together, Ayush promotes homeopathy, Ayush promotes Ayurveda,\n",
      "[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:26.960]  it promotes yoga, naturopathy, everything together.\n",
      "[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:32.080]  So I think that birds of a feather flock together kind of false feeling is there in the alternative\n",
      "[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:35.200]  medicine community and also among the minds of laypersons.\n",
      "[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:41.360]  You know, tell me then about Ayurveda, because Ayurveda has one, the connotation with culture\n",
      "[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:47.560]  and our tradition is much deeper, two, Ayurveda can often give a really warm sense to people\n",
      "[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:50.800]  like there are specialized stores which will sell Ayurvedic cosmetics.\n",
      "[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:55.440]  I have myself bought shampoos and soap gels from there and they are, you know, quite excellent\n",
      "[02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:01.180]  and soothing to use and you know, so that sort of softness, that comfortness is kind\n",
      "[02:42:01.180 --> 02:42:04.420]  of associated with Ayurveda.\n",
      "[02:42:04.420 --> 02:42:08.160]  But in and people will often say that this is traditional wisdom.\n",
      "[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:12.520]  Some of it has been validated by science, like the herbs we use, like turmeric is supposed\n",
      "[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:16.600]  to be good for so many things and you have a great video on that where you point out\n",
      "[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:17.680]  not quite.\n",
      "[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:22.640]  So tell me a little bit about Ayurveda then, because it would seem that belief in that\n",
      "[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:26.440]  is perhaps even more entrenched because it is not just about medicine.\n",
      "[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:29.000]  It is almost like a lifestyle thing.\n",
      "[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:34.240]  You talk about wellness, you talk about Ayurvedic spas, you know, so on and so forth.\n",
      "[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:37.840]  I mean, Ayurveda is actually the elephant in the room.\n",
      "[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:43.000]  You know, it's easy to debunk homeopathy because it has standalone bogus principles, very easy\n",
      "[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:44.360]  to debunk it.\n",
      "[02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:49.600]  But Ayurveda is very different because not only it's part of alternative medical care,\n",
      "[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:51.080]  it's considered health care.\n",
      "[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:54.840]  It has very strong traditional, religious and cultural roots.\n",
      "[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:58.720]  And of course, we are in India and India is the birthplace of it.\n",
      "[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:05.000]  And because when you have to talk about Ayurveda and when I say Ayurveda is a pseudoscience\n",
      "[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:11.480]  or it is not scientific, I mean it purely from its scientific, its principles.\n",
      "[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:15.200]  I don't mean it from, you know, I don't say it because it's from India and India is a\n",
      "[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:16.200]  developing country.\n",
      "[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:17.840]  So it is all, it's not like that.\n",
      "[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:18.880]  People take it in that sense.\n",
      "[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:19.880]  It's not like that.\n",
      "[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:24.000]  You actually look at the principles where we use, for example, we discuss principles\n",
      "[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.560]  of scientific medicine, how a drug comes into the market and can go back or can be used\n",
      "[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:29.560]  for long.\n",
      "[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:31.320]  We discussed about that.\n",
      "[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:34.840]  But when you discuss about Ayurveda, look at the principles of Ayurveda, just like principles\n",
      "[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:39.040]  of homeopathy, the Ayurvedic principles are also all unscientific.\n",
      "[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:46.560]  For example, Ayurveda believes that diseases in the body are caused by imbalances in humors.\n",
      "[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:51.800]  The humoral theory that Galen initially proposed as one of the, so at that time there were\n",
      "[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:52.800]  four humors.\n",
      "[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:54.720]  Ayurveda has three humors, that is a Tridosha.\n",
      "[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:59.660]  So they say that there is this Vayu, Pitta, Kapha, these things get imbalanced and then\n",
      "[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:01.200]  patients develop these diseases.\n",
      "[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:04.280]  So we basically balance them and it becomes better.\n",
      "[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:08.160]  And then they have Prakriti and a lot of philosophical stuff.\n",
      "[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:10.200]  Now it's all philosophy.\n",
      "[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:17.080]  And if you ask an Ayurved to show where Kapha is or Pitta is or please define it, they will\n",
      "[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:19.640]  never give you a straight answer because you cannot measure it.\n",
      "[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:20.960]  You cannot identify it.\n",
      "[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:24.120]  It exists only in imagination and in philosophy.\n",
      "[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:27.520]  It's not actually part of anything.\n",
      "[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:29.800]  That makes Ayurveda a pseudoscience.\n",
      "[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:32.920]  And based on that, how can you treat someone?\n",
      "[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:35.840]  Because based on that, you cannot diagnose anyone in the first place.\n",
      "[02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:39.920]  So just like homeopathy, Ayurveda also treats symptoms.\n",
      "[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:45.040]  But they claim they treat root cause, unlike modern medicine, which treats only the symptoms,\n",
      "[02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:46.040]  which is wrong.\n",
      "[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:50.400]  It's like a propaganda that they keep on talking about.\n",
      "[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:53.780]  Ayurveda does not treat any root cause.\n",
      "[02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:56.840]  If at all there is a root cause identifiable and treatable, and that is through scientific\n",
      "[02:44:56.840 --> 02:44:57.840]  medicine only.\n",
      "[02:44:57.840 --> 02:44:58.840]  For example, jaundice.\n",
      "[02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:02.480]  Ayurveda will treat every jaundice as jaundice.\n",
      "[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:06.000]  But we know that jaundice can be because of many, many reasons.\n",
      "[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.640]  You know, jaundice can be liver related, it can be blood related also.\n",
      "[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:13.200]  So you can have hemolytic anemias where your red blood cells get destroyed and you can\n",
      "[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:14.360]  have jaundice because of that.\n",
      "[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.400]  Or you can have a liver failure because of different types of viruses or alcohol or autoimmune\n",
      "[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:20.160]  liver disease and you can have jaundice because of that.\n",
      "[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:23.680]  So you treat the cause of jaundice, then the jaundice goes away.\n",
      "[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.440]  But Ayurveda treats only jaundice.\n",
      "[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:30.160]  So you have a set of things to do for a patient of jaundice and you don't actually treat anything\n",
      "[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:31.160]  there.\n",
      "[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:32.160]  No root cause, nothing.\n",
      "[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:33.480]  It mostly worsens the patient.\n",
      "[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:38.720]  So in Ayurvedic principles, and when I talk about Ayurveda, the biggest problem that Ayurveds\n",
      "[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:42.240]  bring to the table is that, are you an Ayurveda practitioner?\n",
      "[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:43.240]  You are not.\n",
      "[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:46.160]  Have you done bachelors in Ayurvedic medical sciences?\n",
      "[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:47.160]  You have not.\n",
      "[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:49.280]  So what authority do you have to talk about Ayurveda?\n",
      "[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:53.240]  I mean, you don't need any authority to talk about it because anybody can rip apart and\n",
      "[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:55.560]  critique pseudosciences as they want.\n",
      "[02:45:55.560 --> 02:46:00.240]  And it is part of scientists and clinical scientists to actually talk about pseudosciences\n",
      "[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:03.440]  because it is important for their practice, routine practice also, which is why I talk\n",
      "[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:04.440]  about it.\n",
      "[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:06.320]  And also, I have read the whole thing.\n",
      "[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:10.720]  I have four versions of Susruta Samhita, two versions of Charaka Samhita.\n",
      "[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:14.080]  I have Ashtanga Hridaya, which are the three pillars of Ayurvedic classical texts, and\n",
      "[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:15.880]  I have read them from cover to cover.\n",
      "[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:19.720]  And I'm sorry to say, it is completely pseudoscientific.\n",
      "[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:23.040]  There is nothing in it, except maybe there are some good points on nutrition.\n",
      "[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:26.880]  In the sense that not the real nutrition, but some stuff they say that in observational\n",
      "[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:30.720]  part is pretty good about nutrition and some observations are pretty good.\n",
      "[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:35.880]  For example, Susruta Samhita, they talk about some surgical procedures, pretty decent stuff,\n",
      "[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:38.160]  but it has all evolved from them.\n",
      "[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:42.800]  And the other whole aspect of it is completely pseudoscientific.\n",
      "[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:47.880]  But to talk about Ayurveda from this aspect is not easy because people are not going to\n",
      "[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:49.000]  listen to it.\n",
      "[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.920]  What people do is that directly they'll jump into the other aspects of Ayurveda, which\n",
      "[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:55.320]  is religion, tradition and culture.\n",
      "[02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:59.800]  So they'll say that we have been using it for 2000 years and it is still here.\n",
      "[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:05.600]  It has not gone away, which means it is useful, which is actually appealing to tradition fallacy.\n",
      "[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:06.900]  That is not how you use something.\n",
      "[02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:12.120]  It is here because it's part of our tradition and culture and not because it is a science.\n",
      "[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:18.840]  Second is people say that Ayurveda has been, you know, it is actually, you're talking against\n",
      "[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:20.840]  Ayurveda because you are a Christian.\n",
      "[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:23.920]  These are the stuff that I get on Twitter.\n",
      "[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:27.080]  You're a Christian, you don't know everything, but you're anti-Hindu, you're anti-Indian.\n",
      "[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:28.960]  Go back to Pakistan and things like that.\n",
      "[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:31.980]  So that is the second type of argument that they bring.\n",
      "[02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:36.480]  And the third type of argument they bring is that you are losing business.\n",
      "[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:40.360]  You know, Ayurveda treats patients and improves them.\n",
      "[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:41.800]  You are not getting that business.\n",
      "[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:42.800]  So you are losing business.\n",
      "[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:44.720]  You're talking bad about Ayurveda.\n",
      "[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:48.560]  These three arguments are actually nothing to do with the science.\n",
      "[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:51.840]  They are not rational or scientific arguments.\n",
      "[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:58.600]  And the best part is that people erroneously think that Ayurveda is making us lose business.\n",
      "[02:47:58.600 --> 02:47:59.600]  It's actually the opposite.\n",
      "[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:04.400]  I am actually getting more patients because they go for alternative medicine.\n",
      "[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:08.660]  You know, somebody who's just sitting at home having some gas trouble, instead of taking\n",
      "[02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:15.760]  a little bit of, you know, Digene or something, some antacid, something, they go for Ayurveda,\n",
      "[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:20.280]  they prescribe him a bunch of herbals and that herbals will actually cause him some\n",
      "[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:21.880]  herb induced liver injury.\n",
      "[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:27.040]  Then they come to my hospital, get admitted, pay for the biopsy, pay for the hospital charges,\n",
      "[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:29.400]  ultimately get a transplant and pay 25 lakhs.\n",
      "[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:30.560]  So who's getting the business here?\n",
      "[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:33.160]  I'm actually getting more business here because of Ayurveda.\n",
      "[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:35.120]  So it's not like I'm losing business.\n",
      "[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:36.760]  And I don't want that business.\n",
      "[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:37.760]  You know, that is the whole point.\n",
      "[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:42.320]  I want people to stop doing that, stop harming themselves so that we lose business.\n",
      "[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:43.520]  This is the whole aspect of it.\n",
      "[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:45.320]  But people don't understand this part.\n",
      "[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:49.640]  They directly jump into these irrational arguments when you talk about Ayurveda.\n",
      "[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:54.000]  Come straight, talk about scientific reasons or whatever you can bring to the table from\n",
      "[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.240]  a scientific point of view in Ayurveda, you will see that it is a house of cards.\n",
      "[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:01.640]  That is why Ayurvedas don't come for a direct confrontation ever.\n",
      "[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:06.360]  Even on Twitter, you can actually see, I mean, I just put up something on arsenic album on\n",
      "[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:10.040]  homeopathy and you can just see the responses underneath by an Ayurved.\n",
      "[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:12.960]  He's just abusing me in Hindi.\n",
      "[02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:17.800]  I mean, it's complete, I mean, they're just irrational when it comes to arguments.\n",
      "[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:19.920]  So you cannot win an argument with them.\n",
      "[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:23.440]  And they feel that they have won because we don't, we ignore them at some point, right?\n",
      "[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:24.640]  And this is how it goes.\n",
      "[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:30.600]  So Ayurvedic principles and homeopathy principles are both unscientific and not, not sound enough\n",
      "[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:31.860]  to call it a science.\n",
      "[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:32.960]  And this is the biggest.\n",
      "[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:33.960]  And same with Siddha.\n",
      "[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:38.360]  I mean, if I don't talk about Siddha and the Unani, people will say that, you know, you're\n",
      "[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:40.680]  not talking about Unani because Unani has a different culture.\n",
      "[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:45.440]  It is mostly in the Perso-Arabic, this thing, it's part of more of part of Muslim culture.\n",
      "[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:48.440]  And Siddha is mostly regional in Tamil Nadu.\n",
      "[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:51.360]  But Siddha also has a Tridosha theory.\n",
      "[02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:53.700]  Unani has four humors instead of three.\n",
      "[02:49:53.700 --> 02:49:56.120]  It has something known as black bile also.\n",
      "[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:00.440]  The others have bile, kapha and vayu.\n",
      "[02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:03.840]  Unani has black bile also, that is the original Galenic humor theory.\n",
      "[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:07.120]  So this is only the difference, but all of them are pseudosciences.\n",
      "[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:08.120]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:11.360]  And, and, you know, one point that you made while speaking about Ayurveda in the past\n",
      "[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:16.360]  is that, you know, when Ayurveda is taught in colleges, people have to mix in some modern\n",
      "[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:20.200]  biology as well, because what the Ayurvedas originally believed was, for example, the\n",
      "[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:21.600]  brain is part of the heart.\n",
      "[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:24.520]  There was no concept of the brain as a separate organ.\n",
      "[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:30.220]  And my thing is that, you know, when we are knocking Ayurveda and despite not being Christian\n",
      "[02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:36.480]  like you, I'm still going to knock it as vehemently that when we are knocking it as a pseudoscience,\n",
      "[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:41.360]  it's not exactly dissing the original Ayurvedas or the field as it evolved.\n",
      "[02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:42.760]  Back then we didn't know better.\n",
      "[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:44.020]  This is what we knew.\n",
      "[02:50:44.020 --> 02:50:48.440]  You could conceive of flying chariots, but you could not have invented an internal combustion\n",
      "[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:49.440]  engine.\n",
      "[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:51.200]  Technology hadn't progressed that far.\n",
      "[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:53.160]  So it's not a knock on that.\n",
      "[02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:57.160]  It's just that we were less advanced and we are more advanced now.\n",
      "[02:50:57.160 --> 02:51:02.160]  And you know what you correctly earlier, we were speaking of how homeopathy became popular\n",
      "[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:06.880]  in a time where, you know, just going to hospital could kill you because infections were so\n",
      "[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:12.560]  rampant when modern medicine as it then was, was at such a primitive stage.\n",
      "[02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:17.040]  It is natural that people preferred sugar pills might even have been better for them.\n",
      "[02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:21.040]  But the difference, the reason why modern medicine has advanced so much and the reason\n",
      "[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:26.580]  that all of these have stayed more or less fixed in time is the scientific method.\n",
      "[02:51:26.580 --> 02:51:28.560]  You know, it is falsifiability.\n",
      "[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:30.300]  It is a scientific method.\n",
      "[02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:36.280]  You keep brushing up against reality, testing everything, testing, testing, testing, understanding\n",
      "[02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:39.200]  the world better, admitting your mistakes, moving ahead.\n",
      "[02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:44.800]  And therefore you see such a sea change, you know, in proper medicine in the last 200 years\n",
      "[02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:49.080]  while homeopathy is still there, you're still diluting that stuff and possibly.\n",
      "[02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:52.440]  So that is why I say not experience, but experiment.\n",
      "[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:53.440]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:56.120]  You don't go by experience, you go by experiments.\n",
      "[02:51:56.120 --> 02:52:03.160]  And if you put these practices into experiments, you can see that they'll fail enormously epically.\n",
      "[02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:07.860]  And that is why even after 2000 studies later, governments have identified, I mean, scientifically\n",
      "[02:52:07.860 --> 02:52:13.080]  progressive societies, I would mention Australia, UK, US, they will identify that homeopathy\n",
      "[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:14.400]  is sham.\n",
      "[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:19.640]  And a lot of funding has been stopped in the NHS and in Germany, people have to pay from\n",
      "[02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:22.120]  their pockets to actually avail homeopathic services now.\n",
      "[02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:24.120]  It's not part of the public funding system anymore.\n",
      "[02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:25.120]  Why?\n",
      "[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:26.120]  Because we have progressed.\n",
      "[02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:31.560]  We don't, we don't do that because for us, I think this is a big part of our big part\n",
      "[02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:32.560]  of our economy.\n",
      "[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:37.200]  You know, it brings in money and it's not easy to just one day suddenly make it vanish.\n",
      "[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:42.120]  So there are a lot of reasons why it stays here in India and gets and gets the limelight\n",
      "[02:52:42.120 --> 02:52:43.360]  it is getting now.\n",
      "[02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:46.360]  And science is not one of it.\n",
      "[02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:47.360]  That is the whole aspect of it.\n",
      "[02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:50.680]  It is not here because it is scientific, it is here because of other reasons other than\n",
      "[02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:52.040]  science and healthcare.\n",
      "[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:55.120]  Yeah, inertia, tradition, all of those things.\n",
      "[02:52:55.120 --> 02:52:58.640]  And what also strikes me is, you know, for every Ayurvedic doctor who says, have you\n",
      "[02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:02.560]  studied Ayurveda, you can't question, you know, no regular doctor would ask you something\n",
      "[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:03.560]  like that.\n",
      "[02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:05.240]  It's a question of facts.\n",
      "[02:53:05.240 --> 02:53:09.600]  You know, if a lay person like me is to come and say that, hey, your theory of this is\n",
      "[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:12.040]  wrong, I would have to explain why.\n",
      "[02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:15.360]  And then I would have to, you know, and it would be falsifiable.\n",
      "[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:20.040]  And you could easily figure out what the truth is, you know, exactly like if somebody asked\n",
      "[02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:25.080]  me, you prescribe paracetamol, even though paracetamol is the number one cause of acute\n",
      "[02:53:25.080 --> 02:53:27.160]  liver failure in the world.\n",
      "[02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:28.800]  I don't, I don't tell them that.\n",
      "[02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:29.800]  Are you a doctor?\n",
      "[02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:30.800]  Have you studied MBBS?\n",
      "[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:31.800]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:53:31.800 --> 02:53:33.160]  No, I tell them the truth.\n",
      "[02:53:33.160 --> 02:53:37.120]  The truth is paracetamol in its routine dose is safe.\n",
      "[02:53:37.120 --> 02:53:41.120]  The reason why people develop paracetamol poisoning is either because of overdosing\n",
      "[02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:47.680]  as part of an attempt of attempted suicide, or it is because of overdosing accidentally.\n",
      "[02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:52.560]  That happens mostly in children, because mothers or fathers, they actually give more than what\n",
      "[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:54.040]  is required to reduce the fever.\n",
      "[02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:55.760]  And that actually causes the trouble.\n",
      "[02:53:55.760 --> 02:54:00.100]  Otherwise, paracetamol is actually the safest drug in the world if you use it as recommended\n",
      "[02:54:00.100 --> 02:54:01.560]  and routinely.\n",
      "[02:54:01.560 --> 02:54:07.680]  But it is the poster boy for anti modern medicine from the alternative medicine industry, because\n",
      "[02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:12.480]  unfortunately it is the commonest cause associated with liver failure because of overdosing or\n",
      "[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:14.440]  because of attempted suicides.\n",
      "[02:54:14.440 --> 02:54:16.640]  And this, this we will explain, right?\n",
      "[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:18.760]  You don't ask them, you know, are you an MBBS doctor?\n",
      "[02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:21.440]  What, what, what, what authority do you have to ask me?\n",
      "[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:22.440]  Come on.\n",
      "[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:23.440]  That happens.\n",
      "[02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:27.760]  That questions come only when you are unscientific and you don't know, have any other ways to\n",
      "[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:29.880]  defend your practice.\n",
      "[02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:30.880]  Yeah.\n",
      "[02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:35.480]  And like three common ways in which you get attacked earlier, like you pointed out, none\n",
      "[02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:38.840]  of them is making an argument, all of them is attacking the person.\n",
      "[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:40.920]  So that is always a sign that you have lost.\n",
      "[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:42.520]  You don't have truth on your side.\n",
      "[02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:43.520]  Exactly.\n",
      "[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:44.520]  Exactly.\n",
      "[02:54:44.520 --> 02:54:46.320]  And, and most of them are ad hominem, you know, a lot of them are ad hominem.\n",
      "[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:50.000]  And I've seen that homeopaths are more ad hominem than Ayurveds.\n",
      "[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:54.240]  I don't know why, but they are more abusive and they harass more.\n",
      "[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:59.280]  And I've had a lot of harassment and trouble with the homeopathic community than I've had\n",
      "[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:01.160]  with Ayurvedic community.\n",
      "[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:03.360]  The handful of times I've written about this, so have I.\n",
      "[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:04.880]  Now, why do you think that is?\n",
      "[02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:09.840]  Is it because Ayurveda at least is a part of the culture in such a way that they don't\n",
      "[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:11.320]  have to feel threatened?\n",
      "[02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:13.040]  You know, they're, they're marketed very well.\n",
      "[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:16.200]  They're also doing their shower gels and wellness spas.\n",
      "[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:20.280]  So they feel kind of more secure while homeopaths at some level, they must surely know that\n",
      "[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:22.160]  it's all woo woo.\n",
      "[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:26.200]  I cannot actually put a finger to an exact cause for that.\n",
      "[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:30.280]  But I think Ayurveda is much more acceptable in the community, right?\n",
      "[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:36.040]  So even if they don't attack the messenger, they are still comfortable.\n",
      "[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:41.040]  But in, in homeopathy, it's different because you have to go by testimonials to keep it\n",
      "[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:42.040]  alive.\n",
      "[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:45.120]  Homeopathy survives only on testimonials and nothing else.\n",
      "[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:50.640]  And because of that, and it has nothing to do with patient care or health care or compassionate\n",
      "[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:51.640]  care, nothing.\n",
      "[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:53.200]  It has everything to do with business.\n",
      "[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:58.000]  So when you attack homeopathy or criticize homeopathy, you're actually criticizing the\n",
      "[02:55:58.000 --> 02:55:59.000]  business of homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.200]  You're actually reducing the business of homeopathy.\n",
      "[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:04.320]  And I think this is what makes them really angry.\n",
      "[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:08.240]  Because you, you don't want to lose patients.\n",
      "[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:12.800]  For me, when I, if I lose patients or gain patients, it's, it's not like I'm thinking\n",
      "[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:14.040]  from business point of view.\n",
      "[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:17.760]  You know, I've lost so many patients or I've gained so many patients or today I got two\n",
      "[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:18.760]  new patients.\n",
      "[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:19.760]  I mean, I don't think like that.\n",
      "[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:20.760]  But homeopaths do.\n",
      "[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:27.240]  They actually are, they actually are more into the business of health care than actual\n",
      "[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:28.240]  patient care.\n",
      "[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:30.000]  You know, it's, it's totally different.\n",
      "[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:33.560]  And every alternative medical practice is actually business of health care.\n",
      "[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:36.000]  It has nothing to do with the compassion of patient care.\n",
      "[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  It has nothing.\n",
      "[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:38.880]  They will say that they are more compassionate.\n",
      "[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:42.920]  I mean, I do appreciate two things in homeopathy and Ayurveda.\n",
      "[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:46.160]  And I would, I am going to be open about it.\n",
      "[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:48.760]  The time that they spend with the patient.\n",
      "[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:49.760]  Marvelous.\n",
      "[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:54.960]  I mean, like we spoke in our initial questions, we were saying that, you know, modern medicine\n",
      "[02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:58.080]  doctors see so many patients, they don't have time to spend.\n",
      "[02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:04.400]  A lot of patients, why they go away from modern medicine to alternative practices like Ayurveda\n",
      "[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:07.240]  and homeopathies, because they listen to them.\n",
      "[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:10.680]  They hear them out because they have more time to spend with the patient.\n",
      "[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:15.200]  A homeopath actually takes about two and a half to three hours of history alone from\n",
      "[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:16.600]  the patient.\n",
      "[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:19.120]  And they ask them everything.\n",
      "[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:20.720]  What time do you take a bath?\n",
      "[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:21.720]  How do you go to sleep?\n",
      "[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:22.720]  How are you sleeping?\n",
      "[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:25.760]  I mean, these are not related anything to disease, but they still ask them and that\n",
      "[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:27.100]  is at a personal level.\n",
      "[02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:31.280]  So they feel more comfortable and more confident with that particular homeopath rather than\n",
      "[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:35.080]  that modern medicine doctor who just prescribes some pills and push them away.\n",
      "[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:36.360]  So this is something so important.\n",
      "[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:41.680]  And I think if a modern medicine doctor has to learn something from homeopathy and Ayurveda,\n",
      "[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:46.840]  it is that you have to talk to your patient because without that communication skill,\n",
      "[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:49.200]  things don't work out well for both of you.\n",
      "[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:53.120]  And this is where I want to bring in something that I wanted to talk to you before, where\n",
      "[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:56.760]  I said that I had an episode of violence against me.\n",
      "[02:57:56.760 --> 02:58:00.480]  And this was initially starting from my... and this is when I understood the importance\n",
      "[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:01.800]  of patient communication.\n",
      "[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:02.800]  That is how I learned.\n",
      "[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:05.280]  I mean, as a doctor, I think we have to learn it the hard way.\n",
      "[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:08.200]  These are things that are... these things are not taught in colleges.\n",
      "[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:12.660]  And I hope younger doctors also listen to this podcast because they should know this.\n",
      "[02:58:12.660 --> 02:58:14.600]  You don't... they don't teach you this in colleges.\n",
      "[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:19.840]  And I think it's very important because patient communication is what clinches everything.\n",
      "[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:24.200]  And what happened was that there was this patient with severe alcoholic liver disease\n",
      "[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:29.120]  and that patient was so sick and we advised for a transplantation.\n",
      "[02:58:29.120 --> 02:58:31.080]  They had no money.\n",
      "[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:36.200]  They had probably 9 or 10 lakhs to spare for the whole thing, for the transplant.\n",
      "[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:40.000]  And little bit left for the other post-transplant care.\n",
      "[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.400]  And the transplantation at that time was not active in my unit.\n",
      "[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:43.800]  It was only in some other hospital.\n",
      "[02:58:43.800 --> 02:58:45.640]  So I had to refer them to another hospital.\n",
      "[02:58:45.640 --> 02:58:48.280]  But they quoted about 25 lakhs for the transplant at that time.\n",
      "[02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:50.560]  This was about 6-7 years back.\n",
      "[02:58:50.560 --> 02:58:52.680]  And they said that, sir, there is no way we can do it.\n",
      "[02:58:52.680 --> 02:58:54.680]  But we want to do it because we want to help our father.\n",
      "[02:58:54.680 --> 02:58:57.600]  So I said that, you know, I studied in ILBS.\n",
      "[02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:01.600]  ILBS has a very cheap transplant, this thing, charges.\n",
      "[02:59:01.600 --> 02:59:03.040]  So they transplant patients.\n",
      "[02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:06.080]  At that time, they used to transplant patients within 10-11 lakhs.\n",
      "[02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:07.720]  So it was like a big deal for them.\n",
      "[02:59:07.720 --> 02:59:10.280]  So they took this patient by flight.\n",
      "[02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:12.120]  Somehow I optimized him, stabilized him.\n",
      "[02:59:12.120 --> 02:59:13.480]  I just said, go do a transplant.\n",
      "[02:59:13.480 --> 02:59:15.440]  I did not say anything more than that.\n",
      "[02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:16.680]  And they just went.\n",
      "[02:59:16.680 --> 02:59:17.960]  So they thought everything is going to be fine.\n",
      "[02:59:17.960 --> 02:59:19.080]  You go there, get transplanted.\n",
      "[02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:22.280]  So by the time he reached there, this patient became very sick.\n",
      "[02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:27.040]  So my mistake was that I did not tell them regarding how this disease is going to progress,\n",
      "[02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:29.200]  what to expect and what not to expect.\n",
      "[02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:32.840]  So I did not tell them that severe alcoholic liver disease is associated with infections\n",
      "[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:34.120]  at any time.\n",
      "[02:59:34.120 --> 02:59:35.720]  Patients can bleed any time.\n",
      "[02:59:35.720 --> 02:59:39.880]  Patients can develop sudden blockage of veins in the liver at any time.\n",
      "[02:59:39.880 --> 02:59:41.520]  They can crash any time.\n",
      "[02:59:41.520 --> 02:59:44.360]  And this can happen during the workup time before you reach there.\n",
      "[02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:46.160]  I did not tell them all this in detail.\n",
      "[02:59:46.160 --> 02:59:50.760]  So the moment they arrived at ILBS, patient got very sick.\n",
      "[02:59:50.760 --> 02:59:54.360]  He was on the ventilator for about a couple of weeks.\n",
      "[02:59:54.360 --> 03:00:01.240]  The money that they had collected for the liver transplant actually went into just managing\n",
      "[03:00:01.240 --> 03:00:04.480]  the complications of this patient on ventilator.\n",
      "[03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:10.440]  So finally, when the doctors there optimized him for transplant, they ran out of money.\n",
      "[03:00:10.440 --> 03:00:14.040]  And then ultimately he died there under hospice care.\n",
      "[03:00:14.040 --> 03:00:16.440]  So he was supposed to die here in his home.\n",
      "[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:18.840]  He went all the way to Delhi and died there.\n",
      "[03:00:18.840 --> 03:00:22.240]  Bystanders, family, furious.\n",
      "[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:24.520]  I mean, there was nothing I could do there.\n",
      "[03:00:24.520 --> 03:00:26.280]  And I understood it was my fault.\n",
      "[03:00:26.280 --> 03:00:28.880]  So they came back after everything, after the burial, everything.\n",
      "[03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:30.280]  And I never knew about it.\n",
      "[03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:32.840]  He just messaged me saying that, you know, the patient has died.\n",
      "[03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:33.840]  So I asked him what happened.\n",
      "[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:35.640]  He said, no, he died of infection and things like that.\n",
      "[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:36.640]  And I said, OK.\n",
      "[03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:40.000]  I did not even say anything more than that because it was on the phone, on WhatsApp.\n",
      "[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:41.520]  Nothing more I could say.\n",
      "[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:42.520]  And I just left it there.\n",
      "[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:47.600]  After two months later, after everything was settled, his son, nephew and another guy,\n",
      "[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:56.520]  I think his brother, they came into my OPD, they just he just, I mean, banged on my table\n",
      "[03:00:56.520 --> 03:01:00.440]  and said, you destroyed our family.\n",
      "[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:01.440]  So I was like shocked.\n",
      "[03:01:01.440 --> 03:01:02.440]  I did not know who this guy was.\n",
      "[03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:06.120]  I suddenly I forgot it was it was almost two months after his death.\n",
      "[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:09.640]  And then suddenly he said that because of you, my father, who was supposed to die at\n",
      "[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:12.320]  home in Kerala, he died in Delhi.\n",
      "[03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:14.160]  And then he started abusing me right, left and center.\n",
      "[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:20.720]  They took my chair and they beat up my I mean, beat the table and some stuff there, destroyed\n",
      "[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:21.960]  my files and everything.\n",
      "[03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:22.960]  And then they abused me.\n",
      "[03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:26.640]  And then they left while they were going out.\n",
      "[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:30.720]  They told every other patient was sitting there that don't go into this guy's room.\n",
      "[03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:32.240]  He will kill your family and things like that.\n",
      "[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:33.640]  I mean, it was so bad.\n",
      "[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:37.840]  I was so I mean, I've never faced that kind of stuff because I've done everything good\n",
      "[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:38.840]  for the patient.\n",
      "[03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:42.320]  I mean, as a doctor, we don't want to do anything bad for any patient.\n",
      "[03:01:42.320 --> 03:01:45.480]  We do everything thinking that is going to be good for the patient.\n",
      "[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:48.680]  And I did all that, called up those people, arranged everything for his travel.\n",
      "[03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:50.000]  And I did all that.\n",
      "[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.960]  And I got so shocked that they came back and did this to me.\n",
      "[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:53.960]  Then I reflected on it.\n",
      "[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:55.560]  I was depressed for a whole week or two.\n",
      "[03:01:55.560 --> 03:01:59.440]  I think I am still depressed when I think about that episode, because it was quite bad.\n",
      "[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:06.080]  I mean, I when patients become violent towards you, it's because you spend all your life,\n",
      "[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:07.560]  you're you're learning about.\n",
      "[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:08.560]  Yeah, I did.\n",
      "[03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:11.740]  I studied for 15 years medicine to help people.\n",
      "[03:02:11.740 --> 03:02:14.720]  And then once this happens to you, you feel like an utter failure.\n",
      "[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:16.400]  You know, you're like lost.\n",
      "[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:17.640]  Did you talk to them again?\n",
      "[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:19.140]  No, I did not.\n",
      "[03:02:19.140 --> 03:02:24.680]  Because I think it I don't think it mattered because they they just left.\n",
      "[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:28.880]  And I think at some point they would have also cooled down because I did not want to\n",
      "[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:30.680]  make things worse.\n",
      "[03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:33.220]  And I was depressed for about a couple of weeks.\n",
      "[03:02:33.220 --> 03:02:36.920]  And then I at that time, I reflected on what went wrong.\n",
      "[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:38.840]  And I think every doctor should do that.\n",
      "[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:43.240]  If somebody if something is going on in your practice and your patients or family is not\n",
      "[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:45.720]  satisfied, please reflect what is happening.\n",
      "[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:47.000]  You have to always self assess.\n",
      "[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:48.680]  A lot of doctors don't do that.\n",
      "[03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:52.380]  And I figured it out that, you know, it was because of poor communication.\n",
      "[03:02:52.380 --> 03:02:57.680]  And from that time onwards, I tell the pros and cons of everything to all my patients.\n",
      "[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:01.480]  Like we discussed before, I talked to them regarding finances also, everything is on\n",
      "[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:03.580]  the table for everyone to see.\n",
      "[03:03:03.580 --> 03:03:07.880]  And I've never had a single episode of violence against me after that.\n",
      "[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:11.000]  Not a single episode when people die.\n",
      "[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:15.680]  And when my patients die, actually, their family comes to my room.\n",
      "[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:19.880]  They cry a lot in front of me and they thank me.\n",
      "[03:03:19.880 --> 03:03:22.440]  I feel sad because I could not save that patient.\n",
      "[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:27.280]  But they come and they thank me and I feel that I have done my part.\n",
      "[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:31.640]  You know, it is satisfying in in a bittersweet way, but they never become violent towards\n",
      "[03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:33.040]  me.\n",
      "[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:37.320]  And this is the this is the sleep that I spoke to you about.\n",
      "[03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:38.320]  It's not a good sleep.\n",
      "[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:41.080]  But for me, I mean, I cannot explain it.\n",
      "[03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:44.160]  I sleep well at night because of this.\n",
      "[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:45.320]  And this is very important.\n",
      "[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:49.120]  And this is what I think one should learn from the alternative medicine industry, the\n",
      "[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:50.960]  way they talk to people.\n",
      "[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:55.760]  I mean, if I talk to when I when I say that, you know, this homeopathic medicine is what\n",
      "[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:59.800]  caused liver injury to you or this Ayurveda is what liver injury to you.\n",
      "[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:01.760]  Patients defend them.\n",
      "[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:05.840]  Patients defend the Ayurvedic practitioner and the homeopath saying that no.\n",
      "[03:04:05.840 --> 03:04:06.840]  He's a good man.\n",
      "[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:07.840]  Yes.\n",
      "[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:10.000]  That is the power of communication.\n",
      "[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.280]  And I don't know why people doctors can't understand it.\n",
      "[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:16.560]  Just imagine if every medical doctor, proper medical doctor communicates properly with\n",
      "[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:17.700]  the patient.\n",
      "[03:04:17.700 --> 03:04:19.920]  You will not have this alternative medicine industry.\n",
      "[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:23.580]  It will just go to smithereens, I'm 100% sure.\n",
      "[03:04:23.580 --> 03:04:26.320]  And would you say that that's and I'm just thinking aloud here.\n",
      "[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:31.280]  Would you say that that's an underrated part of the process of treating someone that it\n",
      "[03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:36.200]  is not just about, you know, how you treat what is happening to their body, but also\n",
      "[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:41.200]  that you understand their anxieties, you understand their context, and for that, you have to talk\n",
      "[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:42.440]  to them, sit with them.\n",
      "[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:46.240]  I think the whole issue is with our medical education system.\n",
      "[03:04:46.240 --> 03:04:50.760]  You know, right from the end of 12th grade, you're pushed into a competition, you have\n",
      "[03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:52.760]  to get into MBBS somehow.\n",
      "[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:57.280]  Then in MBBS, you are taught the basics, finish internship, get into MD somehow.\n",
      "[03:04:57.280 --> 03:04:59.640]  Then suddenly you get into DM somehow.\n",
      "[03:04:59.640 --> 03:05:03.680]  Nobody is telling you here that you need patient communication skills.\n",
      "[03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:06.920]  Nobody's telling you that the patient is a person.\n",
      "[03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:09.720]  Everybody's saying that you have to diagnose, you have to investigate, or this is how it\n",
      "[03:05:09.720 --> 03:05:10.720]  is.\n",
      "[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:11.720]  This is the algorithm to diagnose.\n",
      "[03:05:11.720 --> 03:05:13.720]  You go like this and follow.\n",
      "[03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:15.120]  Come on, that is not clinical medicine.\n",
      "[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:19.560]  And I think that that aspect of clinical medicine was taught to be my my professors.\n",
      "[03:05:19.560 --> 03:05:22.160]  And that is exactly why I said they are a dying breed.\n",
      "[03:05:22.160 --> 03:05:26.440]  I don't know about teachers now, because when I see the quality of students that I deal\n",
      "[03:05:26.440 --> 03:05:31.360]  with, because I have a lot of young doctors joining my unit as medical officers and everything,\n",
      "[03:05:31.360 --> 03:05:33.640]  I don't see any compassion in them.\n",
      "[03:05:33.640 --> 03:05:34.640]  Even none.\n",
      "[03:05:34.640 --> 03:05:36.720]  Which means their education was like that.\n",
      "[03:05:36.720 --> 03:05:38.160]  Nobody's taught them the real thing.\n",
      "[03:05:38.160 --> 03:05:40.880]  Nobody's taught them to see the patient as a person.\n",
      "[03:05:40.880 --> 03:05:45.600]  Everybody is taught, every student has been taught to see the patient as an algorithm.\n",
      "[03:05:45.600 --> 03:05:47.680]  And that is how we approach the patient.\n",
      "[03:05:47.680 --> 03:05:50.760]  That is where you see everywhere, approach to the patient, approach the patient.\n",
      "[03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:53.000]  It's not like approach the person.\n",
      "[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000]  And I think this is also very important for clinical medicine.\n",
      "[03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:59.920]  Once you do that, and once you know your science, I mean, that is a good doctor.\n",
      "[03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:04.160]  Is it the case that, you know, I'm sure that many of your batchmates, wherever you studied,\n",
      "[03:06:04.160 --> 03:06:07.400]  would also not be compassionate in that way, would get jaded, would get whatever.\n",
      "[03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:11.600]  I mean, compassion, I think is, to a certain extent, I'm not, can it be taught?\n",
      "[03:06:11.600 --> 03:06:14.600]  Like, isn't it something internal that comes to you?\n",
      "[03:06:14.600 --> 03:06:18.840]  I mean, I mean, internal is there definitely, like for me, because of a lot of other, because\n",
      "[03:06:18.840 --> 03:06:20.900]  I've been exposed to this from my dad.\n",
      "[03:06:20.900 --> 03:06:22.080]  So it was internal for me.\n",
      "[03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:25.240]  And I know how, I mean, I understand its importance.\n",
      "[03:06:25.240 --> 03:06:32.520]  But I think it can be taught because if somebody, if, for example, the students that train under\n",
      "[03:06:32.520 --> 03:06:39.440]  me, when they write their USMLE and UK and they go, they stay with me for about a year\n",
      "[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:42.240]  because I trained the medical officers also who are with me.\n",
      "[03:06:42.240 --> 03:06:46.640]  And the main thing that they have told me is that, you know, you taught us how to diagnose\n",
      "[03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:48.120]  this, you taught us how to diagnose that.\n",
      "[03:06:48.120 --> 03:06:52.280]  They tell me that you, it's very interesting the way you talk to the patient.\n",
      "[03:06:52.280 --> 03:06:55.480]  And that is what actually impresses them.\n",
      "[03:06:55.480 --> 03:07:03.280]  And I think it can be taught because when you, you as a teacher, what you practice is\n",
      "[03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:04.880]  what they will learn.\n",
      "[03:07:04.880 --> 03:07:09.520]  So if you are a teacher who is just going to prescribe, the student will also just prescribe.\n",
      "[03:07:09.520 --> 03:07:13.120]  If you are a teacher who is interested only doing endoscopies for the patient, the student\n",
      "[03:07:13.120 --> 03:07:17.320]  will also do endoscopies for a patient which who does not even require endoscopy, you know,\n",
      "[03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:19.600]  because that is what he's been taught and he's been exposed to.\n",
      "[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:21.140]  I think it can be taught.\n",
      "[03:07:21.140 --> 03:07:24.640]  And if they're a dying breed, why do you think they're a dying breed?\n",
      "[03:07:24.640 --> 03:07:29.760]  Because I don't see, because I mean, the professors that I have dealt with at the time and my\n",
      "[03:07:29.760 --> 03:07:34.080]  batch mates, you know, we are all in the same, we are all like-minded.\n",
      "[03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:38.880]  And when I see that batch, I still, I'm in touch with these, my colleagues at the time\n",
      "[03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:43.120]  and they still practice that kind of medicine that we have practiced, you know, very patient\n",
      "[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:44.120]  centric.\n",
      "[03:07:44.120 --> 03:07:49.520]  When I see a fresh pass out, like a fresh DM guy or a fresh MD guy who works under me\n",
      "[03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:52.080]  or with me, I mean, this is maybe my personal observation.\n",
      "[03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:56.600]  I don't know about, I'm not generalizing to all, but I see that they are more interested\n",
      "[03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:59.480]  in working up the patient and investigating more.\n",
      "[03:07:59.480 --> 03:08:04.060]  And you know, you don't, I asked them, what is the patient's name?\n",
      "[03:08:04.060 --> 03:08:08.960]  Some of them actually have to go back to the paper and look at the name, you know, it's\n",
      "[03:08:08.960 --> 03:08:09.960]  that bad.\n",
      "[03:08:09.960 --> 03:08:10.960]  No, no.\n",
      "[03:08:10.960 --> 03:08:12.480]  What I meant was not, why do you think it's a dying breed?\n",
      "[03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:15.720]  Because which is what you answered, but why are they a dying breed?\n",
      "[03:08:15.720 --> 03:08:19.160]  I take it that they're a dying breed, I see it in other professions as well.\n",
      "[03:08:19.160 --> 03:08:21.720]  So this almost seems to be a common thing, but why?\n",
      "[03:08:21.720 --> 03:08:25.960]  I think medical education, medical practice is more commercialized now, you know, it's\n",
      "[03:08:25.960 --> 03:08:27.600]  no more an art.\n",
      "[03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:32.720]  So clinical medicine is actually, I call it an art of medicine with strong scientific\n",
      "[03:08:32.720 --> 03:08:34.100]  principles.\n",
      "[03:08:34.100 --> 03:08:35.480]  It's still an art.\n",
      "[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:37.360]  Now it is not an art anymore.\n",
      "[03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:39.700]  It is commercialized science.\n",
      "[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:42.480]  So you need an artful science instead of a commercialized science.\n",
      "[03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:46.720]  And I think it's because there's so many colleges, so many people passing out of the college,\n",
      "[03:08:46.720 --> 03:08:50.800]  so much of stress on the medical colleges and the medical people.\n",
      "[03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:55.440]  I don't, I think that art part is lost somewhere and the commercial part has come up.\n",
      "[03:08:55.440 --> 03:09:02.760]  It's beautifully put and it almost seems so sad, this paradox that while, you know, a\n",
      "[03:09:02.760 --> 03:09:07.760]  lot of doctors trained in modern medicine will have the algorithms, they'll understand\n",
      "[03:09:07.760 --> 03:09:10.720]  what's going wrong and how to treat it, but they won't have the compassion.\n",
      "[03:09:10.720 --> 03:09:13.680]  And there'll be alternative medicine people who have the compassion, who are talking to\n",
      "[03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:17.560]  the person for two hours, two and a half hours, but they don't have the algorithms, they can't\n",
      "[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:18.560]  do anything with it.\n",
      "[03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:19.560]  Absolutely.\n",
      "[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:20.560]  So you need to strike a balance.\n",
      "[03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:21.560]  Right?\n",
      "[03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:24.280]  So you need that algorithm and the compassion and that can happen only in science-based\n",
      "[03:09:24.280 --> 03:09:25.280]  medicine.\n",
      "[03:09:25.280 --> 03:09:28.680]  You cannot expect the alternative practitioner to have an algorithm, they won't, they are\n",
      "[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:29.680]  not trained in it.\n",
      "[03:09:29.680 --> 03:09:34.320]  So the best way is to have a compassionate kind of algorithmic approach to the patient\n",
      "[03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:36.440]  from a modern medicine doctor.\n",
      "[03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:38.180]  And that works well.\n",
      "[03:09:38.180 --> 03:09:39.880]  It works well for both.\n",
      "[03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:44.120]  So, you know, I mean, one reason I guess homeopaths would get so angry and it's happened to me\n",
      "[03:09:44.120 --> 03:09:48.960]  and we'll discuss that also how people respond to writing these kind of things is that, you\n",
      "[03:09:48.960 --> 03:09:53.520]  know, the moment you, if a person is trained in only homeopathy, the moment you destroy\n",
      "[03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:58.440]  the basis of that, you know, you are effectively saying that they're either delusional or they\n",
      "[03:09:58.440 --> 03:09:59.880]  are a fraud.\n",
      "[03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:04.820]  And you are obviously, if somebody tells me I'm either a fraud or I'm delusional, obviously,\n",
      "[03:10:04.820 --> 03:10:08.600]  you know, it's natural to respond with anger and be, you know, so I kind of get that.\n",
      "[03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:13.480]  Tell me about the real world consequences of this, because one of the things that you've\n",
      "[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:19.520]  been doing so well in your social media is documenting the damage that bad quote unquote\n",
      "[03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:25.280]  medicine does the documenting the damage that Ayurveda does documenting the many ways in\n",
      "[03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:29.120]  which we are harmed by all of these so called harmless herbal supplements.\n",
      "[03:10:29.120 --> 03:10:32.080]  And so, you know, tell me a little bit about that.\n",
      "[03:10:32.080 --> 03:10:34.960]  What is the what do you think is the extent and scale of that?\n",
      "[03:10:34.960 --> 03:10:37.480]  What have your experiences been like?\n",
      "[03:10:37.480 --> 03:10:43.320]  And around around when did you begin to notice these and realize that these are a serious\n",
      "[03:10:43.320 --> 03:10:45.240]  problem?\n",
      "[03:10:45.240 --> 03:10:50.600]  So this actually started off with so when I came back to Cochin to practice as a consultant\n",
      "[03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:56.280]  junior consultant, initially, my whole idea was to work on alcohol associated liver disease,\n",
      "[03:10:56.280 --> 03:10:57.640]  because Kerala is replete with it.\n",
      "[03:10:57.640 --> 03:10:58.640]  And it was my interest.\n",
      "[03:10:58.640 --> 03:11:01.400]  You know, you did stool transplants, you have so many new things happening in that.\n",
      "[03:11:01.400 --> 03:11:02.960]  So that was my interest.\n",
      "[03:11:02.960 --> 03:11:08.320]  So what happened was that I came here with a mindset to study alcoholic liver disease.\n",
      "[03:11:08.320 --> 03:11:13.680]  But what what I faced in real life in my OPD is that I started seeing a lot of patients\n",
      "[03:11:13.680 --> 03:11:16.920]  with hepatitis and jaundice without any cause.\n",
      "[03:11:16.920 --> 03:11:21.480]  No, they had no known reasons for their hepatitis and jaundice and they're like acute, they\n",
      "[03:11:21.480 --> 03:11:22.480]  presented quickly.\n",
      "[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:25.000]  It's not like it's like a chronic ongoing process.\n",
      "[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:28.320]  Suddenly, within a few weeks, they're developing jaundice and hepatitis.\n",
      "[03:11:28.320 --> 03:11:31.360]  So hepatitis is when you have inflammation of the liver and your liver function tests\n",
      "[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:35.120]  will show very high abnormalities in your enzymes, SGOT, SGPT and all that.\n",
      "[03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:36.120]  And you'll have jaundice.\n",
      "[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:40.440]  Jaundice is clinically defined as bilirubin more than three, total bilirubin.\n",
      "[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:43.960]  Lot of people actually mistake it as the lab value.\n",
      "[03:11:43.960 --> 03:11:45.680]  If it slightly goes up, they call it jaundice.\n",
      "[03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:48.120]  It's not the clinical jaundice is above three.\n",
      "[03:11:48.120 --> 03:11:54.440]  So what we did was that when we looked at these patients background in the sense that\n",
      "[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:59.440]  three, six months prior to development of this jaundice, when we looked at that this\n",
      "[03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:03.320]  this particular group of patients, all of them were actually consuming traditional medicines,\n",
      "[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:06.480]  you know, herbal medicines and homeopathy and whatnot.\n",
      "[03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:11.040]  And at that time, we did not figure it out because the common sense at that time was\n",
      "[03:12:11.040 --> 03:12:15.280]  that natural is herbal and safer, no side effects.\n",
      "[03:12:15.280 --> 03:12:20.360]  Everybody uses that because it's safe when we looked at these products.\n",
      "[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:25.000]  So what we did was we identified that traditional medicines were being consumed and the timing\n",
      "[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:26.000]  was actually fitting.\n",
      "[03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:27.760]  This is known as temporal correlation.\n",
      "[03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:32.000]  So they started at some point the traditional medicine and then they developed jaundice\n",
      "[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:33.480]  and it fits it.\n",
      "[03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:37.640]  And you look at all the other causes of jaundice, they're all not there.\n",
      "[03:12:37.640 --> 03:12:38.840]  It's all negative.\n",
      "[03:12:38.840 --> 03:12:44.620]  So this herb induced or drug induced liver injury is basically a diagnosis of exclusion.\n",
      "[03:12:44.620 --> 03:12:48.320]  You say that all the other stuff is not there and this is the stuff and it it fits with\n",
      "[03:12:48.320 --> 03:12:51.060]  the timing and we did liver biopsies.\n",
      "[03:12:51.060 --> 03:12:53.920]  So once we did the liver biopsy, we identified.\n",
      "[03:12:53.920 --> 03:12:58.480]  So if somebody is consuming alcohol, there will be a signature in the liver, right?\n",
      "[03:12:58.480 --> 03:12:59.480]  That is how we identify.\n",
      "[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:01.300]  Alcoholic liver disease has a particular signature.\n",
      "[03:13:01.300 --> 03:13:02.960]  So you know, this is alcohol.\n",
      "[03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:05.640]  Viral hepatitis has a signature, you know, it's viral hepatitis.\n",
      "[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:09.640]  Even modern medicines like paracetamol, when you take, if it's toxic, you'll have a particular\n",
      "[03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:11.480]  type of pattern of liver injury.\n",
      "[03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:17.360]  When we looked at the liver biopsies of all these patients, it was like crazy.\n",
      "[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:21.160]  It was like patterns never seen before in the sense that you'll have patterns of paracetamol\n",
      "[03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:26.120]  poisoning, patterns of alcohol poisoning, patterns of viral hepatitis, patterns of autoimmune\n",
      "[03:13:26.120 --> 03:13:29.760]  hepatitis, everything in a single patient, which is impossible.\n",
      "[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:34.040]  So my pathologist was quite confused, like what is happening to these patients?\n",
      "[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:38.560]  Then we look back and we retrieved these ayurvedic supplements, herbal medicines that they were\n",
      "[03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:44.500]  taking, we analyzed them and we found out that they had multiple liver toxic components\n",
      "[03:13:44.500 --> 03:13:47.600]  in it, including herbs, adulterants, contaminants.\n",
      "[03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:52.160]  So they actually brought out a mix, a match of types of different types of liver injuries\n",
      "[03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:53.160]  in these patients.\n",
      "[03:13:53.160 --> 03:13:55.680]  And these were the cause of liver injury in these patients.\n",
      "[03:13:55.680 --> 03:13:57.320]  So we proved it.\n",
      "[03:13:57.320 --> 03:14:01.640]  This is what we published in 2017-2018 in Indian Journal of Gastroenterology, which\n",
      "[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:04.600]  is the official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology, one of the oldest societies\n",
      "[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:08.920]  in India, a very, very influential and famous society.\n",
      "[03:14:08.920 --> 03:14:14.280]  The moment this was published, that traditional thinking was completely broken.\n",
      "[03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:19.440]  You know, we say that, you know, natural does not mean safe and herbal is not safe.\n",
      "[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:20.560]  Ayurvedic herbals are not safe.\n",
      "[03:14:20.560 --> 03:14:22.040]  It can actually cause liver injury.\n",
      "[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:25.880]  And some of these liver injuries are severe enough that patients can die or they can go\n",
      "[03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:27.080]  for a transplant.\n",
      "[03:14:27.080 --> 03:14:28.920]  So we did that beautifully done paper.\n",
      "[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:32.080]  It was, it actually got an editorial also written on it.\n",
      "[03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:36.360]  And that editorial actually was the highest downloaded article in the history of that\n",
      "[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:37.360]  journal.\n",
      "[03:14:37.360 --> 03:14:39.720]  It was that, that, that effective.\n",
      "[03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:45.080]  And this came out in the papers, the Times of India ran a story on it, then started all\n",
      "[03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:46.600]  the trouble.\n",
      "[03:14:46.600 --> 03:14:49.680]  So what happened was that Ayush Ministry figured it out.\n",
      "[03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:50.680]  Something has happened.\n",
      "[03:14:50.680 --> 03:14:52.720]  This has come out and Ayurvedic herbals are not safe.\n",
      "[03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:54.720]  There is a side effect as well.\n",
      "[03:14:54.720 --> 03:14:56.960]  So they started to email me.\n",
      "[03:14:56.960 --> 03:15:02.720]  So initially it was in good faith emails saying that, you know, you have identified this and\n",
      "[03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:05.360]  which is something unique and things like that.\n",
      "[03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:07.160]  And we would like to talk to you regarding this.\n",
      "[03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:10.000]  I said, okay, let us talk about it.\n",
      "[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:15.400]  Then the second mail came that you have to come to us alone, to our place, to the ministry.\n",
      "[03:15:15.400 --> 03:15:16.920]  We will arrange for your stay and everything.\n",
      "[03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:17.920]  You have to come alone.\n",
      "[03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:19.720]  We have to discuss alone.\n",
      "[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:21.200]  So I said, I'm not going to come alone.\n",
      "[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:23.200]  Why do you mention that you have to come alone?\n",
      "[03:15:23.200 --> 03:15:25.640]  I mean, my co-authors are there, senior authors are there.\n",
      "[03:15:25.640 --> 03:15:26.640]  We'll come.\n",
      "[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:27.640]  No, you, you come alone.\n",
      "[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:28.960]  That's, that's fine.\n",
      "[03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:33.520]  Then I said that I showed some resistance because I said that, what do you want to know actually?\n",
      "[03:15:33.520 --> 03:15:35.040]  And what do you want to discuss about?\n",
      "[03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:39.080]  If it is about changing policies or bringing about a change in the herbal industry, because\n",
      "[03:15:39.080 --> 03:15:44.840]  you are the top apex guys sitting on top there, then I'm ready to have a conversation.\n",
      "[03:15:44.840 --> 03:15:45.840]  They said that.\n",
      "[03:15:45.840 --> 03:15:51.840]  Then came a very weird kind of a letter accusing me of a lot of defamation and all that, saying\n",
      "[03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:53.400]  that you did not check for this.\n",
      "[03:15:53.400 --> 03:15:54.400]  You did not check for that.\n",
      "[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:59.040]  You did not take the permission of Ayurveda industry and Ayush before you publish this\n",
      "[03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:00.040]  paper.\n",
      "[03:16:00.040 --> 03:16:01.040]  You know, some nonsense like that.\n",
      "[03:16:01.040 --> 03:16:04.140]  I mean, why do you need their permission to publish a scientific paper?\n",
      "[03:16:04.140 --> 03:16:06.000]  And so many things like that.\n",
      "[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:09.360]  And you don't, you do not, you do not have an Ayurveda author in that.\n",
      "[03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:12.080]  You should have an Ayurveda author only then this is going to be valid and things like\n",
      "[03:16:12.080 --> 03:16:13.080]  that.\n",
      "[03:16:13.080 --> 03:16:14.080]  I mean, crazy stuff.\n",
      "[03:16:14.080 --> 03:16:16.760]  So I said, you know, these guys are just trolling me.\n",
      "[03:16:16.760 --> 03:16:17.760]  And I stopped.\n",
      "[03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:19.400]  I started ignoring.\n",
      "[03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:21.360]  But these letters kept on coming.\n",
      "[03:16:21.360 --> 03:16:25.640]  And ultimately they said that, okay, you can call the editor in chief of the journal and\n",
      "[03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:26.640]  you come alone.\n",
      "[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:27.640]  And then we'll discuss.\n",
      "[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:28.640]  I said, no.\n",
      "[03:16:28.640 --> 03:16:32.320]  There will be drug-induced liver injury experts, there will be hepatologists, there will be\n",
      "[03:16:32.320 --> 03:16:37.240]  clinical scientists, and there will be journal people also who will have a panel discussion\n",
      "[03:16:37.240 --> 03:16:38.560]  with you on this.\n",
      "[03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:40.160]  So that something good comes out of it.\n",
      "[03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:44.280]  We'll have to make some guidelines or bring out some information for the people.\n",
      "[03:16:44.280 --> 03:16:45.760]  No news after that.\n",
      "[03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:49.600]  They stopped messaging me after that, when I said that.\n",
      "[03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:55.660]  Then I think, I think, I'm not sure how that happened, but two private Ayurveda pharmaceutical\n",
      "[03:16:55.660 --> 03:16:59.920]  companies filed a case against me saying that I'm defaming them.\n",
      "[03:16:59.920 --> 03:17:03.800]  So one was this big company called Pankajagasturi, it's in Kerala.\n",
      "[03:17:03.800 --> 03:17:08.160]  They market products for arthritis and asthma.\n",
      "[03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:12.180]  And for arthritis, that particular product that they market called Orthoherb, I had actually\n",
      "[03:17:12.180 --> 03:17:14.720]  analyzed that and published it in my paper.\n",
      "[03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:18.500]  And I've shown that it had high levels of arsenic and it was contaminated.\n",
      "[03:17:18.500 --> 03:17:22.440]  And that news actually spread like wildfire in Kerala because every household was using\n",
      "[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:24.560]  this particular product.\n",
      "[03:17:24.560 --> 03:17:32.320]  So he filed an FIR against me and cops came to my OPD during my OP hours and started questioning\n",
      "[03:17:32.320 --> 03:17:35.600]  me regarding this, about defamation and things like that.\n",
      "[03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:37.400]  But cops were brilliant.\n",
      "[03:17:37.400 --> 03:17:41.240]  I told them this is part of a scientific paper, they understood and they left me.\n",
      "[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:42.540]  So that part got cancelled.\n",
      "[03:17:42.540 --> 03:17:45.140]  So this guy was like really pissed off.\n",
      "[03:17:45.140 --> 03:17:48.240]  He filed another case in another police station against me.\n",
      "[03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:50.040]  And again, those cops came.\n",
      "[03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:55.080]  And they were a little more into the investigation.\n",
      "[03:17:55.080 --> 03:18:00.160]  Again they wasted a lot of my time, my father's time also, while we were seeing patients.\n",
      "[03:18:00.160 --> 03:18:02.800]  And then they wanted to interview all the authors.\n",
      "[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:05.120]  So I have a pathologist as an author.\n",
      "[03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:08.660]  I have the biomedical guy who does the analysis for me.\n",
      "[03:18:08.660 --> 03:18:11.000]  And they're all from Cochin University of Science and Technology.\n",
      "[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:13.560]  I mean, real, valid, legit people.\n",
      "[03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:15.520]  And they went and spoke to all of them.\n",
      "[03:18:15.520 --> 03:18:21.200]  And the pathologist was actually quite badly, I mean, in the sense that they were a little\n",
      "[03:18:21.200 --> 03:18:22.360]  strong on him.\n",
      "[03:18:22.360 --> 03:18:27.280]  He had to show all the slides that he looked at, explain all that stuff.\n",
      "[03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:30.240]  He was just harassed quite a bit.\n",
      "[03:18:30.240 --> 03:18:32.200]  And he was really down.\n",
      "[03:18:32.200 --> 03:18:37.960]  And he was the pathologist who actually identified these new patterns of liver injury.\n",
      "[03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:39.220]  And that is like something unique.\n",
      "[03:18:39.220 --> 03:18:42.400]  So that paper actually was completely on his shoulders.\n",
      "[03:18:42.400 --> 03:18:45.960]  I mean, his finding is what helped me publish this paper.\n",
      "[03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:49.080]  He was so harassed that he actually left the country.\n",
      "[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:52.360]  He left India and is now working in the UAE and he's peaceful there.\n",
      "[03:18:52.360 --> 03:18:56.800]  He said, I'm not going to come back again if this is what happens to a scientist or\n",
      "[03:18:56.800 --> 03:19:00.960]  a physician when they bring out scientific truths, I'm not going to come back.\n",
      "[03:19:00.960 --> 03:19:03.680]  So he started working abroad and he's not come back.\n",
      "[03:19:03.680 --> 03:19:07.520]  So I lost a good member in my team.\n",
      "[03:19:07.520 --> 03:19:12.480]  And once this happened and we started seeing problems with other systems of alternative\n",
      "[03:19:12.480 --> 03:19:14.240]  medicine also, like homeopathy.\n",
      "[03:19:14.240 --> 03:19:16.760]  So we started talking about homeopathy related liver injury.\n",
      "[03:19:16.760 --> 03:19:22.720]  So I have, I published a lot of papers on Ayurveda related liver injury in normal people.\n",
      "[03:19:22.720 --> 03:19:27.680]  Ayurveda, if cirrhosis patients, if they consume Ayurveda, what happens to them?\n",
      "[03:19:27.680 --> 03:19:28.880]  That paper we published.\n",
      "[03:19:28.880 --> 03:19:32.040]  And even alcohol liver disease patients, if they consume Ayurveda, what happens to them?\n",
      "[03:19:32.040 --> 03:19:35.280]  So we have a bunch of good original papers on this.\n",
      "[03:19:35.280 --> 03:19:40.840]  And the all papers have shown that these patients have very poor survival without a transplant.\n",
      "[03:19:40.840 --> 03:19:45.840]  For example, if you take patients with alcoholic liver disease who take herbal medicines, the\n",
      "[03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:51.680]  only 18% of them will survive at six months and that's a very low number.\n",
      "[03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:53.720]  That's 18% of patients.\n",
      "[03:19:53.720 --> 03:20:00.920]  I mean, that's about 90% of them, 80% of them dead for nothing, without proper treatment\n",
      "[03:20:00.920 --> 03:20:02.280]  and without a transplant.\n",
      "[03:20:02.280 --> 03:20:05.840]  Even in the case of cirrhosis patients, when they take Ayurveda for other reasons like\n",
      "[03:20:05.840 --> 03:20:10.160]  diabetes or whatever, 53% of them die.\n",
      "[03:20:10.160 --> 03:20:12.360]  And these are all unnecessary health burden.\n",
      "[03:20:12.360 --> 03:20:15.000]  We can actually avoid it, you know, avoidable health burden.\n",
      "[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:20.880]  These people should have survived for longer duration, for decades, if they did not consume\n",
      "[03:20:20.880 --> 03:20:22.080]  that herbal medicine.\n",
      "[03:20:22.080 --> 03:20:23.360]  So that was the whole point.\n",
      "[03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:26.000]  So then we started publishing on homeopathy.\n",
      "[03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:29.840]  So we have had a lot of patients who develop alcoholic liver disease because of homeopathy.\n",
      "[03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:30.840]  Because of homeopathy.\n",
      "[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:35.400]  Because homeopaths, what they do is they know that the diluted stuff is diluted and there\n",
      "[03:20:35.400 --> 03:20:36.400]  is nothing in it.\n",
      "[03:20:36.400 --> 03:20:39.000]  So they start giving patients mother tinctures.\n",
      "[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:40.760]  Mother tinctures are potent.\n",
      "[03:20:40.760 --> 03:20:45.200]  I mean, for them it's not potent, for them it's low potency, but for us it is very potent.\n",
      "[03:20:45.200 --> 03:20:49.880]  Mother tinctures contain absolute alcohol, about 90 to 94% and then active ingredient\n",
      "[03:20:49.880 --> 03:20:52.760]  like arsenic or lead or something like that.\n",
      "[03:20:52.760 --> 03:20:58.280]  And patients consume this to get the effect and they develop real proper adverse events\n",
      "[03:20:58.280 --> 03:20:59.280]  because of that.\n",
      "[03:20:59.280 --> 03:21:02.760]  We have had bone injury, we have had even patients with bone marrow failure after consuming\n",
      "[03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:04.760]  homeopathy medicines, mother tincture.\n",
      "[03:21:04.760 --> 03:21:08.280]  And we published that and we spoke about it.\n",
      "[03:21:08.280 --> 03:21:13.440]  Homeopaths are a totally different breed when it comes to, you know, responses.\n",
      "[03:21:13.440 --> 03:21:19.720]  A group of homeopaths, I'm talking about practitioners, I mean, they consider themselves as doctors.\n",
      "[03:21:19.720 --> 03:21:26.000]  They took a car from North Kerala, came all the way, identified my lab somehow, the lab\n",
      "[03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:29.120]  where I analyze these products, they identified the lab.\n",
      "[03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:33.960]  They harassed my lab members, the security and everybody, took videos, live videos of\n",
      "[03:21:33.960 --> 03:21:39.080]  that lab and then put it on Facebook calling for violence against them.\n",
      "[03:21:39.080 --> 03:21:44.880]  So the homeopathy sympathizers and apologists on their behalf started writing below that\n",
      "[03:21:44.880 --> 03:21:48.800]  particular post saying that we'll kill them and stuff like that.\n",
      "[03:21:48.800 --> 03:21:50.360]  I mean, crazy.\n",
      "[03:21:50.360 --> 03:21:55.400]  My lab members got so scared and the lab director told me that, you know, this is something\n",
      "[03:21:55.400 --> 03:21:59.880]  we did not expect this and I was so worried for them and I was so sorry that it got leaked\n",
      "[03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:01.320]  out somehow.\n",
      "[03:22:01.320 --> 03:22:05.360]  And I told them that, you know what, let us stop this because they were the ones who helped\n",
      "[03:22:05.360 --> 03:22:09.280]  me with all the analysis of my, all the drugs and all the papers we published was just because\n",
      "[03:22:09.280 --> 03:22:11.240]  of their beautiful work.\n",
      "[03:22:11.240 --> 03:22:15.280]  And I had to cut ties with them because I wanted to, I want to make sure that they don't\n",
      "[03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:17.360]  get into any more physical trouble.\n",
      "[03:22:17.360 --> 03:22:23.320]  So I had to stop my analytical work for almost a year before another lab agreed to work with\n",
      "[03:22:23.320 --> 03:22:24.320]  me.\n",
      "[03:22:24.320 --> 03:22:27.400]  And we have, we have a lab now who's working with us, totally anonymous.\n",
      "[03:22:27.400 --> 03:22:30.000]  It's not, it's nowhere in the state also.\n",
      "[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:31.240]  And they are doing the work for us now.\n",
      "[03:22:31.240 --> 03:22:36.400]  But because of this, because the homeopaths responded so badly, harassed my lab members,\n",
      "[03:22:36.400 --> 03:22:42.640]  leading to the closure of our deal, I lost a whole year of research work because of that.\n",
      "[03:22:42.640 --> 03:22:46.360]  And that's actually quite, quite, if you look at a clinical scientist, that's actually quite\n",
      "[03:22:46.360 --> 03:22:50.360]  a, quite a huge time that is lost.\n",
      "[03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:54.520]  So these are the two major events that happened and two, three major events, actually, I mean,\n",
      "[03:22:54.520 --> 03:22:59.360]  from the AYUSH ministry, from the pharma lobby, and also from the homeopaths directly.\n",
      "[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:03.120]  In between this, something else happened, you know, this is nothing to do with Ayurveda\n",
      "[03:23:03.120 --> 03:23:07.100]  per se, but it is to do with the herbal and supplement industry that is Herbalife.\n",
      "[03:23:07.100 --> 03:23:11.360]  So I published a paper on Herbalife related liver injury, where a patient actually died,\n",
      "[03:23:11.360 --> 03:23:16.000]  a young woman died, 23, 24 years of age with two kids.\n",
      "[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:18.320]  She died after consuming Herbalife products.\n",
      "[03:23:18.320 --> 03:23:22.040]  And this is not the first time it has happened, Herbalife is well known to cause liver injury\n",
      "[03:23:22.040 --> 03:23:23.100]  and death.\n",
      "[03:23:23.100 --> 03:23:27.360]  And about, before I published my paper, more than 70 cases of Herbalife related liver injury\n",
      "[03:23:27.360 --> 03:23:32.320]  has been published from all over the world, Switzerland, Israel, Europe, everywhere.\n",
      "[03:23:32.320 --> 03:23:36.440]  And mine was the first from India, from Asia Pacific region.\n",
      "[03:23:36.440 --> 03:23:38.320]  And we published that.\n",
      "[03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:41.240]  And Herbalife is a different kind of monster.\n",
      "[03:23:41.240 --> 03:23:46.400]  It is nothing like what we deal with the Ayurveda industry, they mailed me a nice mail initially\n",
      "[03:23:46.400 --> 03:23:47.960]  asking about patient details and all.\n",
      "[03:23:47.960 --> 03:23:50.120]  So I gave them, I said that everything is in the paper.\n",
      "[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:52.000]  So I forwarded the paper to them.\n",
      "[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:57.200]  The second mail I got was from an attorney in Delhi saying that, you know, I have defamed\n",
      "[03:23:57.200 --> 03:23:58.200]  Herbalife.\n",
      "[03:23:58.200 --> 03:23:59.720]  So you have to pay 2 million US dollars.\n",
      "[03:23:59.720 --> 03:24:02.840]  They're going to sue me for 2 million US dollars.\n",
      "[03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:07.040]  So I said, sue me, no problem, because I have evidence to show in the court, you're not\n",
      "[03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:09.680]  going to win this, you sue me, no problem.\n",
      "[03:24:09.680 --> 03:24:12.400]  So I was holding my ground.\n",
      "[03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:14.500]  What they did was something unexpected.\n",
      "[03:24:14.500 --> 03:24:17.880]  So they did not communicate with me anymore.\n",
      "[03:24:17.880 --> 03:24:22.120]  They directly started suing the journal and the publisher.\n",
      "[03:24:22.120 --> 03:24:25.720]  So the report where I published that report in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental\n",
      "[03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:29.240]  Hepatology, JCH, and the publisher was Elsevier.\n",
      "[03:24:29.240 --> 03:24:35.080]  So they sent a lot of legal letters to them, to the journal editorial board, to the assistant\n",
      "[03:24:35.080 --> 03:24:36.680]  editor of the journal.\n",
      "[03:24:36.680 --> 03:24:38.960]  These people are like not expecting this, right?\n",
      "[03:24:38.960 --> 03:24:44.800]  And I mean, I can fight in the court, because I have some good friends and lawyers and everybody\n",
      "[03:24:44.800 --> 03:24:46.200]  who's ready to willing to help me.\n",
      "[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:49.240]  But these people, if they actually have to fight in the court, they have to pay from\n",
      "[03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:50.240]  their pockets.\n",
      "[03:24:50.240 --> 03:24:51.840]  Nobody's going to help them out and all that.\n",
      "[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:55.400]  So they actually got scared of this legal threat.\n",
      "[03:24:55.400 --> 03:25:00.280]  And they issued an apology letter without telling me and called my, and in that apology\n",
      "[03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:06.520]  letter without any proper scientific validation, they called my paper unscientific and said\n",
      "[03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:09.280]  that everything that I had written in the paper was actually wrong and they are sorry\n",
      "[03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:10.280]  for it.\n",
      "[03:25:10.280 --> 03:25:12.660]  And they sent this apology letter to Herbalife.\n",
      "[03:25:12.660 --> 03:25:17.760]  And because of that, my paper was removed, removed without my permission.\n",
      "[03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:22.560]  And this was actually a big deal for Herbalife and science lost and money won there.\n",
      "[03:25:22.560 --> 03:25:29.240]  And this was actually blocked by major science integrity scientists like Elizabeth Bick.\n",
      "[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:33.680]  She blocked about it, Retraction Watch, NPR funded Retraction Watch actually wrote about\n",
      "[03:25:33.680 --> 03:25:34.680]  it.\n",
      "[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:35.680]  All supporting you, obviously.\n",
      "[03:25:35.680 --> 03:25:36.680]  All supporting me.\n",
      "[03:25:36.680 --> 03:25:39.160]  Because that paper was strongly scientifically valid.\n",
      "[03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:42.960]  And they actually ran two peer reviews and both the peer reviews actually said that this\n",
      "[03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:44.480]  is true.\n",
      "[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:46.600]  This paper has no science problems.\n",
      "[03:25:46.600 --> 03:25:48.000]  It is all true.\n",
      "[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:51.920]  But because Herbalife were hounding them, they removed that paper.\n",
      "[03:25:51.920 --> 03:25:56.880]  And it was very sad to see the senior gastroenterologists and senior physicians fumble.\n",
      "[03:25:56.880 --> 03:26:00.960]  Because if they had stood ground, I could have actually gone to court and won that case.\n",
      "[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:02.360]  Is that paper still online somewhere?\n",
      "[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:03.360]  No, no.\n",
      "[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:04.360]  It's completely taken it out.\n",
      "[03:26:04.360 --> 03:26:07.520]  And everywhere I put it up, they take it out.\n",
      "[03:26:07.520 --> 03:26:10.800]  I put it up on a private server in ResearchGate.\n",
      "[03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:11.800]  They took it out from there.\n",
      "[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:13.480]  They sued ResearchGate.\n",
      "[03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:17.920]  I put it up on a place called Inado, I forgot the name.\n",
      "[03:26:17.920 --> 03:26:21.480]  This is also a public server where you can upload your papers and everything.\n",
      "[03:26:21.480 --> 03:26:24.720]  They took it out from there also, said that they'll sue them.\n",
      "[03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:27.040]  So they're not allowed that paper to come up anywhere.\n",
      "[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:31.520]  Now it is uploaded in Dr. Elizabeth Bick's blog and in Retraction Watch's blog and in\n",
      "[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:32.880]  my personal website.\n",
      "[03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:33.880]  It's uploaded there.\n",
      "[03:26:33.880 --> 03:26:34.880]  Wonderful.\n",
      "[03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:36.280]  I'll link to it from the show notes.\n",
      "[03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:40.280]  So that is that these are the problems that I faced mostly.\n",
      "[03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:46.120]  So from all angles, legal, police, and even $2 million of suing.\n",
      "[03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:49.800]  And the best part is even after my paper came out, multiple papers from other countries\n",
      "[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:53.920]  came out, I mean, showing Herbalife related liver injuries.\n",
      "[03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:59.280]  Because those guys and those journals were strong headed, Herbalife can't do anything\n",
      "[03:26:59.280 --> 03:27:00.280]  there.\n",
      "[03:27:00.280 --> 03:27:03.440]  But because you were in India and an easy, easy target, so they thought.\n",
      "[03:27:03.440 --> 03:27:04.440]  I think so.\n",
      "[03:27:04.440 --> 03:27:08.560]  So I, you know, when COVID first started, I got sort of distraught at the kind of quacky\n",
      "[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:12.520]  remedies that these people were kind of coming up with Coronil and all of that.\n",
      "[03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:15.600]  And I wrote, I was a columnist for the Times of India.\n",
      "[03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:19.680]  I mean, technically, I still am, but I haven't written for the longest time.\n",
      "[03:27:19.680 --> 03:27:21.600]  Apologies to my editors there.\n",
      "[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:25.960]  So I wrote this piece about, basically called Beware of Alternative Medicine.\n",
      "[03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:30.440]  I'll link it from the show notes and spoke out against homeopathy and Ayurveda.\n",
      "[03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:34.080]  And in the end, I had something about how the Ministry of Ayurveda should not exist,\n",
      "[03:27:34.080 --> 03:27:35.720]  which I do strongly feel.\n",
      "[03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:37.680]  It's a ministry of quackery.\n",
      "[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:41.160]  And the Ministry of Ayush, I don't know if it's a great honor or something, but the Ministry\n",
      "[03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:45.720]  of Ayush then came out with a press release complaining against my article and demanding\n",
      "[03:27:45.720 --> 03:27:48.280]  that Times of India and I apologize.\n",
      "[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:51.640]  And my editor there called me in laughing and said, what do we do?\n",
      "[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:55.780]  And I said, listen, I am happy to double down, never apologizing for that.\n",
      "[03:27:55.780 --> 03:27:57.840]  So nothing of that's what happened.\n",
      "[03:27:57.840 --> 03:28:03.840]  But you know, for a ministry to come out with a press release against an individual article\n",
      "[03:28:03.840 --> 03:28:06.760]  in a newspaper seemed to me just nuts.\n",
      "[03:28:06.760 --> 03:28:11.560]  But what you told me when we were chatting in the break is that the Times of India reporter\n",
      "[03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:15.840]  who covered your first study, just covered your study said that so and so has a study\n",
      "[03:28:15.840 --> 03:28:17.840]  out and this is what it says.\n",
      "[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:21.520]  She had to go to court along with the Times of India because she got harassed and sued.\n",
      "[03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:23.040]  Yeah, by the Ministry of Ayush.\n",
      "[03:28:23.040 --> 03:28:24.040]  By the Ministry of Ayush.\n",
      "[03:28:24.040 --> 03:28:27.920]  It went to the magistrate and from there it got chucked out.\n",
      "[03:28:27.920 --> 03:28:31.280]  But imagine all that harassment paperwork.\n",
      "[03:28:31.280 --> 03:28:35.160]  Give me a sense of the incentives involved in that ecosystem because I can imagine a\n",
      "[03:28:35.160 --> 03:28:40.480]  big company like Harbalife putting money might and trying to intimidate you and you know,\n",
      "[03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:45.320]  back in the day, IIPM once did this to a bunch of bloggers filing cases from all kinds of\n",
      "[03:28:45.320 --> 03:28:46.320]  different cities.\n",
      "[03:28:46.320 --> 03:28:50.880]  So you have to, you know, kind of go, you know, it's just harassment and using money\n",
      "[03:28:50.880 --> 03:28:52.240]  power to whatever.\n",
      "[03:28:52.240 --> 03:28:55.040]  And I can understand a private company like Harbalife do that.\n",
      "[03:28:55.040 --> 03:28:59.480]  I can understand groups of homopath doctors do that because you know, otherwise, their\n",
      "[03:28:59.480 --> 03:29:03.880]  sense of self is being attacked, their business is being attacked as you point out their livelihood.\n",
      "[03:29:03.880 --> 03:29:06.680]  What's the deal with the Ministry of Ayush in all of this?\n",
      "[03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:08.920]  Like what are the vested interests involved?\n",
      "[03:29:08.920 --> 03:29:13.560]  And surely there is, you know, there must be some internal conflict between, I mean,\n",
      "[03:29:13.560 --> 03:29:16.380]  our government also has a Ministry of Health, right?\n",
      "[03:29:16.380 --> 03:29:20.000]  And the Ministry of Ayush is, you know, directly counter to that.\n",
      "[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:24.840]  So what sense do you have of these dynamics and these vested interests and what's going\n",
      "[03:29:24.840 --> 03:29:25.840]  on here?\n",
      "[03:29:25.840 --> 03:29:30.400]  I think the most important aspect is that the Ministry of Ayush, I think we need a ministry\n",
      "[03:29:30.400 --> 03:29:31.400]  like that.\n",
      "[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:35.400]  For example, in the US, they have a National Center for Complementary Interrogative Medicine,\n",
      "[03:29:35.400 --> 03:29:36.400]  NCCIM.\n",
      "[03:29:36.400 --> 03:29:41.160]  They regulate, for example, if they actually find out that a particular herb or a herbal\n",
      "[03:29:41.160 --> 03:29:45.880]  supplement or a herbal or dietary supplement is actually causing harm to the patient population\n",
      "[03:29:45.880 --> 03:29:51.040]  or a general population, they bring out statements saying that, you know, beware, at your risk,\n",
      "[03:29:51.040 --> 03:29:54.040]  this is not evaluated by the FDA, this is shown to cause problems.\n",
      "[03:29:54.040 --> 03:29:55.520]  So please beware.\n",
      "[03:29:55.520 --> 03:29:57.840]  And you set your risk.\n",
      "[03:29:57.840 --> 03:30:01.600]  But what our ministry is actually, our ministry is supposed to do that, Ayush Ministry is\n",
      "[03:30:01.600 --> 03:30:02.720]  supposed to regulate.\n",
      "[03:30:02.720 --> 03:30:05.600]  But what they're doing is that they have completely forgotten about regulation and they're doing\n",
      "[03:30:05.600 --> 03:30:06.920]  promotion.\n",
      "[03:30:06.920 --> 03:30:11.840]  So they are there, just there to promote Indian medicine, Indian traditional medicine.\n",
      "[03:30:11.840 --> 03:30:15.000]  And they have actually brought everything into that umbrella term Ayush and promoting\n",
      "[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:16.480]  everything.\n",
      "[03:30:16.480 --> 03:30:23.600]  And if they actually, if I say that or you say that something is harmful and that part,\n",
      "[03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:27.240]  that is directly related to an Ayush practice.\n",
      "[03:30:27.240 --> 03:30:32.640]  If they also say, yeah, it is harmful, then it's directly saying that, you know, you cannot\n",
      "[03:30:32.640 --> 03:30:33.640]  promote it.\n",
      "[03:30:33.640 --> 03:30:37.440]  So every time they're doing promotion, it's against their promotional values.\n",
      "[03:30:37.440 --> 03:30:43.600]  A classical example is when the COVID pandemic was at its peak, Ayush Ministry actually brought\n",
      "[03:30:43.600 --> 03:30:47.320]  out guidelines for treating COVID, which is one of the most hilarious things I've ever\n",
      "[03:30:47.320 --> 03:30:48.880]  read in my life.\n",
      "[03:30:48.880 --> 03:30:54.360]  And in that they actually mentioned that people should take Giloy Khata, lot of Giloy decoctions\n",
      "[03:30:54.360 --> 03:30:58.720]  to prevent Corona, this thing, infection.\n",
      "[03:30:58.720 --> 03:31:04.000]  Very interestingly, a group of doctors from Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai, headed by Professor\n",
      "[03:31:04.000 --> 03:31:09.400]  Abha Nagral, they identified initially six patients who developed severe Giloy liver\n",
      "[03:31:09.400 --> 03:31:17.120]  injury and they attributed it to some components in Giloy, which can act, known as furanoditerpenoids.\n",
      "[03:31:17.120 --> 03:31:21.240]  I mean, people say that modern medicine is chemical, but they don't think, they don't,\n",
      "[03:31:21.240 --> 03:31:23.200]  they don't realize that everything is chemicals.\n",
      "[03:31:23.200 --> 03:31:25.760]  And these are worse chemicals, not being tested.\n",
      "[03:31:25.760 --> 03:31:27.080]  Not being tested also.\n",
      "[03:31:27.080 --> 03:31:30.480]  So these plants have a lot of chemicals in that plant, phytochemicals.\n",
      "[03:31:30.480 --> 03:31:36.480]  And one of that chemical is known as furanoditerpenoids that can actually cause injury to the liver.\n",
      "[03:31:36.480 --> 03:31:41.440]  And the injuries in a very, very unique manner that furanoditerpenoids can actually modulate\n",
      "[03:31:41.440 --> 03:31:43.200]  your immune system.\n",
      "[03:31:43.200 --> 03:31:49.360]  So your immune system loses its ability to identify self, which means it will start attacking\n",
      "[03:31:49.360 --> 03:31:50.720]  you.\n",
      "[03:31:50.720 --> 03:31:53.060]  That is known as autoimmune, autoimmune disease.\n",
      "[03:31:53.060 --> 03:31:56.900]  So you lose, your immune cells start attacking your organs.\n",
      "[03:31:56.900 --> 03:31:59.360]  So that particular attack comes in the liver.\n",
      "[03:31:59.360 --> 03:32:02.880]  So that is Giloy induced autoimmune like hepatitis.\n",
      "[03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:09.160]  So Giloy, this group found out that if you take Giloy as recommended, some patients can\n",
      "[03:32:09.160 --> 03:32:12.580]  actually get autoimmune liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis.\n",
      "[03:32:12.580 --> 03:32:17.420]  And those who already have autoimmune disorders, like for example, diabetes or thyroid disease\n",
      "[03:32:17.420 --> 03:32:20.720]  or rheumatoid arthritis, these are all autoimmune diseases, right?\n",
      "[03:32:20.720 --> 03:32:24.040]  So if somebody who has already has a risk of autoimmune disease and they take Giloy,\n",
      "[03:32:24.040 --> 03:32:27.720]  they have a higher risk of developing autoimmune hepatitis with Giloy.\n",
      "[03:32:27.720 --> 03:32:28.720]  This was published.\n",
      "[03:32:28.720 --> 03:32:32.960]  IH ministry brought out a, it's so funny, I mean, I don't know how they can do that.\n",
      "[03:32:32.960 --> 03:32:36.820]  They brought out a big press conference saying that the study is fake.\n",
      "[03:32:36.820 --> 03:32:41.120]  This study was actually published in a peer-reviewed journal, you know, under the Indian National\n",
      "[03:32:41.120 --> 03:32:44.840]  Association of Study of Liver, Inasal is the biggest national society for liver management\n",
      "[03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:46.120]  in the country.\n",
      "[03:32:46.120 --> 03:32:49.980]  And they called that study a fake and said that this is misleading.\n",
      "[03:32:49.980 --> 03:32:54.520]  So me and a lot of my colleagues were actually discussing about this.\n",
      "[03:32:54.520 --> 03:32:56.920]  And we just started talking about Giloy.\n",
      "[03:32:56.920 --> 03:32:59.600]  And I said, you know, I have seen like three or four cases of Giloy.\n",
      "[03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:03.120]  And my colleagues started saying that, you know, he has seen eight, another colleague\n",
      "[03:33:03.120 --> 03:33:04.740]  has seen four.\n",
      "[03:33:04.740 --> 03:33:06.920]  So I said, why don't you guys publish it?\n",
      "[03:33:06.920 --> 03:33:10.360]  He said, like, I mean, we don't know how to go about it.\n",
      "[03:33:10.360 --> 03:33:15.680]  So what we did was we created this group called the Liver Research Club of India, Liverachi.\n",
      "[03:33:15.680 --> 03:33:18.800]  And 13 hospitals participated in that.\n",
      "[03:33:18.800 --> 03:33:24.520]  And we published the largest series of Giloy liver injury from the country, from all regions.\n",
      "[03:33:24.520 --> 03:33:28.600]  And that was published in Hepatology Communications, which is an official journal of American Association\n",
      "[03:33:28.600 --> 03:33:30.440]  of Study of Liver Disease.\n",
      "[03:33:30.440 --> 03:33:34.200]  That was like a nail on the coffin for the Ayush industry.\n",
      "[03:33:34.200 --> 03:33:39.840]  A lot of papers ran because it's not just about six patients now, it's now much more.\n",
      "[03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:44.320]  We are getting so many patients from different parts of the country having Giloy liver injury.\n",
      "[03:33:44.320 --> 03:33:47.240]  We brought out a lot of media wrote about it.\n",
      "[03:33:47.240 --> 03:33:51.040]  I think the Wire Science wrote the best part of it.\n",
      "[03:33:51.040 --> 03:33:56.360]  Banjot Kaur, she wrote a really good article on it about Giloy liver injury.\n",
      "[03:33:56.360 --> 03:33:59.040]  And this was out in the open now.\n",
      "[03:33:59.040 --> 03:34:06.200]  Still Ayush got a statement saying that this is misleading, fake information.\n",
      "[03:34:06.200 --> 03:34:10.560]  I mean, what they should have done is ideally tell people that at least people who have\n",
      "[03:34:10.560 --> 03:34:13.440]  some autoimmune disease process, please avoid Giloy.\n",
      "[03:34:13.440 --> 03:34:14.440]  That's it.\n",
      "[03:34:14.440 --> 03:34:15.440]  That's all they're required to do.\n",
      "[03:34:15.440 --> 03:34:16.440]  That is regulation.\n",
      "[03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:17.440]  Right.\n",
      "[03:34:17.440 --> 03:34:22.360]  But if they do that, the problem is almost 70 to 80 percent of Ayurvedic products contain\n",
      "[03:34:22.360 --> 03:34:27.960]  Giloy, which means all of these products will come under the blacklisting.\n",
      "[03:34:27.960 --> 03:34:31.320]  They can never do that because they are going to lose a lot of businesses because Ayush\n",
      "[03:34:31.320 --> 03:34:37.080]  Ministry, I think, has to take care of stakeholders concerns also.\n",
      "[03:34:37.080 --> 03:34:43.440]  So we have a lot of private and public Ayush industries running and everybody's products\n",
      "[03:34:43.440 --> 03:34:44.440]  will be under the scanner.\n",
      "[03:34:44.440 --> 03:34:48.280]  If somebody says that, you know, Giloy is dangerous, please don't take it.\n",
      "[03:34:48.280 --> 03:34:50.120]  It can cause autoimmune hepatitis.\n",
      "[03:34:50.120 --> 03:34:53.360]  That means a lot of Giloy products will be off the shelves.\n",
      "[03:34:53.360 --> 03:34:58.640]  People will stop using it if they make a statement like that, which is why I think Ayush to protect\n",
      "[03:34:58.640 --> 03:35:04.400]  their stakeholders in the best of interest of business does this.\n",
      "[03:35:04.400 --> 03:35:06.360]  That is why they behave like that.\n",
      "[03:35:06.360 --> 03:35:08.920]  And I think it is still to do with the business only.\n",
      "[03:35:08.920 --> 03:35:14.520]  And they look at the stakeholders part, but not the public health part.\n",
      "[03:35:14.520 --> 03:35:17.360]  So the Ministry of Ayush is not really working for the people of India.\n",
      "[03:35:17.360 --> 03:35:20.480]  It's working for these companies in the Ayush space.\n",
      "[03:35:20.480 --> 03:35:25.680]  I definitely think so, because if they were definitely going to be working for public\n",
      "[03:35:25.680 --> 03:35:30.920]  health and the people of India, the Italian ministry has blacklisted turmeric supplements.\n",
      "[03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:35.680]  They have actually told people who sell turmeric supplements in Italy to put a black label\n",
      "[03:35:35.680 --> 03:35:39.160]  warning because turmeric causes a lot of liver injury and bleeding manifestation.\n",
      "[03:35:39.160 --> 03:35:42.480]  So there is going to be a black label warning for turmeric supplements.\n",
      "[03:35:42.480 --> 03:35:43.480]  They are doing it.\n",
      "[03:35:43.480 --> 03:35:44.480]  There is evidence to it.\n",
      "[03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:45.480]  A lot of work has been done.\n",
      "[03:35:45.480 --> 03:35:46.960]  A lot of publications has come out.\n",
      "[03:35:46.960 --> 03:35:49.200]  Why isn't the Ayush Ministry doing it?\n",
      "[03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:54.760]  Already another, I mean, Italian government is not like, you know, they don't do it without\n",
      "[03:35:54.760 --> 03:35:55.760]  any reason.\n",
      "[03:35:55.760 --> 03:35:56.760]  They have actually have reasons for it.\n",
      "[03:35:56.760 --> 03:35:58.240]  So if they are doing it, why not?\n",
      "[03:35:58.240 --> 03:36:00.000]  Ayush Ministry is not doing it.\n",
      "[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:04.960]  So that definitely means that they are ignoring or evading health-related truths from the\n",
      "[03:36:04.960 --> 03:36:05.960]  people.\n",
      "[03:36:05.960 --> 03:36:06.960]  So they're not working for the people.\n",
      "[03:36:06.960 --> 03:36:07.960]  100% not.\n",
      "[03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:13.920]  And an important sort of point to note here is that this is a systemic problem.\n",
      "[03:36:13.920 --> 03:36:19.640]  It is not as if there is some outlier, bad company has produced a bad medicine, it is\n",
      "[03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:20.920]  not like that at all.\n",
      "[03:36:20.920 --> 03:36:23.880]  It is a systemic problem within Ayurveda itself.\n",
      "[03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:28.620]  Like when you point out that 70 to 80% of Ayurveda medications have Giloy, you know,\n",
      "[03:36:28.620 --> 03:36:30.200]  it is a systemic problem.\n",
      "[03:36:30.200 --> 03:36:31.600]  Everybody is at risk.\n",
      "[03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:35.400]  What is the sort of quantum of cases that you see?\n",
      "[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:36.880]  How bad is it?\n",
      "[03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:41.760]  So I mean, if you look at from my practice, I think it will be a little bit of bias because\n",
      "[03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:46.360]  there will be a referral bias there because I am the only person who actually works actively\n",
      "[03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:47.800]  on complement and alternative medicine.\n",
      "[03:36:47.800 --> 03:36:51.480]  We do a lot of herbal and herbal-related toxicology analysis also.\n",
      "[03:36:51.480 --> 03:36:53.720]  My department and my unit does that.\n",
      "[03:36:53.720 --> 03:36:57.440]  So I get a lot of referrals from other hospitals and other people also.\n",
      "[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:02.920]  I mean, so I see a lot more patients than what other people may be seeing, other doctors\n",
      "[03:37:02.920 --> 03:37:04.280]  may be seeing.\n",
      "[03:37:04.280 --> 03:37:10.640]  Even then, during the COVID time, I used to see about five to six new cases a week of\n",
      "[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:14.640]  herbal liver injury, including homeopathy and Siddha and everything.\n",
      "[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:15.760]  And now it has come down to three.\n",
      "[03:37:15.760 --> 03:37:19.960]  I mean, last week I saw three patients with herbal and homeopathy liver injury, which\n",
      "[03:37:19.960 --> 03:37:24.320]  is actually a lot because if you look at it per month, it's somewhere around 12 cases,\n",
      "[03:37:24.320 --> 03:37:27.440]  15 cases of patients who should not have been patients in the first place.\n",
      "[03:37:27.440 --> 03:37:31.200]  This is just added disease burden, added health burden to the community.\n",
      "[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:32.720]  You can just avoid all of it.\n",
      "[03:37:32.720 --> 03:37:37.200]  You can avoid all this resource utilization, all this financial burden from the patient.\n",
      "[03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:41.760]  Some of them even land up in liver transplant, 20 to 25 lakhs.\n",
      "[03:37:41.760 --> 03:37:44.120]  So much of unnecessary spending on it.\n",
      "[03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:48.880]  And this is just the tip of the iceberg that I see.\n",
      "[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:54.160]  If every doctor in the periphery, in every doctor in an institute with a proper department\n",
      "[03:37:54.160 --> 03:37:58.960]  to look into adverse drug reactions from complementary and alternative medicines does this, I think\n",
      "[03:37:58.960 --> 03:38:00.640]  these numbers will be much, much higher.\n",
      "[03:38:00.640 --> 03:38:06.400]  It will be much higher because if you look at data coming out from the US and Asia Pacific\n",
      "[03:38:06.400 --> 03:38:11.880]  per se, the number one cause of something known as acute or chronic liver failure, that\n",
      "[03:38:11.880 --> 03:38:16.480]  is already patients have stable liver disease, they have underlying pre-existing liver disease\n",
      "[03:38:16.480 --> 03:38:18.440]  and suddenly they develop liver failure.\n",
      "[03:38:18.440 --> 03:38:24.000]  The number one cause of such acute and chronic liver failure initially was anti-tuberculosis\n",
      "[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:25.000]  drugs.\n",
      "[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  We have a lot of TB patients.\n",
      "[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:27.000]  We treat them.\n",
      "[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:32.040]  Some of them develop TB-related liver injury, anti-TB drugs-related liver injury.\n",
      "[03:38:32.040 --> 03:38:36.240]  Now the number one cause is complementary and alternative medicine in Asia Pacific.\n",
      "[03:38:36.240 --> 03:38:37.240]  So that is there.\n",
      "[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:38.240]  It is emerging.\n",
      "[03:38:38.240 --> 03:38:42.400]  So if actually if you look at it from an Indian perspective, what I am seeing is just the\n",
      "[03:38:42.400 --> 03:38:43.400]  tip of the iceberg.\n",
      "[03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:44.560]  There'll be much, much more cases.\n",
      "[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:48.440]  Yeah, and I imagine most people who are just taking herbal supplements won't even identify\n",
      "[03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:54.520]  it as a cause of something, you know, they'll think it could be diet, it could be genes,\n",
      "[03:38:54.520 --> 03:38:55.520]  it could be whatever.\n",
      "[03:38:55.520 --> 03:38:58.400]  They won't even consider it as the harmless looking pill that they take every morning.\n",
      "[03:38:58.400 --> 03:38:59.400]  They won't even disclose it.\n",
      "[03:38:59.400 --> 03:39:00.400]  Yeah.\n",
      "[03:39:00.400 --> 03:39:04.000]  Like if you ask them, are you taking any other medicines, they'll say no, because they think\n",
      "[03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:06.320]  these are just nutritional supplements or safe herbals.\n",
      "[03:39:06.320 --> 03:39:08.040]  They won't even consider it as medicine.\n",
      "[03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:11.080]  And the irony is one of the things that you pointed out in one of your articles or talks\n",
      "[03:39:11.080 --> 03:39:15.400]  is that, you know, that there are supplements which are sold in India as medical supplements,\n",
      "[03:39:15.400 --> 03:39:18.520]  but in Europe, they're only allowed to be sold as food supplements.\n",
      "[03:39:18.520 --> 03:39:19.520]  Yes.\n",
      "[03:39:19.520 --> 03:39:20.520]  Yes.\n",
      "[03:39:20.520 --> 03:39:24.800]  Here they can write Ayurvedic proprietary medicine on the top of it.\n",
      "[03:39:24.800 --> 03:39:30.640]  In the Europe, the same company writes food supplement, same product, because they're\n",
      "[03:39:30.640 --> 03:39:31.640]  not supposed to.\n",
      "[03:39:31.640 --> 03:39:33.360]  You cannot prescribe as a medicine there.\n",
      "[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:35.400]  That is that is the true regulatory policy.\n",
      "[03:39:35.400 --> 03:39:37.160]  Here you can just write anything and sell.\n",
      "[03:39:37.160 --> 03:39:40.520]  I mean, you can see that from what Patanjali has been doing.\n",
      "[03:39:40.520 --> 03:39:44.600]  They're bringing out advertisement after advertisement, saying that they can cure diabetes and cancer\n",
      "[03:39:44.600 --> 03:39:50.360]  and writing, you know, Diagrit and Livogrit and things like that, when none of that actually\n",
      "[03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:51.360]  works.\n",
      "[03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:52.360]  And nobody's bothered.\n",
      "[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:55.120]  No action has been taken on them till now.\n",
      "[03:39:55.120 --> 03:39:59.960]  And this is really becoming a banana republic when it comes to public health.\n",
      "[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:07.320]  Give me a sense of the ecosystem of these different alternative medicines, like we discussed\n",
      "[03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:12.400]  earlier that there is an undersupply of doctors of proper medicine in India.\n",
      "[03:40:12.400 --> 03:40:18.520]  But what is the size of the ecosystem of Ayurveda doctors and Ayurveda training institutes,\n",
      "[03:40:18.520 --> 03:40:21.760]  homeopathic doctors and homeopathic training institutes?\n",
      "[03:40:21.760 --> 03:40:23.360]  What is their training like?\n",
      "[03:40:23.360 --> 03:40:26.760]  Can any of their training possibly be useful?\n",
      "[03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:31.840]  Because if we have such a massive shortage of properly trained personnel, maybe, you\n",
      "[03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:36.200]  know, paramedics from here, or you could teach these guys nursing, or they could be useful\n",
      "[03:40:36.200 --> 03:40:38.480]  in some way, you know, what's the scene?\n",
      "[03:40:38.480 --> 03:40:40.320]  Give me a sense of that ecosystem.\n",
      "[03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:42.920]  So I mean, exact numbers, I'm not sure.\n",
      "[03:40:42.920 --> 03:40:48.800]  But I think the largest numbers of homeopathy medical colleges is in Maharashtra, homeopathy.\n",
      "[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:52.760]  And the largest number of Ayurveda colleges is in Kerala and Karnataka.\n",
      "[03:40:52.760 --> 03:40:59.200]  And a lot of these students actually opt for Ayush is because they have tried multiple\n",
      "[03:40:59.200 --> 03:41:03.720]  times to get into MBBS and they could not or their ranks are on the lower side.\n",
      "[03:41:03.720 --> 03:41:06.060]  And that is why they opt for Ayush.\n",
      "[03:41:06.060 --> 03:41:07.980]  This is because it's a single exam.\n",
      "[03:41:07.980 --> 03:41:10.080]  And all of this comes in under the single exam.\n",
      "[03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:15.080]  If you split it, like MBBS is one exam and Ayush is another exam, I'm sure nobody will\n",
      "[03:41:15.080 --> 03:41:18.320]  go there to give separate Ayush exams to get into Ayush medical colleges.\n",
      "[03:41:18.320 --> 03:41:19.320]  I see.\n",
      "[03:41:19.320 --> 03:41:20.320]  Right.\n",
      "[03:41:20.320 --> 03:41:21.320]  So it is very different.\n",
      "[03:41:21.320 --> 03:41:22.320]  So it's a single exam.\n",
      "[03:41:22.320 --> 03:41:24.600]  And based on your rank, you go for Ayush or MBBS.\n",
      "[03:41:24.600 --> 03:41:27.240]  So if you split it, a lot of things will change.\n",
      "[03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:31.600]  Another thing is that if you actually do a bachelor's in homeopathy or bachelor's in\n",
      "[03:41:31.600 --> 03:41:36.160]  Ayurveda in Kerala, you have a reservation quota for MBBS.\n",
      "[03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:39.600]  Sorry, what would you say?\n",
      "[03:41:39.600 --> 03:41:41.360]  For example, you have reservations, right?\n",
      "[03:41:41.360 --> 03:41:44.600]  You have quotas for OBCs and things like that.\n",
      "[03:41:44.600 --> 03:41:45.600]  Right.\n",
      "[03:41:45.600 --> 03:41:49.680]  So there is a reservation system for people who do alternative medicine.\n",
      "[03:41:49.680 --> 03:41:52.280]  They can get a direct entry into MBBS.\n",
      "[03:41:52.280 --> 03:41:56.120]  So you're forced to take a certain number of homeopathic students and a certain number\n",
      "[03:41:56.120 --> 03:41:59.440]  of Ayurveda students into your proper MBBS course.\n",
      "[03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:00.440]  Yeah.\n",
      "[03:42:00.440 --> 03:42:01.440]  So there is a reservation.\n",
      "[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:02.440]  Wow.\n",
      "[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:03.440]  Yeah.\n",
      "[03:42:03.440 --> 03:42:08.120]  And I think one of my I mean, the one of my main clinical research associate that I work\n",
      "[03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:11.160]  with, Dr. Arif, he was a homeopath.\n",
      "[03:42:11.160 --> 03:42:12.160]  He's an ex homeopath.\n",
      "[03:42:12.160 --> 03:42:15.920]  He studied, I mean, he practiced for almost 10 years homeopathy and left it because he\n",
      "[03:42:15.920 --> 03:42:17.320]  understood it is pseudoscience.\n",
      "[03:42:17.320 --> 03:42:20.900]  Now he's doing very good clinical research in my in my unit.\n",
      "[03:42:20.900 --> 03:42:24.720]  And he was telling me that there is a reservation system for alternative medicine.\n",
      "[03:42:24.720 --> 03:42:30.460]  So if you do a BHMS or BAMS, if you give a NEET exam next time, you'll have preference\n",
      "[03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:34.440]  over another general category student for getting into MBBS.\n",
      "[03:42:34.440 --> 03:42:37.460]  That is what makes people go for integrative medicine.\n",
      "[03:42:37.460 --> 03:42:43.380]  So you do both MBBS and BHMS or MBBS and BAMS and they practice worst of both and end up\n",
      "[03:42:43.380 --> 03:42:44.700]  doing bad for the patient.\n",
      "[03:42:44.700 --> 03:42:47.120]  So this integrative medicine thing is also coming up.\n",
      "[03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:52.280]  So we have a lot of medical colleges, I mean, catering to I mean, I won't call it the medical\n",
      "[03:42:52.280 --> 03:42:58.100]  colleges, but colleges catering to Ayurveda and homeopathy and even Siddha and naturopathy\n",
      "[03:42:58.100 --> 03:43:02.180]  also are courses that are coming up and Unani, a lot of them.\n",
      "[03:43:02.180 --> 03:43:08.160]  Now the biggest part of this is that after they complete their training, their training\n",
      "[03:43:08.160 --> 03:43:10.100]  actually involves both.\n",
      "[03:43:10.100 --> 03:43:14.520]  So if you look at the curriculum in BAMS and BHMS, there are modern medicine subjects in\n",
      "[03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:16.040]  that.\n",
      "[03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:20.320]  You cannot learn anatomy and physiology from classical Ayurvedic texts because in classical\n",
      "[03:43:20.320 --> 03:43:26.000]  Ayurveda, they say that heart is a single chamber with a lot of vessels going around\n",
      "[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:28.200]  it like tentacles and supplying every part of the body.\n",
      "[03:43:28.200 --> 03:43:31.800]  I mean, we know that William Harvey identified the real circulation and it is not like what\n",
      "[03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:32.800]  is in Ayurveda.\n",
      "[03:43:32.800 --> 03:43:33.800]  So you can't teach them that.\n",
      "[03:43:33.800 --> 03:43:39.000]  Ayurveda says, I think there are more than 360 bones in the body, according to Ayurvedic\n",
      "[03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:40.840]  this thing, which is wrong.\n",
      "[03:43:40.840 --> 03:43:46.120]  So what they do is they teach them proper physiology, anatomy and biochemistry and everything\n",
      "[03:43:46.120 --> 03:43:48.600]  and surgical methods and everything.\n",
      "[03:43:48.600 --> 03:43:52.720]  And then they ask the students to go and treat them the Ayurvedic way.\n",
      "[03:43:52.720 --> 03:43:58.160]  So when I spoke to some of these Ayurveda students who are, I won't say harassing me,\n",
      "[03:43:58.160 --> 03:44:03.320]  but responding rather rudely to me on Twitter, they are saying that you have only studied\n",
      "[03:44:03.320 --> 03:44:05.440]  allopathy, which is not right.\n",
      "[03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:07.600]  I mean, I've studied scientific medicine.\n",
      "[03:44:07.600 --> 03:44:09.440]  You have studied only scientific medicine.\n",
      "[03:44:09.440 --> 03:44:13.360]  But in Ayurvedic course, we are studying both, we are studying Ayurveda and scientific medicine.\n",
      "[03:44:13.360 --> 03:44:14.800]  So we have best of both worlds.\n",
      "[03:44:14.800 --> 03:44:18.800]  I mean, see the wrong impressions that these students have.\n",
      "[03:44:18.800 --> 03:44:21.120]  They study actual modern medicine.\n",
      "[03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:25.240]  Their question papers actually have modern medicine questions, like, for example, what\n",
      "[03:44:25.240 --> 03:44:26.240]  is migraine?\n",
      "[03:44:26.240 --> 03:44:27.240]  How do you treat migraine?\n",
      "[03:44:27.240 --> 03:44:30.080]  And the next question will be, how do you treat unmadha?\n",
      "[03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:35.480]  You know, unmadha is basically mania in Ayurveda.\n",
      "[03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:39.800]  And you should read the chapter where they say that the patient should be put in a well\n",
      "[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:44.040]  and then scared with snakes and dogs and all that and then beaten up and all that.\n",
      "[03:44:44.040 --> 03:44:46.280]  That is how it is written in Ayurveda, treatment of mania.\n",
      "[03:44:46.280 --> 03:44:48.040]  We know that is not how you treat mania.\n",
      "[03:44:48.040 --> 03:44:49.680]  So you have a mix of both.\n",
      "[03:44:49.680 --> 03:44:51.760]  So you people are so confused.\n",
      "[03:44:51.760 --> 03:44:55.720]  Students are so confused about what is right and what is wrong, because the syllabus itself\n",
      "[03:44:55.720 --> 03:44:56.720]  is completely wrong.\n",
      "[03:44:56.720 --> 03:45:02.360]  Even in homeopathy, they teach homeopathic pharmacology, which is that dilution thing,\n",
      "[03:45:02.360 --> 03:45:04.560]  but they teach proper disease conditions.\n",
      "[03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:09.360]  For example, they talk, they learn about infections when homeopathy has no germ theory, even Ayurveda\n",
      "[03:45:09.360 --> 03:45:13.840]  has no germ theory, but they talk about infections, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and then they ask\n",
      "[03:45:13.840 --> 03:45:15.520]  them to treat with this diluted stuff.\n",
      "[03:45:15.520 --> 03:45:17.920]  I mean, it's so confusing for the student.\n",
      "[03:45:17.920 --> 03:45:21.760]  So the whole course pattern itself is so wrong.\n",
      "[03:45:21.760 --> 03:45:25.040]  If they actually convert the whole thing into modern medicine pattern, I mean, I think we\n",
      "[03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:30.680]  would have more doctors to serve more patients instead of these half big practitioners that\n",
      "[03:45:30.680 --> 03:45:32.840]  come out of these courses.\n",
      "[03:45:32.840 --> 03:45:36.800]  And the whole thing about bridge courses, now that's something that the government was\n",
      "[03:45:36.800 --> 03:45:42.920]  planning to do, is that BAMS and BHMS candidates can actually do some six months course in\n",
      "[03:45:42.920 --> 03:45:48.560]  a private or a public hospital and then start practicing as a general physician or an MBBS\n",
      "[03:45:48.560 --> 03:45:54.600]  level graduate, which is actually even worse because they don't know the basics of pharmacology,\n",
      "[03:45:54.600 --> 03:46:00.120]  biochemistry, anatomy, physiology properly to apply it in a patient population.\n",
      "[03:46:00.120 --> 03:46:05.240]  So converting them directly into doctors, it's not a good thing.\n",
      "[03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:09.240]  Second aspect is like what you said, we can actually have them as paramedical.\n",
      "[03:46:09.240 --> 03:46:14.520]  For example, take them completely out of their practice and teach them a particular paraclinic\n",
      "[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:20.320]  or a paramedical or a biomedical course, and then make them go into that.\n",
      "[03:46:20.320 --> 03:46:21.800]  That's actually a brilliant thing to do.\n",
      "[03:46:21.800 --> 03:46:26.080]  A lot of these Ayurveda and homeopathy doctors also do to get out of their courses, they\n",
      "[03:46:26.080 --> 03:46:30.080]  actually do masters in hospital administration, and then they start doing entrepreneurship\n",
      "[03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:31.080]  and things like that.\n",
      "[03:46:31.080 --> 03:46:32.080]  They don't practice at all.\n",
      "[03:46:32.080 --> 03:46:36.160]  So I have an Ayurveda graduate who's working with me now in my clinical research department.\n",
      "[03:46:36.160 --> 03:46:40.840]  I have a homeopath and an Ayurveda practitioner, and she's actually fully into clinical research\n",
      "[03:46:40.840 --> 03:46:41.840]  work.\n",
      "[03:46:41.840 --> 03:46:42.840]  She stopped her practice now.\n",
      "[03:46:42.840 --> 03:46:45.880]  And now they are doing a course on bioethics and all that.\n",
      "[03:46:45.880 --> 03:46:52.320]  So they are doing additional courses and trying to get into the administrative and clinical\n",
      "[03:46:52.320 --> 03:46:55.300]  research part of real clinical medicine.\n",
      "[03:46:55.300 --> 03:47:01.440]  So that can be done, but directly making them in charge of treating actual real patient\n",
      "[03:47:01.440 --> 03:47:04.520]  force with a small bridge course, I don't think it works.\n",
      "[03:47:04.520 --> 03:47:10.480]  Because it took me 15 to 16 years to finish my medicine, and then another five years to\n",
      "[03:47:10.480 --> 03:47:12.760]  actually understand how to deal with patients.\n",
      "[03:47:12.760 --> 03:47:17.260]  So how can somebody just do a bridge course in six months and become a doctor suddenly\n",
      "[03:47:17.260 --> 03:47:19.960]  after passing homeopathy and Ayurveda?\n",
      "[03:47:19.960 --> 03:47:24.000]  So that conversion also should be practical.\n",
      "[03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:28.880]  And it has to be either clinical research based, research associate based, hospital\n",
      "[03:47:28.880 --> 03:47:32.080]  administration, paramedical, paraclinical or biomedical.\n",
      "[03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:33.080]  That actually helps.\n",
      "[03:47:33.080 --> 03:47:34.760]  Yeah, I mean, a couple of things strikes me.\n",
      "[03:47:34.760 --> 03:47:39.600]  One is that I can't imagine as a student, what kind of dissonance I would have being\n",
      "[03:47:39.600 --> 03:47:43.640]  taught a theory that is modern in terms of germ theory and all that.\n",
      "[03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:47.600]  But being taught that the way to treat it is by diluting something a million times or\n",
      "[03:47:47.600 --> 03:47:48.600]  whatever.\n",
      "[03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:50.360]  I mean, what does that dissonance do to you?\n",
      "[03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:51.360]  How can you live with that?\n",
      "[03:47:51.360 --> 03:47:56.420]  No, I think that dissonance is what makes them very aggressive towards real doctors\n",
      "[03:47:56.420 --> 03:47:57.880]  and scientists.\n",
      "[03:47:57.880 --> 03:48:01.680]  Because I mean, somebody is telling them that, you know, everything that you have studied\n",
      "[03:48:01.680 --> 03:48:03.800]  and been practicing is actually fraudulent.\n",
      "[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:06.920]  I mean, I think then that dissonance come into play.\n",
      "[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:08.520]  And that is when they get aggressive.\n",
      "[03:48:08.520 --> 03:48:12.240]  And that is what happens with when you argue with homeopaths.\n",
      "[03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:14.680]  And Ayurveda, they always find a way to do business.\n",
      "[03:48:14.680 --> 03:48:18.280]  A new thing that I have seen is that a lot of these Ayurveda graduates, what they do\n",
      "[03:48:18.280 --> 03:48:24.400]  is they have now started on full on on Instagram, Instagram has now become a cesspool of alternative\n",
      "[03:48:24.400 --> 03:48:25.400]  medicine practitioners.\n",
      "[03:48:25.400 --> 03:48:26.400]  It's a cesspool.\n",
      "[03:48:26.400 --> 03:48:30.760]  A lot of Ayurveda practitioners start giving out nutritional advice and a lot of things\n",
      "[03:48:30.760 --> 03:48:31.760]  like that.\n",
      "[03:48:31.760 --> 03:48:32.760]  And people just fall for it.\n",
      "[03:48:32.760 --> 03:48:37.160]  I mean, people love such generalized stuff, generic stuff, nutrition and how to take care\n",
      "[03:48:37.160 --> 03:48:40.080]  of your hair, how to grow your fingers longer.\n",
      "[03:48:40.080 --> 03:48:45.840]  And what they do is along with that, they'll slowly start a supplements selling industry.\n",
      "[03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:50.120]  So you'll have another page of theirs where they will be selling some supplements.\n",
      "[03:48:50.120 --> 03:48:54.360]  And this has now become the new stuff that these Ayurveda and homeopath practitioners\n",
      "[03:48:54.360 --> 03:48:55.360]  do.\n",
      "[03:48:55.360 --> 03:48:56.720]  Homeopaths do something additional.\n",
      "[03:48:56.720 --> 03:49:00.520]  So they'll have their clinic and attached to the clinic, they will have a medical shop,\n",
      "[03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:03.000]  a pharmacy shop.\n",
      "[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:08.600]  You just need a single license, medical license, I mean, pharmaceutical license to sell both\n",
      "[03:49:08.600 --> 03:49:11.280]  types of drugs as per the current rule.\n",
      "[03:49:11.280 --> 03:49:14.740]  So they'll have modern medicines and also homeopathic medicines in that.\n",
      "[03:49:14.740 --> 03:49:17.160]  And what is going to be selling is all modern medicines.\n",
      "[03:49:17.160 --> 03:49:21.000]  So they'll be sitting in their homeopathic clinic and prescribing modern medicines, which\n",
      "[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:22.480]  the patients will be taking.\n",
      "[03:49:22.480 --> 03:49:24.760]  So this is another trend that is coming up.\n",
      "[03:49:24.760 --> 03:49:27.160]  I mean, it's nothing they have studied at all.\n",
      "[03:49:27.160 --> 03:49:29.440]  It's just messed up, completely messed up.\n",
      "[03:49:29.440 --> 03:49:32.980]  And social media is just adding fuel to the fire.\n",
      "[03:49:32.980 --> 03:49:37.120]  One example of what they offer to do, which you just gave us how to make your fingers\n",
      "[03:49:37.120 --> 03:49:38.120]  longer.\n",
      "[03:49:38.120 --> 03:49:39.120]  What's that?\n",
      "[03:49:39.120 --> 03:49:40.120]  I'm just giving an example.\n",
      "[03:49:40.120 --> 03:49:42.760]  I thought it was actually something like that.\n",
      "[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:48.760]  No, there are homeopaths doing videos saying, are you suffering from excessive flatulence?\n",
      "[03:49:48.760 --> 03:49:52.280]  Then I'll then they'll tell us how to reduce flatulence.\n",
      "[03:49:52.280 --> 03:49:56.640]  I mean, some nonsense stuff, how to drink tea the right way.\n",
      "[03:49:56.640 --> 03:49:57.640]  Wow.\n",
      "[03:49:57.640 --> 03:50:00.440]  I mean, there is a guy in Kerala, a homeopath.\n",
      "[03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:04.600]  He does not disclose himself as a homeopath, because if he does that, then his viewership\n",
      "[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:05.600]  will fall.\n",
      "[03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:11.080]  So he calls himself as Dr. Rajesh Kumar, and he has a huge YouTube channel, more than a\n",
      "[03:50:11.080 --> 03:50:12.640]  million followers.\n",
      "[03:50:12.640 --> 03:50:17.860]  And he does this stuff, how to drink your tea properly, how to drink your coffee properly,\n",
      "[03:50:17.860 --> 03:50:23.460]  how to sit properly, how to stand properly, how to drink water properly, stuff like that.\n",
      "[03:50:23.460 --> 03:50:28.240]  And on the side, he'll be slowly in between, he'll be selling his homeopathy stuff.\n",
      "[03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:30.720]  We do apologies to my listeners.\n",
      "[03:50:30.720 --> 03:50:33.800]  This is one thing I won't be linking to in the show notes, because out of principle,\n",
      "[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:37.960]  I'm simply not going to link to any quacks.\n",
      "[03:50:37.960 --> 03:50:43.520]  What you said earlier about the process of these kids getting into the Ayurveda colleges\n",
      "[03:50:43.520 --> 03:50:45.360]  or the homeopathy colleges really interests me.\n",
      "[03:50:45.360 --> 03:50:50.960]  You said they give a single MBBS exam, and because they can't get into a proper medical\n",
      "[03:50:50.960 --> 03:50:53.560]  college, they end up going for these.\n",
      "[03:50:53.560 --> 03:50:59.320]  And therefore, it strikes me that then the fundamental core problem here is an undersupply\n",
      "[03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:01.360]  of medical education.\n",
      "[03:51:01.360 --> 03:51:05.740]  Because what I would rather have is many more medical colleges, fine, maybe these people\n",
      "[03:51:05.740 --> 03:51:09.760]  came at the bottom of the exam, and you feel they aren't smart or whatever, which is not\n",
      "[03:51:09.760 --> 03:51:13.600]  always the case, because even passing an exam is a particular skill.\n",
      "[03:51:13.600 --> 03:51:17.000]  Often you have the privilege to learn how to pass an exam, which many don't.\n",
      "[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:18.000]  But the point is,\n",
      "[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:22.280]  I am a living example, I was never a brilliant student in my entrance exams.\n",
      "[03:51:22.280 --> 03:51:27.280]  I mean, I just I just got through I got through in second attempt, third attempt and all that.\n",
      "[03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:29.440]  I mean, ranks don't matter at all.\n",
      "[03:51:29.440 --> 03:51:31.440]  Everybody's a brilliant student given the opportunity.\n",
      "[03:51:31.440 --> 03:51:32.440]  Yeah.\n",
      "[03:51:32.440 --> 03:51:36.280]  And in the end, you got so many awards, like from one of your bios, I'm just going to read\n",
      "[03:51:36.280 --> 03:51:37.840]  this bit out since you mentioned it.\n",
      "[03:51:37.840 --> 03:51:41.040]  I know you're modest, and you won't want me to do this, but I'll read it out anyway, because\n",
      "[03:51:41.040 --> 03:51:42.280]  I was so impressed.\n",
      "[03:51:42.280 --> 03:51:46.560]  Quote, he was awarded the gold medal for academic excellence in hepatology by the Honorable\n",
      "[03:51:46.560 --> 03:51:51.880]  President of India Shri Pranab Mukherjee during the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences\n",
      "[03:51:51.880 --> 03:51:56.480]  Convocation and Foundation Day Ceremony held 14th of January, blah, blah, date, date, and\n",
      "[03:51:56.480 --> 03:52:01.560]  has won the prestigious American Association for Study of Liver Disease consecutively in\n",
      "[03:52:01.560 --> 03:52:07.280]  the year 2015, 2016 and 2017, and was given honorary trainee membership to the American\n",
      "[03:52:07.280 --> 03:52:10.040]  Association for blah, blah, it goes on and on.\n",
      "[03:52:10.040 --> 03:52:13.840]  So that also impressed me that you mentioned about how you had trouble getting into all\n",
      "[03:52:13.840 --> 03:52:14.840]  of these.\n",
      "[03:52:14.840 --> 03:52:15.920]  But then you're excelling.\n",
      "[03:52:15.920 --> 03:52:21.200]  Then you're doing 165 papers, you know, which means you can give anybody a chance.\n",
      "[03:52:21.200 --> 03:52:27.520]  And 100% I mean, I see on Twitter, I mean, MBBS students and talking about how they did\n",
      "[03:52:27.520 --> 03:52:31.400]  not get through NEET, they have a very low score, and they feel depressed.\n",
      "[03:52:31.400 --> 03:52:32.600]  I said, absolutely not.\n",
      "[03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:37.320]  I mean, if you want to bag a postgraduate seat, get in any college that you want, because\n",
      "[03:52:37.320 --> 03:52:40.640]  ultimately depends on how you carry yourself forward.\n",
      "[03:52:40.640 --> 03:52:43.280]  You know, if you are interested in something, you have passion for something, your ranks\n",
      "[03:52:43.280 --> 03:52:46.640]  don't matter at all, you can excel and every student is a brilliant student, there is no\n",
      "[03:52:46.640 --> 03:52:49.840]  poor student, bad student, I hate such terms.\n",
      "[03:52:49.840 --> 03:52:55.160]  Every student is brilliant, given the right opportunity, or given them or if they have\n",
      "[03:52:55.160 --> 03:52:58.240]  that knack of taking opportunities.\n",
      "[03:52:58.240 --> 03:53:02.880]  And is this an artificial scarcity in the sense of scarcity of medical colleges or medical\n",
      "[03:53:02.880 --> 03:53:03.880]  training?\n",
      "[03:53:03.880 --> 03:53:04.880]  I really think so.\n",
      "[03:53:04.880 --> 03:53:10.320]  I mean, we have a lot of MBBS seats, probably, but we don't have much of specialty and superficiality\n",
      "[03:53:10.320 --> 03:53:11.320]  training seats.\n",
      "[03:53:11.320 --> 03:53:12.320]  It's very, very less.\n",
      "[03:53:12.320 --> 03:53:14.440]  So there is a lot of stagnation.\n",
      "[03:53:14.440 --> 03:53:19.720]  And because of the stagnation, a lot of postgraduate seats, I mean, we are not getting enough postgraduates\n",
      "[03:53:19.720 --> 03:53:20.720]  coming out properly.\n",
      "[03:53:20.720 --> 03:53:25.720]  And then there is a lot of brain drain, a lot of MBBS people going out, more and more\n",
      "[03:53:25.720 --> 03:53:31.080]  students are again coming into the competitive exams every year.\n",
      "[03:53:31.080 --> 03:53:38.000]  And that is where a lot of them get fizzled out and they go into these Ayush related streams.\n",
      "[03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:44.160]  Another aspect is that not just the lack of infrastructure and seats or a lack of medical\n",
      "[03:53:44.160 --> 03:53:50.720]  seats, there are some students who really want to do Ayurveda or homeopathy, and that\n",
      "[03:53:50.720 --> 03:53:52.360]  is because of legacy.\n",
      "[03:53:52.360 --> 03:53:57.520]  So there are these big Ayurveda based families in Kerala and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and\n",
      "[03:53:57.520 --> 03:53:58.520]  all.\n",
      "[03:53:58.520 --> 03:53:59.520]  They have a legacy.\n",
      "[03:53:59.520 --> 03:54:02.960]  They are like 6th and 7th generation of Ayurveda practitioner, they'll have a business to run\n",
      "[03:54:02.960 --> 03:54:04.160]  and all that.\n",
      "[03:54:04.160 --> 03:54:08.320]  So based on that, some of them actually opt for Ayurveda and homeopathy to run their business.\n",
      "[03:54:08.320 --> 03:54:14.320]  Otherwise, I don't think any sane minded student will actually want to do Ayush related, make\n",
      "[03:54:14.320 --> 03:54:16.600]  Ayush as one of the career options for themselves.\n",
      "[03:54:16.600 --> 03:54:17.760]  I don't think so.\n",
      "[03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:22.600]  So this is one possible bottleneck that there isn't enough supply of doctors because there\n",
      "[03:54:22.600 --> 03:54:23.840]  aren't enough medical colleges.\n",
      "[03:54:23.840 --> 03:54:27.000]  If there were like double the number of medical colleges, you'd have double the number of\n",
      "[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:28.000]  medical students.\n",
      "[03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:33.040]  And you know, I mean, in an ideal world, you would train everyone who wanted to be trained\n",
      "[03:54:33.040 --> 03:54:35.280]  in medicine, you train them in medicine.\n",
      "[03:54:35.280 --> 03:54:36.840]  But it is what it is.\n",
      "[03:54:36.840 --> 03:54:44.640]  Is it is another reason for why alternative for why Quackery continues to thrive is another\n",
      "[03:54:44.640 --> 03:54:48.960]  reason that per capita, there simply aren't enough trained doctors.\n",
      "[03:54:48.960 --> 03:54:52.080]  So if you're living in a rural area, you're living in a village, there's no doctor in\n",
      "[03:54:52.080 --> 03:54:53.640]  your village, what do you do?\n",
      "[03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:55.200]  You got to go to someone.\n",
      "[03:54:55.200 --> 03:54:57.440]  So is that also a reason?\n",
      "[03:54:57.440 --> 03:55:02.480]  Because working in a peripheral set up in a rural area, I mean, doctors don't want to\n",
      "[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:07.840]  do that now in India, because I mean, it's it's it's quite poor, I think, except maybe\n",
      "[03:55:07.840 --> 03:55:14.440]  a few states or maybe a few regions in some states, the rural practice is not a dream\n",
      "[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:16.240]  practice for a lot of doctors.\n",
      "[03:55:16.240 --> 03:55:21.120]  Because the one is they struggle to get into MBBS, two is they struggle to get out of MBBS.\n",
      "[03:55:21.120 --> 03:55:24.320]  Three is they struggle to get into post graduation.\n",
      "[03:55:24.320 --> 03:55:27.880]  And if you want them to go work in a rural set up for peanuts, nobody's going to do it\n",
      "[03:55:27.880 --> 03:55:29.240]  with basic setup.\n",
      "[03:55:29.240 --> 03:55:32.920]  They actually want to work to the best extent for the patient.\n",
      "[03:55:32.920 --> 03:55:38.480]  For example, if I go sit in a rural primary health care center, what am I going to do?\n",
      "[03:55:38.480 --> 03:55:43.920]  Because I am trained to manage patients who have undergone post who have undergone transplants.\n",
      "[03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:47.800]  I mean, I'm trained to manage patients who are critically ill in the ICU, critically\n",
      "[03:55:47.800 --> 03:55:49.680]  ill cirrhosis management also I've been trained.\n",
      "[03:55:49.680 --> 03:55:55.160]  If I go sit in a PHC, fever patients will come, arthritis patients will come, or if\n",
      "[03:55:55.160 --> 03:55:58.480]  a liver patient actually comes, I won't be able to do anything much for them.\n",
      "[03:55:58.480 --> 03:55:59.920]  I'll have to refer them to some other place.\n",
      "[03:55:59.920 --> 03:56:04.000]  So the kind of work that I'm trained in and the kind of work output that I'm going to\n",
      "[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:07.160]  do in a rural setup is completely mismatched.\n",
      "[03:56:07.160 --> 03:56:12.480]  Otherwise, government should make sure that post MBBS or family medicine doctors are there\n",
      "[03:56:12.480 --> 03:56:16.680]  MD, family medicine, which are very good, very good category of doctors that we can\n",
      "[03:56:16.680 --> 03:56:21.240]  actually promote to take care of the rural and suburban area as well.\n",
      "[03:56:21.240 --> 03:56:25.320]  They should actually improve conditions and infrastructure for them to actually work and\n",
      "[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:27.480]  improve patient care in these areas.\n",
      "[03:56:27.480 --> 03:56:30.280]  So it's not like a super specialist has to go and work there.\n",
      "[03:56:30.280 --> 03:56:34.240]  You can actually have these group of doctors who are trained to work in such situations\n",
      "[03:56:34.240 --> 03:56:35.240]  go and work there.\n",
      "[03:56:35.240 --> 03:56:36.860]  But even that is not happening here.\n",
      "[03:56:36.860 --> 03:56:41.260]  That is why patients in those areas, they mostly go and get, you know, treatments from\n",
      "[03:56:41.260 --> 03:56:43.000]  alternative medicine practitioners.\n",
      "[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:45.880]  And the best part is most of the alternative medicine practitioners who go work there,\n",
      "[03:56:45.880 --> 03:56:50.400]  they prescribe modern medicines, you know, they don't, they don't prescribe their kind\n",
      "[03:56:50.400 --> 03:56:51.600]  of practice there.\n",
      "[03:56:51.600 --> 03:56:55.600]  And that actually harms the patient more, you know, they just maybe prescribe antibiotics\n",
      "[03:56:55.600 --> 03:57:00.040]  for a viral infection, which then antibiotics should be used for a bacterial infection.\n",
      "[03:57:00.040 --> 03:57:05.680]  And they prescribe unnecessary painkillers and the patients land up in more trouble.\n",
      "[03:57:05.680 --> 03:57:10.040]  So you know, you spoke earlier about, you know, a member of your team who was who felt\n",
      "[03:57:10.040 --> 03:57:15.400]  so harassed that he relocated to the UAE, you know, we've chatted about you've chatted\n",
      "[03:57:15.400 --> 03:57:20.120]  about all the different cases filed against you both by the Ministry of Ayush and by so\n",
      "[03:57:20.120 --> 03:57:24.240]  and so private companies, how you were almost physically attacked all of that.\n",
      "[03:57:24.240 --> 03:57:29.080]  Equally, even I remember when I wrote my piece, in fact, a lot of the online trolling for\n",
      "[03:57:29.080 --> 03:57:32.800]  that quite apart from the Ministry of Ayush complaint was actually not from Ayurveda people,\n",
      "[03:57:32.800 --> 03:57:37.960]  it was all from homeopaths and very vociferous, very abusive, it was just horrible.\n",
      "[03:57:37.960 --> 03:57:41.840]  And although I've gotten mobbed often by all kinds of people, and they're all horrible.\n",
      "[03:57:41.840 --> 03:57:49.680]  So my question is this, that what is the environment for the scientific temperament in India?\n",
      "[03:57:49.680 --> 03:57:54.080]  Because when we look back to our past as an independent nation, you know, I often keep\n",
      "[03:57:54.080 --> 03:57:58.920]  talking about how you had a bunch of elites who were ruling the country who tried to rule\n",
      "[03:57:58.920 --> 03:58:00.080]  it in a top down way.\n",
      "[03:58:00.080 --> 03:58:04.160]  And they thought they can spread their values in a top down way, the liberal, liberal tolerant\n",
      "[03:58:04.160 --> 03:58:06.280]  values and they couldn't quite manage.\n",
      "[03:58:06.280 --> 03:58:10.360]  And we are seeing that today that in a sense, politics has caught up with society.\n",
      "[03:58:10.360 --> 03:58:15.520]  And equally, I worry that we talk of scientific temperament, we talk of setting up IITs and\n",
      "[03:58:15.520 --> 03:58:18.800]  all of that, which are great achievements in their domains.\n",
      "[03:58:18.800 --> 03:58:22.680]  But the scientific temperament is not something widespread at all.\n",
      "[03:58:22.680 --> 03:58:24.360]  And I am not optimistic.\n",
      "[03:58:24.360 --> 03:58:28.520]  When I look around me, when I look at the kind of harassment that you have to deal with,\n",
      "[03:58:28.520 --> 03:58:32.880]  when I look at when you tell me the story of your team member having to relocate to\n",
      "[03:58:32.880 --> 03:58:38.840]  leave the country, because of harassment, it doesn't make me very optimistic.\n",
      "[03:58:38.840 --> 03:58:42.520]  So give me a sense of, you know, what is the environment?\n",
      "[03:58:42.520 --> 03:58:43.520]  What gives you hope?\n",
      "[03:58:43.520 --> 03:58:46.640]  Do you think that there is progress happening?\n",
      "[03:58:46.640 --> 03:58:50.040]  You know, do you think you know, where do you see that progress coming from?\n",
      "[03:58:50.040 --> 03:58:54.320]  You know, is there light at the end of a tunnel or is it the torch of a serial killer?\n",
      "[03:58:54.320 --> 03:58:55.720]  What's, what's?\n",
      "[03:58:55.720 --> 03:58:59.560]  So you add on to that part where my colleague actually left the country.\n",
      "[03:58:59.560 --> 03:59:03.480]  So I have another pathologist, senior pathologist working for me now.\n",
      "[03:59:03.480 --> 03:59:08.120]  But if you look at my papers published recently on Ayurveda and homeopathy and all, you won't\n",
      "[03:59:08.120 --> 03:59:10.440]  see a pathologist name in that.\n",
      "[03:59:10.440 --> 03:59:14.280]  Because that senior pathologist has specifically asked me not to put her name.\n",
      "[03:59:14.280 --> 03:59:17.740]  Because she does not want the harassment to happen to her.\n",
      "[03:59:17.740 --> 03:59:19.040]  So that part is also there.\n",
      "[03:59:19.040 --> 03:59:22.920]  So if you see the last three or four papers we published in Ayurveda and homeopathy, there\n",
      "[03:59:22.920 --> 03:59:24.480]  is no pathologist name in that.\n",
      "[03:59:24.480 --> 03:59:26.080]  It's quite sad.\n",
      "[03:59:26.080 --> 03:59:28.160]  So that that was an extra point.\n",
      "[03:59:28.160 --> 03:59:35.760]  So coming to this aspect of scientific temperament, you know, I don't think I mean, we should\n",
      "[03:59:35.760 --> 03:59:41.320]  just talk about or blame the common person or the layperson about lack of scientific\n",
      "[03:59:41.320 --> 03:59:42.880]  temperament.\n",
      "[03:59:42.880 --> 03:59:49.160]  This is deeply, deeply ingrained, even in the doctor community, the lack of scientific\n",
      "[03:59:49.160 --> 03:59:50.160]  temperament.\n",
      "[03:59:50.160 --> 03:59:57.040]  For example, when I spoke about when I speak about turmeric, or Ayurvedic product or homeopathy\n",
      "[03:59:57.040 --> 04:00:04.080]  product being not useful, apart from the common people who actually come with defenses or\n",
      "[04:00:04.080 --> 04:00:08.240]  harassment towards me, I was shocked to see I mean, first time I'm seeing that shocked\n",
      "[04:00:08.240 --> 04:00:15.240]  to see oncologist, cardiologist, cellular biologists and all attacking me on my statements.\n",
      "[04:00:15.240 --> 04:00:18.600]  So I was wondering what is wrong with them, because I'm talking about an alternative medicine\n",
      "[04:00:18.600 --> 04:00:20.040]  practice.\n",
      "[04:00:20.040 --> 04:00:24.800]  And these guys are all properly trained scientists or clinical clinicians, and they still have\n",
      "[04:00:24.800 --> 04:00:25.800]  a problem with it.\n",
      "[04:00:25.800 --> 04:00:27.960]  And you're giving links to the research and everything.\n",
      "[04:00:27.960 --> 04:00:29.600]  Absolutely complete evidence based.\n",
      "[04:00:29.600 --> 04:00:32.920]  I mean, I'm quoting published data also.\n",
      "[04:00:32.920 --> 04:00:34.760]  But they're just so aggressive.\n",
      "[04:00:34.760 --> 04:00:36.960]  And some of them actually talk about testimonials.\n",
      "[04:00:36.960 --> 04:00:41.360]  There is this one one guy who is a cancer surgeon, who's telling that, you know, he\n",
      "[04:00:41.360 --> 04:00:44.040]  used homeopathy in Ayurveda and his some skin disease went away.\n",
      "[04:00:44.040 --> 04:00:46.240]  I mean, he's a cancer surgeon for God's sake.\n",
      "[04:00:46.240 --> 04:00:50.680]  I mean, that's like one of the highest levels of medical medical science that you can do.\n",
      "[04:00:50.680 --> 04:00:56.160]  And these are the people who are, you know, defending an alternative medicine industry.\n",
      "[04:00:56.160 --> 04:00:59.880]  So I think the scientific temperament does not mean that you know, you're just trained\n",
      "[04:00:59.880 --> 04:01:03.960]  in science or you're educated and you have an MD degree or an MS degree or a DM degree,\n",
      "[04:01:03.960 --> 04:01:11.280]  it means that you are able to think rationally and logically, without any obstacles from\n",
      "[04:01:11.280 --> 04:01:14.400]  your traditional religious or cultural values.\n",
      "[04:01:14.400 --> 04:01:18.760]  You know, you need to you need to have that power to separate both.\n",
      "[04:01:18.760 --> 04:01:23.200]  Like I never talk about religion or I never quote religion or cultural matters or anything.\n",
      "[04:01:23.200 --> 04:01:24.640]  I never even discuss that stuff.\n",
      "[04:01:24.640 --> 04:01:26.560]  And I talk about health care.\n",
      "[04:01:26.560 --> 04:01:29.440]  I know how to differentiate both and I keep it separately.\n",
      "[04:01:29.440 --> 04:01:30.440]  It's different.\n",
      "[04:01:30.440 --> 04:01:34.640]  So I don't want to impose anything on anybody from those those aspects.\n",
      "[04:01:34.640 --> 04:01:40.520]  But these doctors, when they they are actual doctors, they're not even doctors.\n",
      "[04:01:40.520 --> 04:01:45.440]  These doctors, when they actually come to defend Ayurveda or homeopathy, they quote\n",
      "[04:01:45.440 --> 04:01:50.040]  traditional cultural and religious stuff, not scientific stuff, just like a layperson\n",
      "[04:01:50.040 --> 04:01:51.040]  talking.\n",
      "[04:01:51.040 --> 04:01:56.160]  And this is what is important, because even though they are trained in medical science,\n",
      "[04:01:56.160 --> 04:02:02.040]  they have a lack of their incompetent in in the distinguishing between what scientific\n",
      "[04:02:02.040 --> 04:02:08.920]  evidence is and what unscientific aspects of whatever we are talking about is.\n",
      "[04:02:08.920 --> 04:02:12.960]  And a lot of them don't even realize the real principles of homeopathy or real principles\n",
      "[04:02:12.960 --> 04:02:13.960]  of Ayurveda.\n",
      "[04:02:13.960 --> 04:02:14.960]  That's where they come to defense.\n",
      "[04:02:14.960 --> 04:02:15.960]  They have not read about Ayurveda or homeopathy.\n",
      "[04:02:15.960 --> 04:02:18.840]  I have read all the textbooks in Ayurveda or homeopathy.\n",
      "[04:02:18.840 --> 04:02:20.820]  I have two sections in my room.\n",
      "[04:02:20.820 --> 04:02:22.320]  One is full of graphic novels.\n",
      "[04:02:22.320 --> 04:02:26.440]  The other section is full of pseudoscience literature, top to bottom.\n",
      "[04:02:26.440 --> 04:02:27.640]  And I have read everything.\n",
      "[04:02:27.640 --> 04:02:28.640]  And it's all fiction.\n",
      "[04:02:28.640 --> 04:02:29.640]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:02:29.640 --> 04:02:30.640]  It's better than fiction.\n",
      "[04:02:30.640 --> 04:02:33.680]  I mean, that's the actual graphic novel section.\n",
      "[04:02:33.680 --> 04:02:34.680]  Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "[04:02:34.680 --> 04:02:35.680]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:02:35.680 --> 04:02:38.800]  And if they actually made some effort, they would definitely understand.\n",
      "[04:02:38.800 --> 04:02:39.800]  But they won't.\n",
      "[04:02:39.800 --> 04:02:43.320]  I mean, like I said, there are a lot of there are multiple levels of obstacles in their\n",
      "[04:02:43.320 --> 04:02:44.640]  thinking.\n",
      "[04:02:44.640 --> 04:02:49.440]  And scientific temperament is something that I think that should be taught from the school\n",
      "[04:02:49.440 --> 04:02:50.680]  level.\n",
      "[04:02:50.680 --> 04:02:56.320]  And also, once you enter the college also, I mean, for example, now everything is going\n",
      "[04:02:56.320 --> 04:02:57.320]  upside down.\n",
      "[04:02:57.320 --> 04:03:00.360]  For example, like you asked me, is there any hope?\n",
      "[04:03:00.360 --> 04:03:05.400]  If you ask me today, I would say things are really bad because what they're doing is they\n",
      "[04:03:05.400 --> 04:03:10.480]  are now mixing Ayush related stuff into MBBS curriculum.\n",
      "[04:03:10.480 --> 04:03:14.560]  Just yesterday, an MBBS student forwarded me a question paper which was asked during\n",
      "[04:03:14.560 --> 04:03:16.760]  their first terminal exam.\n",
      "[04:03:16.760 --> 04:03:23.720]  And it had a question saying that provide the physiology aspects of yoga in cardiac\n",
      "[04:03:23.720 --> 04:03:27.240]  and cardiac physiology and something, something.\n",
      "[04:03:27.240 --> 04:03:28.520]  I mean, come on.\n",
      "[04:03:28.520 --> 04:03:32.680]  That's not a question that you should be asking an MBBS student when yoga aspects of cardiac\n",
      "[04:03:32.680 --> 04:03:34.280]  physiology and all.\n",
      "[04:03:34.280 --> 04:03:38.920]  If yoga is something that is very close to Indians, just like turmeric.\n",
      "[04:03:38.920 --> 04:03:42.240]  And when I say that yoga is a pseudoscience, most of the people don't agree with me because\n",
      "[04:03:42.240 --> 04:03:44.960]  they don't know what yoga principles actually are.\n",
      "[04:03:44.960 --> 04:03:47.400]  Yoga principles are actually pseudoscientific principles.\n",
      "[04:03:47.400 --> 04:03:50.840]  The bindu and the chakras, everything are imaginary stuff.\n",
      "[04:03:50.840 --> 04:03:56.320]  And when such questions are being included in a proper question paper, students will\n",
      "[04:03:56.320 --> 04:04:01.000]  realize that, I mean, students will erroneously realize that, you know, okay, these are also\n",
      "[04:04:01.000 --> 04:04:02.800]  maybe important stuff.\n",
      "[04:04:02.800 --> 04:04:08.600]  And they actually will have, you know, I won't say best of both worlds, but they'll learn\n",
      "[04:04:08.600 --> 04:04:12.280]  about Ayush and they'll learn about modern medicine also.\n",
      "[04:04:12.280 --> 04:04:15.920]  And same thing is happening to Ayush candidates now.\n",
      "[04:04:15.920 --> 04:04:19.480]  They are learning modern medicine and their textbooks in detail.\n",
      "[04:04:19.480 --> 04:04:25.160]  But that's that slight percolation of pseudoscientific teaching is now slowly coming into our proper\n",
      "[04:04:25.160 --> 04:04:28.200]  mainstream literature, mainstream teaching also.\n",
      "[04:04:28.200 --> 04:04:33.820]  This is not a good sign at all, because I have no idea where this is going to end.\n",
      "[04:04:33.820 --> 04:04:38.760]  Because you are going to have a lot of half-baked bitter students coming out of these colleges.\n",
      "[04:04:38.760 --> 04:04:42.600]  And when you talk to them about Ayurveda or homeopathy or yoga, they will exactly behave\n",
      "[04:04:42.600 --> 04:04:44.600]  like the homeopaths are behaving now.\n",
      "[04:04:44.600 --> 04:04:48.480]  And they're supposed to be the real doctors who only take care of our public health.\n",
      "[04:04:48.480 --> 04:04:55.840]  So if I stand from today's point of view, I think the future of India needs to change\n",
      "[04:04:55.840 --> 04:05:00.040]  rapidly and somebody has to bring that change in somehow.\n",
      "[04:05:00.040 --> 04:05:01.980]  It's not good looking.\n",
      "[04:05:01.980 --> 04:05:03.060]  Just enlighten me on this.\n",
      "[04:05:03.060 --> 04:05:08.680]  So are you saying that MBBS syllabi is now being changed to bring in these aspects under\n",
      "[04:05:08.680 --> 04:05:10.040]  pressure from the Ayush ministry?\n",
      "[04:05:10.040 --> 04:05:11.040]  Yes.\n",
      "[04:05:11.040 --> 04:05:13.120]  I mean, they already have internship in Ayush now.\n",
      "[04:05:13.120 --> 04:05:14.120]  Okay.\n",
      "[04:05:14.120 --> 04:05:18.160]  Like when I did internship, I had an option of radiology, forensic medicine, community\n",
      "[04:05:18.160 --> 04:05:19.640]  medicine and things like that.\n",
      "[04:05:19.640 --> 04:05:24.480]  Now they have an option of Ayurveda, yoga, unani siddha, homeopathy.\n",
      "[04:05:24.480 --> 04:05:27.280]  Homeopathy is an option for them to spend a week.\n",
      "[04:05:27.280 --> 04:05:31.440]  I mean, spending one second in homeopathy is a waste of time.\n",
      "[04:05:31.440 --> 04:05:32.560]  It's worse than a waste of time.\n",
      "[04:05:32.560 --> 04:05:33.560]  It could set you backwards.\n",
      "[04:05:33.560 --> 04:05:34.880]  It could confuse you.\n",
      "[04:05:34.880 --> 04:05:35.880]  Exactly.\n",
      "[04:05:35.880 --> 04:05:37.720]  And they have a whole week of posting there.\n",
      "[04:05:37.720 --> 04:05:41.680]  And now slowly and steadily, their papers are also getting, question papers are also\n",
      "[04:05:41.680 --> 04:05:45.760]  getting included with Ayush related practices.\n",
      "[04:05:45.760 --> 04:05:47.920]  And this is absolute nonsense.\n",
      "[04:05:47.920 --> 04:05:51.240]  And this is not the way you teach medicine to students.\n",
      "[04:05:51.240 --> 04:05:54.520]  So about 20 minutes ago, I was beginning to feel a little optimistic because I thought\n",
      "[04:05:54.520 --> 04:05:58.680]  part of the problem is solving the question of access that there are students who want\n",
      "[04:05:58.680 --> 04:06:03.460]  medical education, you give them more medical colleges and less of them will go for these.\n",
      "[04:06:03.460 --> 04:06:08.200]  And equally, there are patients who have they had access to proper doctors would not go\n",
      "[04:06:08.200 --> 04:06:09.880]  for this quackery.\n",
      "[04:06:09.880 --> 04:06:15.520]  But what you're pointing to now is that the problem is more deep rooted than that.\n",
      "[04:06:15.520 --> 04:06:19.520]  Even people who have studied the science, even people who, you know, cancer oncologists\n",
      "[04:06:19.520 --> 04:06:25.020]  will also, you know, find something in this, which is, which is kind of scary.\n",
      "[04:06:25.020 --> 04:06:33.500]  So what, you know, in your small way, you fight every single day against this kind of\n",
      "[04:06:33.500 --> 04:06:37.960]  misinformation and against this kind of bad science, as it were, and you're carrying on\n",
      "[04:06:37.960 --> 04:06:38.960]  the good fight.\n",
      "[04:06:38.960 --> 04:06:43.100]  But in general, how do you feel civil society can counter this?\n",
      "[04:06:43.100 --> 04:06:46.960]  Because a counter is not going to come from a ministry, the counter is not really going\n",
      "[04:06:46.960 --> 04:06:51.440]  to come from even our medical colleges, if our, you know, MBBS syllabi is dictated in\n",
      "[04:06:51.440 --> 04:06:52.440]  this way.\n",
      "[04:06:52.440 --> 04:06:56.400]  The counter may not even come from the scientific community per se, if many of them will believe\n",
      "[04:06:56.400 --> 04:06:57.400]  this.\n",
      "[04:06:57.400 --> 04:07:01.720]  But if determined people within civil society say that, look, we got to solve this problem,\n",
      "[04:07:01.720 --> 04:07:06.240]  we got to do something about it, you know, what are the possible ways in which we can\n",
      "[04:07:06.240 --> 04:07:10.940]  So one thing that I have noted is that when I started this, started talking about science\n",
      "[04:07:10.940 --> 04:07:16.560]  and pseudoscience about maybe three years back, I used to always get I mean, the majority\n",
      "[04:07:16.560 --> 04:07:21.440]  of the responses that used to get were either abuses, harassment or troll.\n",
      "[04:07:21.440 --> 04:07:26.720]  I never used to have any positive stuff regarding what I was tweeting at the time.\n",
      "[04:07:26.720 --> 04:07:31.680]  But now when I look at, if you look at the tweets and the responses, you'll see that\n",
      "[04:07:31.680 --> 04:07:38.000]  a lot of common people, a lot of, you know, engineers and computer engineers, and you\n",
      "[04:07:38.000 --> 04:07:43.760]  know, lawyers and police officers, I mean, people who are have no idea about the medical\n",
      "[04:07:43.760 --> 04:07:48.160]  field completely non medicos, they come in support of scientific medicine, they come\n",
      "[04:07:48.160 --> 04:07:51.620]  in support of my statements, and this is something brilliant that I've seen.\n",
      "[04:07:51.620 --> 04:07:58.440]  So the whole aspect is to change the mindset of the general people that actually will change\n",
      "[04:07:58.440 --> 04:08:01.040]  the choices that they will they will make for their children.\n",
      "[04:08:01.040 --> 04:08:06.480]  So for example, if maybe about five, six years back, if somebody says that, you know, I did\n",
      "[04:08:06.480 --> 04:08:10.480]  not get into MBBS, what should I do, daddy and mommy, what should I do?\n",
      "[04:08:10.480 --> 04:08:12.000]  They'll, shall I take homeopathy or Ayurveda?\n",
      "[04:08:12.000 --> 04:08:14.720]  They'll say, yeah, take it because you'll become a doctor anyway.\n",
      "[04:08:14.720 --> 04:08:15.720]  So you take it.\n",
      "[04:08:15.720 --> 04:08:19.720]  So that is, that was the thought process at that time, but now, if we keep on talking\n",
      "[04:08:19.720 --> 04:08:24.100]  about science and pseudoscience, and how only scientific medicine and a science based approach\n",
      "[04:08:24.100 --> 04:08:28.720]  can improve a community and a nation, and people actually imbibe that, if that question\n",
      "[04:08:28.720 --> 04:08:35.280]  comes again, so one of these kids of one of these people who are now scientifically enlightened,\n",
      "[04:08:35.280 --> 04:08:40.040]  if they ask, shall I take homeopathy, they'll say no, don't take homeopathy, go for veterinary\n",
      "[04:08:40.040 --> 04:08:44.080]  medicine, or go for biomedical science, go for physics or biochemistry, either those\n",
      "[04:08:44.080 --> 04:08:48.640]  are scientific streams, you don't have to become a doctor to contribute scientifically\n",
      "[04:08:48.640 --> 04:08:51.200]  to the community, there are so many other options.\n",
      "[04:08:51.200 --> 04:08:53.360]  So they will start looking for those options.\n",
      "[04:08:53.360 --> 04:08:59.200]  And that way, when the demand comes down, I think slowly and steadily, our community\n",
      "[04:08:59.200 --> 04:09:02.780]  will become better from a scientific temperament point of view.\n",
      "[04:09:02.780 --> 04:09:09.160]  So I don't think there is any point in trying to modulate or, you know, influence politicians\n",
      "[04:09:09.160 --> 04:09:15.280]  or the ministry, or even these institutions, because all of these institutions are now,\n",
      "[04:09:15.280 --> 04:09:20.080]  I mean, they are completely under the control of whatever this governance wants them to.\n",
      "[04:09:20.080 --> 04:09:27.040]  A classical example is, it's very, it's quite sad, Nimhans in Bangalore, has a separate\n",
      "[04:09:27.040 --> 04:09:30.080]  wing for Ayurveda and yoga completely.\n",
      "[04:09:30.080 --> 04:09:36.120]  So a colleague of mine actually went there to show a doctor, a neurologist, and everybody\n",
      "[04:09:36.120 --> 04:09:42.120]  who goes in there has to go through an Ayurveda and a yoga practitioner also, like it's become\n",
      "[04:09:42.120 --> 04:09:43.120]  mandatory.\n",
      "[04:09:43.120 --> 04:09:46.800]  He was telling me he was examined by the neurologist and everything.\n",
      "[04:09:46.800 --> 04:09:50.480]  He wrote some tests, and he wrote some medication, he asked them to go to the next room.\n",
      "[04:09:50.480 --> 04:09:53.160]  So he went to the next room, and there was an Ayurveda guy sitting there.\n",
      "[04:09:53.160 --> 04:09:56.640]  And he's asking them questions and asking him, yeah, telling them stuff to do and things\n",
      "[04:09:56.640 --> 04:09:57.640]  like that.\n",
      "[04:09:57.640 --> 04:09:59.480]  So that has become integrated now.\n",
      "[04:09:59.480 --> 04:10:01.680]  What questions did the Ayurveda guy ask the neurologist?\n",
      "[04:10:01.680 --> 04:10:08.080]  His diet and, I mean, he didn't tell me in detail, but about diet and sleep, and how\n",
      "[04:10:08.080 --> 04:10:11.040]  his dosas were not right and things like that.\n",
      "[04:10:11.040 --> 04:10:15.200]  And then the yoga guy prescribed him some yoga posters and things like that for his\n",
      "[04:10:15.200 --> 04:10:17.240]  brain disease and things like that.\n",
      "[04:10:17.240 --> 04:10:18.240]  Complete nonsense.\n",
      "[04:10:18.240 --> 04:10:20.760]  It's become totally integrated now into the main mainstream.\n",
      "[04:10:20.760 --> 04:10:23.400]  So these things are happening in the main institutes.\n",
      "[04:10:23.400 --> 04:10:30.400]  And I think a lot of money is also being pumped into these institutes for Ayush related research.\n",
      "[04:10:30.400 --> 04:10:31.480]  Lot of it.\n",
      "[04:10:31.480 --> 04:10:35.640]  And instead of really doing proper research, Ayush based research has now become a big\n",
      "[04:10:35.640 --> 04:10:38.320]  deal in most of the central institutes.\n",
      "[04:10:38.320 --> 04:10:39.320]  Even IIT.\n",
      "[04:10:39.320 --> 04:10:41.440]  They're all doing a lot of work for Ayush.\n",
      "[04:10:41.440 --> 04:10:44.400]  CSIR is doing a lot of product development for Ayush.\n",
      "[04:10:44.400 --> 04:10:45.880]  AIMS is doing active Ayush.\n",
      "[04:10:45.880 --> 04:10:48.400]  I was visiting AIMS in Bhubaneswar.\n",
      "[04:10:48.400 --> 04:10:54.480]  They were actually doing a study on constipation and yoga intervention.\n",
      "[04:10:54.480 --> 04:10:57.240]  Come on, you just take a Dulcolax, your constipation is gone.\n",
      "[04:10:57.240 --> 04:10:59.560]  Why do you need yoga for that?\n",
      "[04:10:59.560 --> 04:11:01.040]  Or treat the cause of constipation.\n",
      "[04:11:01.040 --> 04:11:02.040]  It's hypothyroidism.\n",
      "[04:11:02.040 --> 04:11:04.120]  You treat for thyroid disease, your constipation is gone.\n",
      "[04:11:04.120 --> 04:11:07.160]  Instead of that, they're making patients do all these asanas and all that and seeing if\n",
      "[04:11:07.160 --> 04:11:08.800]  constipation gets relieved.\n",
      "[04:11:08.800 --> 04:11:10.800]  What a waste of time and money.\n",
      "[04:11:10.800 --> 04:11:14.200]  All this is happening in central institutes now, which is quite sad.\n",
      "[04:11:14.200 --> 04:11:15.200]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:11:15.200 --> 04:11:19.200]  And it also, you know, you get this rhetoric from both homeopaths and ayurvedic people\n",
      "[04:11:19.200 --> 04:11:22.680]  saying that, hey, allopaths treat only the symptoms.\n",
      "[04:11:22.680 --> 04:11:23.680]  We treat the root cause.\n",
      "[04:11:23.680 --> 04:11:24.680]  Wait a minute.\n",
      "[04:11:24.680 --> 04:11:29.560]  Those people can't even know the root cause because their whole foundation is so demonstrably\n",
      "[04:11:29.560 --> 04:11:33.920]  crazy, like in the wonderful video you did with Krish Ashok, you also pointed out about\n",
      "[04:11:33.920 --> 04:11:38.840]  other aspects of Ayurveda, which are demonstrably false, like, you know, quite apart from Vata,\n",
      "[04:11:38.840 --> 04:11:41.320]  Pitta, Kapha, having no basis in science.\n",
      "[04:11:41.320 --> 04:11:45.400]  They will also talk about categories of hot and cold food, which make no sense.\n",
      "[04:11:45.400 --> 04:11:49.160]  And they will say honey and ghee can't be eaten together, you'll die.\n",
      "[04:11:49.160 --> 04:11:51.600]  You know, I have used honey and ghee together in a dessert.\n",
      "[04:11:51.600 --> 04:11:52.600]  Milk and curd and fish.\n",
      "[04:11:52.600 --> 04:11:56.280]  Curd and fish can't be used together.\n",
      "[04:11:56.280 --> 04:12:00.640]  And we don't we don't kind of question it, which is sort of nuts.\n",
      "[04:12:00.640 --> 04:12:04.720]  No, but you know, one important thing that and I'm thinking aloud here from what you\n",
      "[04:12:04.720 --> 04:12:10.120]  said is that it's heartening that more and more people speak up with you.\n",
      "[04:12:10.120 --> 04:12:14.680]  And I wish more and more people do this, because what I have realized is that it'll spread\n",
      "[04:12:14.680 --> 04:12:17.320]  through society when good people are silent.\n",
      "[04:12:17.320 --> 04:12:20.240]  And too often we find this, we'll go online.\n",
      "[04:12:20.240 --> 04:12:23.720]  And too often I'll agree with someone on Twitter, but I'll think to myself that hey, if I actually\n",
      "[04:12:23.720 --> 04:12:27.520]  comment, you know, people will mob me, I'll get into trouble.\n",
      "[04:12:27.520 --> 04:12:28.960]  We stop ourselves like that.\n",
      "[04:12:28.960 --> 04:12:31.840]  And I would just like to request everyone listening to this that one, of course, you\n",
      "[04:12:31.840 --> 04:12:33.120]  got to follow Abby on Twitter.\n",
      "[04:12:33.120 --> 04:12:38.760]  But every time he puts out a tweet that you agree with, amplify it either comment or retweet\n",
      "[04:12:38.760 --> 04:12:42.720]  it and you know, good people should not be silent when there is so much at stake.\n",
      "[04:12:42.720 --> 04:12:46.400]  This is a this is a health issue for God's sake, you know, it's when there is so much\n",
      "[04:12:46.400 --> 04:12:47.400]  at stake.\n",
      "[04:12:47.400 --> 04:12:51.560]  So, you know, you've given me a lot of your time and I want to thank you for that.\n",
      "[04:12:51.560 --> 04:12:54.760]  But before I do, I'm going to ask you for a little bit more of your time, because my\n",
      "[04:12:54.760 --> 04:13:00.440]  tradition at the end of my episodes is to ask my guests for recommendations of what\n",
      "[04:13:00.440 --> 04:13:06.480]  kind of books, music, films they really enjoy and would want to share with the world.\n",
      "[04:13:06.480 --> 04:13:10.600]  And and I'm going to start with graphic novels, because you're a fan of them as am I.\n",
      "[04:13:10.600 --> 04:13:13.120]  So I'm very keen to know what you'd recommend that we read.\n",
      "[04:13:13.120 --> 04:13:14.120]  Yes.\n",
      "[04:13:14.120 --> 04:13:19.120]  So graphic novel wise, I'm not sure if everybody's cup of tea, but one that is very close to\n",
      "[04:13:19.120 --> 04:13:24.360]  my, I mean, I just love reading it again and again is something called as Blankets.\n",
      "[04:13:24.360 --> 04:13:26.000]  It's by Craig Thompson.\n",
      "[04:13:26.000 --> 04:13:27.000]  Beautiful book.\n",
      "[04:13:27.000 --> 04:13:28.000]  Wonderful book.\n",
      "[04:13:28.000 --> 04:13:29.000]  Just.\n",
      "[04:13:29.000 --> 04:13:30.000]  It's just brilliant.\n",
      "[04:13:30.000 --> 04:13:31.600]  I mean, I mean, I can't explain it.\n",
      "[04:13:31.600 --> 04:13:32.600]  It's so nice.\n",
      "[04:13:32.600 --> 04:13:33.600]  It's so soothing.\n",
      "[04:13:33.600 --> 04:13:36.040]  The second one would be I'm not sure if people have read this.\n",
      "[04:13:36.040 --> 04:13:38.280]  It's called Rosalie Lightning.\n",
      "[04:13:38.280 --> 04:13:39.880]  It's by Tom Hart.\n",
      "[04:13:39.880 --> 04:13:46.800]  It's about a parent to I mean, a couple losing their child to sudden death syndrome.\n",
      "[04:13:46.800 --> 04:13:51.600]  And I mean, I mean, I mean, the listeners would think that I'm such a depressed, I mean,\n",
      "[04:13:51.600 --> 04:13:55.760]  depressive, tragic kind of guy, because a lot of books that I read are to do with a\n",
      "[04:13:55.760 --> 04:13:56.760]  lot of tragedies.\n",
      "[04:13:56.760 --> 04:13:59.360]  I think that's partly because I've been molded that way.\n",
      "[04:13:59.360 --> 04:14:03.160]  My mind is molded that way because the kind of patients I see and the kind of work that\n",
      "[04:14:03.160 --> 04:14:09.800]  I do every day, I try to look for bittersweet things in, you know, in real tragedy.\n",
      "[04:14:09.800 --> 04:14:12.240]  So these books stick with me.\n",
      "[04:14:12.240 --> 04:14:19.360]  And another book that I love is it's supposedly a children's book, but I think it's it's it's\n",
      "[04:14:19.360 --> 04:14:20.360]  more than that.\n",
      "[04:14:20.360 --> 04:14:22.200]  I'm not sure if you've heard of it.\n",
      "[04:14:22.200 --> 04:14:24.480]  It's called Robot Dreams.\n",
      "[04:14:24.480 --> 04:14:30.800]  Robot Dreams is about losing something and then finding it, but then still having that\n",
      "[04:14:30.800 --> 04:14:33.160]  lingering feeling that you have lost it.\n",
      "[04:14:33.160 --> 04:14:34.160]  Wow.\n",
      "[04:14:34.160 --> 04:14:35.160]  Right.\n",
      "[04:14:35.160 --> 04:14:36.640]  So that happens with me and my patients.\n",
      "[04:14:36.640 --> 04:14:46.280]  When I see a patient who is supposed to actually die and, you know, he improves.\n",
      "[04:14:46.280 --> 04:14:49.120]  And then I don't know what goes on.\n",
      "[04:14:49.120 --> 04:14:53.280]  You cannot actually you know, you cannot actually predict anything when it comes to health.\n",
      "[04:14:53.280 --> 04:14:57.880]  That is one part of medical science that, you know, you're nobody to speak on what is\n",
      "[04:14:57.880 --> 04:15:00.440]  going to happen to you or what is going to happen to your patients.\n",
      "[04:15:00.440 --> 04:15:02.240]  You can you can never predict it.\n",
      "[04:15:02.240 --> 04:15:06.680]  So patients who actually improve and then suddenly you lose them.\n",
      "[04:15:06.680 --> 04:15:14.520]  For example, I've had patients who have fought severe liver disease, came out of it doing\n",
      "[04:15:14.520 --> 04:15:15.760]  so well.\n",
      "[04:15:15.760 --> 04:15:19.560]  And then six months later, eight months later, they come with a severe bleed.\n",
      "[04:15:19.560 --> 04:15:21.040]  So we call it as a variceal bleed.\n",
      "[04:15:21.040 --> 04:15:26.000]  That is when it happens in cirrhosis where you have large vessels in the foot pipe and\n",
      "[04:15:26.000 --> 04:15:30.320]  they burst because your liver is cirrhotic and you you vomit blood and exsanguinate and\n",
      "[04:15:30.320 --> 04:15:31.440]  die.\n",
      "[04:15:31.440 --> 04:15:33.320]  And some of them come with such torrential bleed.\n",
      "[04:15:33.320 --> 04:15:36.280]  You cannot you can't do anything because when you do an endoscopy, you just see a blood\n",
      "[04:15:36.280 --> 04:15:37.280]  field.\n",
      "[04:15:37.280 --> 04:15:39.800]  You can't even identify the source to control it.\n",
      "[04:15:39.800 --> 04:15:41.480]  And they die in front of you.\n",
      "[04:15:41.480 --> 04:15:42.840]  And they were doing so well.\n",
      "[04:15:42.840 --> 04:15:44.960]  And you suddenly lose them.\n",
      "[04:15:44.960 --> 04:15:50.360]  And and it's like that, you know, you you you won the battle, but then you you lost\n",
      "[04:15:50.360 --> 04:15:51.920]  it at the end.\n",
      "[04:15:51.920 --> 04:15:53.920]  But that feeling of winning is there.\n",
      "[04:15:53.920 --> 04:15:56.600]  But then you have lost it also, right?\n",
      "[04:15:56.600 --> 04:15:59.880]  So these books actually give me that kind of sense.\n",
      "[04:15:59.880 --> 04:16:02.120]  That is why I love these books.\n",
      "[04:16:02.120 --> 04:16:04.080]  And I keep them very close to me.\n",
      "[04:16:04.080 --> 04:16:07.120]  And another book that I would recommend is Maus.\n",
      "[04:16:07.120 --> 04:16:08.120]  Brilliant.\n",
      "[04:16:08.120 --> 04:16:09.120]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:16:09.120 --> 04:16:12.480]  Maus is a book that it strikes.\n",
      "[04:16:12.480 --> 04:16:13.480]  Art Spiegelman.\n",
      "[04:16:13.480 --> 04:16:14.480]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:16:14.480 --> 04:16:16.040]  Art Spiegelman's book just strikes.\n",
      "[04:16:16.040 --> 04:16:19.240]  And another would be just to be off track.\n",
      "[04:16:19.240 --> 04:16:21.640]  There is a book called Bone.\n",
      "[04:16:21.640 --> 04:16:23.380]  It is a large series.\n",
      "[04:16:23.380 --> 04:16:24.380]  It's very cartoonish.\n",
      "[04:16:24.380 --> 04:16:27.600]  But my God, that's like a really mature book.\n",
      "[04:16:27.600 --> 04:16:30.360]  It has so many sub stories in it, and it's brilliant.\n",
      "[04:16:30.360 --> 04:16:32.480]  I love that book, Bone.\n",
      "[04:16:32.480 --> 04:16:37.240]  And then I would say from a literature point of view, a graphic novel that is very close\n",
      "[04:16:37.240 --> 04:16:41.400]  to me and I just love it is V for Vendetta.\n",
      "[04:16:41.400 --> 04:16:42.400]  Just brilliant.\n",
      "[04:16:42.400 --> 04:16:44.480]  I mean, these are the graphic novels that I love.\n",
      "[04:16:44.480 --> 04:16:47.880]  I have a lot of Marvel and DC comics, but I won't mention them here because they're\n",
      "[04:16:47.880 --> 04:16:49.000]  just entertainment value.\n",
      "[04:16:49.000 --> 04:16:53.360]  But these are some serious books that I relate to in my practice.\n",
      "[04:16:53.360 --> 04:16:57.140]  I mean, in my in my profession and career, because they're all bittersweet and tragic\n",
      "[04:16:57.140 --> 04:16:58.140]  at the same time.\n",
      "[04:16:58.140 --> 04:17:00.320]  So these are the books that I love.\n",
      "[04:17:00.320 --> 04:17:01.320]  Movies.\n",
      "[04:17:01.320 --> 04:17:06.240]  One movie that is very, very, I mean, something that changed.\n",
      "[04:17:06.240 --> 04:17:08.000]  I never knew that movies can affect you.\n",
      "[04:17:08.000 --> 04:17:13.640]  I mean, this is the movie that actually when I actually saw it, I had this feeling that\n",
      "[04:17:13.640 --> 04:17:16.960]  I mean, movies you see for entertainment, you know, you don't get affected by it.\n",
      "[04:17:16.960 --> 04:17:18.160]  That is how it was all the while.\n",
      "[04:17:18.160 --> 04:17:19.720]  But this movie started affecting me.\n",
      "[04:17:19.720 --> 04:17:26.200]  And that is when I said that movies are so powerful that it can challenge your emotions.\n",
      "[04:17:26.200 --> 04:17:29.720]  Cinema Paradiso is a movie that I just love.\n",
      "[04:17:29.720 --> 04:17:31.560]  It is so fantastic.\n",
      "[04:17:31.560 --> 04:17:35.400]  And on the same lines, so many movies are there, which I love.\n",
      "[04:17:35.400 --> 04:17:39.960]  But I cannot, I mean, give I mean, make a huge list out here.\n",
      "[04:17:39.960 --> 04:17:43.040]  So I'm just thinking the good ones that I've seen.\n",
      "[04:17:43.040 --> 04:17:44.400]  Tell me whatever comes to mind.\n",
      "[04:17:44.400 --> 04:17:45.400]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:17:45.400 --> 04:17:46.400]  So there is this movie.\n",
      "[04:17:46.400 --> 04:17:47.400]  I don't think everybody would have seen it.\n",
      "[04:17:47.400 --> 04:17:49.420]  There is a movie called Tiger Tail.\n",
      "[04:17:49.420 --> 04:17:50.680]  It runs on Netflix.\n",
      "[04:17:50.680 --> 04:17:53.400]  It's a fantastic movie about love and loss.\n",
      "[04:17:53.400 --> 04:17:54.400]  I love it.\n",
      "[04:17:54.400 --> 04:17:56.040]  Tiger Tail.\n",
      "[04:17:56.040 --> 04:18:00.560]  And there is this movie called The Town, which stars Ben Affleck.\n",
      "[04:18:00.560 --> 04:18:06.560]  It's an action movie, but it ends so differently, which is why I love that movie, The Town.\n",
      "[04:18:06.560 --> 04:18:11.840]  And then I would, I mean, I don't like these mainstream kind of trilogies and movies.\n",
      "[04:18:11.840 --> 04:18:13.440]  I don't, I don't like them.\n",
      "[04:18:13.440 --> 04:18:19.240]  Then something I just watch without, you know, like a brainless watch is Korean movies.\n",
      "[04:18:19.240 --> 04:18:21.000]  I love Korean movies.\n",
      "[04:18:21.000 --> 04:18:27.040]  So one Korean movie I love is, there is this movie called I Saw The Devil.\n",
      "[04:18:27.040 --> 04:18:30.520]  I don't think everybody should see it because it's really crazy.\n",
      "[04:18:30.520 --> 04:18:32.960]  Now that you've said that, everybody will rush to see that only.\n",
      "[04:18:32.960 --> 04:18:33.960]  I certainly will.\n",
      "[04:18:33.960 --> 04:18:34.960]  Oh my God.\n",
      "[04:18:34.960 --> 04:18:36.960]  I mean, it's violent and it's brilliant.\n",
      "[04:18:36.960 --> 04:18:39.240]  I mean, Korean movies are inherently very violent.\n",
      "[04:18:39.240 --> 04:18:41.680]  So I Saw The Devil is one movie I love.\n",
      "[04:18:41.680 --> 04:18:45.320]  Then there is a new Korean movie that I recently saw called The Roundup.\n",
      "[04:18:45.320 --> 04:18:46.320]  Brilliant action movie.\n",
      "[04:18:46.320 --> 04:18:47.320]  I love it.\n",
      "[04:18:47.320 --> 04:18:53.840]  Then there is a movie called Memories of Murder, brilliant Korean movie, fantastic, Memories\n",
      "[04:18:53.840 --> 04:18:55.160]  of Murder.\n",
      "[04:18:55.160 --> 04:19:00.600]  And if you ask me a series that I loved, there are two of them.\n",
      "[04:19:00.600 --> 04:19:04.760]  One is the series called The Night Of.\n",
      "[04:19:04.760 --> 04:19:05.760]  It's a brilliant series.\n",
      "[04:19:05.760 --> 04:19:06.920]  It's on Hotstar.\n",
      "[04:19:06.920 --> 04:19:10.160]  I think everybody should watch it, The Night Of.\n",
      "[04:19:10.160 --> 04:19:13.960]  And there is this series called True Detective Season One.\n",
      "[04:19:13.960 --> 04:19:14.960]  That's superb.\n",
      "[04:19:14.960 --> 04:19:15.960]  Wow.\n",
      "[04:19:15.960 --> 04:19:16.960]  Mind-blowing.\n",
      "[04:19:16.960 --> 04:19:19.160]  So these are the ones that directly come to my mind.\n",
      "[04:19:19.160 --> 04:19:23.080]  So when it comes to music, I am very old school.\n",
      "[04:19:23.080 --> 04:19:25.280]  I love the 70s and 80s music.\n",
      "[04:19:25.280 --> 04:19:30.920]  So I am completely into Pink Floyd, Def Leppard, Metallica.\n",
      "[04:19:30.920 --> 04:19:32.680]  So basically I love the power ballads.\n",
      "[04:19:32.680 --> 04:19:34.000]  I don't like the heavy metal part.\n",
      "[04:19:34.000 --> 04:19:35.640]  I love power ballads.\n",
      "[04:19:35.640 --> 04:19:38.520]  And I love soft rock and rock ballads.\n",
      "[04:19:38.520 --> 04:19:40.960]  So I love a lot of Bon Jovi.\n",
      "[04:19:40.960 --> 04:19:43.240]  I love Man O' War.\n",
      "[04:19:43.240 --> 04:19:45.160]  I'm not sure if people have heard about all this.\n",
      "[04:19:45.160 --> 04:19:47.680]  I love this group called Savataj.\n",
      "[04:19:47.680 --> 04:19:49.280]  They have a song called Sleep.\n",
      "[04:19:49.280 --> 04:19:52.440]  I'm telling you, if you listen to that, you will definitely sleep off.\n",
      "[04:19:52.440 --> 04:19:53.440]  It is so soothing.\n",
      "[04:19:53.440 --> 04:19:55.720]  It's one of the best songs I've heard.\n",
      "[04:19:55.720 --> 04:19:56.720]  Savataj.\n",
      "[04:19:56.720 --> 04:19:58.360]  Sleep by Savataj.\n",
      "[04:19:58.360 --> 04:20:05.080]  And another song that I really love is songs by Sting And The Police.\n",
      "[04:20:05.080 --> 04:20:06.440]  I love their songs.\n",
      "[04:20:06.440 --> 04:20:11.560]  And then, you know, the classic Cyndi Lauper, the classic 70s and 80s.\n",
      "[04:20:11.560 --> 04:20:16.680]  I mean, I can't imagine songs better than 70s and 80s anymore.\n",
      "[04:20:16.680 --> 04:20:21.560]  I mean, the ones you hear now, I mean, I think they're all trash.\n",
      "[04:20:21.560 --> 04:20:22.560]  I'm sorry.\n",
      "[04:20:22.560 --> 04:20:23.560]  I guess we are too old.\n",
      "[04:20:23.560 --> 04:20:29.640]  I mean, the only good band that I like hearing now is I think Imagine Dragons.\n",
      "[04:20:29.640 --> 04:20:30.640]  I love them.\n",
      "[04:20:30.640 --> 04:20:31.640]  They've got good songs.\n",
      "[04:20:31.640 --> 04:20:34.680]  But I think I'm too old to actually comment on new songs.\n",
      "[04:20:34.680 --> 04:20:36.720]  I love the 70s and 80s.\n",
      "[04:20:36.720 --> 04:20:37.720]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:20:37.720 --> 04:20:38.720]  Very nostalgic.\n",
      "[04:20:38.720 --> 04:20:39.720]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:20:39.720 --> 04:20:41.840]  And actually, congratulations, you have a book deal coming.\n",
      "[04:20:41.840 --> 04:20:45.320]  I know you don't want to divulge too many details, which is perfectly fine.\n",
      "[04:20:45.320 --> 04:20:46.920]  But tell me about this.\n",
      "[04:20:46.920 --> 04:20:51.720]  How have you fit writing the book into your sort of schedules and anything that you wish\n",
      "[04:20:51.720 --> 04:20:54.960]  to that you're okay with divulging about it is good for us.\n",
      "[04:20:54.960 --> 04:20:55.960]  Yeah.\n",
      "[04:20:55.960 --> 04:21:01.120]  So, I mean, this book project, the book deal that has come to me was it's completely out\n",
      "[04:21:01.120 --> 04:21:02.120]  of some.\n",
      "[04:21:02.120 --> 04:21:03.120]  It was surprising.\n",
      "[04:21:03.120 --> 04:21:04.120]  And I was not expecting it.\n",
      "[04:21:04.120 --> 04:21:09.320]  I mean, I always wanted to write a book because I love writing literature, especially medical\n",
      "[04:21:09.320 --> 04:21:10.720]  literature.\n",
      "[04:21:10.720 --> 04:21:12.880]  But I never expected this to come so soon.\n",
      "[04:21:12.880 --> 04:21:18.680]  And this this actually happened because the type of tweet that I do, I have a long form\n",
      "[04:21:18.680 --> 04:21:24.440]  tutorial, where I talk about a particular patient case and how we came to a diagnosis\n",
      "[04:21:24.440 --> 04:21:28.480]  of that patient through, you know, it's a kind of storytelling mode that I do on Twitter.\n",
      "[04:21:28.480 --> 04:21:30.960]  It's like a long thread form.\n",
      "[04:21:30.960 --> 04:21:35.240]  And I think I did about 20 of those long thread forms which I've collected in my on my profile\n",
      "[04:21:35.240 --> 04:21:36.400]  in Twitter.\n",
      "[04:21:36.400 --> 04:21:42.400]  And I think I got a lot of good response from my followers and friends on that.\n",
      "[04:21:42.400 --> 04:21:49.240]  And I got two or three offers from various publishers asking me if I would like to make\n",
      "[04:21:49.240 --> 04:21:55.000]  this kind of work into a proper book, which will actually look into, you know, hepatology\n",
      "[04:21:55.000 --> 04:22:00.440]  person because as my handling publisher, I mean, the editor told me, you know, you have\n",
      "[04:22:00.440 --> 04:22:05.840]  books on brain, you have books on heart, you have books on gut, you know, they all sound\n",
      "[04:22:05.840 --> 04:22:08.600]  so sexy, but we have no books on the liver.\n",
      "[04:22:08.600 --> 04:22:14.800]  So and the liver aspect of patient management and care is much more intense than what we\n",
      "[04:22:14.800 --> 04:22:16.620]  actually see in the other books.\n",
      "[04:22:16.620 --> 04:22:18.300]  And so this has to be there.\n",
      "[04:22:18.300 --> 04:22:23.320]  So they said that, you know, you have to write a book on it and it has to be on hepatology\n",
      "[04:22:23.320 --> 04:22:27.400]  based purely on your patient care and, you know, patient related stories.\n",
      "[04:22:27.400 --> 04:22:32.680]  And through those stories, you will teach the common man what hepatology is and how\n",
      "[04:22:32.680 --> 04:22:37.440]  the practice of hepatology is from the past to the present.\n",
      "[04:22:37.440 --> 04:22:38.920]  So this is a huge project.\n",
      "[04:22:38.920 --> 04:22:45.920]  So I think probably I'll, I'm going to look at 1.25 lakh words, about 400 pages, and hopefully\n",
      "[04:22:45.920 --> 04:22:49.880]  I'll finish it in the right time, maybe within a year.\n",
      "[04:22:49.880 --> 04:22:56.440]  And I currently what I'm doing is when I when I have a mood for writing that kind of, you\n",
      "[04:22:56.440 --> 04:22:59.960]  know, stuff, I do that and there is no timing to that.\n",
      "[04:22:59.960 --> 04:23:04.000]  So if I'm sitting in the OPD, and I get an idea about one particular section, I just\n",
      "[04:23:04.000 --> 04:23:05.480]  make a note on it.\n",
      "[04:23:05.480 --> 04:23:10.880]  And then I go back home and I write that paragraph, or if I'm sitting at home, and I get some\n",
      "[04:23:10.880 --> 04:23:15.000]  ideas on it, and my kids are asleep, and everybody, everything is settled.\n",
      "[04:23:15.000 --> 04:23:19.720]  I spend some time alone, maybe an hour or half, possibly two or three days a week and\n",
      "[04:23:19.720 --> 04:23:21.500]  then keep writing.\n",
      "[04:23:21.500 --> 04:23:23.780]  So I've not fully started on it yet.\n",
      "[04:23:23.780 --> 04:23:29.920]  But I've started and probably I have completed 16 pages of 400 pages.\n",
      "[04:23:29.920 --> 04:23:30.920]  Wonderful.\n",
      "[04:23:30.920 --> 04:23:31.920]  I can't wait to read it.\n",
      "[04:23:31.920 --> 04:23:33.040]  I feel that it'll be an important book.\n",
      "[04:23:33.040 --> 04:23:35.480]  And, you know, I feel you do important work.\n",
      "[04:23:35.480 --> 04:23:39.160]  So thank you so much for taking so much time and, you know, sharing your insights with\n",
      "[04:23:39.160 --> 04:23:40.160]  me.\n",

      "[04:23:41.160 --> 04:23:42.160]  Yeah, thank you for having me.\n",
      "[04:23:42.160 --> 04:23:46.880]  I was I was very glad that I could do this with you and open up the way I did with you\n",
      "[04:23:46.880 --> 04:23:48.840]  because you gave me this opportunity.\n",
      "[04:23:48.840 --> 04:23:49.840]  Thank you so much.\n",
      "[04:23:49.840 --> 04:23:53.640]  Thank you.\n",
