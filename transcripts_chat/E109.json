        "message": "Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen. The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once said that all of Western philosophy was nothing more than a series of footnotes to Plato. From this, you can gather two things. One, unlike other fields, philosophy does not seem to have made that much progress in the last 2000 years. I would argue, though, that this is not quite true. The second thing that quotation tells you is that Plato was a rock star. And indeed, while reading Rebecca Goldstein's superb book, Plato at the Googleplex, Why Philosophy Won't Go Away, I was struck by what a foundational thinker Plato really was. He asked many big questions that still drive philosophical inquiry today, and he anticipated insights that were given proper shape many centuries later. For example, we think of the social contract as a concept that was formulated during the Enlightenment. And the field of game theory is something that came about in the 20th century. So my eyes almost popped out of my head when I read a dialogue of Plato in which Glaucon, elder brother of Plato and a minor character in this dialogue, describes what is basically a game theoretic argument for a social contract. And Plato's dialogues, as I discovered in Goldstein's excellent book, are full of such seemingly modern arguments and insights. Plato at the Googleplex is a book that really has two intersecting parts. Half the book is a series of illuminating essays on Plato, his times, his philosophy, the impact of his work. The other half is a series of fictionalized dialogues of Plato set in current times and modern venues like the Googleplex, and these are quite witty and entertaining. Besides introducing us to Plato, the book really makes an argument that philosophy is not an arcane academic discipline, but that it actually matters in this modern world, in these crazy times that we live in. I spoke to Goldstein in December 2018 when she was in Mumbai for the Times Lit Fest. We recorded in a room given to us by the organizers and the venue was quite noisy. So please do excuse the quality of the recording. Before we get to it though, a quick commercial break.

I wanted to start by talking about what the philosopher Carl Jaspers calls the axial age, which is where you point out in your book that between 800 BC to 200 BC, there was a sudden explosion of different quests to find answers to the question of what makes a life matter. And it showed up in all the different normative religions, the monotheisms that sprang up and in philosophy in Greece. But my sort of question was why during this particular period was there this sudden quest?"

So when I approached this question of why the ancient Greeks had this massive explosion of creative ideas, you know, and they're credited with laying down the foundations of Western civilization, you know what, it occurred to me that this didn't happen in a vacuum, that this was happening, you know, in many places on the globe. And that all of the normative paradigms, you know, meaning the paradigms that people refer to when they're trying to give meaning and purpose to their lives, whether it's religious or secular, were formulated during this period. It was actually a philosopher, a German philosopher of the 20th century named Jaspers. He was the first to notice and to name the Axial Age, that there was this great creative normative ferment during this period. And so the question is, you know, why did it happen then? And social scientists are just beginning to look at this. There hasn't been a great deal of attention given to it. I mean, after all, it was one of those things that was pointed out by philosophers, that something amazing was going on during this period. It seems like the most important variable was that, simply, the people were well-fed. Pascal Boyard in France has plotted the caloric intake all over the globe at that time. And indeed, the countries that participated in what we call the Axial Age, which was India, in Hinduism and Buddhism and Jainism, were formulated during this period. China, Confucianism and Daoism were formulated during this period, and Greece, philosophy and tragic poetry, which was their response to this, to these questions of what it is that gives meaning and purpose to our lives. These were all, and also the Judean hills, you know, where the Abrahamic approach was formulated. Persia, Zoroastrianism, all of these places that participated and forged these frameworks that are still extant today, claiming all of us in one way or the other, including someone like me, who's a secularist, you know, and so I trace my roots back to ancient Greece. They were all well-fed."

And it comes very naturally to our species as soon as we're freed from the, you know, the constant trials of simply surviving. These other features of the\u2026 You also pointed out that it correlates with urbanization. Exactly. These were highly organized city-states and they had standing armies, they had coinage, they had slavery, they had trading, you know, this is so important, right? So they were mixing with different people, different cultures, different ways of thinking, which makes us humans think, well, what's the right way of thinking about our lives, right? Here are these different traditions, different goals, what's the right way? It comes quite naturally to us. And also in these cities, there was more anonymity. I had the great privilege, I don't think I wrote about it in the book because I don't think I'd had yet this experience, of visiting one of the last of the hunter-gatherer tribes, of spending a little time with them in Tanzania, the Hadza. And it was very interesting. First of all, they have to really, every day they wake up and they have to fulfill their caloric needs. I mean, and it's very difficult. But one of the things that was very clear is they lived in great intimacy with each other. Everybody clearly mattered in that village, right? It's sort of a, it's a family. It's how, this is what we have come from, of intimate village life. And when, in these big city states and there's more anonymity, this question also I think is exacerbated. Well, you know, who am I? What can I do to achieve some sense of mattering in the universe? In the village life, you matter. You know, it's, everybody has their position. So all of these things come together. I don't think it's just a matter of caloric intake. I think it's more complicated than that, but we see it in all of these places. There was also a scribe class. So there was written language in all, you know, there was written."

But after his death, we find many little statues of Socrates, they regretted it. But because of certain things that had happened after they lost the Peloponnesian War, their war with another city state, Sparta, they didn't have tolerance for Socrates with his skeptical questions anymore, asking them or demanding that they question their own normative values, which were not philosophical, but rather something that I call the ethos of the extraordinary, that what they had produced was this view that in order to really matter, you have to make a name for yourself so that knowledge of your life will be replicated in future generations or in your contemporaries. And this gives a certain moreness to your life, you know, so fame and glory, what they call kleos. And so that this was, this was their way of pursuing it.

But what we seem to have gone back to follow the default is the pre philosophical Athenian of you, which is to be replicated in the minds of others. What's extremely interesting, I'm writing about this in my new book, but you know that we are, we're a species that really looks for attention one way or the other, right? That this is, and in fact, even the way we've evolved, we can, we have, you know, neuroscientists have now shown us that we have special areas of the brain, special neurons that are devoted to being able to see when people are looking directly at us, those neurons will fire. If people's eyes are directly on us, a few inches, a few centimeters, either way, other neurons will fire. So we have this detection system, right, of when people are paying attention to us. And I, you know, I've had experience with little babies, my own, and other little babies at such an early age, they are making eye contact, extreme eye contact. We're so dependent, we're a gregarious species, we're very, very dependent on the care of others for a very long time, we have a very long childhood and adolescence, it gets longer and longer, I know 45-year-olds now who are still adolescents, but that's another story. But so this dependence on our own kind makes us very susceptible to attention. So what we see in the Axial Age with these gods that most of, you know, how do we want to feel that we matter, it's put in terms of, you know, sort of the gods, but the Greeks were very special because the way that their stories of their gods develop, you don't want too much attention from these gods. Something bad always happens when a god pays too much attention to you. So you want to be glorious, but not so glorious so that the gods feel that you're competition. I think of them because I have older brothers and sisters, you know, that the Greek gods are sort of like older brothers and sisters, you know, they want you to emulate them and to revere them, but then if you start to surpass them, they're going to slap you back into your place very, very quickly. So it's, the Greek gods are something like this, so they develop this kind of, it was a highly religious society, saturated with religious rituals, but those were mostly to appease the gods, you know, to their apotropaic, that is warding off evil. You don't, you know, so don't pay too much attention and I'm paying proper respect to you. But in terms of what they wanted, the attention that they wanted to make them feel like they matter was from fellow citizens and from future generations.

You could talk about the areta of a knife or of a horse, you know, so it was the excellence of this thing in ancient Greek. And it's really the influence of the philosophers, of Socrates and of Plato, how it comes to mean virtue rather than any kind of excellence, because part of the attack of the philosophers on the normative framework of their society, why Socrates was put to death, was that the claim is, you know, not just any kind of kleos will do the trick. It has to be areta, it has to be true excellence, and what they argue for is that true excellence consists in knowledge, wisdom, virtue, justice, courage, you know, the virtues. So the term undergoes this transformation. And you know, by the time we get to the Gospels, you know, written in Greek, areta simply means, you know, virtue. It just means virtue. This is the transformation that these philosophers who are writing, well not Socrates, he didn't write, but Plato, Aristotle, and the philosophers who follow them, that this was a transformation"

And I want to quote a great, a very nice passage that kind of illustrates that from your book. Start quote, in the Gorgias, is that the right way to pronounce it? In the Gorgias, Socrates is presented as asserting something so radical that his hearers think it has to be a joke. He would, he says, rather be treated unjustly than treat others unjustly. But if areta is conceived of as analogous to the health of the body, then Socrates' statement is hardly absurd. The injustice that we do involves us far more intimately than the injustice that we suffer. I don't only act out of character, my character reacts to my actions."

And in fact, it's something far more private, something that takes a tremendous amount of striving, but not striving just to be replicated in other people's minds.

Well, the big problem is, of course, most of us are not exceptional, right? We're perfectly, but yes, I mean, by definition, we're ordinary, most of us. And so what, you know, what did you do? Well, you, I call it participatory exceptionalism. You know, you're participating in an exceptional city state and of course, Athens was the most, it was a given premise, a firm premise among all of the ancient Greeks of no matter what city state that they were the best in the world, right? This comes very naturally to our species. And you know, in fact, their word for a foreigner is barbarian because, and it comes from their word for blah, blah, blah, what, you know, just is bar, bar, bar, you know, you can't understand what they're saying. So they're barbarians, right? And it simply meant not Greek speakers. And so, but there was that, that kind of implication, lesser, there are lesser people. And then among these exceptional Greek speakers, the most exceptional, the creme de la creme were the Athenians, right? And it was, it was an imperial power. They were an imperialist over their fellow Greek city states. And they were also a great draw for their, for all of the most creative people. So you know, Aristotle was not born in Athens, he came to Athens, he came to Athens to study in Plato's Academy, the first European university that was founded by Plato. And so there was this, this sense that the way you can achieve something big and extraordinary is by being a citizen of an extraordinary state. So there's this nationalist fervor that is so strong because the whole existential longing to make something of your life was tied, tied up in this. And this is a way, of course, that we all, it's a way we all try to do it, by the group we belong to, you know, that this is a way of, rather than the values that we cultivate within our soul, the group that we belong to."

One of the reasons I like Plato, although I do not think that everything he said was right, clearly not right. But again, how could I think that philosophy makes progress and think that everything Plato said was right? No, we can, we've made so much progress, we can look back at Plato and say, no, you were wrong about this, this and this, and many other things. But something that's very fundamental about him, he changed his mind many times. And this discipline that he really founded for us is a very self-critical, it's reason, but everything is open to reason. Everything has to be justified. And so there's a great self-critical capacity that has to be cultivated in order to be a philosopher. I feel that any philosopher who hasn't changed her mind many times over the course of her life is really not being a good philosopher because this is critical, this self-criticism. So but one of the things that stays permanent with him is that, what I call the sublime grade, the intertwining of these three most important things for him, truth and beauty and goodness, and that they all are connected, they're embedded with each other. You can't achieve any one without the other. So for example, how can we tell that something is true? There has to be a beautiful explanation. So if we have, you know, two or more explanations that are, that can accommodate all of the things that we're trying to explain, all of the evidence, we go with the most beautiful one, the most elegant one, in some sense the simplest one. But there's an aesthetic evaluation of that as a criterion for truth. Now, I come from a background in physics and that is very, very apparent in physics. You know that when we, for example, turned away from the geocentric view, that the heavens all revolved around the earth and moved the Copernican Revolution to the heliocentric universe, both systems could accommodate all of the empirical evidence, the movements of the planets and all of this, but one of them was really messy. You had to keep adding more and more epicycles. It was mathematically grotesque, right, and one, all you had to do was change the orientation and make the sun the center with the earth moving and the, everything became, the explanation itself became beautiful, became mathematically simple. We still, this is still the case, you know, so for, you know, all the way, you know, with relativity theory, when Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, he had very little empirical evidence for it. What he had was beautiful mathematics, the mathematics is stunning, the theory itself is stunning and when it, it, it, he was proposed, the general theory was published in 1915, had to wait until 1919 until he had any empirical evidence for it. They needed a complete eclipse, a solar eclipse so that they could see whether or not, I won't, I won't go into it."

It takes taming of the ego, right? Because we have a great tendency to believe what's true, what, if it most flatters ourselves, our place in society, our place in the universe, I mean, why did we think that the earth had to be the center of the universe with all the heavens revolving around us, right? It flatters our, our sense of importance in the cosmos, you know, so just to be able to attain the truth means you have to subdue the ego somewhat, right? But that also, when we see the truth, our perspective is so broadened. We see ourselves in this greatest perspective, the grandest perspective, and that itself, you know, expands our virtue, gives us a tolerance, and we don't take ourselves so damn seriously, right? I mean, this is, this is the aim of ethics to, we see ourselves in some perspectives in regard with other, of our fellow citizens and fellow creatures and our planet itself, our cosmos itself. This is what it is to be virtuous. So yeah, so that's how these things all become intertwined. I just wanted to say this, this one thing that Einstein had said when he finally was brought the evidence for the general theory of relativity, that yes, light, the mass of, the mass of the sun actually did shift light in the way that he had predicted, and it was a huge, you know, success for this theory. And so a philosopher of science, Hans-Reichenbach, asked him, how did you feel when you finally got news that your theory had been vindicated? And he said, oh, no, I already knew it had to be true because it's so beautiful. So the empirical evidence just didn't even matter so much. So you know, this, and this we can trace all the way back to Plato."

It requires education. You don't get the most comforting answers from it, right? You know, it depends on us. It's very human-centric. It makes the universe a kind of cold and uncaring place, an impersonal place. It's not surprising it broke out in ancient Greece, given what they thought of their gods, which were, they're downright, you know, hostile to us. But it doesn't, whereas the, you know, the Judeo-Christian Muslim view, which captured the world, is that it's very powerful. It gives us a sense of cosmic significance. You know, I, myself, had started out that way. I was born into an extremely religious family. I know what it feels like to make the transition of feeling, you know, that God is watching everything I do, which is terrifying because, I mean, it's really, there's no privacy whatsoever. And also, you know, he's a very stern God.

I think that, you know, it was Alfred North Whitehead, a 20th century philosopher and logician who had said that the truest thing you can say about Western philosophy is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. And this is a very good soundbite, but like most soundbites, it's a gross oversimplification. What you can say about Plato and the reason that he's so very important is that he had a real sense for what the philosophical questions were and what answers a philosophical question and what doesn't answer a philosophical question. And he found philosophical questions lurking in every area. So he lays out the landscape of philosophy, that we can say, the different areas, you know, philosophy of religion that we spoke about a little bit and, you know, and theory of knowledge, epistemology, moral philosophy, political philosophy, you know, all these different, but that there are always these philosophical questions that arise that are not one with the fields themselves. They're meta questions. They're about the philosophy of science, you know. So it's not that he laid out all of the answers, as I say, we can look back and see how many mistakes he made. I mean, his theory of forms. I don't know anybody who holds by this philosophy of language. He asked the important questions and he proposed his theory of form. What is a meaning? How does a word acquire meaning? And he had this theory of forms. We have philosophy of language now, very complicated, very sophisticated. It's not Platonic, right? It's not Plato's answers are not the answers, but Plato's questions, time and again, are the questions. But we've made, we've made progress with them. The other thing is the more scientific progress we make, the more philosophical questions are churned up by the scientific progress."

So often philosophers will first ask the scientific question that kind of motivates the science and finally the methodology emerges that could, that could answer these questions. But that's not its only role. It also looks at what science, you know, the current science of the day is telling us and helps to determine what it's answering and what it's not answering. So for something like, for example, neuroscience. So we've learned so much more about consciousness, you know, through cognitive science and through neuroscience, we can map the brain and see where different aspects of consciousness, where they're located. And, you know, I think neuroscience has made it extremely probable that consciousness is a brain process, right? That it's, it is, it is a material physical process. Has it thereby eliminated the notion of agency, that we're actually in control of our actions? Has it shown that we can possibly be free, that the sense that we have of actually making choices of, of just deliberating and deciding is an illusion. So this is a philosophical question. So look at what science has so far established and then see what it implies, what it doesn't imply. What's, what's still open. Scientists are often very eager to, to interpret their findings in the broadest way possible. So you'll find many neuroscientists, you know, I mean, we've answered all of these philosophical questions and that's where people trained in philosophy, you know, they have to look, know the science, be trained in the science. But as the philosophical question, does it really entail what the scientists are saying that it entails? I mean, in physics, which was the, the, the science, the scientific field that I'm most interested in, that I had most studied in university, there is, you know, we have this very strange theory, quantum mechanics, and we don't quite know how to interpret it. And you know, when I was taking my physics courses, there was one view, you know, about quantum mechanics, which is, was associated with Niels Bohr, was called Copenhagen interpretation, which is that, you know, things don't exist until you measure them. So to ask where is the particle before it's measured, where, you know, where had it been before, is a meaningless question. You know, this is a philosophical view. And what happened was philosophers began to examine this view and say, look, here's quantum mechanics. Here's what you found. The interpretation of quantum mechanics, this is philosophical, is it good philosophy? And they're the ones who really prodded physicists so that they came up with other interpretations as well. There's the Bohmian interpretation. There's the multiverse interpretation. These things were first proposed by, by philosophical thinking. So this is another way in which the more progress we make with our science and getting into stranger and stranger things, to see what it implies and what it doesn't imply. And that, that is, that's the work I think very much of philosophy. What philosophy is after is to maximize our overall coherence, to see what we know and what other possibilities that leaves open, closes off, to try to make us as consistent and coherent. That has always been the role of philosophy ever since Socrates was wandering around asking his annoying questions of his fellow citizens."

Truth seeking comes from the violent activity of philosophy, a drama enacted deep in the interior of each of us and which manages in its violence to deprive us of positions that may be so deeply and constitutively personal that we can't defend them to others. This violent activity is personal, even as it leads one in an impersonal direction where interpersonal agreement is possible. Stop quote.

It has to be minds clashing with other minds, and that's the way these deep intuitions that we don't even realize we have, because they're so deep down within us, that they can be brought to the floor and other people who don't share your intuitions will say, defend them, account for them, tell us why I ought to believe in them. And then, you know, sometimes you realize you really have no reason whatsoever. And that's how progress is made. One of the wonderful things that's happened in our own day is that, you know, more and more people are brought into this conversation. A person like me, a woman, would not have been part of this conversation for very long. And I have seen over the course of my lifetime how this has changed. When I entered into philosophy, I was the only woman in the room, especially because I did philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics. These were really considered unfeminine, right, areas of philosophy. I was the only woman in the room. I'm not anymore, right? There are many women. But this itself has brought philosophical questions into the conversation that were invisible to men, such as raising children, you know, questions about what is the right way, you know, children have been, care for the planet. I mean, the ecological concerns have become, you know, in general, for all of us, a very, very important part of philosophy, but more what we call applied ethics, rather than just grand theories of ethics, applied ethics, you know, really specific questions that are facing us have become much more prominent."

And yes, I feel angry, you know, I don't feel, I don't feel comfortable reading these things. But I, you know, I force myself to, and I force myself to think out, well, what are they assuming that I'm not assuming? How do I defend my assumptions against their assumptions? It's a lot of work, right? This is a lot of work, but, and it's uncomfortable, and it doesn't feel so very good. But I think, I think that this is part of what it is to be an enlightened person. To be an enlightened person is to be aware of the things that you're assuming, and that they're not necessarily true to other people, and do you really have good reasons? Could you convince them? What's the best that you could give them to try to change their minds? If we did that..."

Because when you talk about virtue coming from knowledge, if you have complete knowledge, doesn't that then make philosophy meaningless and virtue moot?"

You know, I believe in, you know, to believe that we have this ability to look at our own thought processes and be self-critical about them and change our mind about them, without believing in that degree of freedom, you know, we can't make any sense out of what it is to be rational. So if we're committed to reason, we have to be committed to some degree of freedom."

        "time": "00:58:09.720",
        "message": "Yeah, yeah. No, I think we have to be even more. It's like, to say that there really is, you know, rational behavior, rational beliefs justify belief, and those which are irrational and unjustified, and that therefore ought not to be believed, right? There is a normative presupposition that is enfolded in epistemology itself. To be committed to that, we have to be committed to some degree of freedom. When I see, when I examine my own thought processes, because you come at me with these trenchant questions, and I say, well, I really don't know how to answer them. I better go back to the drawing board and rethink it, and maybe I will, I will change my mind. That is, that's a presumption of being a reasonable person at all. So if, you know, what we have learned undermines reason itself, then we have no reason to even trust what we have learned, right? It's a, it's a kind of Pyrrhic victory. It will, it will destroy any claims we have to, to truth, to knowledge, to reason. So to that degree, I think we have to, we have to countenance free will. Rebekah, thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you. Thank you."

Think about it as three friends revising before a test and we go back to school. There's nostalgia. There's trauma. There are lunch breaks. There are favorite teachers. There are horrible teachers. There's everything. So every Tuesday, we bring in a guest on the podcast and we ask them a very simple question. Do you know how to citizen? Meghna, I think the question is, do you know how to citizen? But Shreyas, I'm asking you this question, do you know how to citizen? Hi listeners, we at Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund have come up with a special podcast series called MF101 in collaboration with Bloomberg Quint.
