Maybe you're a woman in a particular time and place, and women in that time and place behave in a particular way and you don't question that. You slip into that skin and then that skin is who you are. Or if you're a creative person, you build an image of yourself as a certain kind of creative person. Maybe you're a writer of books in a time where writing a book is considered the ultimate intellectual achievement and you don't go in other directions. Or maybe you're a filmmaker who only wants to make feature films and looks down on vlogs and TikTok videos. You may have a love of language and storytelling, but you tell yourself that only one form is for you and the rest don't matter. You get inside the box and the box closes in on you. Now, I've done many episodes on the creator economy and I believe that more and more young creators are escaping the tyranny of form, even while they embrace the possibilities of each form that they take up. And this is a damn good thing. Equally, even outside the creator economy, technology has connected us to the rest of the world and everywhere we can see different ways of living and new possibilities of who we can be. But that is now. A few decades ago, we were largely prisoners of circumstance and location. Well, most of us were. My guest today has lived an unconventional life. Born in 1939, she never felt any pressure to slip into female stereotypes and her father even advised her to not bother to get married. As an artist, she was never bound down by any one form or any one language. She's been a novelist, a critic, a journalist, a playwright, a translator, a writer for cinema, a historian of theatre, a memoirist, and an essayist par excellence. And she's done these in both English and Marathi. She's a legend of Indian culture, but it's not just her work that blew me away, but the clarity of her thinking, as you'll hear in this conversation. This is a special episode. Savor it."

        "message": "Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Shanta Gokhale, and I just don't know how to describe her because as I pointed out a few moments ago, she's done it all. I'm good friends with her son, the columnist Girish Shahane, and I took much longer to call Shanta to the show than I should have. Frankly, I was intimidated by the breadth of her work, and I worried I may not be able to do it justice. But I finally did invite her, and she was so kind that she agreed to chat with me over two days. This episode is eight hours long, but my last two episodes to cross seven hours, episode 303 and 309, which are linked from the show notes, have been two of my most loved episodes. And like those episodes, I feel this one also is too short. My purpose with conversations like these is to create a kind of oral history, to try and capture glimpses of someone's life and the times they lived through. Shanta has lived a rich life, and a sharp gaze has captured so much that is essential about these times. As you listen to her, I'll also urge you to check out all her books. One Foot on the Ground is a fantastic and unflinching memoir, and she also has two other memoirs about a father and a mother on her website. I've linked them from the show notes. Jerry Pinto edited a great collection of her writing called The Engaged Observer, and you can read her novels, Rita Vellinker and Tyawarshi, also known as Crowfall, in both Marathi and English. She's written a magisterial history of Marathi theatre, she's translated books, there's a lot to dive into. But hey, you can start with this conversation. Before we begin though, let's take a quick commercial break. So, if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to ctqcompounds and check out their daily reader. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long-form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. They also have a great program called FutureStack, which helps you stay up-to-date with ideas, skills and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future. FutureStack batches start every Saturday. What's more, you get a discount of a whopping 2,500 rupees, 2,500 if you use the discount code UNSEEN. So head on over to ctqcompounds at ctqcompounds.com and use the code UNSEEN. Uplevel yourself. One of the things I realized when I started this podcast and started doing it is that older people like us, and I'm approaching 50, so relative to our listenership, I'm from a different generation, often suffer from the curse of knowledge that we assume that our lived experience of the world is sort of a shared experience, a shared bedrock of knowledge. And then I have to harshly remind myself at times that 70% of the country is born after 1991, right? And many of the things I take for granted, what India used to be like, what our cities used to be like, what our culture used to be like, is something that they just don't know. And therefore, I think there's a lot of, I find a lot of value from listening to my guests talk about how they grew up, where they grew up, get a sense of those times. So I'd ask you to, you know, take us back to your childhood and where you were born and so on."

And Dr. Nikki, as her name was, was away in church and came back and mother was still laboring away. So she prayed. And that's how, that's not how I was born, but that's when I was born. And this followed, Dr. Nikki said, she's going to be a philosopher."

        "message": "Dad, because he came first. He was a wonderful person to be with. One gets close to one's parents. I did at any rate, around 12 or so, because that's when I was reading seriously. And this was a shared interest. So I read what he did, and I wasn't forbidden from reading any book that I picked up. So he was a man in a hurry. He was a journalist, and he had so much to think about and to write and do. So he would say to me, OK, tell me in two short lines what you liked about the book. So I think it got me into the habit of thinking concisely about things. And there was a lot of this kind of back and forth conversation. We had family dinners, and so there was a lot of conversation. And this was mainly with Dad, because otherwise the rest of the day he was away at work, etc. And my time with my mother was when she was in the kitchen cooking, and I would chat to her. Or she was a woman with many ambitions, so she would be rushing off to college, and I'd be handing things out to her. She had to catch that particular train, etc. And she and I became friends in later life. My father, unfortunately, passed away rather early in life. He was just 56. And six years before that, I was away for my education. So the years with him were basically between the age of 14 or 12 and 16. Those were years of a very fine and intense relationship building up between us, basically through books and through travel. He and my mother were both ardent travellers, and they had always travelled before we arrived. And after we arrived and were of an age when we could go with them. We've done some amazing trips outside, trekking and down south to temples, all sorts of things. So those were times when he was relaxed and we could really share ideas and thoughts. And I always got the feeling somewhere that I was being tested. I didn't know what the test was. I don't know whether I passed or failed, but it kind of pushed me to think. Thinking was extremely important. And this was a result of the conversations I had with him. So with him, it was a relationship based on ideas. And with my mother, the ideas were there, but it was common sense. Her observations about life, her feelings, her past with her family, stories about that. She was a great storyteller. My father didn't tell stories. I mean, when I wrote that memoir of his, I was very sorry that I started it so late because a number of his close friends had passed on. And I didn't know where to look for material on him, intimate, personal material, just a few stories that I had growing up and the rest. Luckily, he being a writer, a journalist, and my mother having been this great preserver of things, I had this bulging file full of cuttings from the time he started in Patna to his Times of India days. So to the extent that you understand a person through his or her writing, I understood where he was, where he stood. And the kind of negotiation that he had to do, even back then, we talk about it now, but even then, it was a British-owned newspaper. So you had to tiptoe around certain things. And I knew where he was tiptoeing because at home, it was full blast, full idiot stuff like that. And so it was very interesting for me to see this. My father negotiating between his beliefs and what he had to do as a professional journalist, and my mother negotiating between her aspirations and what she had to do as a homemaker. And I think both of them didn't show signs of struggle, but I do think that I realised, though I was having a very easy life, that life wasn't easy. That it was all about sticking to what you believed in, despite everything, and yet being able to get on with people. Both of them had so many friends of so many varieties and ideologies, and looking back, it amazes me because now it's this or that. It can't be anything in between, but my two distant cousins of my mother's would come over, and they were called Ram and Lakshman. And they were Hindu Mahasabha members, and absolute no two ways about it. And my father was left-leaning with Marxist sympathies, and they had fantastic conversations together. And there was much laughter, much teasing, and it was something that I took for granted, that this is how things are. And suddenly you were faced with the rest of the world, where things weren't quite that way. So that was the kind of home atmosphere that I grew up in. And my mother, insisting, her huge insistence was that whatever your circumstances right now, you never know what they will be in the future, and you have to be tough. So she would sometimes make us sleep on a chadai, sometimes on a bed, sometimes with lights on, sometimes with lights off, get used to it. And I think we got used to it, because later on in London, I lived a very sparse life and didn't feel it at all. So it was a lovely, lovely childhood."

        "message": "When I was, lots to double click on, and I'll first double click on a little further on your dad. One of the things that struck me while reading your memoir of his, is that he was in multiple ways, he was almost born 60 years before his time. And one way, of course, is that in the holidays, you speak about how you guys are taking photographs of each other and just really engaging with what's around you. And I thought that, okay, in this, you know, Instagram generation, he would, he would have been putting up reels all the time, and it would have been great. But the other way, which, you know, truly blew my mind in, in which he was ahead of his time, was his clarity about what his values were, and his expression of that clarity. For example, early on, you speak about how, you know, when he realized as a child, what the caste system was, he decided to rebel against it. Now, he could not change his name, but he changed other markers. So instead of his dhoti, he wore pajamas. And instead of keeping a bald head, he had long hair. So he had long hair and pajamas, which was an act of rebellion, almost against what the background was."

We were still living in the times which he had left behind. And as I said, he had friends from all walks of life, all classes, all castes, and many of his friends spoke of him as an eccentric. So we grew up with the idea that that was something else. And when we visited our friends' houses, we saw the kinds of rules and regulations that they lived under, which we didn't. So we always knew that he was different. My mother was different, because her friends who would just drop in would always complain, Indira, you're always busy. And then she would say, well, I can hardly sit with my feet up waiting for you to come. Yes, I like to keep busy. So she was also different, and we grew up admiring this difference. It wasn't as if we felt you are not like other parents, and therefore we are different, and it's not the way we want to be. We were perfectly happy being different, and our parents being different, because we were getting to do a whole lot of things that my friends couldn't. And now that you're asking me about this, as late as when I was about 40, 45 maybe, I had gone to visit a friend of my father's, a well-known screenplay writer, Mr. G. R. Kamath, who wrote all the scripts for all the do things, do bhai, do chot, do whatever it was. And he stopped halfway through our conversation and said, I have to tell you this. Your father was a fool to send you to England. And I'd grown up hearing this, because you didn't send daughters to study abroad. You sent boys, sons, daughters you saved up for their marriages and dowries and stuff. So this kind of difference was always impressed upon us by other people. And so we knew who they were. And they were people who changed over time. They themselves were never rigid. So as we were learning from them, gradually I know my mother was learning from me. Lots of things that my father used to ask me. So it was a really give and take kind of relationship after a while. So we never thought of them as fixed entities, except for a few things, like despite my father's liberalism, he was in a few ways a puritan. We played sports and we wore shorts and played sports. But at any other time, our dress had to be decent, so to say. And the other rigid thing he never got rid of was he hated women who dolled up in jewelry. So there was no gold and things in the house, and we weren't supposed to. And I don't know about my sister, but I didn't mind it, though. There was a time when I wanted to doll up, but I didn't so much mind being denied these things. So these were plus something like thread ceremonies, which he wouldn't let us attend. And he actually put his foot down. But my mother would say, sorry, these are my relatives and this is happening. I have to be there. But he sat us down and explained to us when we were very young why he objected to thread ceremonies and how they were always gender specific, unlike the Parsi thread ceremony, and caste specific. So those were values, those were core values which stayed. But otherwise, I remember I persuaded him out of the shirts, colorless shirts that he used to wear. And I got him some nice checked material. And he would say to me on his way to office, I guess you're going to decide what I'm to wear today. And I would put out his shirt for him. So it was that kind of relationship."

You write, quote, to father, gold ornaments were the equivalent of baubles, a sign of primitivism. Face powder was prohibited. It clogged the pores of the skin, preventing sweat from flowing freely. In adolescence, when I became conscious of my looks and spent more time than father thought necessary before the dressing table mirror, he draped it with a sheet. When my school friend Rohini Patkar came over, she asked in loud surprise, gosh, why do you cover your mirror with a sheet? Father's voice wrote back from the veranda, because we are halfwits, stop quote. And you point out he actually used the Marathi word. And I'm just thinking aloud here that it strikes me that this is not so much a kind of conservatism as it is a deep form of liberalism in the sense that, you know, it seems to play into another thing that you mentioned about your parents, that even though once they had two daughters, they did not try for a son. They were happy with their two daughters. You know, they valued daughters. And also, they were not tied in by the stereotype of what a daughter must be, which shows in the way that he sent you out to England for education. And there's a very moving part where you quote him saying, and these are his words, don't expect us to go searching for a husband for you. You are free to choose your own mate or whatever caste, creed or religion he may be. But when you do, don't expect us to give you a lavish wedding. I am putting all my money into your education. You will find that of greater value than an extravagant social ceremony and gold ornaments, right? And the whole thing of covering the mirrors seems to me to be almost an identical impulse that my daughter is not, you know, the traditional thing that daughters must be beautiful and married off, but no, daughters must be knowledgeable and have that confidence."

You've written a lot about his journalistic career in great detail, and perhaps we'll talk about that, about the fights he took on matters of principles, how he walked away from places because, you know, he didn't want to compromise on his values and all of that. And the picture that one gets is of someone who is passionate about the calling of journalism. You know, all the excerpts from his writings are just, you know, so coherent and cogent and so clear. And at the same time, we get a picture of someone who perhaps with age or perhaps he was always like this, you know, you'll be able to elaborate, is also becoming, you know, the family is becoming bigger and bigger in a scheme of things like with many men, the family is something that happens to them, but they are doing whatever else they are doing and everything else is incidental. And here, this is not the case. Like after you finish your school, he wants you to go to England. And at that point, he leaves a job for reasons of principle, which you point out. And but he wants to send you guys to England. And when your mother protests and says she's only 16, how can she go? He says you also go. And when she says, but what about her 14 year old sister? He says, take her with you. So the three of you are off to England. And there is this lovely, there are these lovely lines where you write, your ship is called SS Arcadia. And you write, quote, the SS Arcadia was a huge awe-inspiring white hulk. Up on the deck, we lost all sense of reality. Down below stood father, a small, lonely figure, a devoted family man, sending his wife and daughters off to a country he had never visited himself. But for whose education system he had the deepest admiration. Mother was concentrating on swallowing her tears. As she looked down at father, he said, he used to be reluctant to let me go even to Dahanu for a few days and now see where he's sending us. The ship moved away. Father grew smaller and smaller till we could see him no more. Stop quote. Right. And this is such a moving, lovely picture. And, you know, tell me about how you saw him sort of change over the years. You know, because many men become one thing and then they never change through their lives. And they are just that. And here it seems that this is a thoughtful man, but also given to self-reflection. And just through his actions, you know, we get glimpses."

And I think I've quoted one of his friends who said about my mother, about them as a couple, that he is a horse that's going galloping wildly. And without the reins that she puts on him, he would go, you know, berserk. So my mother absorbed a lot of that kind of anger and rage. I know that. I used to argue with her and I'd say that this is unfair. I mean, he shouldn't have lost his cool this way with you of all people. And why didn't you say something? And she would always say, you know, he will cool down by himself. And I will find the time to tell him that what he said was unfair. I am not going to take it lying down, but there is a time and a place and I will find it. You don't worry. And I would say to him, you're a huge feminist where we are concerned, but where I is concerned, you're not. So he would laugh at that. He would understand exactly what I was getting at. Because while we weren't cast in stereotypical roles, to some extent, because the family becomes part of any marriage at all, she had to take on stereotypical role. So he knew that he hadn't protected her from that. So he knew what I meant. And he had a lovely laugh, which we recognized as his recognition of what we were saying. And it was always charming when we saw it. Because at other times, you talked about his passion for me and image, enduring image of him is pacing the veranda before he left for work. And he would be thinking possibly about the edit that he had to write. And there were times when you could see that repressed anger and frustration. He would go red in the face. He wasn't fair skinned as such, but his skin would take a red tint. And we knew he was inside of him furious. And when he died that young, my mother did say, this is all that repressed fury, which has taken him."

And I'm just thinking aloud here, but it strikes me that men who were remarkable in those times, what is remarkable about them can often be seen in their biography and the things that they do. The women who are remarkable, it's unseen, right? It's unseen because, you know, they're not public and a lot of the things that they do, the negotiations and the compromises are private, known to nobody, forgotten. And I just like one, of course, my favorite three sentences of your writing are, you know, about your mother. And these are delightful sentences. I mean, they just contain a universe and I'll read these out. We knew about the tiger cub, her rice mill manufacturing Gandhian father once brought home from the jungle. It died of pneumonia after a servant decided to soap and bathe it to make it spanking clean. Meanwhile, it had acquired a taste for Alfonso mangoes. You factor universe into this and this is genius. But tell me a bit more about what you could gather about your mother's childhood, because it's tough in the sense that, you know, she has to drop out of school in the fifth standard because her father's gone and had a whole bunch of kids who have to be looked after. And one after the other, the kids are popping out and she's got to look after them. So I think fifth standard, she drops out and she kind of does that. And you would imagine that this would sort of domesticate a woman where they just get adjusted. OK, this is a rule. House, family, you know, you move on from parental home to looking after husband and kids. But your mother was a different kind of person. Your mother, you spoke about how once in her childhood she amused all her uncles, her brothers, because she jumped into the well to learn swimming. So she was one feisty woman. And my really favorite anecdote in all of this is how she decides to find a mate for herself."

And even as we heard it in, you know, the 1940s, it seemed way ahead of where we were. So, OK, first of all, she had a very good relationship with her father. Father used to be extremely busy, but he recognized in her that spirit which he admired. And she became his right hand in the business. She would keep all his accounts. So she became important to him in that sense. And I think I have said here or in the other memoir about her that perhaps it was a touch of selfishness that he wasn't thinking of her future, of her marriage. And the others, of course, were all aunts and busy with their own children. So she decided, she was 25 at that time, which was, I mean, well past marriageable age as such. And she decided, OK, I have to do this for myself. And so she started reading the marriage columns in Marathi magazines, and she came across this notice, this ad put in by a young man who seemed to have no particular, none of those typical caste and looks kind of demands. He was looking for a free woman, a woman with character and caste no bar. So because her father had brought them up to not believe in caste, and they had been ostracized by the Brahmins of Dhan, because they allowed scheduled caste people to fill water at the well. So they had been, so she was brought up in that kind of manner. So she thought, OK, this could be the man I'm looking for. And she answered that ad, and he, on his part, having been kicked out of the house and really not having a caring family, had realized that he has to do fen for himself also. So he responded to her letter. And I believe it was quite a correspondence before they decided that, yes, we could go ahead with this. And she did feel in a way inferior to him because he was, as they called people, double M.A. He had two M.A. degrees, and she was just fourth pass. So she used to quote this line from her, the letter that she wrote, that you are the sun and I'm but a glowworm. And so, and she went on to say, but then, and then she used that lovely Marathi proverb, which translated says that, well, it's actually a pipe dream. And if the pipe doesn't play, we'll just break it."

But however eloquently she spoke of them, they weren't the letters. And there was some storm. And when I was writing my memoir of her, I went to lengths to look up what that storm could have been. I looked up, I went to Google, I went to old histories, all sorts of things. But this storm occurring in that year and hitting the West Coast of Maharashtra hasn't been recorded.

You're perfectly happy with masalas and cigarette tins and you build up your life. So that was the point that she was making when she told us this. And in her memoir, I have written about a play which she translated into Marathi, which she, it was a set text for her, for the university course. And she just fell in love with it. And I know exactly why, because it was called The Never Never Nest. I forget the name of the author, but it's about this old aunt who visits her nephew and sees that the house is full of all the amenities and, you know, grand furniture. He has a car and she's trying to figure out how he, with his salary, can afford all this. So she asks him, and these were the higher purchase days, which were just starting in Britain. And he says, oh, it's so simple. We pay installments and we get to use these things. And she says, this sati that I'm sitting on, is any part of it yours? So he says, no, we haven't paid a single instalment. She springs out of it and says, I'm not going to be sitting here. And finally discovers that they totally own the steering wheel of the car. And the aunt says, I'm going home. I can't take this. And she gives them a cheque and says, make at least one thing totally yours. And when her nephew is dropping her off, the wife runs to the maternity hospital where she's pregnant, where she's registered, and she pays the doctor this cheque and comes back saying, at least our baby is going to be fully ours. So the reason why my mother would have translated this play, and she was very keen to have it staged in the women's club that she was a member of, was that it fitted exactly her values. Don't live beyond your means, but don't complain about your means, because it's happiness whether you're here or there, happiness you're making for yourself. So, yeah, the cigarette tins were the beginning of the accumulation which followed."

And she complained to her mother that in all other ways, you're a feminist, why are you doing this? Why are you making a man the center of her existence? And obviously, the question that then arises is that that's a young girl's instinct without having the frames of feminism, without having read feminist books, you still have that instinctive sense that something is wrong. And it is not that a person is bad, that the father is bad person, but that something is structurally wrong in just the way the world is. So tell me about yourself, because one of the things that struck me and that I was really jealous of is how clear eyed you were about everything from the time you were in school onwards. You know, I look back at my youth and I was just a confused mess. But you were just so clear about everything, what you want to do and so on.

And this, it's being able to look at different kinds of people and always listening to their stories of their lives and their feelings about those lives. So, putting all of that together gradually and without being conscious of it, you begin to get actually a sense of yourself, a sense of where you stand vis-a-vis all these different currents that are moving around you. So, a lot of, for instance, at university, there were a lot of wonderful fellow students who were extremely religious. And I had two friends who genuinely felt I was a lost soul. And I didn't take it amiss that they wanted to save me because they genuinely felt for me. And I realized that you're always thinking from within your belief system. And their belief system told me that I was standing in a dangerous place. And because they were so fond of me, I had to be brought around. But gradually through my discussions with them, I became a firmer atheist than I had been. My father was, but in our house, this wasn't forced on us. But if you admired someone and admired his or her values, then you gave serious thought also to this other part. And as far as my mother was concerned, she never declared herself an atheist. But she wasn't a ritualist. She never went to temples. We didn't have images of deities in the house. But I know that there was in her a streak of faith which was abstract, which wasn't necessarily located in an idol as such. And yet she was close enough in belief to my father's atheism because of this, because she wasn't ritualistic. And we didn't hear any clashes between them about this. So I grew up generally thinking, okay, you know, there's no God. And my father is now 45, and he's lived so many years without believing. So what and do I feel a sense like a few of my friends became very emotional at a certain age about God. And there was a lot of talk about how the light came to them or, you know, how a sense of something came, et cetera. And I know that I was watching myself. If three of my friends have three different stories of the same kind, what am I? Why am I not seeing any light or getting any special sense of anything? And so gradually through these discussions, through my own experience of the world and basically of myself, I realized, yes, okay, I'm an atheist. And it's not something that I want to hammer home to anyone. I'm really not interested in converting anybody at all to my belief. But I wish I could be left alone, which often I'm not. I'm challenged to explain. And sometimes I say, I'm not challenging you to explain. I'm accepting you. You accept me. Do you think I'm an okay person? Yeah. So that should be enough, shouldn't it? And then some people say, you know, actually, you may not think so, but you are the most spiritual person we've met. Think so if you must. It is nothing to me. But, yeah, so that was one framework, definitely, that gradually beginning at home but not being forced into it, which I did create over time. And as you said through my reading of Germaine Greer and Simone de Beauvoir, suddenly it's strange when you are not brought up as a girl, a woman. You don't consciously think of yourself as that. And so you say some people are conservative and some are liberal, and that's about it. But suddenly my eyes were opened when I read this. It started in the 60s while I was still in England, a lot of discussions, et cetera, and then actually reading these books and then understanding how this is part of a system that is not individual choice, that these things, these roles are constructed. I didn't go on to read feminist theory after that. I didn't think that I need to. I think in all things I'm a little impatient with theory. This is what I have discovered over time, because I find that theory stops you from thinking freely. It binds you. I didn't continue to read feminism, but I had enough to go on for myself and to connect with other women who didn't think I was a serious feminist, because when my first novel came out, my heroine didn't bang the door and walk out of the house like Ibsen's Nora, which really was the thing to do. Feminists had to be rebellious, and I was in that, and my heroine also learned through experience what it was to be a woman, as I had done. So I really believe in experience teaching you about these things."

Because I think that, you know, I've had a bunch of feminists on this show, like Urvashi Bhuttalia and Kavita Krishnan and Paramita Bora and all of that. And what I admire about all of them is their engagement with the real world, that you don't want to be lost in some theoretical construct, but you want to look at the real world and without being judgmental, you want to try to make it better one step at a time. And one common frustration sort of that some of them have expressed privately or otherwise is that in today's age of social media, you have a lot of performative signaling, going on, where people who don't want to engage with the real world, but they want to show how virtuous they are will, you know, go on Twitter and they'll take stands. And many of these stands will be strident. Like you've pointed out, you know, you translated Lakshmibai Tilak's wonderful book Smriti Chitre, and you pointed out in the introduction to that, and I'll in fact read your words out where you say, quote, feminists have had a problem with Lakshmibai's endurance of her husband's ill-treatment of her. Viewed in the framework of women's rights as we see them today, she should have filed for divorce on innumerable counts. But it is not just that such an act was unheard of in those times. The thought of permanent separation from her husband did not once enter her mind because quite simply Narayan Vaman Tilak and Lakshmibai Tilak loved and respected each other. Stop quote. And, you know, and it's true that a lot of some feminists today, obviously not all, but some feminists today would, you know, pass judgment and it's all black and white. And oh, she was, you know, what a non-feminist thing to do to stay with that terrible man. But the real world is complex. And I'm wondering if the best way to deal with this complexity is not necessarily through columns and nonfiction writing, but through art, through plays, through theater, through novels and so on, because there you can embrace all these complexities and go deep into all of these without."

And it is given to us that we can look back historically. You, you know what society was like and you know to what extent this woman stuck her neck out. And that in itself spoke of her spirit. Why do we want to put her into this kind of a box of feminist thinking and feminist action when the word itself wasn't born back then? And there were winds were already blowing. There was a huge reformist movement in Maharashtra and playwrights, as you say, quite rightly, things are better done through art. Playwrights had put women at the center of their plays and to talk of issues like this. But in our case, the issues were so basic that you couldn't really get to the nuances that today's feminists are. No, I won't say today's feminists are not nuanced, the kinds of young women that you're talking about. No, there's no nuance there at all. But of our generation, we have that perspective and we know how bad things were. And it is within that frame that we have to see Lakshmi Maitra. So, yeah, this was a discussion I had just two days ago. And another thought comes to mind. I was at a literary festival and some young women were planning a panel on some feminist issues. And I was asked if I would be part of the panel. And I said, look, I don't want to be on a stage fighting it out with other feminists. But I have come to feel that maybe we are not on the same page. So perhaps, you know, you shouldn't be asking me at all. So one of the young women said, don't you want all men to be locked up in prison? I said, no, I love men. I have the most amazing male friends. They have problems. I have problems. I understand where they are coming from because gender construct doesn't only apply to women. It applies to men also. When I was in Glaxo, for instance, I used to do the internal public's house magazine. And I was interviewing people on, you know, their whole life, basically. And one of the factory workers talked to me very openly about how he loved cooking and how useless his wife was. So how perfectly matched we are. She hates the kitchen. I love it. And the next day he came up and said, please don't carry that. Because I said, why? It's so refreshing. He said, that's not how my colleagues will see it. I will be told that I'm a bailia."

But, you know, that point you made about, you know, not necessarily hating men also, like, you know, the great writer Bell Hooks also writes about the need to have empathy for men also, because in a sense, they're also victims of patriarchy. I did an episode with Nikhil Taneja recently, one of my most popular and favorite episodes, you know, seven and a half hours long. I'll link it from the show notes where, again, we spoke just about that, that patriarchy, of course, is terrible and oppressive for women in a very obvious way. But it is also oppressive for men in a less obvious way in that we are trapped in roles that, you know, don't allow us to talk to each other freely, don't allow us to cry in public, for example. And trapped in ways that made that worker that you were speaking of say that, please don't carry that. My other men will call me by whatever it is, which is so tragic. While we are speaking of today's discourse, I also want to ask you about another aspect of it. And this is something that you brought up earlier that in your household, you could have your liberal father speak to people who were of a different belief and they could be friends. You know, one of your close friends, Satyamev Dubey had, you know, RSS sympathies and so on. And, you know, some of that, and I wonder if it's possible today, like there's a lovely sort of letter that you reproduce from your father's friend, M.V. Matthew, to your dad, you know, which is in 1966, after your dad has retired and moved to his farm. And he says, my dear GGG, Gopal Guntur Gokhale, that was his name, my dear GGG, as I was saying, it won't work. You know, parliamentary democracy and your present setup are a waste and a luxury. And then he goes on about justice, rule of law, consent of the governed, all of that. And at the end, he asks, how are the onions growing? You know, and I love it. This is so beautiful because this is what is friendship for me. Friendship is not all the other stuff. For me, friendship is how are your onions growing? You know, and I worry sometimes that we lose this, that it almost seems that in modern times, especially for those on social media, you're being pushed to be judgmental of your friends. You know, at another point, you have this lovely essay on Vijay Tendulkar, where, you know, you write about him about the importance he gave to violence in his plays. And you write, quote, seeing it as an integral part of the human makeup, he treated even his most violent characters with a degree of compassion that is rare in our moralistic culture, stop quote. And that phrase, our moralistic culture struck out for me. So with the span of all this passing time, like, you know, do you feel that it has it has changed in this way? Or do you think that only like I notice it when I'm on social media, but I honestly don't notice it otherwise, when I'm actually meeting people sitting in their living rooms, you know, we all disagree."

But in my conversations with this need, for instance, there's no wish to lead you to the source of these ideas. Where does it come from? Where did that belief begin? Are you testing that belief against anything at all? Have you shifted at all? I have shifted. I know I've shifted. I have been fairly rigid. But over these last eight years or so, I have been thinking very deeply about it's not these people, it's not they. It is us. So why is this happening and where is it coming from? And I really think partly it is a kind of hubris. That is what I find questionable, that you want to be a Bhishma guru. That if you have that kind of a dream in today's world, it means that you are consciously blinding yourself to ground realities. Can you? And what does Bhishma guru mean? I'm dying to interview people with just this one question. How do you define Bhishma guru? What exactly are we going to do? And for a guru, if we follow our parampara, the guru didn't go around saying, I'm a guru. Word got around and people came to him and said, let us sit at your feet because we think you have something to give. So let's go back to our parampara. It's not a Western import at all, but think about it and, you know, test yourself. It's very hurtful that people aren't doing that and becoming so rigid. So, yeah, I don't see the possibility of a common platform where we will hope to understand each other."

And it's in the context of American politics, but he makes what I feel was a very wise point there, where he essentially looks at the three ideological tribes in the US, you know, the progressives, conservatives and the libertarians. And he says that they're talking past each other all the time because the first principle from which they come is different. So, you know, your progressives will talk of equality, conservatives will talk of tradition, libertarians will talk of freedom. And all of them are cogent and all of them are coherent and all of them are logically consistent. But they're starting from a different place. And what's important is that you acknowledge the other person's priors. And then you have a conversation. And I think that, I mean, I don't even view that as a problem or at least not as an insurmountable problem. Because I think so far in our history, humans have been able to talk to humans and work things out. That is a whole business of politics, in fact, that you can negotiate and come to understandings and all of that. But in today's harsh, judgmental, moralistic, polarized times is getting more and more difficult. And my next question is kind of speculating on why that might be and asking you to react to it. That I think that one reason we are getting more and more polarized and judgmental of each other and less accommodating, less tolerant, is that we are withdrawing more and more away from concreteness into abstract concepts. Right? So, you know, I did an episode a long time back with Anshul Malhotra, who did a book on partition. And she mentioned how when she was doing research for that, she was in Pakistan at one point. And she was sitting with a family who had had to suffer during the partition. And they were raging and ranting about Hindus are this, Hindus are that. And then they suddenly see Anshul sitting there and they say, tum nahi beti, tum toh bahut achchi ho. You know, and what's happened is they're raging in the abstract, but they're appreciating this person who is there in the concrete. And my sense is that, you know, in the concrete, we can be accepting of each other if we open ourselves up to it. But abstract notions like nationalism, purity, culture, all of this nonsense really gets in the way. And while it would seem that technology has made us more interconnected than before, it has actually made us more atomized than before, because today you go to a cafe, you'll see four friends sitting together, lost in the world of their mobile phone,"

You said tradition for conservatives. So what is tradition? And tradition, by definition, is a changing thing. It cannot be just what was and when was that? Which year are you fixing for tradition? How far back do influences begin and get passed down to you? So once you start trying to define, take equality, define equality. So what do you mean by it? And I have just translated a Marathi classic novel in which caste is the central issue. And a pundit who is working on his own smriti is saying that caste is a good thing. Because let's examine really what would happen with the kind of caste-less society that you're talking about. At the moment, I see that within a caste, the haves are doing something for the have-nots because they can identify them and they can feel for them because there's a lot that they share. So there's a feeling of fellowship and they will do things for the have-nots. Open it out to the whole world. Who do you feel for? It's too wide a thing. You can't. So if you're talking about brotherhood, then that is a very abstract idea, which put down on the ground cannot work because human beings themselves, each of us, has only so much space in our hearts, so to say, for fellow feeling. As you said just now, you recognize a person that's sitting across from you. And that is reality. That's the concrete reality. The whole world cannot become concrete reality for you. And therefore, then you think in terms of groups of monoliths, and that's where politicians take you for a ride because they know that's how you feel. So yeah, that's so good for them."

Leckie had written this book titled, I think, A History of European Morals at the turn of the 20th century, where he came up with this phrase called the expanding circle. And the concept of the expanding circle was that initially, we consider only a small circle of people worthy of a moral consideration. So it could be your family, then it could expand to your tribe, then it could expand to a larger community, then it could expand to a nation. And his sort of thesis was that that circle is expanding for humanity. In fact, Peter Singer wrote a book called The Expanding Circle, about postulating that it will once expand to include animals. But the point you seem to be making is that there is a natural limit to that expansion. Because as you point out, there's a limited amount of place in our heart, that we are hardwired in a sense to search for our tribe, our community. Those are our people. No one outside that is worthy of our consideration. Is that correct?"

And whereas, if you think in terms of enemy groups, then you attach certain attributes to them, which don't belong to any of them individually, but you're thinking of them as a group. It is a physical impossibility of meeting the huge diversity of human beings that make up the planet. And to some extent, then you do think of them in this abstract fashion, if someone is not driving a wedge in and saying it is they and we are us. So that has to be engineered within ourselves.

And he mentioned it to Satyadev Dubey, who was a friend of yours and didn't know you had written that play. And then you write, quote, The next day, Dubey was at my house, angry that I had written a play and not shown it to him. He took it away, and within six weeks, it was on stage in his original language, Marathi. This was my first and only experience of being one of Dubey's writers. And I must confess, he did not change a thing in Avinash. The only thing he did do was give it a time, 1974, and a location, Shivaji Park. I had not located the play in any particular time or place because I was convinced it could happen anywhere and at any time in India. But Dubey did not care for ambiguities, which is why he asked me to close the open end of the play with a strong speech that would remove all ambiguity. Stop quote. And here there is that point about ambiguity, but there is also that point about he's asking you to make it more concrete."

And a lot of the work that I do when I'm writing a novel, for instance, is to put down the timeline very clearly to read around. And I like to refer to certain real events. So I want to know exactly what happened. I want to know how 10 different people felt about that. So that if all of that doesn't come into the writing, but it gives the writing a kind of base in the concrete. So I do believe very much in concrete detail. As I said, because I know that I can't do the other thing. That's not one of the skills that I have. But this I do have because this can be done with a lot of hard work, study, thinking. And that I can do and I love doing. So I must tell you with my novel Crowfall, where in an early scene, one of the protagonists tears up 12 years of diaries, which she has kept consistently. And the last diary, I think, has a picture of Hrithik Roshan on it. And Jameel said, no, you've got that wrong. Hrithik Roshan became popular so much later.

        "message": "I'll come back and ask you many, many more questions about your writing later in our conversation. But to kind of go back to your childhood, you know, one of the themes that has fascinated me is how are people formed? Like in one way, we couldn't be formed like who we are could be partly an influence of our parents. If they are a particular way, we grow up in that household, maybe they have books, so we read more, maybe they are liberal. So, you know, we become liberal. Maybe there's a certain kind of conversation in the dining table and we imbibe all of that. And that's one way. Another way is from our peers, like Judith Rich Harris wrote this great book called The Nurture Assumption in the late 90s, where she looked at a lot of data and spoke about how the role of parents is overplayed. That how kids learn far more from their peers and so on. And that shapes them a lot. And there's a lot besides these two also going on. Like, I think one of the things that many people don't realize is how contingent their character is. You know, I use the example of the 19th century railroad worker Phineas Gage, who was working at a railroad and a metal rod went through his head. And he managed to survive. His memories were intact. Everything was intact. But he from a very calm, soothing kind of person, he became an angry, violent person. The character just changed because part of his frontal lobe was gone. Similarly, I think of one of my heroes, the great musician Chris Cornell, who took some medication for some problem he had. And that medication was later found that it makes people suicidal. So his chemical balance changes and he kills himself. And he's got such a great career and such a great tragedy. And it tells you that we often sort of have so much certainty in who we are, that I am this. But everything is contingent. You know, you get the genes you do. It's an accident. Your circumstances are an accident. You change the chemical balance. Everything changes. You don't have breakfast one day. You're a different person in the afternoon. So looking back on yourself, you know, I want to ask you about the shaping of you. Like what was your conception of yourself? And when you now look back in hindsight, what do you think are the things which shaped you? And also, what parts of that are contingent and what qualities are essential? Like, do you think that there is something essential to Shanta Gokhale that no matter what else happened, this would define you? This would still be you, the core of you, which has never, ever changed?"

        "message": "Yeah. I still don't know who or what I am, frankly. I think, yeah, this question was asked to me some time ago during an interview. And that's when I realized that I haven't really given myself thought. I have, you know, this great question that people ask, who am I and what am I doing here? These are the big questions which I don't remember ever asking myself. This is, I think it has made me happy, but I think perhaps in terms of the kind of character that you become, maybe it's an inadequacy that I have not asked myself these big questions. I think I have the one thing which has been rock solid inside me is can't bear injustice. That is, I mean, just two days ago, I was thinking, you know, these little memories that are stuck in your mind. And you try and figure out why particularly that memory. So this memory is of when I was about six years old and the class teacher was called Miss Jacob. And I was very fond of her, extremely fond of her. And I was always a very quiet child, very shy. I had friends, but I didn't much care to open my mouth and speak publicly about anything. And we were walking in one of those crocodile queues that children have to make at school to go from one part to the other. And someone behind me whispered to me, and I wasn't sure what it was, but Miss Jacob was heading the queue, heard a voice, turned around, came and gave me a slight tap with her cane on my calf, on the calf. It was my left calf, I remember. And I remember the hurt of the injustice done. I hadn't talked. It wasn't me. And I think that it was because of that intense emotion of feeling the injustice, the unfairness of it, that has kept that memory so vividly alive in my mind. So, that's one thing which, you know, it really, I mean, it makes me angry, truly angry. But most other things, yes, well, everything sounds so trite when you say it, but things like living simply, I can't bear to see too much flash. I mean, it's okay, it's there outside and people are there and they're enjoying it. But if I'm there, I feel distinctly uncomfortable. I have a great regard for the hard work that makes money. Money is serious business. And do you make it or don't you make it? And if you make it, how do you make it? And test it always against one's freedom. This I came face to face with in the times of India, where they started taking people on contract rather than as employees. So, people could be picked up from one department and put into another because they were on contract and they could be thrown out any time. I was editing the arts page and there were certain things I was doing there, which I believed in, and it was getting a lot of response from readers also. So, I realized I was doing the right thing, more or less. But I also realized that it wasn't exactly how the management wanted that page to go. It was suggested to me that I should have some features on shirt design and stuff like that. And I stood my ground and I said, that's not how I have conceived of this page. You have given me just this much space and I'm doing in it what I think is of value culturally. The rest of the paper carries stuff about shirts and jewelry, etc. So, why on this page? And I knew I could say this because I was an employee of Bennett Coleman and Company. I was not on contract. I had turned down the contract. I had received calls from Delhi trying to persuade me and I stuck to my guns. I was making less money than my assistant. So, for me, that's where money stands. If it means compromising my values or my freedom to do what I think is right, chuck me out. But if I'm there, I'm going to do what I believe in. So, then money is not an important factor. So, that's me, money and freedom."

And if just buying things will get you some kind of other kinds of pleasures, they are more worth it. Because the money is no longer a scarce resource.

Like one of the interesting anecdotes about your childhood is that you ended up going to school a bit early because you would stand in the balcony and just cry when you saw the other kids go to school. So your parents quickly went to Dada Rege of Balmohan Vidya Mandir and said, please, girl wants to learn, please take her. Yeah. Tell me a bit about what kind of girl you were, what was school like?"

And I wanted to be where there were books. So I was kind of an honorary member of the class. And they didn't bother to include me into the lessons and stuff like that. But I was really happy sitting by myself and just listening. And because it was a junior class, there were also things like play acting and singing. And I think I've talked about Jogrekar sir, who was a music teacher. And he always made me sit on his desk and sing. And I have a feeling that I was tuneful. I think I've been tuneful, but without the voice to go with it. I've learned music, but for my own pleasure. My voice has always been too weak, really, to sing. But those, I mean, what was I, about two and a half then? But I seem to carry very distinct memories of sitting on that desk and singing. And looking back, I wonder how I did that, because I really was very shy. If I was asked my name, it took me a while to say it out loud. But then, jumping forward to my first experience on stage, I think to perform, which is not talking about yourself, you sing someone else's lines, you say someone else's lines, you become someone else. And that fascinated me, that becoming someone else, because it was like a shell then, behind which I could hide and this other person could perform. And for the longest time, I played this game with myself, even as a grown-up. If I ever had to talk publicly, I would say, you know, forget it, it's not you, it's someone else talking. And it was a stupid game to play, and I wasn't a fool. But I think it got me over that hurdle of the first few minutes, and then I was fine after that. So, yeah, two and a half, I was at school, and Dada Rege was extremely upset that I was taken out of his school and put into Scottish school, which was then Bombay Scottish Orphanage. And I felt I should go back to that school and give back something for those first two years of school life that I enjoyed there and really thoroughly enjoyed. And I offered to take voluntary classes in English, because I knew that Marathi or any children studying in Indian language schools had a problem when they went to college. And when I came back from England, I was actually teaching at Elphinstone, so I knew these children and how they hugged the walls as they walked, whereas the English-medium school children walked straight down the middle of a corridor, and that was very hurtful. So, I offered Dada Rege my services free to teach his students, 10th standard students, English. And I don't know if he still held on to the grudge, but he turned down the offer."

And you then, when you speak in Marathi or when you write in Marathi, then a very strange thing happens. On the English reading side, they suddenly sit up and think, OK, so if this person who writes in English is writing, is choosing to write in Marathi, then we have to look at Marathi a little differently from what earlier I know a friend of mine would say. It's a servant's language, Marathi, because socially they never met Marathi people because Marathis were never members of that economic class. So, servant's language, this has been said to me. And I didn't feel the need to defend the language because the language is so great. Why would I want to defend it? But I tell you, lately, it's not just English, it's Hindi as well. And this was my experience at one of these Lit Fests. And there were two, I don't want to name them, but there were two other people on the panel with me. And I forget what the subject was that we were discussing, but both of these people were constantly speaking in Hindi. And it was supposed to be an English-speaking panel, but they didn't think twice about moving into Hindi. Not just that, one of them read out poetry in Hindi. And I thought, oh, okay, how would it be if I read out Gnaneshwar or Tukaram or Arun Kolatkar or Dilip Chitre? And this man's poetry is third class compared to that. But one, I wouldn't be understood because the audience knows Hindi, doesn't know my language. So, the richness or greatness of a literary culture doesn't get transmitted across the country. And through translation, it's another language again. So, at the most people say, oh, wow, this kind of book was written in Marathi. But that language culture hasn't come through. And it's a tricky situation. And I think one that many languages in the world are facing. And Ganesh Devi has been working all his life to try and give them their own space in the total language thing of India. But no, it doesn't work. And I think to some extent, whereas our government, Maharashtra government, could have done a lot towards making Marathi popular, rather than saying, you know, change your signboards and put Marathi there. That's just showing your political power. But to make people love your language, and it's so possible to do, if you communicate it to others imaginatively. I remember in the Doordarshan days, old days, there was this very famous series based on the writings of a humorist, Marathi humorist, Chibi Joshi. And Dilip Prabhavkar and someone else played two characters. And the whole of Bombay was watching. And it was in Marathi. And it was getting across, and they were enjoying it. So, there are ways and means in which you can pass a language on. I think in Bengal, because people don't really speak too much Hindi or English, a lot of people who want to live there have to learn Bengali to some extent or the other. That hasn't happened here. So, I have written about P.K. Atre in my book on Shivaji Park. He was an educationist before he became a political activist. And he had taken his degree in education from London, came back and looking through the textbooks, the readers that were being used in Marathi schools, he was so depressed because, as he says, these selections are not going to create in the students the love for the language. Pride in language is a political thing. Love for the language is something else, that's cultural. And he therefore compiled books to be used at school. And there's two or three generations of people who even today talk about those books and what they meant to them in terms of coming close to their own language."

So it's deeply rich, it's rooted, it's grounded, but it can be insular because the world isn't flowing in. Like English is that sea into which everything else flows, you know, all languages will be translated into English, but not to each other and English may not necessarily be translated everywhere. So where does that knowledge, that outpouring of art, that vast ocean, can it flow into those? And an example of that, of course, is you wrote this great essay about, you know, the impact of a doll's house on Marathi theatre. Where you speak about, you know, Henry Gibson's great character Nora and the choices that she makes and did it influence Marathi theatre? And that's, of course, a whole different debate and argument you get into. But without getting into that argument necessarily, is that then a drawback that, you know, while if you are sitting in London and speaking in English, all the world's theatre and art is flooding into you. But if you are sitting, say, in Satara, you know, it's so limited, not any more so much by geography because we're all interconnected, but as much by language."

Well, about two months ago or three months ago, Lok Satta ran a series of articles of people looking back on 75 years of a particular art form and seeing where it has gone. And, of course, the visual arts have gone completely global while being rooted. Film has never had the kind of problem that word-oriented arts have. I was asked to write about the Marathi novel and this is precisely the conclusion that I came to because I was addressing this feeling of resentment that a lot of Marathi writers have that we are nowhere on the national scene, leave alone the international scene. So, what does it take to get there? And this is precisely it. Okay, let me explain this. The Marathi novel to begin with was confined to Pune and Mumbai. All the educated people lived here and they wrote novels and very middle class concerns. And then in the 60s or so, people who had roots in villages became the new literates and they began to write. And obviously, they wrote about their lives and what they wrote at that time made the urban elite sit up. Ah, this is happening, that is happening and that was great. Then the Dalits began to write and that was another little shock to the middle class urban elites. But then what happened is that that became a cause in itself because if you can get this kind of traction writing about your own lives, then you continue writing about them. And your experience of the world, if that also is limited to a small town or a second tier city, there again, you're not feeding on any kind of broader thinking or you are not seeing multiple viewpoints coming through about life itself, about the world itself. So, that becomes a huge drawback and so my argument was that the Marathi novel, if it doesn't break these boundaries in some way or the other, will stagnate because there's no push even to experiment with form because your experimentation is using your dialect. How long can that last as a form of experiment? And because we belong to a traditional society, society itself is not evolving. We still have certain mindsets and each feeds into the other and helps the other survive. So, it's a real trap and the effect on the Marathi writer then is we don't care. We are fine where we are. We are true to our soil. That is the phrase. And that soil, unfortunately, isn't getting fertilized by anything else. So, it's the same soil and you're true to it, fine, but you can't deny that that limits you. So, you can't and I also quoted from Salman Rushdie's introduction to his compilation, what was it called? Some Indian literature."

So, what comes through is not the best in a global context and that's what we are doing, trying to locate these in a global context. So, therefore, there were no Marathi stories in either of those collections as far as I remember. And that's also because my huge complaint is that because Marathi people have this very, very tough kind of dilemma about language. Pride in language, their language, means not giving or not putting any effort into learning the other language. And if that's where you are, then you're twice stuck. And when you go back to the 30s, people who went abroad, came back, wrote novels with that sort of worldview, which they had acquired, which wasn't westernised. They were writing about their soil, but that soil had been fertilised by other ideas. And so, those novels stand today, even today, as modern novels and nothing that has happened after the 60s has gone further. So, it is, it's a trap, it's a problem."

But I know that if I do, I will never have any readers. So what do I do? And I don't know what to answer him because it is a classic difficult trade off. And the purist in me says, be true to yourself and any story is universal and blah, blah, blah. But at the same time, if you want readers, you know, you also have to be practical.

And I think there is one fundamental way in which the world has changed for creators or is changing for creators. And I include writers, of course, in that. See, in the past, like 30 years ago, there are two things that writers, creators would have to contend with. That one, to be successful, you need scale. You know, 1% of artists are going to succeed. The rest are not going to make any money. So you need scale. You need to be in that bestseller list. Otherwise, you're not going to make it. And the other was that to have the privilege of creating itself often, of getting your work out there, you need to get past elite gatekeepers. So if you are not with the conventions of the time or in the right circle, it just becomes difficult for you. Today, I feel both of those are crumbling. In some cases have crumbled. In some cases are crumbling. Where one, you don't need to scale anymore. Like Kevin Kelly had this great essay 12 years back called The Thousand True Fans. And what he postulated there was that if you are a creator, if you can find a thousand fans who will pay you $100 a year, that's $100,000 a year. You don't need to scale. You need those thousand guys. In fact, another writer whose name I forget, but I'll link her essay from the show notes, wrote about how today a hundred true fans is enough,"

Yeah, I\u2026 See, there is also the other thing that a writer feels he is writing from the heart, that he is saying something that is true, is in good literature. Because I think readers do respond to something that is good. And to some extent, publishers in the languages do. Because publishing in Marathi, for instance, doesn't have the same costs as English language publishing. So, they're able to put out a huge variety of books. And if you're even halfway good, you find a publisher. So, I really don't know what this case is about, but this is something too. Because too many people think that they're writing about a good cause and therefore that work is good. It isn't."

Response one is that writing is probably the last of the creative arts in that sense for whom this can apply. It's much easier, say, on video if you're making TikToks or reels or if you're on YouTube, it's kind of much easier to break through that barrier. You know, that's one thing. And the other thing that I would say is that someone who has the urge to tell a story\u2026 Back in the day, we used to think in terms of forms and we would therefore put ourselves in a box. So, if you thought of yourself as a novelist, you would say, I'm a novelist too. And you would not, once you've put yourself in that box, you would not think of expressing yourself in other forms. And you are an outlier in that sense. Of course, you've done, you know, you've worked in so many different forms, but a lot of people will define themselves a particular way. And what I would urge my friend also to do is don't think of yourself only as a writer. Think of yourself as a storyteller and creator. And maybe other forms emerge where, you know, you could make YouTube documentaries or you could just do a vlog in your dialect and see if it picks up and if people care. And the third thing to contradict what I was saying earlier is that just because scale isn't necessary doesn't mean that it's not possible. Like my favorite living writer, of course, an English writer, but my favorite living writer is Alice Munro, who basically writes about one little district in Canada, right? That's it. And yet her stories touch hearts all over the world. Of course, she has the advantage of the English language, but my point is that your subject or your milieu is not a limitation."

You yourself, sitting where you are, if your idea of a story is limited by the definition in your mind of a story, then you can't break through. And certainly speaking for Marathi writers, there are a number of writers who are writing within the so-called conventional short story form. And then that plus your lack of exposure to other worlds and other world views, the two things combined make your story insular. Then you can't, like Alice Munro, be dead in Japan, for instance. You can't be. So, that also is a problem because it happens, for instance, in Marathi theatre because it's an industry. And industry means that the producer is taking a certain risk. And the producer has ideas of what the audience wants. So, he becomes what you said called a gatekeeper, your first gatekeeper. Director is your second gatekeeper. And you have to get through all that. The best way then is to write conventional stuff because the audience that is coming is not experimental. You need a reader or an audience who is willing to open up to experiment. If the audience comes with the idea that they have paid X amount of money to occupy this seat and therefore they demand entertainment and they do not want their ideas to be disturbed too much, then the writer, director, producer all together produce a product for this consumer and theatre remains where it is. Once in a while, and it has happened on the Marathi stage and so refreshingly, that people from outside the upper cast have broken in and they have brought with them their tradition of folk theatre and they have just let themselves go on stage. And when they have done that, with the conviction that they bring to their performance, the so-called conventional audience sits up and laughs and claps. So, where does that confidence come from? It comes from people saying to themselves, so you want to keep this to yourself, do you, this space? Sorry, we are coming in and that is with our own thing. But if you belong to the conventional playwright-producer kind of clique, then you limit yourself and nothing moves then. So, there have been some wonderful examples on the mainstream stage of experimentation in the face of ruling conventions."

One of the scenes that I remember is Draupadi saying, No, this time around I'm going to ask for a good saree. I'm not going to let Krishna wind me up in any old thing for Vastrarath. And she does it with such flair that only VHPs will find it difficult to laugh. But then again, with a play like Sakharam Baida, going back to the 70s, and all these people were on the streets asking for it to be banned and all the rest of it. It's a pretty conventional play. It breaks new ground because it brings onto the stage a protagonist who does not belong to the middle class. He's a bookbinder. And there is violence, there is sexual innuendo. All this is happening. So, of course, the middle class was up in arms and the director decided then to go to Baya Saheb Thackeray, that your people are protesting. You see the play and tell us what's wrong with it. And Baya Saheb enjoyed the play. And he told his boys, you know, don't be stupid. But he could do it. Tendulkar was very upset because taking the moral stand, he said, why do we have to go and plead with Thackeray? Let this stand or fall. But we are not going to plead. But the producer and director said, it's our life. And we have to allow this play to be staged. So, that happened. Now, Yadakadachit was followed much later by a wonderful play. It was called Shivaji Underground in Bhimnagar Mahal. The storyline is very simple. And that Shivaji has passed on, but he's left his turban behind on earth. Some emissary is sent to earth to find it. And how do you know it's Shivaji's turban? So, this is a running gag throughout, and this man keeps placing the turban on various heads who are claiming to be Shivaji's heirs, political heirs, and it doesn't fit any of them at all. So, none of these people have anything to do with Shivaji. Now, there are two parties here. One, Bhimnagar Mahal party, and the other is not named, but it is the Shiv Sena type party. And they're fighting over Shivaji and what he stood for. And the right-wing people are saying he was this, that, and the other. And these people challenge them because it is a musical. And they say, fine, our parties will sing. You tell us what Shivaji was. We'll tell you what Shivaji was, and let's see who wins. So, the right party is talking about in extremely vague and romantic terms about bravery and how the corn was always golden in Shivaji's times and all the rest of it. And with each verse also, the other party is talking about the concrete things that Shivaji did, his administration, his respect for women, his agrarian reforms, stuff like that, which is all part of history, which these people know nothing about. And ultimately, the right-wing party loses, and these people win. Now, in Maharashtra, to talk about Shivaji is a risky thing because you never know where you will put your foot down and will be seen as a wrong foot. So, Sambhaji Bhagat, who comes from our mill area, and he's a shahid and a rebel, he had his boys lined up outside the theater on the day of the premiere. That we are going to have people protesting, and they're going to come and bring the play down, which has been a tradition in Maharashtra. And here we are. Let's see what happens. And nothing happened. Nothing happened, because how could it? Because the Bhimnagar Mahala Party was actually saying much more in praise of Shivaji than the right-wing party. And it was an absolutely brilliant musical. And it came from outside, because the playwright Tangre doesn't belong to either Mumbai or Pune or Nagpur. He comes from Jalna, which is a pretty backward state, place, rather. And I'd like to tell you about how this man came into theater. He, as you know, there are no regular, there's no regular power supply for farmers in agricultural areas. And it's well known that they steal power from the connection. And there's a way in which they do it. They have a hook in Marathi, it's called akhada, and they kind of allow the power to be conducted through to whatever connection they have. Now, this fellow Tangre had written a play about this problem and entered it for the interstate drama competition. That's a big thing in Maharashtra. And one of our critics from Mumbai had gone as a jury member. And he loved this play, he thought this, Bob May has to see it. So he arranged for these people to be sponsored on the Mumbai stage, Shivaji Mandir, and they acted out in the dark. And they said to the audience first that you have never experienced what we go through. So please welcome to our experience. There will be no lights. And soon your eyes get used to seeing people in the dark. And then they talk about this, and ultimately one farmer dies. He's electrocuted. And this happens very often when they're stealing power. Later on, this actor, Nandu Madhav, who discovered this play, then went on to make a film on it. And that's how Tangre came onto the map, theatre map in Mumbai and Pune. And then he was asked to write this play about Shivaji underground, with Sambhaji collaborating with the music. And he's doing things now from some remote place in Jalna. He was able to break through because he had that, he had things to say. And he had a theatrical imagination in which to say it. So in a way, while the Marathi theatre is kind of height-bound, it is possible to break through. And when some such breakthrough happens, the audience is very responsive. So when mainstream producers decide that the audience will not like it or get it, they are wrong. If the play is good and done with conviction, it carries. So all these things have been happening, not on the so-called experimental stage, but on the mainstream stage. But no such thing is happening as much as it should in literature."

We were discussing in the break earlier and we were broadly in agreement that our hope lies in people from small towns, that people from small towns have so much hunger and imagination. And like Mr. Tangre, as you just mentioned, we'll see the world a little differently. You know, us elites in the big cities, we'll see the world in a particular way, possibly the same particular way. And a lot of the boxes that we think in simply don't exist if you're not from here. And that's one angle of it, that just being from a different location, different circumstances, can help you see differently and come up with new ways of expressing yourself. And also one fundamental way in which India has changed is that back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, perhaps up to the 90s, everybody knew everybody else. When it comes to the elites, you know, so one of the many episodes I've done with Ramchandra Guha, he talks about how, you know, he's in one of those elite colleges of Delhi in the 70s and all his classmates are so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so and it's basically anybody of that age who is from there. You are from that cluster of 3-4 colleges, you are from that cluster of a few schools, that's a Delhi milieu, Bombay will have its own thing, every place will have its own thing, all of the elites know each other and all of that. And today it's way more diffused and democratized and spread out, which is mind-blowing. It can be disorienting if you're part of the old elite and you're kind of, you know, functioning within that system. But I just love it because there are so many unexpected explosions happening from all over, which is why I love TikTok so much before it was banned because, you know,"

And again and again, one has discovered that you go to some remote place and someone comes up and says, oh, you know, I've just read so-and-so novel of yours or so-and-so something, and you're looking at the person and that person doesn't fit your idea of who your reader is. But then the questions are asked and you think, wow, this man has read it much more deeply than any of your friends back home. The other thing that, I have this wonderful friend, Atul Pethe, who is a director, theater director and social activist. And he has a huge network of connections in the remote areas, rural areas of Maharashtra, and he takes his plays out and then the local NGO or social organization will host the play and the locals will come and watch. And what he does, and the depressing thing, of course, is that we don't have, we don't believe in libraries as an institution. So what Atul has done is to carry a bag full of books wherever he goes. And with this hunger that people have, which is not satisfied locally, the books are gone. Within the blink of an eye, all the books have been taken. So we aren't providing. The hunger for books, for plays, for films is all there. But we have not bothered to take these things across. I've just been reading a very interesting book in Marathi written by a woman.

And obviously, these two boys are seeing some things which older people will sniff at. And they're seeing other things which are pretty worthwhile and thinking about it.

Like one of the things that struck a chord with me when you wrote about your school days is about how, you know, after price distribution days, you write, quote, it was gratifying to come home with books. Middlemarch, great expectations, far from the madding crowd, which opened up new worlds to me, stop quote. And I had, you know, before my father passed, I sat down, had long conversations with him about his childhood. And he would have been pretty much as old as you. And he spoke about the same thing. You know, he would always stop his class and he would always get books as a reward, you know. And eventually he read all the standard books and then he would go and exchange them for other books. And that tells me not that you won a lot of prizes or he was good at academics, but that tells me that there was a value given there"

And I remember that I kept going back to it again and again because I think they were all black and white. And something about those tonalities and the rhythms of the lines which the photographer had managed to capture without understanding what was fascinating me. I know I was fascinated. So my relationship with books began with this kind of very strong visual experience. And then definitely through all the books that I won at school, all of which I read, except I was very scared of Alice in Wonderland. I found it extremely disturbing. I didn't want her to fall through the rabbit hole because it was going into nowhere. And that was scary. And then to drink something which made you so tall and then to eat something that made you so short. So obviously, you know, this kind of magical thing scared me more than fascinated me. And I came to Alice in Wonderland much later when I was about 14 or 15 and then thoroughly enjoyed it, but not at a younger age. Dickens, of course, and it was wonderful to feel sorry for those poor boys. And I would weep copiously over Wordsworth's Lucy and Dickens's little poor boys, etc., etc. So it was also a sentimental journey. But on the other hand, I remember thinking, because this was a pre-independence day and the Brits were still around, and I thought, oh, they had poor people. Their people were in rags. So how do I kind of, you know, how does that tell you who they are now? And so I know that that consciousness of the history of peoples came to me with Dickens and his books. And then, of course, there was a wonderful holiday that we had in Pune. My father had dedicated it to reading"

So Shakespeare from then became an important part of my growing up and thinking about life. I think having been close to his work has shaped my thinking about people. And the kind of compassion that he has for people who are not necessarily virtuous was something which appealed to me hugely. Yeah, so there was a point, I think, I remember my mother saying she used to come and on Saturdays, Sundays when I was head down in books and she would call me for lunch and I'd say, coming, and she'd call and I'd say, coming, and then she'd finally come and kind of drag me up physically and she'd say, okay, for as long as you are with me and I'm with you, I will do this. But I worry for you because no one else is going to get after you if you have your food and you're going to starve. No use feeding your mind with these books if you can't feed your body with food. So she used to be pretty upset with me. Earlier we were talking about growing up in a certain kind of environment and being shaped by it. But now when I'm speaking about this, I realize that we probably get shaped in different ways. Because my sister couldn't bear to read a book. She was an outdoor person and she was just waiting to get out and start playing with her friends while I was with my books. And what did that mean? My father used to, even in England, say, get after your sister, get her to read. And I know that I wrote back and said, yes, yes, she's reading. But she wasn't. She would read one book and think that was enough. And much later I thought, why? Why should she read if she doesn't feel like reading? She wants to do other things. So what is this kind of snobbery that we think only someone who reads is worth something and others are not? And I think my sister grew up with something of a complex about this. Because we had a huge showdown after attending a wedding and one of my father's colleagues was present and he kind of said hi to her and he turned to me and said so happy that you're carrying all your father's intellectual legacy. And she stared daggers at me."

For our listeners, we are recording this over two days so we'll now take a break, have dinner and tomorrow Shanta will come back again. But a question before we go in there is that these days people keep raving about the great job that AI is doing and I am frankly blown away by it. You know, GPT-3 is the tip of the iceberg I think for people to judge AI based on the pros turned out by GPT-3 is like people judging computing based on the earliest mainframe of 2MB, right? I think the future is limitless and some people worry that at some point that inevitable moment comes where AI is creating art better than humans can and what happens to us artists then? And frankly, I am not so worried about that because my sense is that for an artist, the joy will come from doing the art and of course you will have people who will appreciate it and 1000 true fans and all of that who will want that authentic human experience behind it also but the joy will come from the doing of it and it seems unrelated but the reason I thought of it is you spoke of how your sister loved to run but you know, your parents couldn't get her that training and maybe in India that training just wasn't there in those days, I mean you know, we can get you books if you like to read but if you have the outdoors not too bad, what do you do? But, you know, in all of these fields, I feel that you know, whether you are a creator, whether you are a sports person, you know, on the one hand, there is a desire to do what you want to do for the love of it and to excel in it for that alone and on the other hand, there is a validation that you crave, so an artist may crave applause or a sports person may crave competition to beat people and to get a medal and in a sense, these are two separate things that can often play off against each other and you know, I am not making a judgment either way, obviously, I would love to be good at something and also be acclaimed for it because why not, but at the same"

No, no, that's true, even forget about AI even by yourself your writing and if you are at least a little self-critical you do say to yourself, yeah, this was fun writing but this is where it remains and it goes into your bottom drawer you don't always write to publish I have written a lot without publishing and that's because of the joy of creation that you speak of and publishing may or may not bring the applause, you are not looking for that either because then it comes to calculating how that applause will come, you are still writing for yourself, if the applause comes, well and good you enjoy it so yes, there are two things but I think they are a continuum because if you are writing for yourself it means that writing is a thing of joy and that allows you to put joy in the writing that you do for publishing and that's an important quality of that writing also, so the one feeds into the other, I don't think they are two separate things unless there are artists who crave for awards, but craving is fine, you can't write for an award award is a chancy thing, ultimately there are five people in the running and only one can be chosen so you take your chance there, nothing can, in art you can't or you shouldn't calculate it destroys the joy and the joy I think is the important thing at least it is for me and when I read books where I sense the joy of writing I respond to it very, very strongly because that makes that book more meaningful along with whatever else it is doing in terms of theme, subject, characterization but it's alive for me then so, yeah musicians I mean, I think, look, if you have a voice and you've trained for years that why isn't it an end in itself I remember a time when I had gone to Gwalior for a they have one annually and it's an all night thing and on the second day morning we were walking around a park and there was a temple there and from far away we heard a voice singing, it was an early morning raga and we thought what and where and we followed the voice and there was this man he had a briefcase next to him, so obviously from here he would go on to his job, which could be as dull as a clerical job, but here he sat in this shrine facing that god and singing singing divinely now the environment, the situation, all of it added to the effect of this music on us, perhaps if you put him on a stage in an enclosed auditorium, he would have been one of the many singers but here he was extraordinary because he was doing it for something inside himself"

I, yeah I don't remember feeling those anxieties I don't really know, perhaps it was a kind of confidence that I had acquired growing up in Mumbai and already knowing that I didn't quite fit but enjoying the non-fitting part and finding that there were things that I gained out of not fitting so that was already my Mumbai experience for instance, I grew up listening to and enjoying Raga music because my father would take me to concerts and I had grown to love it. In my school in Mumbai, already I couldn't share this with any of my friends they were all into Hindi film music which also I enjoyed so I could share that but this part I couldn't share with them as you said yesterday, a lot of people weren't reading so that part of my life I couldn't share with even the closest friends so I was already in a sense a misfit and I had grown used to it also I must mention that both I and my sister were dark skinned and that gives you a lot of grief in our country but with my parents and I don't know I think I've quoted it somewhere but my father said Tanvi Shama that famous verse from Meghdoot he would quote that and say well that was our idea of beauty of a dusky skin and that's what you have and he said you're going to have men line up at the door asking for your hand not that that thought ever entered our minds at that age but so we were given that sort of confidence and in London because one had heard about the colour bar so much from everybody who had been there I was prepared for it and the experience came when we were hunting for a flat because I would call up see an ad, find that it seemed to be right for us, call up and we'd be invited to see the flat and the minute they saw our brown faces they'd say oh sorry dear it's just gone and not being a fool I knew what that was so then this flat that we went finally rented in Shepherds Bush and I announced myself first I said we are interested in the flat that you've advertised but we are Indians and the voice at the other end said so what dear just come over and it was so lovely to hear that voice and she wasn't British she was South African but white South African and we came to this house where our upstairs neighbours were from New Zealand and there was another neighbour from the Caribbeans so we realised that there are those people also where colour doesn't matter and then going to not to a state school but to a public girls school where everyone is well brought up and have thought about race and stuff like that so I was at school never ever made to feel that I was a wrong colour and as I have said I visited my friends in their homes and I was always welcomed and so yeah Colour Bar was there but I was in a place where"

Okay you spoke of gender and things like that but I would say coming to grips with reality let me put it that way and the first reality that I was forced to come to grips with was of caste and this happened on the street where all of us would come down to play wonderful street games and they've been lost now but that's okay they have video games to supplant those but it was a time when Shivaji Park, the neighbourhood where I live was becoming the stronghold of the middle and lower middle class and these were people who were getting urbanised and they still had their roots in villages and places, small towns perhaps and there was a strong caste instinct and the funny thing is that whereas elsewhere later I found that people could mention caste in your face here I think everyone was aware that it was a mixed neighbourhood we had not only caste different castes living there, we had people from different Indian regions we had Punjabis we had Malabaris as they were called from South Kerala we had Gujaratis of course and Tamil people all in one gully so to say and we all came down to play together but the first time caste sort of came out was when either I or my sister did something which didn't get the approval of two other girls in the group and one of those girls said you know in Marathi Bhaturdi Ti Bhaturdi Bhaturdi is a very rude way of referring to Brahmins and a Brahmin will always be a Brahmin is what she was saying and then when we went up I knew it was something rude but I didn't know exactly what it was so I asked my mother and she was rather sorry that she had to explain this to me and so she told me what it meant and I had got the tone right, it was rude so then I kind of probed her further and asked her what all this caste is and later at school of course we learnt about the four the Varna system but that was the time when she said caste is important in Hindu society and that is why your grandfather was ostracized that is why the Dhanu people the Brahmins did not socialize with us as much as they would with each other so then that was a kind of punch in the stomach and I had to deal with living with this enforced superiority I was playing with everyone from all classes and castes and I really didn't want to feel superior and so I think all of us have had to deal with our caste whatever it might be if you don't believe in it if you believe in it, that's fine because then you're with everyone else so this was an eye opener to me and we spoke about how my father you read out in fact how he told me education is what he would give us and marriage we had to look after for ourselves find your mate he had said and I had a very close friend who had fallen in love now of course it was 15, 16 year old love and possibly wouldn't have lasted but her parents were horrified when they heard about it and of course the local gossip was quick to pass on this bit of news to them and then they got going quickly looking for bridegroom for her etc and meanwhile keeping a watch on her movements and I was away in England when she got married and this is what I heard from my mother from her letters that this had been happening to my friend and I thought how strange it was because we had not only grown up together we had gone to the same school and it was a co-ed school an English medium school plus we had played badminton together and that's where she had met this young man so all these things were like modern life she wore shorts pleated shorts but shorts all the same and then what was this I couldn't understand and by then I was sure that I did not want to ask my friend why she was doing this by then I had understood reality enough to know that what my parents thought was not what other parents thought and ultimately my dear friend's life was in that sense going to be different from mine so that was one more eye opener to me but about myself we spoke of atheism that became strong while I was at university through attempts to convert me and bring into the fold so to say so when you are opposed I think your ideas crystallize and become firm and you know why so that was an important part and then of course because I got to know this Norwegian young man lovely person and with whom I fell in love and we had a lovely relationship for three years we travelled together quite"

Knowing how vigorously the girls families would oppose such goings on, she opened her house to the wooers in the wood. If the badminton club secretary was inviting players over for tea, which family would object? Two such romances were flowering nicely under Queen G's patronage when a rival gossip spoiled the fun. She reported Queen G's activities to the mothers of the two girls the girls memberships of the badminton club was summer-er really, my pronunciations are terrible summerily terminated within a year, both were married off to suitable boys, that is young men who had settled in America in lucrative jobs the local boys whom the girls had unhappily dumped, spend their lives in Shivaji Park married to suitable girls that is girls who had never stepped on a badminton court, but who cooked and cleaned for them and gave them two children a piece thus all four couples lived happily ever after. And you know, one of the interesting parts of the book for me, which sort of fascinated me and I'm going to double click on is your friendship with Otto, right? In the sense that when I was in college in the 80s and early 90s our conception of romance was such that I assumed that if I have a girlfriend, you know, I will marry her and all the rest of that that is just the conception that you were kind of brought up with and it was sort of popular culture enforced that and even if Bollywood did show creepy men doing a lot of stalking eventually they would get married and have honourable lives and all of that. So in the 50s, I find it so bold that one, you are kind of independently thinking of, you know, independently getting into a relationship with a white man and so on and so forth and also, you know, I mentioned your clarity of thought earlier and the part where I was really sort of struck by it is when you, you know, write about the end of the relationship and again, I'll quote your words quote, Otto's love for me was total mine for him, when it came to the crunch, was wanting. When we said our last goodbyes in July 1962 after my graduation, he proposed I said it would not work. I wanted to live and work in my country. He offered to divide his time between Norway and India. He even made two trips to Bombay to see how he could work it out. It could not be and I was not willing to compromise. In the end, our long and lovely relationship ended in mutual pain. I knew I had hurt him badly but I also knew I would have hurt him worse had I married him. Stop quote. And this kind of clarity is mind blowing to me because I don't just look at myself and see this completely missing when I was young but I see this missing in all young people in general you know, it takes a... So tell me a little bit about how you kind of came to this clarity, like what were your conceptions of love and marriage and men and all of those things because I imagine that in those times, any girl who is getting into a relationship with a man, there are so many thoughts that can come in the way of is it a moral thing to do, am I a bad girl, you know, and now that I'm with him, you know, I should settle down, you start fantasizing and daydreaming about a life together and all of that but you are so incredibly clear on that at least but you know, that's what it seems from your memoir"

I was a completely liberated person. Secondly, my reading, it comes back to that, that I had read enough to understand men, to understand women, to know what each wanted and the nuances of their wanting, the nuances of various kinds of relationships. It was never a woman in general and a man in general. If you got to know somebody, you also got to know the core of their aspirations and with Otto, I hadn't really found that core of his aspirations. He was training to be a dentist, he was a wonderful dentist, but in all our meeting with friends, being at parties, doing things together, I hadn't really found exactly who he was. He was a wonderful person, wonderful company. He didn't have fusty ideas about what women should or should not do. When I visited his place and I spent about a fortnight there, which was a great time I had, he took me to his various aunts and uncles and I was welcomed there. I realized that unlike here, where you can't introduce a non- Brahmin to your Brahmin family, leave alone another race altogether, I realized that here was certainly freedom enough for me to have pursued"

Rest of the time you do your thing, I'll do my thing. My father meanwhile, after I had come back, had said to me, why do you want to marry at all? He said, we are going to move to Taregaon where he was building his retirement home and come and stay with us. Pune University is a wonderful place. Teach there, read, write. So that was an alternative life that was being offered to me. So I knew that anything that I had to do had to be done here. It was also this feeling of nationalism.

But love for country in the sense because of my father and my mother, I had grown up being aware that this nation had to be built. That we were starting off on our own from scratch and whatever we did would add to the growth of the nation. This was, I think, a very, very strong feeling and it's amusing that Girish Karnad says something like that in his memoir and he always told us this anecdote as well that when he and Mohan Rakesh were in Kolkata for a theatre festival and some outdated kind of musical play was being presented and both of them were laughing and then Mohan Rakesh turned to Girish and said, Do you know why we are laughing? Do you recognize this laughter? And said, we are laughing because we think we are the future of Indian theatre. We are going to make Indian theatre. Now no artist after that has felt that kind of claim on the future of the country but we grew up feeling that we had a contribution to make and that contribution was important, it was necessary and it would add value. So it's a generational thing because Girish and Mohan were also talking in the 60s, that's when I came back home. So as I said, when I say my love was wanting, yes, because there was rival love which was holding me back and recently I met an old colleague of mine from the Times who has married a Norwegian and she had to be in conversation with me during the Delhi Lit Fest precisely about this memoir and she said to me before, why did you give him up? I married mine. But then I said, you did it 30 years after I gave him up. We live in"

What I'm struck by about this is the clarity with which you were looking at Otto was perhaps more than the clarity with which he would have looked at himself and I sometimes think that among the layers that I mentioned earlier, one layer that men which is unseen for men and which eventually perhaps some of them learn is that extra layer of awareness which women carry around with them. For example, I can go out on the street for a walk at midnight or I can enter a lift without having to look around and see who the others are and women always have that extra layer of awareness and there is, it seems to me in man-woman relationships, this layer of awareness and interpersonal relationships as well. For example, in different parts of your writings, your autobiography and other writings, there are different aspects of men which are coming out which might perhaps be invisible to them. For example, one, there are the uncontrollable appetites of men. Like you speak about your domestic servant Sathe and the things he got up to or the sadhu who flashed you and so on and so forth and these are appetites which tragically men can often be prisoners to and can be in denial of and refuse to face up to but a woman from the outside can be aware of them and can take that into consideration while doing whatever she does. Second, there is also male ego. You know, there's a moving passage in your book about how at 13 you had a growth spurt and you were taller than most of the boys and to compensate for being taller for them, you took to stooping and your father would tell you to mind your hunch and this is another kind of accommodation which you see women making to the male ego. I mean that famous scene of Satyajit Rai's Aranya Din Rathri where they are playing the memory"

I never ever said to him I think this is what you are doing and it would have been perfect if I had been able to say, look I do not believe university is the only source of education. He was a voracious reader and so on that I thought was the biggest education anyone can have to be reading and then I did something which I laugh at when I look back at it. I was doing my MA because I wanted to continue teaching and I needed an MA to be able to do that so I said to my class friends I had a group of about 5 friends I said you know come over because this thing that we are discussing right now, talk to Viju about it. He has lots to say. So 5 MA students landed up at our place and you know there was a discussion and in my naivety I thought that I had sorted out the problem but it doesn't get sorted out that way because these complexes and these ego things go very very deep and I had exactly the same problem in my second marriage where my husband came from a Marathi medium school and as a matter of fact he is a citizen of the world you don't remain where you are he has grown way ahead of where he was but he still carried that little thing in him of Marathi and English and I often say to him you know I speak a lot more Marathi than you do you speak English all the time, very often with Marathi people have you noticed? So I said let's forget these language differences, both of us read and write in both languages so let's let it lie but he couldn't do that so much taunting went on and ultimately it stopped it had to stop after I wrote Rita Bellinger and it was in Marathi and it was read by Marathi readers and appreciated and after this he could hardly think of me as an Anglophile and whatever else he thought but it was it was ego we're constantly in competition I didn't see any competition I was happy to grow and I grew in various ways both with my first husband and my second husband but they wanted to be themselves just that so sad"

them but living together always is something else and you don't know how it's going to affect you now point is that you go into marriage with a very conventional idea of marriage that this is forever my mother had said so we didn't per se leave divorce out of our thinking it wasn't there in the forefront but if we felt or if I felt that I was frustrated that I wasn't able to put my skills, my knowledge to use and that was important that I had to be a useful human being this was basic with me and while I was having children and I love children, I wanted to I did so it was for me that I had children and it was wonderful bringing them up, spending time with them but beyond a certain point they also had their own activities their own friends and I was free to be myself also that other me and while I was translating and writing and all that went on I was very keen on teaching for me my first experience at Elphinstone College was decisive this is what I want to do, I was very clear about that and so I went around first in Vishakhapatnam later when we were transferred to Hyderabad to the University of Foreign Languages and talked to people and ultimately one Dean told me we are not even looking at your qualifications you don't belong to Andhra and there was trouble enough in Andhra at the time and we will not even consider your application so now I couldn't use my skills I couldn't take part in what I had considered was my vocation and that was a shock I had thought that wherever I went in this peripatetic life of a naval wife I would always be able to get even a temporary job in some college, university if that wasn't happening then something very important in me and for me was being taken away and when that happened then of course there was the scales and a weighing up of things this is important that is important and in my nine years of marriage I hadn't felt at all that my being with Viju was in any way, suppose it wasn't helping me was it helping him was I helping him to build up a career and Viju wasn't interested in a career at all he had told me before we married that I'm going to be stuck in this lieutenant commander rank, how do you feel about it, I was equally I couldn't care less about ranks etc. so then what was I doing and he didn't want children I wanted children so that was part of my side of the balance and then I thought no, this can't go on but I didn't really take that decision immediately I had begun to feel that way but I had to find a way where the children would you know would not get neglected and this friend of mine that I've been talking about who was finally married off to some other chap, very fine person by the way, anyway so her aunt and uncle ran a school in Ooty and her aunt was very fond of me and she had kept urging me to go and teach there and I thought that could be a wonderful way out I didn't necessarily want to divorce Viju but if I was separating and taking the children with me then that would be a place where I could teach and they could study but even while I was considering that and I think I had written a letter to the aunt meanwhile my mother who had spent time with us and seen my life and I think yesterday you read out that little bit about her saying this is not why we sent you to England and she then wrote to me and enclosed a little notice which advertised for a lecturer's post at HR College Mumbai and she said just come and I came and I got that job and from there of course there was I had to finally give up teaching with much regret but the system had changed and I didn't have a place in that system and so on and so forth but I had still only separated I wasn't going to divorce at all, that wasn't my aim but then Arun came into my life and you asked about how I could knowing full well what he was like, why did I marry him and perhaps you know I've been asked this question so often and there were two things one was I was not at Bristol University where I could go around freely with auto and then decide no I can't marry you in Shivaji Park living with my mother who went to a place called Vanita Samaj every Friday where women had many things to say about everything that was happening and I was being seen around with Arun I didn't feel the freedom I had earlier felt to say no I know this isn't going to work and no let's just keep it where it is, I didn't have that, I didn't feel free I wasn't strong enough to do that so in a way circumstances did push me into this marriage because I had gone so far into a relationship the other thing and that perhaps wasn't a thing that I was conscious of at the time but I think it entered as a compensation for having made a wrong choice and that compensation was huge because I got into film making I understood what cinema was about because Arun was passionate about cinema and of course he is such a fine mind his vision his sensitivity to sound to everything that actually makes up a film and I got all of that, I got to sit in on the edits of films I got into serious script writing, I had done two or three scripts before for documentaries but this was something else it was another kind of documentary and that opened another door to me, so when people ask me now how do you not regret that choice and I say because I got a lot out of it and I know it was quite awful for the children but I think I compensated for that to some extent at least and took the pain of it away as much as I could but yes, that is the reason why I don't regret the first marriage because I got to know what the Navy was about I saw the gender discrimination where men and women when they were out together never spoke to each other, if the men spoke to the women they suddenly changed their tone of voice and said so I believe the tomatoes are now very cheap in the market my wife has been making ketchup and I would have to say I'm sorry I'm not into ketchup making I'd rather be talking about what you people are talking about but it's a very gendered society if you go to the Naval Hospital for instance you can't say you're Shanta Gokhale you are wife of Lieutenant Commander Vijay Kumar Shahani it's like that so I was quite amused by it, I thought okay the whole world is like this and so are you so again I learnt a lot about the Navy, about the forces in general the kind of lives they lead I made a lot of excellent friends I had a huge argument with a batch mate of VJs who said why you want to do MA? and I thought it was such a radical question to ask me and being puzzled I asked him a couple of counter questions and I realised where he was coming from and I didn't feel that I could explain anything at all to him I was looking at Viju hoping he would step in and say something to divert the conversation he was sitting cool and not really even engaged with what was going on so then finally I said look all of us have to do something and I can't just sit around doing nothing, that's why I'm doing MA and I removed the sting from this kind of female aspiration to which I had no right at all I removed the sting by saying you know also what kind of a housewife I am so I have to do something and I'm doing MA and that seemed to satisfy his male ego and we became good friends afterwards also"

I loved the freedom the form gave me and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways I exercised my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things Well that phase in my life ended for various reasons and now it is time to revive it only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiauncut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else So please do head on over to indiauncut.substack.com and subscribe.

So tell me a little bit about that phase of your life and just elaborate a bit on what teaching does because a little bit of teaching that I've done, which is the online writing course that I teach and all that, I feel it's changed me in some ways because whenever you teach something, you are firstly you are forced to know your subject so much better and drill into it because if you're teaching something you really have to know what you're talking about and secondly I just feel that in some ways it makes you a better person also because you can't be judgmental of anyone, you have to be understanding of where everyone is coming from and cater to that as well.

But strangely, there are things about yourself that you can't quite understand because you think this is you, but then you're doing something which doesn't fit in with what you think you are. And I've spent a lifetime saying, I'm shy, I'm shy, I'm shy. But when this telephone call came, this was a friend of my father's who was teaching at Elphinstone and I had just come back and he called to say, you know, there's a temporary vacancy here in the English department and you think Shanta would like to step in. So, my father said, talk to her. So, he put me on the phone and I don't think I thought twice before I said yes. So, looking back, I couldn't quite put that together with my so-called shyness. Maybe what was important at the time was to find work, to start earning. And I had a few friends in the advertising industry and I knew there were openings there and I could have stepped in and started making a fair amount of money, but that didn't fit. You know, I couldn't think that I could lend my writing skill to selling face creams or toothpaste, soaps, whatever. I had nothing to say about them. So, I had rejected the one or two kind of, not offers, but soundings out that had been made. And with a degree in English, what else could be done? So, perhaps somewhere at the bottom, this thought also played out. Does work with a monthly salary? So, I'm going to say yes. And he was very happy that he'd found someone for the vacancy. And my first class was what was known as compulsory English, which meant everyone in a certain year had to attend that class. And so, it was one of the big classes and my father's friend knew what that meant. So, yeah, I found that as soon as I stepped onto the desk and I had read what I had to teach beforehand and I had things to say and I said them and I found that the students were fairly attentive. So, when you get that kind of vibe from students, you put that much extra into what you're saying. So, I felt that a contact had been made and I felt that I was capable of making such a contact and that I was actually enjoying myself. I was enjoying this process. But there was something mysterious happening at the same time that this friend of my father's, I called him Raja Kaka. He was Raja Dheksha, Niranjan Raja Dheksha's father."

So, he wasn't going to attend a lecture, but he was walking down. And then Miss Humayun Shroff, who was head of the English department, I found her walking down and back. And so, that's how, I mean, that registered with me. And later, Raja Kaka said, oh, you were fine. I said, yes, I was. And he said, yeah, I was a little worried about so-and-so. So, that so-and-so was some Ruia, I forget what his first name was. And he was a bad bencher and supposedly disruptive. But he hadn't disrupted my lecture. And this is what Raja Kaka and Humayun Shroff were walking up and down to check on. Because apparently, if he was causing trouble, they would have taken care of him on my behalf. That didn't happen. But another time, Kumar Shani told me this much later. He said, we were thrilled that a young unattached woman had come to teach and we were very keen to be there, you know. And so, they decided to attend one of my classes where they didn't belong. And Miss Shroff relayed them, where are you going? And they said, oh, oh, oh, to this class. She said, no, go back to your class. You don't belong here. So, he said, all our plans fell through because we were going to play an old trick on you. They used to have specially made spectacles with no lenses. And when the teacher looked at them, they would put their hand through the frame and scratch their eyes and expected the teacher to be taken aback. And this didn't happen. So, it was very disappointing. But I realized then in my very first year that I was being taken care of. And perhaps that made life easy for me in that first year. And then, of course, I fell into it. And I was kind of disappointed to see that the senior lecturers were all using old notes. They would walk into the class with a fat book of notes, which they had made over the years. And I guess they added some fresh things for each class. But I realized that is also what teaching can turn into. That you're teaching the same book year in and year out. So, what do you do? How much new can be said about any book, however great it may be? So, it was a kind of tiny warning at the back of my head that if you don't want to be doing this, you have to find ways out for yourself. But teaching itself, therefore, became the goal of my life.

And, you know, if you're a teacher, just, you know, you have a syllabus, you have the book, you just teach from it, you're saying the same things year after year, you just go through it. And that's a danger. And the other danger, I think, is that comes with the human relationships that at first, on your first day, you know, everyone's new to you, and you're kind of, you know, alert of the connections that you're making. But after a while, you know, the danger is that it can just be you see your faces, and you don't really care. And you go through the motions, and they go through the motions. And that's what there is. And you said you figured out ways of avoiding these traps. So, can you elaborate a bit?"

        "message": "Yeah. See, I had two years at Elphinstone. And after a gap of nine years, I had about two or three years at HR. So, I hadn't put myself through that kind of test at all. Elphinstone was one kind of student, HR college was another kind of student. But what I did find at HR was being involved with extracurricular activities, which prevented you from thinking of any set of students as a sea of faces. Because when you were working with them on the college magazine, or on the college day programs, each one of them became an individual. And each individual belonged to a group which wasn't participating, but was their friend's group. So, you got to know people better out of the classroom than in. And that carried into the classroom as well. Because I think meeting them outside in cultural programs made them feel that they could be equally open with me in the classroom. So, then questions came. Normally, they didn't ask questions. But when questions are asked, then it takes you away from the text proper. And each time with each class, the questions can be different. So, I found that to encourage questioning was a good way to not fall into this trap of stagnating and using the same notes throughout your life. And I think those students, even at HR, people did ask me, you know, what are you doing at a commerce college? But teaching is teaching. Teaching is really making connections. And so, the strong human feeling exists between teacher and student, if the teacher is so inclined. Students are open to that kind of relationship. And unlike my experience at Elphinstone with the compulsory English class, the first compulsory class that I took at HR was definitely a different kind of experience. Because the backbenchers decided to moo like cattle. And I ignored it the first time around. But I was teaching of all books, a passage to India. And I was partly sympathetic to people who wanted to moo because, you know, it's a difficult book to like and to engage with. So, ultimately, I just closed my book and I said, look, I'm here as a teacher. I would like to share thoughts with you. But if you aren't interested, then I would prefer you not to come to class. And for today, that entire corner from which I heard cattle mooing, must leave class. I will give you your attendance because that's what matters to you. That's why you're here in the first place. So, I'll mark all of you present. Then please leave. And there was much protest, but not too loud. And I think they were quite happy to leave. Their attendance was taken. So, that was it. And ultimately, this class, this compulsory class was reduced to about 25 students from about 100. And I would take the attendance at the beginning and then wait for two minutes while the class emptied out. And then I had wonderful lectures with the remaining 25 because they were there because they were interested. They had questions to ask. So,"

When we begin to think of ourselves as writers, maybe there's another layer when we notice aspects of the craft.

And it was two years. So, there was no question of repeatedly reading and rethinking and rediscovering. Then HR college, I didn't have to teach literature. A lot of it was communication skills, etc. And this was one text which I had to teach, but it was to this huge class. But even with that, I went back to it every year, because it has a mystery at its centre. And it was a mystery that bothered the students, because their question was, and I think it is a question that the normal reader asks that, you know, one of the protagonists goes into this mysterious cave, and something happens in that cave, and she comes back and accuses one of the other characters of having molested her. But it is never proved. So, the question what exactly happened in that cave is right there, unanswered. And the students always said, surely, ma'am, surely, ma'am, the writer has to know the answer. Otherwise, why is he writing this novel? And the only answer I could give, which was what I thought it was, wasn't going to and never did satisfy them, which was that there are certain mysteries in life and ambiguities, for which there are no clear answers. And it is for us to think about it. And finally, does it matter? Suppose I say to you now that I happen to have read what this author says about that mystery, and Aziz did not molest this woman. I say to you, then what do you do with it? What follows would follow in any case, because as I have explained to you, it has to do with the ruling race and the subject race, and to what extent the rulers are willing to believe their own against people who are not their own. And that is the crux. So, what difference would it make if I solve that little puzzle for you? And they said, no, ma'am, but you know, when you're reading, you need to have these answers. Fair enough, but we left it at that. So, as I said, I didn't teach literature. So, there was no question of reading or re-reading for my teaching as such. But I have always done it for myself. I have, in fact, during the pandemic, I decided that since I have this kind of free time, which has come to me after several years, let me start re-reading. So, I went back to the classics. I read Middlemarch. I read Anna Karenina. I read Far From the Madding Crowd. I read Tacre's Vanity Fair. I read, re-read, Alice in Wonderland. And I didn't read Ulysses because Ulysses had been, in any case, a difficult book to read when I first read it. And I would like to. I would like to because it's a challenging book for a writer. How do you spin out a day and still engage the reader's attention? So, I'll soon do that, but I need a stretch of time for that."

So, here's sort of a question thinking aloud that, you know, you speak about re-reading these classics, Middlemarch, Far From the Madding Crowd, all of those. How did you feel reading them? Because, you know, there's on the one hand, there are people like Calvino who wrote an essay, I think, with the title, Why Read the Classics, who feel that we must engage with the classics and read them over and over again. But another way of looking at it is that, you know, the majority of literate people to ever have lived are probably alive today. And the sample size in terms of just the amount of literary work that is coming out is far greater today than it has ever been. And therefore, just applying a statistical lens to it, you should say that we should expect more great work to emerge from the current moment than necessarily from the past. And people could say that perhaps we romanticize the past when we place it on a pedestal, or perhaps these works are valuable as to understand the history of how our literature evolved, but not much more than that on its own terms. And I'm just thinking aloud, so I don't have a position on this. I think there is some truth perhaps to both of these. But, you know, since you've just re-read the classics, I'm wondering if you would have some insights to share."

        "message": "Well, I can only speak for myself. And since I am two things, a serious student of literature and a writer, I go back to books with a different kind of view. What do I want? And I do know that anybody who reads a book for the first time and once misses a lot of what the author has put in. On an absolute superficial level, there is a story, there are characters, there's a plot, and that engages the first time reader. Now, it is only a writer or a student of literature who will then want to go back and sort out where all the things that have impacted her as a reader come from. What has the writer done? Then there is a whole question of the language. How is the language being used? So, that is the most conscious part of what a writer does. And you discover little things that the writer has done and you realize that had this word been replaced by a similar word, it would have had a different effect. So, when you are writing, you become more conscious and more careful about using precisely the word for what you are trying to say, the feeling you are trying to express. But all this, as I said, belongs to this kind of person who is a student and a writer. But recently, I have come across, I think it was after I read Anna Karenina again, I think for about the fourth time. And I was full of my ideas of how it had been the first time and the second time and the third time. And I was keen to hear what other lovers of Anna Karenina felt about it. And I am amazed at the number of people who are attached to this book and young people, young people who have their own channels and talking books and they are talking Anna Karenina quite often. And they are addressing their viewers who apparently are asking questions, so they too are reading. So, there is a large world of people who are reading the classics. We do not know them, but they are there, I think, and not necessarily belonging to the group that I spoke of, of students and writers, just people who are interested in books and in reading and discovering other worlds, worlds from the past, worlds from other spaces, all of that, I think. But funnily enough, I was interviewed by someone after my translation of Smriti Chitre came out. And it was a very strange question. He said, at a time when nobody is reading the classics, why have you translated Smriti Chitre? So, there were two implications. A, that Smriti Chitre was old hat, and B, that people weren't reading the classics. And first of all, I said, look, this is a translation. And as a translation of an old classic, there's a whole new readership that it will have, probably in universities, in women's departments, etc., etc. And I had already by then received a couple of emails, one from Scotland, one from America, with questions about Smriti Chitre. So, I said a translation isn't for the local reader. And secondly, I don't know why you assume that people aren't reading. You don't know the entire world of readers. Neither do I. But from my experience, unexpected people are reading unexpected books. So, I don't go with your premise at all that people are not reading. And if you're saying young people, then again, I don't know. We have a very glib way of saying young people. I said, we were young, and none of my classmates had read Smriti Chitre even back then. And I had. So, there are young people and young people in every generation. Anyhow, that was my answer to him. But about a week or so later, I got a call from a friend who said that her nephews and her own grandson were so excited that there was now a translation of Smriti Chitre, because apparently it was a set text for them at school. Some, I think, Jamnalal Bajaj, for people who had opted for Marathi, were asked to read Smriti Chitre. So, that's an answer to that. But there was another question that you asked. You asked whether classics were classics because we romanticized them. Partly the answer is in the answer that I've just given, that lots of people are still reading it. But some time ago, I decided to go through the books that I had inherited from my father and reading the blurbs on the jackets. And many of those books were called Book of the Century or Book of the Decade or whatever it was. And people were not reading it anymore. Therefore, it hadn't become a classic. So, what makes a classic? I think because a book has a continuous readership down the ages. Therefore, we call it a classic, not because we think it is old and therefore, there are so many novels written around the time that Tolstoy was writing. They are not classics. So, it is, these are very, very special books. So, if you take the trouble of reading them, then sitting here today, you recognize them as classics for the quality of the writing, quality of the thought, the expansiveness of the theme,"

And, you know, when people, like one of the habits that irritates me is when people who can't do something themselves or don't do something themselves, they extrapolate that preference to everybody else.

And therefore, they imagine that everybody else must find classics boring that, you know, I don't listen to long podcasts, or I don't read 100 books a year, or I don't listen at higher speeds. So, everybody else who is doing something wrong, they are skimming or they're pretending.

And there are certain cults, I have read books and I haven't enjoyed them. For me, because I do so much serious reading, and I need to be engaged by a mystery, straightforward. I want a dead body within the first chapter. Maybe in your drawer, like that lady requested. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Something straight out. Agatha Christie gives you that, and there are a whole lot of other writers who give you that. So, the question is set up, then follow all the clues. And it helps your mind in a different kind of way because you are in competition with the writer. You're saying this, but I think I can go beyond what you have shown. And I suspect this. And then things keep unfolding. And a red herrings, or as Poirot says, red fish, being strewn all over them. Not fish, Poirot, it's herrings, says Captain Hastings. But it's engaging. And I am truly impressed by how these people's minds are organized. They know the end. And yet, they can construct a novel in such a way that they don't know. So, I need that kind of straightforward detective novel. There are detective novels which I have been given to read, etc., which want to be literary. And they build up local color, they build up characters. And I'm saying, don't bore me, please. And I put that book away. So, yes, those are books that I take to bed with me.

A thought expressed on paper was concrete proof of what you were. When I put thoughts on paper, as many young people do, I recognized that I got a particular pleasure out of choosing certain words above others, and putting them together in a certain way that wasn't just about making sense. This kind of writing was therefore a solitary exercise. Stop quote, tell me a little bit about, you know, what drew you to writing? And did you begin to get a sense of yourself as a writer? Or did you begin to get a sense of yourself as someone who would always write whatever else they would do, or whatever else they might be? And how much of a part did your parents play in this? Because your mother, you have mentioned was an excellent storyteller, with Tiger Cubs with a taste for mangoes in her past life. And at the same time, your father was a very clear and incisive writer. There are excerpts that you've quoted from his columns from, you know, the 40s and 50s and so on."

And if that made me a writer, then I was a writer. But jottings that you make, and they're not offhand jottings, you're taking care over the sentences, over the choice of words, which is the process which I have said, I always enjoy. But to become a writer, you have to write in a certain form that gets published. So, journalistic writing was the first form of writing that I did. And it really happened entirely by accident. Because of the joy that I took in the process of writing, one of the letters that I wrote home, Mr. Matthew, whom you have quoted already, who used to look after the Sunday supplement of the Times-Pena, read this letter, because my father had enjoyed it. So, he had handed it over for him, Uncle Matthew to read. And Uncle Matthew said, I shall publish this. And suddenly, I was published. Now, that's the that's the first stamp that tells you, you are a writer, because you're published. But, and then I continued, because this is a slot that I had found. And I used to write middles for the Times of India, because it allowed me to express my view of the absurdity of things. And they paid pretty well for the Times. And I didn't want to make money at that time. Then I realised the dangers of doing the same thing over and over. However, fresh each column was, it was still 450 words, and was still something light and refreshing, etc. Two things happened. Miss Jassawalla, also of Elphinstone College, said to me once, we were, I think, it might sound unlikely, but Miss Jassawalla and a few of us from the English department were watching a film. I forget what it was, but we occupied two rows. She was in the row in front of me. And it was obviously a funny film and laughing. And Miss Jassawalla turned around and said to me, Shanta, I think I can hear the rumble of a middle coming from you. I thought, oh God, no, surely not. Surely not. That was one. And soon after that, a very good friend of mine said to me, have you planned to die writing middles? And that was a reality check. And I thought, no, that's not how I want to die. I want to write other things also. And that article, I don't know if you were referring to that article, but I wrote an article for the Times of India, my first serious article, talking about the Brahmanism in university education, the Brahmins being the English medium people and all others being non-Brahmins. And it was much appreciated. So, I thought, fine, I'm not just a middle writer. I can write serious stuff also. And that opened out that avenue to me of serious journalistic writing. But then later, I discovered that I wasn't much good at doing news stories, news features, because it involved talking to strangers and it involved probing into their personal lives. And one such story really upset me. I was asked to go and write about a rape that had happened. And I mean, it was a horror story, what had happened. Everyone knew what had happened. And what was I going to do? I was told, go and talk to the girl. And I went to this place. It was in a slum in Worli. And I stood outside that door and I did not go in. I just simply didn't want to ask that girl the stupid question, how do you feel? And I came back and did the most unprofessional thing. I told my editor, no, I'm incapable of doing this story. So, I realized that I wasn't what they call a hard-nosed journalist. And I think that is what turned me towards writing on cultural subjects and other stuff like that. And then in those days, a lot of magazines were still publishing fiction. And it's a strange thing that people assume someone who can write journalistic stories can write fiction. I had never shown any kind of skill for writing stories, but requests kept coming. Write a story for this special issue, write for that. Femina, Eves Weekly. And then what was that magazine? Imprint. Requests came. And suddenly, if a request came, there was a story in my head. I had always loved listening to stories and I had loved telling stories. So, it was a question of putting them into words. And so, my first short stories and perhaps my only short stories were written on request by these magazines, by Illustrated Weekly and by some Marathi magazines also. So, both languages I have used in short fiction. So, that was another form which I went into. And then the play that you referred to, Avinash, which because I was so much part of theatre and of watching plays, I had read huge amounts of plays, American, Russian, English, German, everything. So, playwriting seemed to come to me in a fairly natural way. If a subject lent itself to a play, the writing of it came quite naturally. And I discovered this with Avinash because I was so preoccupied at that time with this whole business of mental conditions, which are put down as madness and lunacy back then. You didn't kind of differentiate. You didn't think of mental illness as illness at all. It was all madness. And I was terribly disturbed by two or three such things that had happened in my circle. And it was through that kind of deep concern that I sat down to write Avinash. And I wrote it, I think, in about a week or so. And I didn't have to rewrite any part of it. It just stood the way it was written in the first draft. And that's how Dubey did it. So, that was playwriting. I didn't follow up with any other play till lately when I have written a few plays. Not all of them staged, but some read, some performed to some extent, a couple of them published. So, that I came into because of this extremely strong emotion that I felt, and felt that it could only be expressed through a play. And then finally, the novel, which happened in 1983-84 or so, where again, impelled by two or three cases of ex-marital relationships that were happening around me. And my friends were the other women, not the wives. So, I was seeing things from their viewpoint. And the other woman's viewpoint has never been central to any Marathi novel in any case. And I felt very deeply about it. That's how Rita Velinkar came about. So, that was the first novel. So, from journalism to short fiction, to playwriting, to novel."

        "message": "So, you know, we were discussing earlier about the relevance of marriage and all that. And I'm reminded of this lovely passage from Rita Velinkar, where one of the female characters is telling a man, quote, I'm not asking you to step out of my life. I'm stepping out of yours and removing you from the centre of mine in order to live alone. I'm taking away from you that special place in my life, which you alone occupied, not in order to hand it over to someone else, but to reclaim it for myself, stop quote, and just a lovely passage. I had once written this essay, sort of talking about my podcasting and that as well, about how the form shapes the content of what you do. And that in turn can shape your character in the sense my observation there was that as my episodes got longer and longer, like I started off doing like 20 minute episodes, my shortest episode is just 11 minutes, wasn't oral history format, then it was just one issue and whatever quickly. And it was shallow stuff. And I realized that as I got longer and longer, it forced me to become a better reader, because I'd have to do much more work reading, it forced me to become a much better listener. And that in turn, forces humility. Because if you are going to then listen genuinely to try and understand the other person, your ego has to go out of the equation. And I felt that what happened was that the form that I had chosen the long form podcast shaped the content that I was producing, you know, more considered slow conversations like this one. And that I think changed me. Right. And I want to ask you a question about the various forms that you have therefore worked in. Because you're starting with the middle. And at one point, when your friend advises you, are you going to write middles all your life? It is, in a sense, it implies that a particular kind of person writes a middle, that you're sure shallow and humorous, and you're not really digging deep into things. Yes. And there also one feels that if you wrote middles all your life, and none of this other stuff that you mentioned, yeah, I suspect you would be a different person. Yes. Right. And stepping out of the middle forces you to go somewhere else. Writing hard nose reporting would have made you a different person from just immersing yourself into culture. You know, in a different context, you've written in your book about how when you were in Glaxo, you wanted to organize plays, which the workers would do. But because the lunch break was 45 minutes, and they take 10 minutes to eat, you decided to constrict whatever you were doing to 30 minutes and rewrite it accordingly. Yes. And that's also a constraint. That's also a form. And constraints, of course, can create great art by just, you know, being constraints, but equally, they, you know, force a certain kind of expression. And, and I just find that this connection is everywhere. Like the shallowest people are on Twitter, because you have 280 characters, though, I believe that's being changed soon. But you have 280 words, characters, sorry. And, you know, so what is your experience with all these different forms that you worked in? Do you feel that they shaped you and changed you? Do you feel that a novel required you to become something else in order"

        "message": "to write? Yeah, yeah. I think stepping out of middles was stepping out of a comfort zone. Because I knew this is something I could do. I think I was, despite the fact that I loved writing, and I keep saying the process of writing, not the product. And I keep saying that because it's, I was diffident about the product. When I said that I wrote my first serious article, it was certainly because of these promptings, which I have spoken of, but also always out of a deep emotional disturbance. When you're not asking yourself, can I do this? Because I know, at any given point of time, if I asked myself, can I do this? My answer could possibly be, possibly be, no, come on, you can't. When have you done that? No, no, no. But it was a strong emotion that forced me into writing something. And that something happened to be a different form from what I had done earlier. I said the same thing about Avinash, strong emotion. Rita, strong emotion. It was even after Rita, I refused to call myself a novelist. If anyone called me that, I would stop them. And I would say, unless I have written a second novel, I'm not a novelist. I am just a one-off thing. So, there were all these kinds of lines which I drew for myself. And each time I stepped across a line, it was actually to discover myself. Because I hadn't thought I was capable. But this proved that I was. And then, short stories. So, if a short story idea comes to me, and if I want to publish a short story, I will be published. I can write an adequately interesting short story. With the novel I had given up, I had given up after writing four chapters, because they were written in English, because I automatically thought if I'm writing a novel, it's going to be in English. But I stopped because I instinctively realized that it wasn't working. Something was not working. And, of course, my conclusion was, you're not a novelist. Why do you bother? So, I had set it aside. And it came back because I began thinking of it and hearing the character speak in Marathi. And I realized that I had been using the wrong language for what I was wanting to write. And that's how I started writing Rita again in Marathi. And once that was done, I thought, yes, I think Marathi is my language for novel writing. So, the second novel, I had absolutely no doubt which language I was going to write in. And although it was about a theme that isn't normally written about in Marathi literature, which is the visual arts and violence, I didn't feel diffident. I felt perfectly confident in writing in a form in which I hadn't written earlier, because it's not a linear story from A to Z. But by then, I felt confident. And at the end of it, I was okay with people saying, calling me a novelist. No problem. So, it was actually a discovery of one's own capacities. When Govind Nihalani asked me to do my first ever script for a documentary, I wondered if I could. And he said, it's a documentary. I'm giving you all the research material. You just have to read. And I had said to him, let me read and let me feel my way to a script. If I feel because I've seen enough excellent cinema, both feature films and documentaries. So, I have certain standards. And if I can come up halfway at least, then I accept this assignment. And I found that it was happening. And so it happened, that first script, after which I became pretty confident about writing film scripts also. So, it's really a process of self-discovery of overcoming confidence, diffidence. And in a way, I think I'm glad I was diffident, because I see a lot of confident people around. And I see their first novels, which they think are up there. And I can see so many flaws. But to come to novel writing later in life, after you have read so much, you have certain standards. And you may not be up there, but you know where you are. And I'm happy with that."

Another consequence of diffidence, and perhaps related to the anxiety of wanting to fit in or wanting validation or wanting to be acclaimed for what you do, is sometimes that I guess, when you start writing, and it's something that all writers might go through, is that they overthink it, that they can come out with writerly prose, because they're trying to write in a particular way and be impressive. And at one point, you know, there's this great passage by you, again, quoted by Jerry, who almost feels like a co author of the podcast now. But he quoted you in his introduction, and I'll read this bit out, because I send this to all my writing students also, because I wanted them to read it. And you wrote, you get an idea, you think, oh, this might make a great story or a column. But when you get down to it, you find that it needs to be expanded. This is easily done if it is an argument. But that's not what I'm talking about here. This is something fluffier, you have to think up metaphors, you have to put in images, you have to add quotes. And for that you have to have a good memory, which I do not have. This is called filling up. I have so many ideas that flit across my mind, I have learned over time to enjoy these and to let them go. In a book I have called the Creative Processes Symposium, many people from mathematicians to artists to writers talk about the processes. One of them is Catherine Ann Porter, a short story writer, she says it was pointed out to her that she could not describe her short stories lack descriptions. So she set herself an exercise, she went out and sat down somewhere on a hill or something and looked around her with the intention of going home and describing things. When she got home, she tried and found that she could not do it. She could not describe what she had seen. And she decided that there was something she could do and something she couldn't. And that is why I say I can't fill up, stop quote. And the lesson in this which I, lesson for me, lesson for my writing students when I told them is that it's okay, you know, you will have strengths, you will have weaknesses. If your strengths allow you to, you know, get to the essence of something, that's what matters. It doesn't matter that, oh, I have to learn to describe well or use big words or whatever. I find the most common mistake young writers make is they're overwriting because you're overthinking. So tell me about your process of sort of coming to terms with this and coming to terms with what kind of writing you want to do, because one I imagine for a journalist, it would be almost forced upon you because you have deadlines, you can't overthink or overwrite too much. But what was your process through your life of finding that phase where you're comfortable in your writing skill and you're like this?"

I wanted to impress myself. I wasn't looking to impress anyone outside myself. And to impress myself, I just simply had to be honest to myself, to recognize myself. And then out of that recognition, put everything I had into my writing. And at the best of times, good language for me has never meant big words. I think good writing is good thinking and finding the right words for what you're thinking or what you're feeling. And those words can be three-letter words or 10-letter words, doesn't matter. But you're not going for the 10-letter words because they sound impressive. So, yeah, if that answers your question."

And there's also a lovely passage where you write about academics and I'll just quote this because I really like it. For someone who loves language, it is painful to hear academics binge on words like negotiate, problematize, navigate, inscribe, predicate, hegemonize, subaltern, and cite. Worthy words all but without any resonance of sound or sense. Does that make me anti-intellectual? No, it makes me anti-a certain type of academic. I believe that those who speak and write the sturgid jargon use it as easy currency for an exchange of ready-made positions. If intellectual means thinking independently, struggling to find words to express thought, and coming up with fresh formulations to stimulate further thinking, then the people I had heard in seminars weren't it. Excuse me if I don't listen, I would say, and doze off, dreaming of resonant words like crepuscular, kairoskuru, ephemeral, gamble, diaphanous, gossamer, insouciance, mellifluous, palimpsest, one could go on forever. The riches of the English tongue are infinite, stop quote. And I'm sure I pronounced a few of them wrong, but I'm also certain that you and my listeners will forgive me. Tell me about sort of, you know, earlier, and in your writing, you've referred to Virginia Woolf talking about how every woman needs a room of her own, which is not necessarily only a physical space, but I'm guessing also something in your head, where you can sit down and find that peace. And, and it is way harder for women than it is for men, you know, for most men, if they say, yeah, I'm going to write in my study every Sunday for four hours, don't disturb me, it's easy, you know, that the house will run.

        "message": "life, how you dealt with this? The question first arose as a problem was in Vishakhapatnam, when I was translating Godavari Parurekar's book called Jema Manus Jaga Hoto. And the children were young, I think, two and four, possibly. And they weren't ever noisy children, but they like to keep sharing things with me, I was around, they were around. So I had, I played a trick, and they appreciated it. During this translation period, I had told them that I'm not Ayi, I'm Shanta Gokhale. That was, see, it acted like moving out from home into an office. That is a physical space. A lot of people say, working from home is comfortable, but it's too comfortable. If you have to go to the office, then your entire attitude to your work changes. I couldn't change spaces, but I could draw the line in this way. So, I was Shanta Gokhale, and that became my space. And they would keep to themselves. Of course, I didn't try their patience too much. I would translate in stints of about one hour or so, at the end of which I'd be with them, and then back again. So, that's how I managed it then. What I couldn't manage successfully, and here I'll go back to Virginia Woolf, because she says, apart from having a room of one's own, and she doesn't mean it metaphorically, because she says, and 500 pounds. So, it's space and money and money to keep you going. And so, that part wasn't my problem. Space was, I have written a maximum proportion of my total output in these last 20 years, since I have had my room to myself. And I have realized how important it is that I should have that. Because with Arun, it was always a question. I had a desk, wasn't as if I didn't. But he with that male ego, which you've been talking about, and I have agreed to full heartedly, felt that what he was reading was so important, that I had to keep aside whatever I was doing, in order to let him speak about it. So, a lot of the time that I could make for myself from housework, and from being with the children, and being with my mother, was taken up in this fashion. And it was a kind of relief, which I cannot even begin to describe, when that room came totally into my control. And I could be at my desk, and I could write 10 continuous sentences, without someone saying, listen to this and break my link. So, that having the space is extremely important, the physical space, mental space I always had. I could actually write, writing to the office on the bus, for Rita Velinkar, I have done that. I just needed space to myself without interruption. So, yes, that is why I keep quoting Virginia Woolf. She had it right. She knew what a woman required, if she wanted to be a writer."

So, they were there, the language was there, and I just needed to be tested. And this could happen only if the person who was suggesting it was the kind of person that Nishim was. Totally generous in spirit, and always very careful about what he was saying, and knew he had actually worked with me on a translation from Marathi. So, I realized that this was there somewhere at the back of his mind also. So, all these things combined gave me that trust in his judgment. See, it was entirely possible for me, maybe not me, but people would say he's an old fogie. What does he know? I mean, he doesn't understand what I'm writing. So, it required that kind of trust in this person to do what I did. With Satyadev, he was a very close friend. And Jerry was rather, wondered why I wasn't offended when he called me a cow. And I said, friends aren't allowed to call me that because there's so much love behind the word. So, and I knew his passion. He was such a passionate man where theatre was concerned. He lived it, he ate it. And if he was saying, do this, I had no questions to ask at all. I had the time and I had the space. So, I did it. And as you say, that pushed me into translating plays. And it also established me as a translator of plays. So, a whole lot of playwrights who later asked me to translate based their request on the fact that I had done Avadya, which had been published in a magazine. And it was there for people to see.

There are things that you can't say in English and immediately your Hindi or your Gujarati or your Marathi comes. And there are things which while I'm talking to someone in English, I suddenly say in Marathi because that's the right word for that occasion or for that person. So, of course, there are certain things which have words, very effective words in one language and not in another. But it's not when I'm actually writing either in English or Marathi, I'm not conscious of being in another mental space, another linguistic space, obviously. But mental space, no. And I think that is possibly what people say to me, that you hold back on your emotions. That's my sensibility. And it is both functions in English and it does in Marathi. If I were actually moving into another world, I would move into the characteristic Marathi world, world which is highly emotional, which even now thinks of people as good and bad. And the modern writer has found grayness also. But the very typical Marathi culture is to think in terms of good and bad. And a lot of people write that way and write emotionally about things, which I don't do. So, the language doesn't take me into that other world.

For example, it could be said that some languages are just naturally minimalistic, like perhaps Japanese and Korean, which is why novelists in those languages, even in translation tend to be quite sparse, whereas some languages are given to expressionism, like maybe Bengali or Urdu. So if you are to translate something from Urdu word for word to English, it might seem to someone who's only read English literature that this is too ornate, that this is too flowery, that you need to kind of tone it down. And I'm wondering if that is something that therefore affects the literature of these languages, that one, they are intrinsically different in certain ways, certain immutable ways, and also that they have evolved differently, whereas a language like English is really a global language, there are tributaries from everywhere coming into that ocean, but smaller languages might be kind of more insular and not have had that opportunity"

Evolution would suggest that it is internally motivated, and it goes from stage to stage, and it arrives at a certain point, which is distant from the starting point. Here, it's very clearly a departure, straight, and a departure that has come because of an external influence, not necessarily internally motivated."

You don't, because there are two different frameworks and the two different purposes for which these artists were painting. And I know that it has happened with me in assessing plays. If a play is calling itself experimental, then I have a certain framework, which is global. Experiments have happened all over the world, and where are you in that context is the measure which I'm using for you. I go to mainstream theatre, and I know the framework within which those people are working. And I look at the play within that framework, and I see the little attempts that have been made at a breakthrough. And I appreciate them. These people are not saying we are experimental, but that artistic impulse is driving them to break the mould to some extent, at least. And my friends in so-called experimental theatre have said to me, you're very lenient with them, and you're very strict with us. I said, yes, you have chosen to occupy another frame altogether, and you're accountable to that."

Shanta, I'm going to, you know, pick up on a theme that you mentioned earlier in our conversation, where you spoke about how idealistic you were, with that idealism being one of the reasons that you came back to India and how that idealism was mirrored in so many people that you met and people that you saw. And you know, when I my father was an IAS officer joined in the 60s. And, and I often asked him, why did you know, I mean, apart from it being, you know, he kind of almost got into it accidentally, so to say, he was in love with my mother and her parents wouldn't allow a marriage unless he had a stable job. So he had to, so he just gave the exam and joined. But one thing I realised is that he said, like, that in that generation of, you know, him and people like him, there was an idealism about the whole process. Whereas I have actually had episodes with IAS officers since on the show. And even if the odd IAS officer today can be idealistic and driven to do something for the country, but you know, a lot of people join for the wrong reasons. And you cannot exactly blame them because that idealism as a whole seems to have gone from society a bit. I mean, that is one way to look at it. The other way of looking at it is that, you know, if idealism is basically a hope for a better life, maybe in younger people, it manifests in other ways, which have nothing to do with the kind of ideals that we had. So what are sort of your thoughts about this?"

I think if your objective is to make as much money as you can, I can't see where idealism can come in. I said biases because this is, I mean, a kind of anti-money bias, which I have. But on the ground, I do know people who are wealthy. And I find that those who belong to the earlier generation and who inherited money didn't run after it, it just came to them, can be idealistic and are very often. But those who have suddenly found that a certain branch of education will bring them a certain kind of job, which will bring them a certain amount of money. And they go to that branch because they have this long term view, which has money at the end. Then what are they idealistic about? I don't know. I had an experience with students of management at the Bangalore Institute of Management. And two of them came to me after my lecture, and I was talking about art. And they said, you know, we are here, we know we will get very good jobs, but we mean to chuck them up as soon as we have enough money, because we want to go into rural development. And we believe that unless that happens, the country can't be said to be progressing. So, it was idealism on hold. And everyone else had their goal fixed. The problem between idealism and money can, I think, be settled if you believe in philanthropy. And a lot of people who make a lot of money also give away a lot of money. And they do it for the betterment of the world, which is not the world they inhabit. So, they're not self-centred in that sense. They open out to the rest of the world. So, I can see idealism playing a part there. But I don't see too much of that happening here. And I keep wondering, I haven't really read or thought too much about it. So, it's just a hunch that charity is not, charity is done to lesser human beings. As I said, I'm thinking off the curve, but I'm trying to\u2026"

But to read it in the printed word, I don't have all those things. So, it's just a hunch that money-making cancels out idealism. And if you are idealistic, what does that mean in the first place? That terrorists are often called idealistic, meaning that they have a dream, they have an idea, and a goal towards which they're working. So, I mean, we need to go back to a definition of idealism, because I think you used it and I responded, assuming a certain definition of idealism, which is ethical, which we think is ethical. Now, to have an ideal of one country, one culture, one colour, one language, it's a dream, it's a big dream. It doesn't fit my definition of idealism. So, that is a problem with the use of certain words as well. But I think in the course of saying all this, I have defined what it means to me. And it's within that context that I have spoken."

Your son Girish, besides being a good friend of mine, is also an excellent poker player. And I used to wonder back in the days when I was active, that so many times I will bluff into him, and he will call me, how does he know I'm bluffing? And just now you said that, when people talk to you, you look at their eyes, you look at their body language, and I think some of that might have passed down to Girish. A couple of points of response that if we look at idealism, like what does an idealist want to do? However, he defines it, an idealist wants to make the world a better place. However, the idealist defines a better place, and how this plays into money. I think that there are a couple of aspects to it, as far as philanthropists are concerned, and a lot of people who've not inherited money, but made it themselves, like the Nilekanis and Azim Premji and so on, are also great philanthropists. And the way I would look at that is I don't really care what their intent is, whether there is self aggrandizement behind that or whatever, I look at the effect of their money on the real world. And if it is making the lives of people better off, that's great. The other aspect of it is that in a free market, which is not crony capitalistic, like India often has been, you know, the only way you can make money is by making someone else's life better off by providing them a service that they want. So I wouldn't completely look at the desire to make money as something crass, because unless, of course, you're using the power of the state, as so often happens in India to do rent seeking and all that, you know, the way you make money is by giving somebody something that they want and making them better off. And I think that's perfectly honourable in a sense. And even if people are driven by the desire to make money, like a lot of capitalists who made the world a better place have done it because not because they wanted to make money per se, but there was some problem they wanted to solve. And they get in there to try and solve the problem. And then it helps the world at large. And I'm also kind of okay with that. So I wouldn't look at money as something that is necessarily a counter to the idea of idealism. I had once written a column where I address a question that people often bring up, that why were our freedom fighters such great leaders, you know, even if we disagree with them on some particulars, we can accept that they were all great leaders, great men and women. But modern politicians cannot are not looked upon in that way. And my thesis was that back then, that it's all about incentives, that back then, you know, people like Gandhi, Patel, Nehru, all of these people, there was no power to be had for them. So they were driven only by principle and with no pot of gold at the end of that rainbow. And therefore, the sort of people who became freedom fighters were people like that. Whereas today the way, you know, the state has such a big role in our lives, where power and money have this interplay and this vicious circle that goes on between them, a different kind of person is drawn to politics. And that makes me wonder that if Gandhi was born today, if Nehru was born today, what would they be doing? And, you know, I once in fact said that a modern day version of Nehru who wrote and read and thought so much as perhaps someone like Pratap Bhanumaita, you know, more of an intellectual who stays away from the muddy waters of what politics does. But I imagine one place where idealism should have survived is the world of the arts. Because I think artists have often looked upon as yeah, you got to make money, you got to do things to make money. But at the same time, they are drawn to art in the first place towards becoming artists, because of their passion and their desire for the arts. So what's your sense in the artistic world? Because the world of theatre back in the 50s and the 60s, I'm guessing must have been driven by, you know, by idealism, perhaps even a foolish idealism at times. Whereas today, so much of the arts are so commercialised that anyone who chases a lowest common denominator is necessarily not being"

And that money is good for everybody. Fine, that is one way of making money. But it's not the goal. Where did he start? He started with a problem. And he thought he would be able to solve it. And once it was solved, one step led to another and another. I just have one of several stories that I have witnessed. There was a friend of mine, a colleague, who said that her son, who was then at college, had a certain regard for me. And therefore, would I talk to him about choice of profession? And I said, fine, let him come. When the boy came, he said, I want to become a journalist. And my parents want me to become a chartered accountant. And they will not hear of me becoming a journalist because they think it's not a profession that you can make money in. So, I said, ultimately, you have to decide whether you want to do what you want to do, or you want to do what your parents want you to do. Speaking for myself, since I've been requested to speak to you, I think your mother mistakenly thought that I would be thinking the way she does, because all parents are supposed to think that their children should do well money-wise. And I said, because she's mistaken, I love your idea of becoming a journalist. I have read what you have written so far. And I think you have promise, a lot of promise, and it would be wonderful.

What is offered to her or him isn't always accompanied by choice. You aren't being asked, would you like to do this role, or that role? This is the offer. You take it or leave it. And if at the beginning of your career, you leave it, then instantly a reputation begins to build up. You can't afford to be choosy at the early stages. So, whose heart, the heart is only saying, I want to act. And only recently, I've gotten back to Habib Tanvi's memoirs. And he says, it's acting in films is a profession without any autonomy for the actor. And if an actor wishes to say something, then he has to change his media. So, that's film acting. In theatre, yes, as you said, there was a time when, well, I can only speak about Maharashtra, which happens to have a theatre industry, which most states don't have. And because there's an industry, there's a possibility of making money. And any number of actors in Maharashtra have lived off theatre and whatever spin-offs come from that. There is the other stream of theatre where most of my friends belong, where idealism comes in, where you're thinking of theatre as an art, and you are wishing to improve what you can do in that art, how you can contribute to that art. And only the other day, there was this young teacher sitting with me, and he is doing a project on theatre. And he was saying that I've been reading a lot around the subject. And he said, I am totally amazed at the kind of give and take that you people appear to have, that you could say to each other, look, this isn't working, or this is bad, to put it bluntly. And how, he said, we can't say that to our colleagues anymore. So, I said, yeah, that was because of idealism, because we weren't thinking, this is my work, and how dare someone say that it's all wrong. We were, all of us together, thinking of our work in the context of the art, theatre, art, and we all wanted to go further towards achieving what those ideals were. And things did change. And I have to return to that same subject, because it's a fact, you can look at the statistics, you can look at people's memoirs. And 1985 onwards became the watershed. Beyond that, people stopped being that kind of idealistic about theatre. And Dubey himself has gone on record to say, I can't do this anymore. This is the man who complained about one of his most popular plays, saying, it's making me money, something must be wrong with what I've done. So, there was a complete change of mindset. And that coincided, of course, with the coming of the satellite channels, and opening up of opportunities for both actors and writers to move into a money-making part of their profession. And if you saw that output, you saw that it was crass. Quite a lot of it was crass. And these were people who would come home or who would meet their old friend and complain about the kinds of things that they were having to write. And I remember Sulbha Deshpande, one of our greatest actors, who said to me once, what's to be done, Shanta? I go there, I leave my brains behind. I get into whatever glossy saree they want me to wear. I'm getting up in the morning from bed, fully made up. That's why I leave my brains behind. But it helps me pay the bills. So, yeah, all these are post-90 things that happened. And there are many people who continue idealistically. Sunil Shanbhag is one of them. I spoke of Atul Pethe, who is another. And they find backers who will back their ideas. But those are people, the kind that you spoke of, that they're making money, but they're trying to do something which helps others, you know, fulfil their ideals and their ideas. So, that is happening. But not everyone has the courage or the dynamism to stick it out in theatre at any rate, to stick it out and just be themselves and do what they want to do."

And he'd basically fought with his family, which was a farming family to come to Bombay and join JJ School of Art because he was idealistic about art, he wanted to be an artist. But by the time he came out of it, the fashions had changed and art had gone cerebral, as you say. And there was the kind of figurative work that he was really good at, no one wanted it anymore. And you speak of the lost and desperate look on his face, as he kind of told you this. And, you know, and I bring up this incident, but it seems that this is often an unspoken and unrealised struggle that many artists may go through, where they want to do one kind of work, but practicality forces them into another direction. Practicality forces Sulbha Deshpande to play a character who's waking up in the morning with all her makeup already on, right? And the trade-off is there. And sometimes you can acknowledge the trade-off and look at it in the face as Sulbhaji seems to have done when she said, I leave my brain behind. But many other people will rationalise it, they'll make one small compromise, and they'll say it's okay, this is also part of my art. And they'll make another one. And they go on and on and so on and so forth. And your contention is that it's much more like this today.

And that was a delight to watch. And it so happens that you know, I wrote a shitty novel in 2009, which I'm kind of embarrassed about. But nevertheless, when it came out, Govind Nihalani got in touch with me and said, I want to make a film with it. And I actually tried to, I remember, argue with him that it can't be a film because it's not a three act structure. He said, No, no, I want to make a film with it. So I did a sort of a rough treatment note for him and a little bit of a started working on a little bit of a script and he took it around. And no one was interested. And then he came back to me. And he said, ki yaar you know, ye Hindi film industry mein there is no hope. I'm going to make this in Marathi. And then he said something which I found very interesting. He said ki the Marathi film industry today and this was in 2009-2010. He said the Marathi film industry today has the same spirit that I used to see in the Hindi film industry of the late 70s and 80s. And you know, I wrote a brief treatment with him with, you know, shifting the scene to Pune. But I think I inadvertently kind of ghosted him because we just ran out of touch and it never happened. And at one level, of course, I felt incredibly sad that an artist of that caliber is not getting people to back him. I mean, if I was a big industrialist with a lot of money, I would just blindly, you know, hand him a packet and say, do whatever you want. But that wasn't the case with him back then. And but my larger question to you is trying to understand what changed, like part of it, as you point out, is this desire to, you know, make more money, lowest common denominator, these big businesses and get involved, and then they cannot think beyond convention. So it is, you know, what we see in Hollywood, ki ek superhero film ban gaya toh you make a franchise and you make 50 more and there's no imagination there at all. You follow some kind of formula without really understanding what the hell is going on. But at the same time, I would imagine there are many more people with money, there are audiences have much more buying power, which means even a niche audience can actually make something profitable. And to some extent, we've had all kinds of independent cinema like Masan come up during that time. But I want you to give me a flavor of what Govindji was referring to, that that spirit that was there in the artistic world that we will try new things. And there were people who were backing new things. And there were audiences who were sharing that excitement with them. And you have seen this across decades and across domains, not just cinema, but theatre also and all of that. And it seems that it's lost. So, give me a flavor of that.

The viewers of the so called middle of the road cinema, which Shyam Benegal was making, were middle class mostly. And what's happened to the middle class since the 1990s has made a huge difference. So, that's one point. But going back to those times, it was a time of discovering as far as films are concerned, discovering world cinema. Before that, we saw a certain amount of Hollywood. We saw special showings of Russian films of the time. But Far East, Middle East, none of these cinemas existed for us. And it all burst open when this consciousness of world cinema came in. And we had a proliferation of film societies. Every Ilaka had a film society. And one of the most well run of them was used to hold its screenings at a place in Worli, Ranod Laboratories. It was called Anandam. And a lot of people who belong to the world of cinema, Indian cinema, were members, founders. And I was introduced to it as soon as I came back from England by a wonderful character called Gopal Duttya. And it was utterly delightful to be part of that society. At the same time, because of the film society movement, there were theatres in Bombay, which began showing art films as they were called. So, there was Lotus Cinema in Worli, which is now Lotus House or something like that. Then there was Chitra Cinema, where I met Dubey for the first time. We were both there to see one such film. And Akashvani Theatre used to hold screenings of offbeat films, etc. So, there was a kind of hunger to see films that went beyond Bollywood and Hollywood.

But the time in between was dead in that sense. Producers didn't want to back anything that was offbeat. And I think quite rightly they suspected that there wasn't much of an audience for it. And I don't know, I don't have the figures, but I think it's a hunch that in the 60s and 70s, there weren't those kinds of big stars who are charging the earth, which totally changed the economics of filmmaking. And that naturally became the cause for things becoming formulaic, that formula seems to bring in audiences who make films like that. So, it's a whole lot of factors acting together that drove idealism of the kind Govind speaks of completely out, yeah."

And as you said, that maybe it's a sign of hope that despite a barren period in the middle, there are films like Masaan and Chaitanya Tamhaane made Court and Disciple and all of that. And, you know, so maybe there's a lot of hope there. Let's talk a little bit about sort of how society is changing and how it has affected women. For example, you know, we discussed the angle of marriage and how women may no longer need to fit themselves in those frameworks to have satisfied lives. In 1998, in Lok Satya, you wrote this great column where you took on Pramod Navalkar, where Pramod Navalkar had spoken of family values. And he was saying that, you know, in 1970, there were only 1000 restaurants in Mumbai, today it is closer to 9887. And he was kind of saying that, listen, our kitchens are now deserted, and there is a problem, women are not in the kitchen, and it is a fountainhead of homely happiness. I think those are the words he used. And, like one, I would see this as tremendously positive for women, the fact that they're not in the kitchen anymore. I mean, I'd actually written a column I got blasted for once arguing that rising divorce rates were fantastic, because it meant that women weren't trapped in bad marriages. And I think this whole trend of ordering out swiggies, amato, everything is also fantastic, you know, it probably indicates that women are a less willing to spend time in the kitchen and be they're working, so even they don't have time to cook. So it's great. And I'm just thinking about the ways in which lives of women have changed in the sense of, in many ways, India is still deeply misogynistic and sexist, and women are still second class citizens. And there's so much data that attests to this. But at the same time, in many ways, in terms of having more choice in terms of being empowered in all kinds of different ways, like the technology they have around them to begin with, you know, things sort of have changed, you know. So tell me a little bit about this, because this is not something that a male guest will ever have anything to say about, because they won't even have noticed it. But, you know, you've seen that change through the decades and,"

The other world comes to me as to everyone else through newspaper stories. And newspaper stories are always about women committing suicide, because divorce is not an option for them. Women who are battered in the house, but domestic violence is a two-edged thing for them, because if they complain, they lose their protection, both social and familial protection. And you can rape me, you can beat me, you can do anything, but I will stay with you, because that's my identity. And I was brought up by people, parents who thought too much education was bad for women. I don't have any skills at all. And you are my provider, and therefore I shall stay with you, taking whatever shit you give me. But equally, I read news items about women who have a profession, who are doing well in their professions. I remember a 32-year-old woman in Delhi committing suicide. And one questions this, why you have everything? Why could you not make an independent life for yourself? And that is because she is not independent. She is still part of a family, which is still part of a clan, which is still part of a caste, whatever. And there's a lot of pressure that people bring to bear on individuals and very few people have the courage. They may have a profession, they may be doing well, but they may lack the strength to stand up against all of this and say, I shall live. I shall not just go away. But they go away. So, women are changing to the extent that their families allow them to. Some families allow them to leap as high as they can. But once they marry, there's a whole lot of other factors which intrude. Even the parents say that you're not us anymore. And parents who, from news items that I read, parents who after their daughter has been murdered, will go to the police and say, we knew that she was being tortured. In fact, we brought her home. And then we tried and counseled the husband and he said he would look after her and he would change. And so, we sent her back. Now, who sends their child back into a hell? If that is happening, which woman has the courage to just leave and be by herself? And in case she does, there is a second very practical problem. Where does she go? Do house owners like single women to stay in their, will they rent a flat to a single woman? Instantly, which men come? How long do they stay? Questions begin to rise. There's a very fine poet, Indira Sant, who has written a poem called Ekti. And it's about this. So, I don't know. Lives of women continue to be tough. And perhaps those who rise and many have risen and broken through the glass ceiling. Now, I'm always excited when I turn to the business pages and I see a whole lot of women's faces as CEOs and CFOs and all the rest, which you didn't do, say even 12, 15 years ago. So, that's good. But, and then there are women artists, amazing artists who are doing fantastic work, which is globally appreciated. So, yes, there is that happening, but I'd say not to the extent that one would hope and expect. There's a huge fight still to be fought."

And even if sometimes we look around in our 21st century bubble, and we say, hey, changes, so much changes happened. The truth is, the other India's are still kind of with us. In your book, at one point, you write about this gentleman who was boasting about his daughter. And you write here, quote, in the course of describing his daughter's qualifications, the gentleman mentioned a quality of a personality that he was proud of, and which he thought would impress me too. She is so modest that she has never raised her eyes to look at a man, he said. Poor unhappy creature, I thought. But who was I to think that? Perhaps our happiness lay in making a father happy, stop quote. And at this point, you also talk about how you and your sister Nirmal always raised their eyes and looked at men. No issues there. And it strikes me that number one, I think more women today will raise their eyes like that and look at men. And one great advantage of the modern times is that women have frames to see all of this by like a woman in the 50s and 60s, who perhaps is not from the same privileged background as you you are, may never have heard of feminism there or be able to make sense of it or be able to apply those frames to look at her life and see what is adjusted, what is unjust. And whereas today, women have those frames through which they can make sense of what is going on around them and which can help them think more clearly. And I for one think that that's, you know, but like you said, change takes ages. You know, I did an episode with Shrayana Bhattacharya called the loneliness of the Indian woman. She's written this great book on desperately seeking Shahrukh, where, you know, she's described in such beautiful and vivid detail how so many women across India are kind of trapped and lonely. And it just strikes me that, you know, even if you're brought up in a way, and even if you're trapped in social structures, like your your parental home, and then your marital home, and you cannot escape those, even if all of that is true, at least if your gaze has changed, you can bring your daughters and your sons up differently. You know, there's this old saying about how paradigms change one funeral at a time. Maybe that's what it takes. Maybe, you know, our generations, when they pass away, maybe some, it's a much better"

There is a neo-Nazi movement, however much they may deny their history. This still continues. We have to accept the fact that there are human beings who have this particular way of thinking about life and about other human beings, that there is a question of us and them. And it manifests in different ways, at different times. Otherwise, the shocking things that surfaced during Trump's time, didn't suddenly mushroom. They were always there.

I remember in a column again, I got trolled for using the term closet bigots, because my sense was that what social media did was it led to what the sociologist Timur Kuran once called a preference cascade. Timur Kuran wrote this book Public Lies, Private Truths in 99, where he spoke about this phenomenon called preference falsification that people feel a certain way, but they don't express it. Right. So you might feel that a woman's place is in the kitchen, but you won't express it. You'll be, you know, you'll show because you feel that you'll get condemned too much. But I think what social media did was that it showed a lot of closet bigots, that there were other closet bigots out there. And in fact, they were the majority. And in fact, everybody was like that. And it leads to a preference cascade where they can express their bigotry openly. You don't need dog whistles anymore. It's not necessary. You can shout it out in public and, you know, express it openly and it is what it is.

So I'm not going to wish that to you, but I'll get you some ghee after this recording is over. No, you know, what you said is so resonant because I've on my show, it's almost a cliche how often I talk of the vocal minority and the silent majority. Though in the vocal minority, I don't include only bhakts, I also include vokes, you know, the extremes on both left and right. But I think the silent majority, one would hope are more sensible. They just want to stay away from the polarized noise out there. And perhaps there is hope there. I want to talk about something else, another field in which you've been a pioneer, which you know intimately, and which has also changed recently in worrying ways, and that's journalism. Right. And my first question to you is that, I guess when you first got into journalism, it must have been with the excitement that I'll write, I'll earn a salary, I'll write about interesting things. You know, initially, I think you even ran a cookery column for right at the start, and then evolved from there to the extent that you were, you know, the arts editor at the Times of India in the late 80s, you gave a start to various journalists like Ranjith Hoskote, Arundhati Suramanian, Jerry Pinto, all of these people are kind of, you know, came up in that time. And there was a that beef flourishing period for the next few years from there, where, you know, I remember the Indian Post and Independent and all of that, and you had so much arts coverage. And it was as a young man, at that time reading those, it was so delightful to, you know, have all that there. And all that has suddenly kind of changed. And in the sense that, you know, the term Godi media, of course, is popular as media that is sold out. And there are sort of two ways of looking at it, both positive and negative. And the negative way is that if you look at the power of the state today, and it's always been much too powerful, but if you, you know, today, if you're a mainstream media house, you have too much to lose, you don't just run a newspaper, you've also got a chemical factory, there can be an income tax rate there. So you have no option but to toe the line. And, you know, even at the time of Indira Gandhi, there is that famous quote about how the press was asked to bend and they chose to crawl, you know, and we see a similar thing happening there. And that's a negative part of it. But the positive side of it is also that the tools of production are in everybody's hands. You know, we do have independent people like Alt News and News Minute and Scroll and so on who are still kind of fighting the good fight, and there is still scope for that. But there is a larger question that kind of bothers me, which is that, what is the central dharma of journalism, in a sense, like I can look at medicine and say that a doctor's dharma is to help his patients in whatever way he can, you know, and so on. But for journalism, it seems that at one hand is that cold business of supply and demand that people want to receive a particular kind of news and your job is to supply to that demand. And on the other side, there is a view that no, it is a higher calling, you know, pursuit of truth has a value of its own. And that is what you're pursuing and how you make that work financially is up to you. But truth is at the heart of it and it matters. And even there, they can then be that separate question of what do I mean by truth? Because a lot of the headlines that you will see on the news sites are truthful. You know, Jhanvi Kapoor went to the spa today. It is truthful, but is it newsworthy? You know, one of my favorite episodes I've done recently is with the journalist Samad Bansal, who talks about the difference between what is newsworthy and what is truthful, you know, the difference between what is journalism and what is content, you know, so what are you know, how did so really a two part question and one part is that, where did you get your values from, in a sense of what constitutes good journalism? What was that value? Where did you get it from? And what was it? And the second part is that, how have you seen it changing today? Because we can say bad things, we can say good things, it's it's all a mess. And in addition to that, there is a fact that there is the mainstream has completely collapsed. There is no consensus on the truth everywhere there are narrative battles. So, you know, what were the values of journalism which you imbibed to start with? And what was it like then? And how has that changed today?"

And it stems from the press being called the fourth column of democracy. There was a reason why it was called that. And today, I think the least that the press can do is to disclaim that description of itself, because it is no longer that. If, for instance, democracy is to present balanced analyses, and to take into consideration every important event that is happening in the country, how can you say that a paper is being democratic by front-paging, second-paging, third-paging, and edit-paging one set of people and sort of perhaps giving a couple of small columns to something called the Bharat Chodho Yatra, which is a huge thing. What's happening? If that is not selling out, what is selling out? Whatever your reasons for selling out. And the finger now has to be pointed at the centre, because that is where all the pressure is coming from. There are blacklists prepared by the central government of journalists who are not on their side. And those blacklists are presented to editors, and they're told clearly that we don't like this chap, we don't like this woman, so control them, please. And they're controlled. A friend of mine who has written a column for the last 20 years is suddenly told that her column will be spiked if two names appear. Those two names are not to appear in the column. This is a directive that comes from the editor, and because the editor has received such a directive from this high power. So, fine, we understand. We read the paper and take everything with a pinch of salt. I turn over many of the first pages, because they all have the same picture on them, and the same claims being made for the person in the picture. So, it's like one capsule, one person capsule that's flying around. And that's not news for me. And no journalist who is working will say, yes, we are giving news. They know what they're doing. Some of them are helpless. Some of them leave and go to these independent channels. Some of them stick on, because many of them are of that opinion. And at last, the editor isn't saying you have to be balanced. The editor is saying be unbalanced. We want this imbalance, because this is what gets us ads. This is what stops raids from happening. So, it's okay. It's the reality, and we accept it. But I will say that whereas this isn't called an emergency, the two years when it was called that, there was still a newspaper which thought it could stick its neck out and carry a blank page, as a front page. Let's see a single newspaper do that today. So, it is a huge and consistently running emergency."

And then at one point in early 2020 or late 2019, I had written a piece critical of the regime. And I got a call from the editor of that page and she was almost in tears. And she said that Amit I'm calling you because you know, they would send a playback of the text because I knew I didn't like changes. So it would have to go through me first. So she said before I send the playback, I thought I should call you because there is one sentence I've just been forced to cut, because our editor got her boss, the big big editor, obviously got a message from people somewhere saying that you you know, you that you better chill out. These guys are too critical of us. And, and I think Akar and me were, you know, picked out for special mention, which I guess is an honour. And she said that I have to cut this line out.

And one the rest of the column was also critical that one line didn't actually make so much of a difference. And part of my reasoning was that listen, if I walk away from the space, but you know, someone close to the regime might come there. So why give it up just keep fighting as long as you can. And I did write a couple more columns. In fact, the the Ministry of Ayush sent an official complaint against me because I wrote a column about the nonsense they do and how it should be abolished with their so called alternative medicine.

But if at 80, you're still okay, then obviously you are specially blessed by God. If you don't have that imaginary figure on whom to sort of hang all your fears and all your hopes, then left to yourself, you become a realist, don't you? You face up to the fact, you realise that in case you want to change your dark skin, you cannot, because you've read the story about the crow and scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed and still remain black. And you've learned your lesson very early on that this cannot be changed. Then many of my friends regularly applied turmeric to their faces because that was supposed to make them fair. I didn't. I mean, I was living in an environment where all of this was being practised, but I didn't feel the need. I was fine as I was. So then I think the whole hippie movement, which made me think of nudity and what is nudity and why do we cover ourselves up and what are we ashamed of? Are we ashamed or is it something else? And that's when I lost my, if I had any shame at all about my body, I lost it totally. And I remember that it was shocking to this company doctor. I've talked about him in my book. And the first time I went to him and he said, Ms. Gokhale, please undress. And I could, of course, have questioned him why that was necessary, but I knew exactly why it was necessary for him. He wanted to look at me undressed. And I said, yeah, sure. Call your nurse in and can you step out, please? So he hadn't, you know, first of all, for a moment to see through. Secondly, for her to insist on her right to have a female around and to send him out of his own clinic. I could see the shock on his face because what he normally expected was the woman would blush and get embarrassed and say, doctor, please, why? And all of that would give him a great deal of pleasure. Because causing a woman to blush means that you have transmitted the ideas in your head and she has received them and is responding. And it's an assertion of your power. Yes. And it's totally sick. So when I said this, the nurse came in and she had a twinkle in her eyes and I said to her, you know, I've come to him for something that's gone in my eye. Do I need to undress? She said, of course not. Just sit there. And I sat in the chair. She went and told the doctor she has something in her eye, doctor. So I told her there's no need to undress. But I really, I simply can see through what a man is actually asking for. And I have to play a game. And I think I've gotten very good at playing these games. So body has, in that sense, been my greatest companion, my greatest friend. And whenever I say to people, I'm listening to my body, I don't think I want to eat anymore. And they think it's some kind of new age stuff, which it isn't. It's just realistic. I know when I say I'm listening to my body, I know my body. And I have taken, I think I made an effort to get acquainted with it. In the 70s, there was this feminist initiative to go out to women's groups and acquaint them with their own bodies, with pictures and charts. And I know all these, for instance, I remember a picture of a group of Rajasthani women with their hands across their mouths, giggling away and looking at these pictures of themselves. This is who you are. So the feminist thing also kicks in, in the way that you look at your body."

For me too, the human body when alive houses all the intangibles that spell what is human emotions, desires, passions, aspirations, ideas, creativity. But once it dies, they die with me. There is no such thing as a soul. This is not a depressing thought for me. It is how it is. But the other is not a thought one can simply toss off either. Many fine minds have argued in favor of the soul and its continued existence after death. I have tested my beliefs against theirs and found that at some stage, the word faith creeps into the argument. It is a concept of faith that I have a quarrel with. Faith does not strike me as a given without which you cannot live. Faith is a choice. The one who needs it lives by it and for it. The one who doesn't gets by pretty well without. There is no reason why you cannot live in and for the here and now in the best way you know, and be prepared to done with it once life ends, stop quote. And in many ways, this is like, I'm also an atheist and rationalist and all of those things. And this is also a dilemma that I face that I cannot find false certainties very often that you know, one has to face up to the fact that when someone goes, they are gone. That when that a time will come when I myself will be gone. And, you know, and then you begin to question that, you know, there is a meaning in the things that you do. And of course, my I'm not nihilistic in that sense. My way of thinking about the world is you take you take joy in all the little things that you find around you and you enjoy the work for its own sake, and so on and so forth. But how is it sort of, you know, have there been times where you have wished that you weren't this way that you could actually believe or have there been times where you look around you and you see that everyone else is so delusional? And then you wonder if maybe in a way, you've just chosen a separate kind of delusion. I mean, how does you know, you've also had that cancer scare where you had cancer, you had chemo, surgery, radiation, all of that, you know, what did you tell yourself in those times?"

And it was the one time when somewhere the thought came, I wish I believed in God, because at this point of time, I would have liked to find solace in saying to God, please save him. But no, I didn't feel that need. And because one of the things that my father always said, when I die, don't cry. There's no need. Of course, he didn't ever expect to die young. Dying young, he was only 56 and dying when your time has come are two different things. You certainly, I could understand his saying, you know, if you've lived a full life and you die, it's a natural thing to happen. And it's a good thing to happen. Because beyond that can be suffering. And you've escaped that. So it's a source of happiness, actually. But it didn't apply to my father dying at 56. And at that moment, I did not cry. It came later. But I also didn't feel the need to pray for his life. So clearly, I was totally convinced and I lived my belief. It wasn't something I had thought out and it stayed at mind level and didn't affect the rest of me. It did. That's how I have been totally."

Turned out that one of the nephews was an atheist. And at that point of time, the woman had turned to God. And I think she was influenced by a friend of hers. And perhaps being single, not having children, it filled some kind of a void in her. And this man decided she had gone mad. And he said to me, he sat across from me and said, you will understand because you care for her so much. She's gone after God now. So, I said, no, I don't get your point. She's earning, she's feeding herself. Is she dependent on you? What kind of power do you have over her and her beliefs and thoughts? You don't. And then she told me, she said that he slapped me. And then I got really upset. I said, how dare you? You just get out of my house. Then her, the rest of her family came. We had a conference. It was decided that these people will no longer stay with her. And they were packed off to the village.

And within that, there will be two separate sections examining the books that have meant the most to me. So, one section will be the three big novels, Madame Bovary, Middlemarch, and Anarkare Nina. And I've been rereading and studying and marking and making notes and thinking. So, it's and all these three novels happen to have been written in the same period of time, but in totally different spaces and cultures. And the differences in culture are reflected very strongly in each of them. So, it will be a study of them as novels, as reflective of their cultures and their places, classics and why. So, that's one section. And another section devoted to Brothers Karamazov by itself. So, these will be two solid sections and the rest will be about reading, the pleasures of reading, the pleasures of buying books, of fresh books with their smells, and secondhand books with their little jottings and notings in the margins. All of that just a magic of buying books. So, it's, I don't know, it's, I've written about 30,000 words so far. And I think there's still"

But to tell you the truth, I am very scared now of publishing, because you think that you've written and that's it, but now it isn't it. A, you have to go through those proofs. And if there's one thing I dislike doing is reading what I have written. And the even more painful thing is being part of the publicity. Only yesterday, I had a call from someone who's publishing a huge book of compilation of long essays about various aspects of the country for the last 75 years. And the request was for me to allow them to shoot me talking about the idea of the book, which wasn't mine. So, those who mooted this idea should be talking about it and talking about my contribution. And I said to her, I can't bear talking about what I've written. Others should talk about it. And I really thought afterwards that if they gave me five essays from the book, I'd talk about them and someone else could talk about my essay. But it is now all about self-promotion.

I don't think any Marathi publisher would stretch himself to that. So, all that is in my mind. In fact, even a room of one's own is crying for translation. But I keep thinking that somehow it's like rubbing salt into wounds, because 80% people in our country are living in two-room tenements. And here I am talking about the luxury for room of one's own for one woman. And 500 pounds, which is still so much in India. Yes. So, that's cancelled out that project.
