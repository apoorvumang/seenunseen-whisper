        "message": "2021 is behind us and 2022 is here. The end of a year, the beginning of another. How much significance does it have? A date is arbitrary after all, and there should be no difference between January 1 and say, September 4. But sometimes in our lives, the milestone of a date can be useful. Mentally, it can help us leave the past behind and start again. The last couple of years have been tough for most of us. I've experienced personal loss, seen my friends and family and everyone around me suffer, and at times it felt endless. The pandemic was more of a sheer trauma for this country than even the horrors of partition that was restricted to a few areas, while COVID entered every corner of this nation. I think every single Indian must know someone personally who died in this time. That is such a terrifying thought. But we have to move ahead. If we cannot live in hope, we cannot live at all. And one of the things that gives me hope is technology. I'm not just referring to medical science, which came up with so many effective vaccines and made this nightmare shorter than it would have been 10 years ago. I'm also referring to everyday tech, which has empowered individuals, especially individual creators. Creators today have the means of production in their own hands. They don't need intermediaries to reach their audiences, and there are no gatekeepers to tell them what they may not do. I've experienced this myself as a creator, and it's been a blessing. Now, along with the hope this may give us, we also need the willpower to do something about it, to not languish anymore, but snap out of our funk and get down to using our time in productive ways. I'm still figuring out how to do this. But I will learn and I will move forward. And I hope you do as well."

He's a creator, humorist, cartoonist, an ex-advertising man, a digital marketing guru, a prolific podcaster, a prolific writer, a music maven, and a teacher and mentor to many. He's also learned a lot about productivity, especially through the latest of his podcasts, Getting Meta. So I thought it would be great to have Chuck on the show to share some of his insights on productivity, so that people like me could get cracking on our New Year resolutions right away. He came home to my home studio, we started talking, and we couldn't stop. We spoke for more than four hours on a bunch of subjects including music, the creator economy, comedy in India, advertising and digital marketing, and much, much more. Our conversation contained multitudes. In fact, this episode is probably too short because despite being podcasters ourselves, we did not speak at all about podcasting, maybe later in 2022. Before we begin this conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break. One of the things I've learned most over the last year and a half is sharing my insights on my two greatest passions, writing and podcasting. And I'd love to invite you to be a part of this journey. Registration is now open for the January cohort of the Art of Clear Writing, where over four webinars on four Saturdays, I teach all I know about the art and craft of writing compelling prose, much interaction, many exercises, and at the end of it, you get to join the Clear Writing community, an online community formed by the 18 previous cohorts of this course. In that community, we have book clubs, workshops, writing prompts with feedback and much else. I am also doing a special cohort of my podcasting course, the Art of Podcasting, which I had conducted for three cohorts last year before I took a break. All my learnings from five years of the seen and the unseen in three webinars over three Sundays. For more details and to sign up for my writing course, head on over to IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. To sign up for my podcasting course, go to seen unseen.in slash learn. These links will also be at the bottom of the show notes. These are exciting times for the creator economy, and I'd love to help you be a part of it."

One is a lazy boy, one is a gaming chair, he took the lazy boy, and he was offered a free foot massage, not by any interns I have around for I have none but by this lovely machine that I have picked up, which my editor, the great Gaurav Chintamani of Advaita fame has actually sampled in such a way that he told me that listen, you want to do an episode with the foot massager on I'll just edit the sound clean out I've sampled that thing. But Chuck wasn't keen to get his foot massaged right at the moment. We'll come to it later. But let's start as I start all my episodes by asking the guest about the Beatles, which is slight googly there. But just before the recording, we were talking about the you know, get back the new documentary on the Beatles by Peter Jackson and the unseen footage and, and you had an interesting point to make about Sgt. Peppers. And I wanted to hear more of it, but it was time to start the recording."

Peppers is probably the Beatles most well known album, jury is still out as to whether it's the best album that's up for debate, of course, and most influential probably and because it changed the direction of music and their careers in many ways. What I find interesting about it when and I love analyzing things like this reading about rock history and just you know, doing what ifs with respect to the history and all that is that if the Beatles started off that way, you know, super experimental and all that I'm not sure whether rock history would be the same with a beat whether the Beatles would be the same and all that before Sgt. Peppers and perhaps even the two albums that preceded that, they built up a massive following on the back of doing safe music, very good music, but still fairly safe music. And they built up a huge following which meant that an experiment album like Sgt. Peppers had a wide audience to go with rather than say somebody like King Crimson who comes right off the bat with the weirdest possible stuff, which doesn't find that much of an audience, and they never went mainstream. So I always think, what if Sgt. Peppers was the first or what are the Beatles discography was actually reverse in some way. So yeah, I think about things like this once in a while."

And, you know, they needed Please Please Me as their first number one and all of that interface to evolve to the point where, you know, Sgt. Peppers was even possible. And like, obviously, I think you're right, if Sgt. Peppers was it was their first album for some by some"

And by the way, we use safe music in air quotes over here. So please don't troll both of us over here. The first few albums sounded simple, but there's actually there's actually a fair bit happening over there with respect to chord changes and all that. We set the even the early Beatles apart. But if you look at even bands like say Genesis, yes, to some extent, they started off complex, and then they became more poppy, if I may, it's a travesty that a progressive band like yes, their most famous song is actually a fairly poppy number. And same with many of the others, give weather now that's whether they're getting old or whether there's giving into commercial mandates, whatever the case may be, the Beatles could have started off the same way what they came up with, what if they came off the bat with a weird album like Sgt. Pepper before George Martin and the executors at EMI sat down and said, please make something that moves units. So, you know, again, all thought experiments, all the things"

One of the things like, so I'm listening to a lot of Floyd right now, because I've got a lovely new pair of headphones and what better band than Floyd to explore that on. And one of the facts that always blows me away is that the album that made Floyd, The Dark Side of the Moon was actually their eighth album. Yeah, right. Which is bang in the middle of the discography. Actually, if you look chart, the discography is actually falls in the second half of their career. Which band today would have the luxury of mucking around for seven albums before finding quote unquote, their sound. So I mean, bands today are expected to be great from the word go. Whereas if you look at some of the greatest bands in history, they took a good three, four albums before eventually finding their sound, be it the Deep Purples of the world, or be it many of the progressive bands, Floyd is the best example of it, they needed to muck around for all that time before finding the sound. So again, all just thought experiments, all just what ifs in the world of music, and that to just rock music, not even the broader scene of pop, and all that. So yeah, I just love thinking"

        "message": "about things like this. Yeah, I mean, a couple of threads come up from what you just said. And one of them goes back to something that Steve Van Zandt said, the E Street Band guitarist for Bruce Springsteen in an interview some time back where he said that rock is no longer mainstream. It was mainstream for like 30 years, mid 60s to perhaps when Nirvana came out with Sounds Like Teen Spirit. And after that, it's no longer part of the mainstream. And I look at entertainment today, it seems to me that one of the things that has happened in the last 30 years, and I don't think that rock not being mainstream is necessarily part of this phenomenon. I mean, the whole music industry is a separate thing with many other forces. But I think one of the things that has happened is that there is less and less that is actually mainstream, like there's a fragmentation of tastes, there's a fragmentation of genres, you know, like, I was mentioning on one of my earlier shows to someone that on YouTube, you know, we think YouTube is one thing, right? It has what it has, and everybody can access all of it. But it's interesting. So on YouTube, I have an algorithm, which I mean, I love the default algorithm, because it kind of gives me whatever stuff that I enjoy. But I wanted to enter some right wing rabbit holes to see what the hell is happening there. And I didn't want it to mess up my algorithm. So I opened incognito window, another Gmail account and entered that and now that's a different algorithm. That's the same algorithm, but it's serving up a completely different feed to me. And I realized that everybody actually gets completely different YouTubes because of the algo and that starts with the first choice you make. And then you go off in random directions. And similarly, I think in popular culture, there is this fragmentation of days. And I wonder if that means either the death of the mainstream, or the winnowing down of the mainstream to something that is very safe and cuts across like the whole Marvel movies kind of thread that's come down. I mean, most of Hollywood, mainstream cinema is you're just following those franchises. And otherwise, I think it's a golden age of cinema. Because if you look at independent cinema, and what's happening across the world is mind blowing the tools of production are open to independent filmmakers is great work happening out there. So in the context of music, which you follow closely, do you think that there's something to this? Like, do you look back and say that, like, when we grew up, there was a mainstream, you knew who the big bands were? Yeah. And they were damn successful, even if they weren't like your Michael Jackson or Madonna. And you also knew your Michael Jackson and Madonna and big pop artists who dominated the charts were, and it was really clear. Yeah. Do you feel that in some way that landscape has changed? And not, it's not necessarily a bad thing. You know, there are many more, there'll be many more niches, there'll be much more scope for different"

        "message": "kinds of art. Yeah. But what's your sense? No, I completely agree. So even if Okay, let's take the micro example of say, rock music, right, and then you can pretty much extrapolate that to any other form of art, really. And there are several reasons for this in the early in the 70s, 80s and 90s, right, which is where a lot of bands were built. They were built, and I think the word has to be used, they were marketed by record executives who had who had to put more eggs in, in a fewer baskets. So you had bands like Kiss or even to not not Nirvana, really, but even before that Van Halen, the all the bands of the 80s, like Bon Jovi, etc, Def Leppard, all of these were incessantly marketed and hyped up by the record labels, because they needed to succeed because they needed to move volumes of physical product. And that, of course, started changing with respect to the internet and all that changing tastes and everything. But what you're seeing now is fewer big artists across the board, right, you may have some huge names, like say, a Taylor Swift or Beyonce or whoever the, you know, Ed Sheeran's of the world who are guaranteed to sell out stadiums, etc, wherever they go, but everywhere else, you are likely to have very tribal and for once on this podcast, we may use tribal in a positive way in a good way. Very, very passionate followings for very niche genres. For example, I am a huge fan of a genre called progressive metal, I'm wearing the t shirt of a band called Ne Oblivisaris. And my objective of coming on to the show, by the way, Amit was just to say Ne Oblivisaris on air, which is a progressive metal band from Australia that uses a violin, right. So now people who like their genre absolutely adore what they do. And when I say adore, what do I mean, it's not just about buying the music. Yes, buying the music, buying the music, I have friends of mine who are patreons of these guys and actually order vinyls and make it viable for a band to make a living maybe not become superstars. I think that era is over. Unless of course, you're aiming for the Ed Sheeran kind of music, but make enough of a living to continue doing what they are touring to say, audiences of 200-300 across the world. That happens. And I think that's happening across the board. There are platforms like say Bandcamp, which allow musicians to put up their album for sale so that fans who connect with them enough can actually buy the album, so that artists get more of the money. All these kinds of things are happening. And I believe the same is true of not just other genres of music, but across art, for instance, there are so many platforms for things like anime and specific followers of certain kinds of visual design, for example. I think it's fascinating, though, the way this fragmentation is happening, like you said, it is absolutely true. So and it's a lot of factors, right? It's because of the changing imperatives of record labels, the economics of streaming. One resource that I can give immediately for anyone who's interested in this topic is there's a fantastic podcast called The Ongoing History of New Music. It's by a Canadian journalist called music journalist called Alan Cross. And he delves into a lot of this. Why are there no big superstars anymore in the in the space of music? Because of streaming, what are the it's very interesting, what are the second order effects of things like that? So absolutely fascinating, you know, very analytical look at music and its evolution in a broader context and with the context of say, an individual band like say a Pearl Jam or the Beatles or something like that. Even doing thought experiments like, okay, if we take this band out of music history, how do things change? And those things are fascinating because in the world of music is usually something very small or seemingly small in the larger scheme of things that's led to a whole chain of things later. Like for example, and heavy metal fans will know this, what if Tony Iommi never had that finger accident, he would have never detuned his guitar, heavy metal would have sounded completely different if at all birthed at all. So yeah, all these butterfly effects sort of things, I think, work in the space of art more than anything else."

And something you said about them sparked off another thought where you said that their fans absolutely adore them. Yeah. And now I find that very interesting, because the other thing that I think has happened and tell me if you agree with this, is that earlier, you had these few big names would make it nothing for the long tail. And those few big names would yes, it would be worshipped by some at a distance. But for a lot of people, the engagement would be kind of shallow. You listen to them in the background, and that's it, you know. And what I find today is that when you go deeper and deeper into these kind of different niches, the absolute numbers go down, but the level of engagement goes up a lot. Like just in podcasting, you know, if you if I was to try to sell this podcast as a radio show back in 1995, obviously, there are no takers for a four hour conversation. Now today, and thankfully, the absolute numbers are also fairly decent right now. But the level of engagement is crazy, right? Which is something I noticed more and more with like a lot of the consumer that I follow the vlogs I watch or the music I listen to or whatever, I'm just way more engaged than I was at an earlier point in time. And this also leads me to thinking about, you know, you were musing about how Dark Side of the Moon was their eighth album, and they were already more than mid career. And in today's day and age, would they have got seven albums to do what they were doing? Now, I think one thing about music back in the day was that it was very record label dependent, it was dependent on big business, right? So tell me a bit about whether that has changed because my sense of the creator economy in general, is that these intermediaries and these platforms are irrelevant. Creators can directly reach users, they can directly build their community, they can directly monetize it monetize seems like a very cold word, but in the sense every community values the creators and, you know, that exchange can happen. Is that also true for music? Like how do musicians make their money? Like if Roger Waters and Dave Gilmour are sitting today and they're forming Pink Floyd, are they going to reach an eighth album?"

        "message": "If record labels aren't interested? That's an interesting question. And I won't speak on behalf of the music industry, because I am not completely sure how that entire dynamic sort of works. But one thing is absolutely certain what you said, okay, let's take the hypothetical situation that the Pink Floyd is, and I used the Pink Floyd, are an unknown entity right now, they've just got out of wherever Cambridge and all that, and they have just started, they have just started say mucking around. So what do they do, they create, say, a SoundCloud, or they put up stuff on YouTube and things like that, there will be and even if you take Gilmour out of the equation and go all the way back to early Floyd, so Syd Barrett and all that, and by the way, if there's anyone who has no clue about what we're talking about, just just know that the early Floyd albums were extremely experimental. And definitely not everyone's cup of tea or saucer full of secrets. Just had to work that nicely done. I'm very proud of myself for that. No, the thing is, I think even that weirdness would have found a niche, I think they would have found an audience, as long as it stuck to what they were doing. And they did it with some level of conviction. I think the I think weirdness has a way of finding an audience in this day and age, right? As long as they continue doing this all sorts of amazing content out there just a few weeks back. My wife introduced me to a channel hosted by a Nepali graphic designer whose entire shtick is creating mock book covers and giving random commentary while doing it. It is insanely compelling content. And one of the things that we are binging right now is a pet groomer, giving the most colorful in the in the in the good way, commentary while while, you know, grooming, grooming pets, like, it's amazing to imagine that this is actually content, like if you take a step back and think about it, like, groomers have been doing this for years for centuries, maybe. And this is now she's crossed a million subscribers recently. And there's nothing outstanding about what she does. She's very good at what she does. And it's weirdly compelling content. So to go back to our hypothetical situation, as long as Gilmore and Waters or Barrett, whatever that combination was, as long as they stuck to what they were doing, and that conviction in it, and they found another bunch of weirdos to sort of go along with the ride, that would definitely happen. I think, again, the community wouldn't be all that huge, but it would be there. And given, you know, the internet, it's unlikely that they would stick to just doing music, they may do something else that branches off into, they may do a weird podcast, for instance, right, or create weird reels, or whatever the compulsions of the day are, for them to maintain themselves, they would do something like that. And you can also be sure that the moment they start becoming quote, unquote, popular, with echoes, dark side of the moon, etc, you'll have those, you'll have many of the same guys saying, Oh, you guys have sold out, and all that. So I'm very sure they would be able to make it. But again, to what scale, not very sure they may be a much smaller brand, they may be like how I'm talking about this band that possibly nobody else has heard of, for example. So it's very interesting to think about how these things could happen. But one thing's for sure, I don't think a record label would give them such a long leash of seven albums to find the sound and even the sound that we're talking about is dark side of the moon, I don't think dark side of the moon would have been would have made it as an album standalone today to somebody who hasn't heard.

This one scene in which and this is not a spoiler where he plays yesterday, right? And his friends are around him. And everybody's jaws are dropping like, Wow, did you write that? And it's like, yeah, I mean, but no, I mean, it's a, it's a Paul McCartney song, like who? And you know, it goes and then it's one of the greatest songs ever written. It's a good song, but it's not all that great. I mean, it's not, it's not Coldplay great. And then this guy's outreach, but then you just step back for a moment. Yesterday is very huge, because not just because of the quality of the song, but also what it means culturally, popularly and all that. When somebody listens to Dark Side of the Moon today, they are going to have a recommendation of somebody says, bro, you're listening to one of the greatest albums of all time. So you're already coming in with some bias, right? What if you listen to Dark Side of the Moon, not knowing it was one of the greatest albums of all time? How would your experience be different? I genuinely do not know. One of the things I used to do while listening to music, and I have this habit of listening to bands chronologically, I used to bias myself by reading a lot of reviews before jumping into the album. So I knew what to expect. And I realized that colored by experience a lot. And like, oh, the song that everyone says is great. I didn't think was all that great. So now my new approach is listening to it first, and then going back and seeing whether and many of the times like, wow, what a great song. This is didn't even get a passing mention on the review. So I don't know where we started from over here. But could Gilmore and Waters continue making music? If they started off today? I think they would, but I don't think they would be selling stadiums. For sure. They would have a very strong Patreon base. But that's it. I don't think I think too much has changed the way music is the also the era, right? I don't think that that acid fueled kind of music, which was so 60s 70s would have worked in this sort of era. So many things put together. So you learn that these thought experiments, there are several, there's a lot of context behind success at one point of time, I guess that makes sense."

But the other good part is they make you examine these contexts deeper. You know, I just think that maybe they would have made a different kind of music today. Maybe they would have made hip hop, you don't know, because they had a palette of sounds in their consciousness to work with. And from that palette, they create the particular music that they do. But today, they would have had a completely different palette of sounds to work with and would have worked with that. So you don't know where they're going. Like, you know, in one of the webinars for my writing course, I talk about Shakespeare. And the point I make is that that guy was a dude. If he was alive today, you know, he would have blown everybody out of the water. Because not only is it great art, but he was a box office superstar of his day. He was Yash Chopra plus Steven Spielberg plus Ed Sheeran, as you just mentioned, who I think is a really fine songwriter. I won't diss him just because he's popular. There's this great video I came across where he's talking about his Van Morrison influence, right. And Van Morrison is like my all time, whatever, just adore Van Morrison, as it were. So Sheeran's talking about the Van Morrison influence. And it's like a 10-12 minute video, I'll play it. Then he talks about how he gets the idea for a song and his initial chords are very Van Morrissey when he plays them. But then he says how he changes it around a little bit to make it more Marcy. And it's one of his big hits, Thinking Out Loud, right, which is such a poppy song. But once you get that Van Morrison connection, you're like, wow. And then you think that, wow, this guy is serious. You know, he took that and he made it into this. I'll link that long video"

        "message": "Yeah, yeah. Like in my, in the webinar where I talk about Shakespeare, right at the end, I play Pink Floyd performing Shakespeare, which is actually not Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd is Dave Gilmore singing Shakespeare's Sonnet 18. Wow. And it's great, right. And I point them to another video, which is on YouTube, I think by this guy called Akala, where he's giving a lecture on hip hop. And at about the five minute mark there, he performs Sonnet 18 to hip hop. Wow. Right. So you realize a universality to what Shakespeare wrote, right? Because he really wrote the hardcore, simple language of his time. He really, you know, took the rhythms of everyday speech and wrote in that. And that's why he's so great. And this is like, I don't know if you've thought about this, you must have. While sort of thinking about all of this, I realized that, like number one, one of the points I try to underscore to my writing students, and I realized this, as I was putting together the course, I realized it even harder is that words, of course, have a music of their own, right? People are reading from a book, they think it's only visual, but they always sub vocalizing without realizing it, reading it out in their head. So words have a music of their own. Now, when it comes to songwriting, it's actually really interesting because the words have a music of their own. And then on top of that, you put music, right? And it's really interesting to then look at the great songwriters and see how they are doing their stuff and how the two come together. Like when Dylan is saying the answer, my friend is blowing in the wind, right? And everything there works so perfectly. It's not like Dylan thought consciously about it, but you know, blowing in the wind, you know, it's ending with that mute sound. He doesn't say the response comrade is wafting in the breeze. Yeah, you know, which is the example I give of bad writing, because all of those words we don't use in our everyday speech, but he's keeping it simple and having a powerful impact. The answer my friend is blowing in the wind and all the music just go"

        "message": "together and enhance. Absolutely. And yeah, absolutely. Because you also realize how different songwriters approach music differently. Like there are some musicians who write the lyrics first, I'm assuming Bob Dylan is one of those. You have others who think of the melody first and then fit in words later. And sometimes those words could be absolute nonsense, because they don't care about the lyrics all that much for them is more about the music. Noel Gallagher of Oasis, one of my favorite bands is notorious for doing that the lyrics don't mean too much, but it's really about the music, the cadence and all that. And then you even when you start digging even deeper, one of the things that sets another one of my favorite bands Iron Maiden apart is the they don't they don't sound like any other heavy metal band. And that's because their primary songwriter happens to be a bassist, which is something that's very unique in the world of rock and heavy metal. So you kind of realize how different songwriters approach, you know, approach these things differently. And it's kind of it's kind of fascinating to think about this, actually, you grow up listening to this music. And then, then once you're older and more mature, and more mature, and you open up lyrics, you open up song meanings and genius.com for everything that you do, for everything that you listen to, and then you say, Oh, oh, wow, okay, now this makes sense. Okay, because it's happened. Okay, fine. It knowing this little tidbits, I think just adds more to music. So anyone who is looking to rediscover music or something of that sort, one thing I highly recommend is just open, just opening up the lyrics, even if you're not a lyrics person, or opening up sites that give you what the meanings of the lyrics are. And for me, those go to places are song meanings and genius, there's usually a lot of song facts, and all that, which adds a lot of color to the, you know, music, the, especially for bands like the Beatles, one thing I love about the Beatles is how all their songs are pretty much just based on everyday ordinary, ordinary incidents. And knowing that just adds a lot more enjoyment to the music, you can almost, you know, feel john channeling that story of, you know, whatever x person and translating that into word, it's kind of, it's sort of like being in the studio with them when"

And there'll be some Beatles song where you can make out at one point, john is imitating Dylan. And the interesting thing is all of these takes would have actually been released had they been creators today, because they would have released everything.

Like Marcus Mumford did a lovely rendition of something called Kansas City. And it's really beautiful. So you have, you can actually in some of those videos, you can see the words in the original paper where Dylan has written them. And these guys were brought together and they were given three, four days or whatever. And they were cooped up and told, you know, and you can see the different things they do with it where and obviously a Marcus Mumford song is a Marcus Mumford song."

This is one thing that you're I've heard you say several times, which is the form often dictates your content, right? And music is a great example of that there is this, there are several studies showing that because of the Spotify era, right now, how does Spotify pay artists, I mean, whatever they pay, it is after 30 seconds of streaming. So I actually came across a band recently that makes music, which is between 30 and 35 seconds each. So they just released a Beatles tribute album, which has 100 songs, all of which are between 30 and 35 seconds. And the logic for that, hey, if Spotify is paying us for 30 seconds, why bother making more? And it's hard to argue with that logic. Because you may say, Oh, back in the day, people used to make 10 hour long sona or whatever. But back then, the imperatives were different. Like even, I mean, you will find some equivalent of some heresy like this happening back then itself, because they needed to fit it on an LP. Why fit it on recorded music, actual music should be experienced live where you can play forever. So yeah, I think there's another fascinating layer to add on top of that. And I think we should stop that discussion of music over there. Otherwise, we'll go on talking about music itself, which is how the form dictates"

And now people are just releasing singles and putting it out there. And what you pointed out is what you think of as an album and what you romanticize was dictated by how many songs you can actually stick on that damn thing called an LP. And each of the songs therefore is also dictated by, you know, what radios will play and all of that. So ultimately, 10 songs or four minutes each or whatever it is, is dictated by physical constraints. Why do we think of those old forms like even writers I remember, you know, so I've kind of wanted to write books on my life and not written any except one shitty one, but I'll redeem myself for that soon. But now when I think about it, I think why books? Why put that on a pedestal? Like if you're a writer, you had you have 800 word articles, you can think of today 10,000 word long forms, short stories have certain lengths."

The biggest platform for music discovery these days, at least for artists discovery for record executives in the US right now is actually tick tock. And I'm guessing this is something that you that you know, it's, it's very interesting how a song goes viral, for example, it may be because somebody converts it into a meme, or it has me mobility. So now just imagine songwriters not just now have to change incentives from okay, will it sound good on radio to okay, does it have a section in the lyrics where people can do some silly dance or something so they can go viral on tick tock, so that etc, etc. So again, a form dictates the content. And the second thing which I this, this I find really fascinating, while we can sit and argue about whether rock is mainstream, hip hop is mainstream, electronic is mainstream, music itself is getting it's behind kicked by this new thing called gaming, which is what people youngsters are spending more and more of their time on. So there's a lovely article headline I saw somewhere, I forget which website this was on probably Wired or Fast Company or one of those, which is something like gaming is the new hip hop or gaming. Gaming is basically this generation's rock music in terms of cultural relevance. It has occupied cultural relevance. And I think with all this metaverse things that's going to happen, it's just going to become even more, especially since we have a generation now that's being bred on platforms like Roblox. So absolutely fascinating. And then where does music come into this? Music is like, I think the future of music is more likely to be interactive experiences, like say that Marshmello Travis Scott doing a virtual concert inside Fortnite. I think the future is going to be something like that. And which just rips apart the concept of music as an audio format by itself, right? Who said it needs to be just an audio format, in some sense is going back to the time when music was performed live. And there was always a visual element along with the audio. And then came along Edison with his ideas and stripped"

We'll segue from music because you're right that wasn't part of the plan to talk so much about music. And maybe it adds in some future date, who knows, I want to go back to the Beatles to use that to segue from it, which is I think of the Beatles hamburgers. And what they did in hamburgers, you would know is that they went there as a young band. And Ringo wasn't part of the group then. So they had Stuart Sutcliffe, I think playing bass, and they had Pete Best on drums. And so it was a five man outfit as far as I recall. And they just played every freaking night that they would play multiple times a day, they just played and played and played and played. And it was iteration, iteration, iteration, all before they had their first song 10,000 hours, 10,000 hours to the max. And so I'll segue from this. It's a good theme for me, because I think one of the big lessons I learned and this must be something I'm sure that you share is that, you know, people often think that you learn a craft and find you practice it. But then once you're in the public eye, you just you put out only your best work and whatever. And one of the things I've realized is that the road to excellence is through constant freaking iteration. Like one insight I like to sort of talk about, I might even have spoken about it on episode one of Getting Meta is from that Ali Abdaal video. Yes, yes, of course. Well, I mean, the basic lesson is and Ali Abdaal did this video when he reached 100 million subs, and he shared the graph of how his subs went up. And it was an exponential graph. And at episode 50, he pointed out when he did two episodes a week for 26 weeks for half a year, he reached 1000 subs, which is nothing right. And his advice to creators was that just make two videos a week for two years with 200 videos and don't look at your subs count and just do it just iterate. And that's exactly what the Beatles did. And people discovered that I think by accident when they're just kind of doing something doing something and because they love it, you know, karna hai, you know, like when you when anyone takes up a guitar, for example, they're not playing it because on day one, they think they're going to be Eddie Van Halen. On day one, if you listen to yourself, you know, you can't, you know, but then on day 8000, you get there, you get there. Yeah. So let's kind of talk about the creator economy in the sense that at like, what are your big sort of learnings from being a creator? Because I think all the learnings I've got from being a creator are really in the last three or four years, even sooner than that, during the podcasting journey, like I wasn't actually taking a step back and getting meta as it were, and thinking about this stuff, you know, I was just doing things. And gradually, things happened. And I, and at some point, I took a step back. And I said, this is interesting. And let's kind of connect all the threads. Tell me about that sort of compressed journey of yours of being a creator and thinking deeply about"

        "message": "Yeah, that's, yeah, that's true, I guess. And there's also the connotation that you're doing something related to the internet. I don't think a journalist would be called as an old school journalist would be called a creator in that sense, although arguably, they're doing way, way more meaningful creation in that sense. So with respect to quote, unquote, content creation, I used to do random articles and cartoons, even from 2010 onwards, always freelanced in some capacity or the other and just trying out various kinds of things. And then podcasting came along the way, right, where I used to listen to a lot of the bugle at that point of time, which is a hilarious show hosted by Andy Zaltzman. Primarily, it used to be co hosted by John Oliver. And now of course, there's a rotating cast of comedians from around the world, including a couple of our own including Anupal, etc. So I had this idea of doing a podcast, but had no clue as to what I wanted to do. And through a series of accidents, which I'll spare listeners, I started ended up starting Simplified with Naren, which again, we didn't have too much of an idea of what we wanted, we didn't have too much of an ambition. And for us, it was just, okay, let's try this out and see what happens. Because I was always keen on doing something with Naren. And then it stuck, IBM threw us a lifeline. And I say lifeline, because we we desperately needed discipline more than recording equipment at the time, we were putting out episodes, which were which were like weeks, months apart. And finally, we managed to get some sort of a cadence going. And then from there, two more podcasts came in, came along the way, which are both individual shows. One is the origin of things, which is a short format show. And the other, of course, is Getting Meta, for which you were, of course, very kindly the first guest. And the name of the show, of course, came about during that first interview. And this was pre-Facebook doing whatever they did. So kindly people, yeah, somebody heard the show. Yeah. And along the way, a couple of other experiments happened as well. I started a newsletter, I created a course of my own, I'm not sure whether that counts as content creation as such. So here's the thing. So to answer your question, that was just to give you context to answer the question that you had asked. I think all of these, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing as I was going in. And I genuinely did not, I had no idea what the end outcome would be, I had a reasonable idea of what my second and third podcast would be. But I did that I can say that only because I had the confidence of having done 150 episodes from my previous show. Right? So otherwise, everything I started like the newsletter for the first time, absolutely no idea how this is going to turn out course as zero idea. I mean, when I started that course, it was an idea that a friend gave me saying that will you take will you teach a few of us digital marketing? I said, yeah, sure, I'll put some structure together and send it out to you guys and see if it works for you. I expected 10 people. And in that first batch, there were I think 130 or 140 people who signed up for it. And this was this was in 2020. For all of these, I just learned along the way. And I think that is the only way to go as long as you're genuine, as long as you are willing, as long as you are transparent about the fact that, hey, I might make mistakes, but I will make up for it. And I will make sure that you get your money or times worth, whatever the case may be. I think you're good, right? I think as long as you as long as you don't over promise, whether you're selling, or whether you're asking people for their time, which let's face it is probably way more valuable. I think you will be fine. I think you will be fine. I think that's my one lesson of, you know, you call me a creator of being a creator, just just start out, as you, you yourself said on the first episode of getting better, just start, then let and iterate along the way. And as long as you are, you are either enjoying it, or learning something, or ideally both, you will be fine. And six, give yourself a period of about six months or something like that to figure out whether it's all working out, whether audiences are reacting, whether you're getting what you wanted out of it. And it should be okay. Because what another thing I've also realized is that content creation in and of itself, doesn't necessarily need to be the end goal, like that could act as signaling for something else. For example, I have a paid digital marketing newsletter, it's not exactly a digital marketing newsletter, but on the periphery. Now, the fact that I run a newsletter is on something related to marketing is enough for some people to think that I might be able to help them out with respect to consulting, right? So doesn't matter whether they read what I write or not, it acts as signaling in some sense, for the fact that, hey, okay, if you're able to take a course on marketing, then you should be able to help me out with the problem my startup is having got many people writing to me for that. I've got many people writing, take the course and said, Yeah, your course and all is fine. But here's the stuff that I actually need your help for. That's happened a lot. So that's another learning for me that the content creation. Yeah, it's nice if you get to a million subscribers, or, you know, whatever number of views listens, whatever, but what, but what does it play for your life or your if I may use the after abuse, the phrase personal brand in the long run, I always think that these content pieces that somebody creates is just one part of, you know, something larger. So I think these two would be broadly some lessons that I have learned. Everything else is just a little too raw, I guess, for me to share. But I'm just having fun, trying out various kinds of things. And I think it's an extremely exciting time to have ideas and just put them out to the world. Really, if there was advice that I would give anyone, I'll just build on what you said, which was very succinctly just start, take something that you are good at doing, and mix it with something that you are interested in or learning about or curious, etc. So for example, you might be a good writer, you might be interested in say, finance, or you might want to learn more about something, right? Or you might have experience doing something, right? So suddenly, when you put these equations together, you'll find that there are lots of permutations and permutations and combinations. And on top of this, if you add a layer of what I like to call treatment, funny, serious, long form, whatever it is, right? Analyze some of your own favorite content creators and the stuff that they're doing and see where do they fall in this? Are they the, there's one phrase that I love, I don't know whether I heard it on your podcast or whether it was on somebody else's, but figure out what your role is in the story. I absolutely love that line. It's not mine, but I love the line. Yeah, it's great. And I think it was, it was said in the context of journalism, right? When you are a journalist, or when you're a writer, who are you? Are you the peer of the reader, who is trying to figure out the story along the way, which a lot of podcasts say like Freakonomics would be that way. Dubner is not an expert, he is learning as he interviews his guests. And I think that's a lovely way of going going at it. Or are you the expert? Are you say a Reid Hoffman, who has spent years cutting his his cutting his teeth, and now is pontificating to the world. If you have that, who am I in the story, merge that with the skill that you have and a possible treatment that you want to take, you can come up with all kinds of ideas. The internet is full of crazy ideas that work, but on paper, they look like they shouldn't make sense. A few few months back, my wife introduced me to this Instagram account called Miss Excel, M-I-S-S-E-X-C-E-L. It is and I kid you not, a Instagrammer who teaches Excel hacks while dancing to EDM. Nothing in that sentence sounds like it should make sense. She recently made six figures in one day in US dollars. Wow. On the because this created enough of a signal for her. I'm guessing nobody follows her for her. Oh, I should learn Excel from this person. What they do follow her for is super quirky is funny. You're signaling the fact that yeah, I'm a cool person who knows Excel. So you're part of that thing. But what she does do is because she's built herself up in this way. She has a serious course for $299 on learning Excel. I'm guessing that's not taught through EDM. I'm guessing that's a proper thing. But what a great way to market a course, even if that wasn't the end outcome. And as a result of that, and her fame has led to workshops and all that, and she can charge a premium now that she's well known, and she has a personality and all that, that's helped her make money. So just think about it. Somebody who's creating funny content around TikTok, funny treatment, Excel being the space that you are familiar with, and dancing, which you are good at all three of those look like a combination that shouldn't make sense. But somehow in the digital age, it just does. Think about all the other combinations that are out there, you may be great at cricket. Now, you may be very interested in cricket, what is your skill? Are you good on screen? Are you a good writer? Are you great at tweets, TikTok, whatever the case may be. And then think about treatments, funny, serious, etc, etc. There are just so many combinations to be made. So when you look at it from this perspective, the sheer spectrum of things that could be created, it's an insanely good time to have an idea or just get started. That's number one. Now on the other side of things, and this is something I've very often thought about, so many we say, right, so many things have changed, right? The platforms have changed, the opportunities have changed, the monetization career options have changed, people become millionaires streaming themselves playing video games or crying out loud, we live in an era like that, for example. But what has not changed fundamentally is the amount of time people have, right? It's not like 24 hours has magically become something as if anything because of hustle culture and all that, the time to consume content has become lower, smaller and smaller, no matter whether it's coming from a network, no matter whether it's something that the TikTok famed TikTok algorithm throws up, whether it's something your friend said, whether it's a podcast that your friend has started, whatever the case may be, all this burgeoning amount of content that's out there, because you know, thriving, hashtag thriving, hashtag content creator economy, all that, there is increasingly less time to consume all of it. And somehow in a weird kind of way, I feel it's going to go back to some form of gatekeeper at some point of time. We always say, oh, content creator, creator economy is awesome, because we're like, no, no longer are we in the strangled stranglehold of the gatekeeper, like going back to our conversation, how we started this. Musicians are free to explore themselves creatively, creatively without worrying about what the record label says. We are free of the tyranny of the of the middleman or the gatekeeper as it were. But what do you do when there are now 5000 bands vying for your attention instead of two, you need some filter right over there. Before that used to be a record label who would do the job of that. But now it could be some somebody else now might might be the Spotify top 20 metal songs playlist, or it could be your trusted friend who is the who is inadvertently acting as a gatekeeper, or it could be a publication. One very interesting thing I saw recently, I follow this author called Charlie Wurzel, he writes this beautiful newsletter called Galaxy Brain on the intersection of technology, culture, business and, and all that. He had a thriving newsletter for a while. And recently he got, quote unquote, acquired by the Atlantic. Right? I think we're going to see a lot more of this happening. Like even if you see the New York Times, look at the number amount of talent that they're just swooping up, right? Kara Swisher, or, you know, lots of those podcasts. And I think somehow, this so much content creation and creators that's happening, it's become sort of like a Wild West, which is romantic to some extent, until you realize that boss, you have only 24 hours in a day. And there's only so much content you can create, I need somebody to curate this for me, curate equal to middlemen in some way or the other. Now, whether that goes back to being the traditional gatekeepers with all their pros and cons, or whether it is a new era, I think that's inevitable. I think that's a cycle that is going"

        "message": "okay, you say sorry. It's like thank you. Sorry is the most weird. So thread number one is gatekeepers like I both agree and disagree. I, I agree that we need a way to filter the universe of content out there. But what I do think is that the gatekeepers of old have become irrelevant and are dying. And I think that's a great thing. Now, for example, back in the day would miss Excel who wants to dance to ADM while doing Excel ever have got a gig for whatever any TV channel any, you know, wherever that kind of content would feature. And the answer is clearly no, she would be laughed out the door. But today, you have acted as a gatekeeper. Like let's say you you are someone whose words I take really seriously on new content to follow, right? You have acted as a gatekeeper for me, and I'm going to go there and I'm going to listen to it. And people who are listening to this episode of the scene in the unseen are going to click there from the show notes. So in a sense, we are gatekeepers. So what's happening is that you don't have that one height bound gatekeeper who thinks in a particular way and follows convention, you have many, many gatekeepers to choose from many ways. And I would therefore say that they're not really gatekeepers, they're arbiters of taste in a way, in the sense that they are helping you and you choose your arbiter of taste or gatekeeper or whatever term you kind of want to use. And I think I think that's fantastic. Because the point is, she can get her work out there today that would not have been possible 20 years ago, I can do a five hour conversation today not have been possible 20 years ago. Of course, my doing a five hour conversation today depends on your willingness as well and your stamina. Have you had your energy bars? But the other interesting thought that kind of struck me about content is, you know, when, again, you were talking about Miss Excel, and it's fascinating, because in a number of ways, she's following, actually, what I would consider principles that creators should follow that are not radical, right? Her work is radical. Yeah, but what are those principles to me, and I'm kind of thinking aloud, and I'm gonna get getting a little meta here. But one of those principles is authenticity, that you got to be true to yourself, if you try too hard to fill a particular gap in the market, or to be somebody else, or whatever doesn't work, right, you got to be true to yourself. She's being true to herself, because she knows Excel, she loves dancing, I presume she loves EDM, which is where this comes from. And it works because she's having a great time doing it. Number two is that you don't have to be a spectacular expert in something to do content on it. Like I taught a podcasting course briefly, and people and you know, students would ask me that why should somebody listen to my podcast, I'm not an expert in anything. And I'm like, No, but the point is that you are on some kind of journey, maybe an intellectual journey, maybe a journey through life, which many other people have in common. So it makes your journey so relatable, as long as you're, you know, true to yourself, again, that being the primary condition, it makes it so relatable, and interesting and entertaining. And it's a similar thing with this lady, who may not be the best Excel teacher in the world, but is I'm sure is perhaps the most successful now from what you say, possibly, possibly, because she wasn't shy of going out there and, you know, putting herself out there. She didn't say am I the greatest Excel expert? No, no self doubt, I just go out there and do it. And the third one which comes from that is intimacy, that all the creators are like, I feel like I know these people, right? Like I just released an episode with Abhinandan Sekri. And somebody wrote in to me to say that I felt I was I felt so much like I was sitting at a sofa in a drawing room with you guys, that at one point I interrupted before I realized that wait a minute, I'm not actually there. Right? And that's such a lovely comment. That's what creators want. And that's what all creators kind of get that you build those sort of intimate spaces where you feel you know the person so you know, Miss Excel, ticking the box on all of those and even you know, NYT going to big creators and taking them and all of that I get where that comes from. But at the same time you have say Yasha Monk starting persuasion on Substack and saying I'll do my own thing and many many people just kind of doing their own thing like Miss Excel will never feel the need to join a conglomerate because if she's made six figures in one day, fuck you, I'll do my thing. You know, why should I let someone else dictate content tomorrow instead of dancing to EDM she might want to do something else. But her boss will say no that worked for us. Dance to EDM. That's all pretty fascinating. That role in the story bit is also interesting. So tell me something while you were telling me about how you would advocate to people that think about your role in the story. And you said that look at content create, look at your favorite content creators and break it down. Did you at any point reverse engineer what other content creators are doing? And you know, get insights from that? Interesting question. And I have to say no,"

        "message": "you know, I think this is something that I realized post facto, I sort of took some lessons away from some of the shows that I listen to always. And like, apart from the content itself, what makes this work? That's something I always think about, right? Which is like, like what you said right now? Yeah, sure. This Miss Excel's content work works because she enjoys 123 whatever. But how can I take a lesson out from there and apply it to an other field which is completely unrelated? How do I break these things down to to use one of our favorite phrases first principles? How do I go back to what is the meta lesson that I can take away from here, which I can apply to something else, which could be completely different. And I think that's the sort of skill I acquired, if I may use the phrase, while I was working in advertising for some time to extracting why this example works, and then transposing that to another brand in another category, etc. But no, to answer your question, not really, I never thought of it that way. I guess, now that, you know, we're sitting and thinking of content, I, if I were to give advice to somebody today, they have, the thing is this, I think everybody today has enough of a frame of reference from their own life, in order to draw enough of an example for for themselves to create content. When I teach students, for instance, since you always say students of my course, let me be another person who says that. So one of the things I start off and I teach a bunch of undergraduate kids at a university, I tell them, see, listen, even if you sleep through all my classes, all you need to do is this, you are subject to a lot of advertising on a daily basis, have an opinion on them, ask at the other end of that ad, which I blocked or email that I deleted, there was some brand manager who paid somebody a lot of money for that to reach you, right? You may not be an expert in advertising yet or marketing yet or whatever, but you are an expert as cheesy as this may sound at being you, right? Somebody did something in order for this ad, email, whatever it is to reach you. You be the ultimate, you are the ultimate judge of whether that works for you or not. If it does not work, or even if it works, why? Just ask yourself that, reflect on that. And then you automatically will feel yourself becoming a better marketer or start thinking that way. Why didn't you swipe up on that Instagram ad? Why did you delete that email? HDFC Bank desperately wanted you to open an FD with them, but you deleted it. Why did you delete? Did they target the wrong person? Did they use the wrong kind of message? Are you tired of them incessantly spamming? Don't you trust them? You just got four great points that the CMO of HDFC Bank would love to know. Thinking like this, I think always works. Similarly, it works kind of similar with content. I think everyone consumes enough content to just reflect on them enough. Why do I like these pieces of content? What makes this content tick? Why do I like some content that is entertaining, something that's useful, something that's close to my heart, etc, etc. Take all these sort of lessons, and then you'll like mishmash them, make your own framework, and then you'll realize that there is, hey, okay, if I look at it this way, I can create x content in this way on this platform around English football, for instance, because I'm passionate about it, nobody else is doing it or whatever. So that's the way I look at it now. But I have to admit a lot of this is very post facto, and not exactly something that I thought of, when I was, you know, getting into it, which is why my other piece of advice is just jump into it and figure it out, figure it out later. There are a lot of things that I don't like about Mark Zuckerberg. But the one thing that he did say that I thought made absolute sense was, and I actually not quite sure whether he said this, if you ship the perfect product, you've waited too long. And I thought that was a lovely way to some, I mean, he said in the context of a product. But I think that works for content as well. If you if your first episode is really, really good. Either you're very good, but then even you being really good is possibly because you've done so many things before. Faye D'Souza's first Instagram thing would have been great. Because she's kind of familiar with doing that. Yes, the format is different, the orientation is different and all that. But she's comfortable. She's a journalist for so long. And she's comfortable speaking in front of a camera. It's not like she's gone off and started a fiction novel or something that would be, you know, something different. So yeah, I think that's the way I think about these things."

        "message": "Yeah, yeah. So the other point from your wonderful 10 minute monologue before this, another point that I wanted to pick up on was creator where you said that I teach a course, and I don't know if that would be called creating. So again, I'm kind of thinking aloud, because you're making up the rules as we go along. There's a tiger chasing us to learn to run is that if I might take a shot at trying to define a creator just for myself, you know, whether others agree with it, I would say a creator is someone who has some knowledge or skill, which they share with the world by creating something, right. And to distinguish it from products and all I'll just say that something isn't a physical thing, but that they share with the world in some way. So whether you're putting out music, whether you're doing a podcast, whether you're teaching a course, there's something inside you that you have that can be of value to others, and you put it out there. And you're automatically in that sense, a creator. And this brings me to another thought like this, dear filmmaker friend of mine, and he was sitting right where you were sitting on this lazy boy, not getting a foot massage also, because I didn't have the foot massager then. And he's around my age, and I felt kind of bad for him. And he was kind of low because he made a short film once which won a lot of Film Festival Awards and got him offers from Bollywood bigwigs who he became friends with. And they said, do this for us do that for us. He said, No, no, I have one dream film. I want to make that first. I want that to be my entry. We know how the story normally goes, right guy grows old film never happens, or he gives in. Well, guess what he made the freaking film. He made the film eight years ago, but after making it for all kinds of reasons, it never got released. So he's made his dream movie. He likes the way he made it. Everything has happened. Aad saal kuch nahi hua. And so he was sitting here bemoaning dad and telling me and every every meet about once a year where he'll kind of come to Andheri and he'll call me up and he'll say aaja hoon kya and I'll say aaja yaar. So and it's kind of the same lament. And this time I told him that boss, this won't do. The point is, if you think about yourself, and this is kind of me talking to you, that if you think about yourself, you're in your late 40s, you probably have 15 years of productive life to go when your cognitive energies are functioning properly for you to do something, right? After that, you're gone. It's a waste. I mean, of course, I know life is meaningless, we all die. But apart from that, if you want to make something of it, after that is gone. So my thing was ki abhi reconfigure the way you think about creation and the way you think about films and the way you think about art, you know, you have tons of and he's an FTII grad also. So you have tons of knowledge about how to make a film, how to write a film, he's written a book on script writing, which hasn't yet gotten released, how to make a film, how to write a film, you've got all of that knowledge, freaking do something, start a YouTube channel, it'll cost you nothing. Yeah, you don't need gatekeepers. You don't need one year producer saying no, yeah, well, hey, yeah, well, hey, you know, just make something every freaking day, because otherwise what you have is going waste. Like I'm sure every single person listening to this has something that other people can benefit from. Absolutely. What are you doing with it? Right. And so this is just something that I felt so strongly about, I felt I have to share it because it broke my heart to see the guy. Once a year, he comes every time he's screaming. My film is not getting released. And I'm like, leave it. You know, it will be released, it's not in your hands. But you can't let the next 15 years go in a lament. And then you say no, I'll start a YouTube channel. And then you realize you're fucking senile and your brain cells aren't working. Right. So my next question is about since you have kindly allowed me without contradicting me to put teaching as part of"

        "message": "The undergraduate one. Yeah, right. Because kids have an annoying habit of getting to the root of the problem and asking very, very fundamental questions. Right? So you're saying, oh, okay, you should do x kind of branding and not or whatever the case may be, their question, why bother doing branding at all? So you know, they ask very, very fundamental questions, which forces you to so this happened to me a couple of times. And then I said, Okay, I can't fluff around with these guys. fluff flies in the boardroom, I can faff around with my client or my this thing, because that's the way the industry works. And we can rant about advertising later. The entire industry survives on gas. And this is joke that you have to get an MBA is just to understand other MBAs. And there's a lot of truth in that. But when you're teaching undergraduates students, you suddenly have to or even younger, that will be even more challenging. You really need to ask fundamental questions, you not only need to simplify your content, but that's the thing, simplifying your content is actually tougher. Because now you need to really get down to the roots of things. And you need to ask yourself, okay, is this really needed? What is the framework that will cover all of this? So to answer your question? Yes, absolutely. I think that whole process of teaching and again, now this is irrespective of which level it was, it forces me to become a better, better practitioner, because it is also a subject, I teach marketing. So it's not it's, it's not a theoretical subject in many ways, at least I try not to make it I try to use as many real examples as as possible. It forces you not just to brush up on the basics, but get better, but constantly evaluate and like if I come across an example today, right? If I like on the way to your house, if I see a billboard or something like is that consistent with what I am teaching? Is that consistent with how I think about marketing? Again, breaking down to first principles pretty much over there. If something contradicts, now do I need to change something? Or this is an exception? Or should I add something else to the framework? This happens all the time. And I like where the stuff that I'm teaching at is at right now, I feel reasonably confident of presenting it to a bunch of 16 year olds. And let me tell you, I mean, there's nothing scarier than going to a bunch of 16 year olds and telling them I'm going to teach you how to use Instagram. There's nothing scarier than that. Uncle sit down. Oh, seriously. And that's the thing. It constantly forces you to to get better. I think it's become more fulfilling because because of that, I think both feed off each other. The teaching helps the because when you teach you one, this is another thing I've realized when I put that course and all that together, a lot of it, it's not like I had these models and frameworks and all that. And immediately it was just a matter of spilling them out onto slides. If I want to take, say, a session on, say, the like how video is being used in marketing, for example, I'll have a broad idea of like, what are the endpoints that I want to get to? And I'll have, say, hundreds of examples in the middle. But to make sense of all of it, you need to simplify it down somewhere to a framework. And then bingo, you find yourself creating a framework that didn't exist, at least in your slides five hours back. And, you know, that sort of thing is fascinating. And then you say, Oh, if I'm using this for video, I can apply the same thing to something else and something else. And then suddenly you find more of these frameworks getting together, which becomes an even larger framework. So I think this whole, it's discovery. And it's for me, it's been extremely fulfilling doing something like that. I totally understand now why teachers my mom's a teacher. So like, when they say that teaching is extremely fulfilling, not just is it like the selfless part of it, I suppose, which I always found, to be honest, a little overrated, the giving back part of it, but it just forces you to become better. So yeah, absolutely. To answer your question,"

As we are sort of on teaching digital marketing, I thought, let me also ask a little bit about digital marketing, because I am basically a digital creator, right? But I do zero digital marketing. And my sort of waffling excuse for not doing it is I will often say, hey, the product is the best marketing, which I kind of believe it's not the full story, but I kind of believe in it, because I've been fortunate enough that whatever little success I've had is kind of organic, but we don't know the counterfactual. Now the thing about advertising is, when you're an advertising man, so you know, the famous quote by John Wanamaker, when he says half the money I spend on advertising is wasted, I don't know which half. And Ambi Parmeswaran was on my show a year back, and he used the phrase, spray and pray for digital marketing. Yeah. And my sense like I did little marketing things once in a while, like created audiograms with a minute of a snippet from my show and all that, and realized that it was basically just solving no purpose at all.

So then you think about, okay, let's assume that you want to reach a new audience, for example, okay, what would be a good way to reach that audience? What would be a medium to reach that audience on what would be a, what would be a message that will resonate with them? And I'm being extremely broad over here, because I can't do ad hoc consultancy on on air. But I think it all starts with asking extremely fundamental questions like that, and having logic behind everything that you do, right, and giving everything enough time, like everything that you said about content creation, give it enough time to breathe, etc. A lot of marketing is also that way, you are very unlikely to click a products banner at the first time you see it, it's usually after say, three or four attempts at reaching you that you end up clicking that and maybe the context has changed or whatever it is. So that amount of repetition is needed, like Zomato didn't become a funny company of a funny brand on Instagram overnight. They've been doing this for years before they have got that solid reputation. You have guys who do flash in the pan sort of tweets that get popular once in a while, but unless you make a habit of it, you will not be known for it and brand perception, etc will not change. Right. And of course, that's a long story by a long story by itself. I think I mean, it all starts with understanding what the objectives are, how, what you can do to change the or let me Okay, let me let me break it down this way. I think this is a simpler way of looking at it. Look at all the look at all the obstacles that are in your way towards your ideal goal and break them down. I think that's honestly the simplest way to think about marketing because what is marketing it's something is solving at the end of the day product needs to be sold, right? Whether you're doing sales led advertising or whether you're doing brand building led advertising, the end objective is to put sales on the put get money into the company's bank account, right? Think about all the reasons why that's not happening right now, or why your objective is not being achieved. Like in your case, suppose you suppose it's just this, this elite audience that is listening to your show, which means that a huge chunk isn't what are those reasons? You can't start marketing without knowing what those reasons are, because you can't just again, in Nambi's words, pray and pray, throw an ad at them and hope that they will convert the ad that works for say, the Lokhandwala crowd might not work for a Raipur audience might not work for a Trivandrum audience, so on and so forth. Understanding why people are not clicking that ad or consuming account forget clicking the ad, why they're not then it could be many other problems. They don't know what a podcast is. They don't like you. They have never heard a podcast before. And the idea of a four hour long podcast scares them. And then you realize it's not a marketing problem. It might even be a product problem. The the USP of the product that works for one audience is actually a non USP for another audience. When you start breaking things down this way, you will eventually get to a point which can be solved by advertising, which is Oh, okay, this message needs to be communicated to that audience and they are on MX Takatak. Great, got it. Now that's a brief. But if you try to solve a problem with only advertising, I don't think it works. I think you need to understand why it doesn't work. So everything you see has a role to play. Your product has a role to play research has a role to play. It's simple yet complicated at the same time. But I've always found the easiest way of approaching marketing. Just ask yourself, what is the goal that you want to achieve? Right? For in your case, it could be get more listeners in somebody else's case, it could be sell this new product. In somebody else's case, it could be I've started a new course, I need to get people for it. Great, you've got your objective, which is honestly half the battle, battle one. What is stopping that ideal objective from happening right now? Start from there, keep asking why, why, why, why till you have enough actionable."

No, no, it's it's fantastic. Like when you know, when I did my podcast course, I remember someone asked me that what about the marketing aspect of it? And I said, Listen, just focus on getting a good product first. Because, you know, if marketing a shitty product just doesn't help people, you just kind of sample it. And the thing with podcasting is you also want to become somebody's habit. And I think this is true of all creators, which is why you got to keep on doing keep on doing keep on doing you know, that's when you're given the privilege of somebody making you the habit, you know, that's kind of what you aim for. So let's now take a quick commercial break. And in case you're feeling really bad, because you've prepared these copious notes on your childhood and got these old family albums with you to show me, don't feel bad. We'll talk about that after the break. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com and subscribe. It is free. Once you sign up, each new installment that I write will land up in your email inbox. You don't need to go anywhere. So subscribe now for free. The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com.

        "message": "like so on and so forth? Yeah, so I was born in a small country called Bahrain, which I guess many people consider the Middle East, just an ex of Kerala, spent 15 years of my life over there, then came back to Kerala for two years. But I think those 15 years in Bahrain, they were very unnumerable, didn't have too many friends as such over there. And that wasn't necessarily because I was anti social or anything, it was that the sheer heat and the distances between houses meant that you needed and and zero public transport, I must add, meant that you needed your dad to ferry you around everywhere in any case. So I didn't have too many close friendships growing up, which is something like I missed, really. And I used to read a lot when I was a kid. But then most of that reading was, you know, your Enid Blyton's, Archie's, that sort of thing. And we had a few nice local magazines over there. So if any Gulf kids are over there, they'll definitely have heard of young times. And that was a gateway to a completely different kind of world. In fact, that magazine was responsible for my initial music knowledge, my initial technology knowledge, a whole bunch of things. It was like a dream for me to get published in a young time. I think that happened once or twice. So following my 10th, I came back to India, or rather, I came to India, it's not I came back to India. I did my 11th and 12th in Kochi, and then, you know, went along with the herd into an engineering college, because that was the thing to do. I think those four years in engineering college really changed everything. I mean, I didn't become a great engineer or anything like that chemical engineering for anyone who's keeping score. But I think a lot of what I ended up becoming later and all that. I think those are the formative years in many, many ways, which looking back now I can say, and I don't think it was very apparent at the time from musical taste to what I want out of life and all those sort of things. Somewhere along the way in college, typically around the third semester of engineering, you figure out what you really want to do with life. And for me, that ended up being advertising. I remember there was this there was this old magazine, I don't know if you remember, there was an old magazine called A&M. I believe, I think it was started by the same guy who ended up starting AFAX, Shrikant Khandekar, if I'm not mistaken. So I read that magazine. And I was fascinated, like, oh, wow, thought goes behind all this advertising stuff and all that. And I became obsessed. I somehow I mean, I had friends of mine who said that they wanted to do an MBA. And that seemed a little too distant for me. I wasn't too keen on following the herd that much. Also, I like had enough of that and want to make my own choices right now. And suddenly, this intersection of MBA and marketing, sorry, MBA and advertising came up. And then I was obsessed with this college called MICA, really wanted to get through to it, learnt everything about it, read up everything, whatever, didn't get through the first attempt, realized why, fixed it and got through to got through the second, second attempt, spent two years in Ahmedabad over there. And been in Mumbai ever since post that been working in various advertising, marketing roles, etc. And been freelancing since 2019, early 2019 or so. I've always done some sort of freelancing on the side to keep the creative side going. Ironic, right? You're working in an industry that's supposed to be creative, yet you're searching for more creative fulfillment somewhere else. Let's just say that the love for advertising died out fairly quickly. But that was that's another story by itself. So that's really where it was. I genuinely think I've ended up trying more things after the age when people typically stop trying things, be it with respect to work, be it even with respect to the kind of music I or, you know, going outside the comfort zone with respect to music and just generally trying stuff. So yeah, that's life in a nutshell, I guess."

        "message": "Yeah, yeah. So again, when I went into engineering, I didn't have too much of an idea. Let's face it of what even engineering was, right? Just I just genuinely didn't know that there were other options out there. And I didn't lament that too much later, because I do believe that, you know, some things worked out, worked out for the best. A few things, I think I got more confident in terms of what I what my strengths were, I realized that, okay, slightly more on the creative side of things, etc, etc. In terms of the music I consume, like it, I went in listening to a Backstreet Boys, and I got out pretty much nerding out over Dream Theater and that whole thing. So I figured out, so it was, so here's the thing about Kerala Engineering College, this is a very interesting set of people who come together, right, especially a government college, because being a government college fees are extremely low. So you have a lot of people, let's face it, wouldn't otherwise have had the chance to access high quality education, lots of reservations, lots of people from across the country, even though, of course, 95% would be largely Malayalees. So among this so called local crowd, and I, please don't mistake me, I do not say that with any like malice or anything like that some of my best friends who I made during engineering were people who I, you know, I had difficulty speaking to because I don't speak Malayalam very well, and they don't speak English very well. So you have these set of guys. At the same time, you had a fair bunch of people from the Gulf. So people who I had enough cultural context with could talk about the cartoons and things that happened and again, young times and all that. And then you had that demographic from India as well. So you have the convent educated guys as well, who used to hang out with us all that purely because the you know, the type of music and all that we consumed were similar and they were interesting overlap. So I thought this was so all in all, you had guys who you knew were destined to say get into an IIM someday. And then you had you had a mix of things. And I think that was very, very enriching, because you were forced to interact with a lot of people get I spent most of my life extremely sheltered in Bahrain forcibly so and in 11th and 12th, because again, in 11th and 12th, you're just focusing on your boards. And, you know, getting into a good college or whatever. I think college was the first time I actually did things, you know, expanded outside book, I mean, outside school books and into more other kinds of books, develop extracurriculars for the first time, learned a little bit of music. Ironically, I actually, like every good South Indian boy growing up in the Gulf, I learned Carnatic, but I never was really too passionate about that. It was when I picked up the guitar and started learning music that I actually liked that I started paying more of an attention to things including, ironically enough, back Carnatic and like, Oh, yeah, that is what is happening over there, except I never paid attention to it. It's amazing how perspective changes. It's, it's kind of weird. So this is this is weird little story that that I have, which I think, I want to say kind of changed everything. It's, it's kind of weird. And maybe I'm hyping it up more than it actually is. So there was this, I, in my first year of college, I was staying in a, in a hostel, just predominantly from predominantly the local guys, right. And I was an extremely shy, I was an outsider for all practical purposes, because my Malayalam was very bad. I don't get cultural references. And because I grew up in the Gulf, I don't even get the Hindi references. So like, Sholay, all these things just went over my head, like these guys are talking about shows in the DD ads of the 90s, completely over my head. So I was in my room silently reading Michael Crichton or something like that. And just whiling the time away recently started discovering some sort of music, etc. And I was pretty much an unknown entity in the hostel and college at around that time, I was kind of happy with that. But I always had a sense of humor, or what I'd like to think was a sense of humor. Growing up, like I said, I was, I used to read a lot of Archie, but the one mag, but the one publication that actually, I would say impacted the content I ended up creating was Mad Magazine. There was something about that slightly surreal sort of humor that really, really appealed to me. And when I was in 11th and 12th, I tried making Mad Magazine style comics when I was in in school, but they would be based on people around, you know, that was my first attempt at content creation, if you want to know that you're using that term, which would it would be like a series of how me and a bunch of friends stole the samosas from the canteen, and then the superheroes who are the professors would come and save the day. Also the things with all sorts of in jokes here and there. I don't know how much of an Archie fan you are. But one of my favorite artists was a guy called Sam Squats. And what I used to love about him apart from his style, his art itself, is that while the main story is happening in the foreground in the background, some random thing would be happening. He was delightful at doing that. Very similar to Mad's, those little things that they draw on the sides. I was highly inspired by all this randomness that somehow seemed to make sense together. Right. And this was a time long before I discovered Monty Python or Sergeant Peppers or even Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. So my idea of randomness came from a completely different angle. And somehow I worked all of this in and I realized I enjoy doing stuff like this. So but again, this was to English speaking convent educated audience, etc. When I came to college, all of that, obviously, there was no audience for something like that. So something very interesting happened. So it was the term exams for our first and second terms combines the first stressful time for the entire hostel. So they decided to do a and I'm not making this up a PJ competition. Okay, in Malayalam PJ is called chali. So it was a chali competition. And the way it worked was it was extremely sophisticated for if anyone who thinks that this is a frivolous activity is very well thought through. There were two jury members who anyone who wanted to submit a joke or a chali rather to the competition had to go and say to these guys and they would update it in their ledger. And every day the score would be updated at the front of their door. They were roommates. So there was some like, like seedings already basis reputation. So some guys had like 10 points already because of the reputation. I obviously had zero because nobody knew who I was. Then I like, but I was good at coming up with funds, especially engineering college funds, because you have so many terms to work around with. So I would make random things like what do you call the temperature of 15th of August, 1948, 1947, the answer would be degree of freedom. So I would make things like this. And I just got the balls one day to go to these guys and submit my humble entry. And at first they were like you of all people are coming to him, okay, let's hear your submission. And they were surprised that I could do this. And then that encouraged me to do more, more, more. And I think I was the topmost person who didn't have a seeding in that competition. So over a period of two months, my reputation, if I may use that phrase, transformed a little bit. I know it seems like a very, very weird story on it. And like, I'm probably making out a silly hostile thing to be more than what it actually is. But the amount of confidence that that little thing gave me that I could do this in front of an audience that wasn't my so called, you know, quote, unquote, target audience, as we might say, that these are like people who I wouldn't have never spoken to otherwise, who suddenly now know me because of this, there are people who from other departments coming up and saying, Oh, do you have a joke on our department? So that felt strange, weird, scary all at once. And I didn't quite know what to make of it. But what one thing I didn't let go was my love for jokes, or chalice as they are enough for a very good friend of mine at the time to say, we are not calling you Deepak anymore, we are calling you Charlie plus Deepak. And that's really how the name comes. What an origin story. Yeah, that's really how the name came about. And it's stuck since then, a random idea it was in 2004, I guess, and it's stuck ever since. You know, I think everyone has those little moments that changed life in some way or the other. And I think that was it for me, the fact that I decided to go up to these guys and actually say that silly little thing. Because I think that gave me the confidence then to I was learning the guitar a little bit at that time say, Okay, what if I take this to stage like, I mean, not that I blew the crowds away, we were very bad, but going up and getting booed on stages and other experience altogether, because once that happens, you can take anything else that comes your way. And we embrace that we actually took on the mantle of being that one act that tries very hard is always going to get booed. And we absolutely had a whale of a time. You know, that's, that's what I said, when I said discovering myself in college, I think that was, you know, incidents like this were instrumental in, in, in doing that, figuring out what kind of music I liked what my role in my friends group in some sense was, as the years progressed in college, my hobbies became more and more, you know, I started doing more and more things like, there was a certain, like a friend, like there were three of us who were obsessed with doing the Hindu crossword on a daily basis. And that was a time when every mobile operator was offering free SMS. And, you know, while WhatsApp has made things super convenient growing up in an age where age of SMS has a different vibe altogether, as the kids might say these days. So we used to sit at the back and we used to and all of us had mastered the art of typing on a T9 mobile phone, Nokia 1100, without looking at the screens, right? And we would solve the crossword. And the challenge was, we get the crossword, each of us had the Hindu subscription, we would get it and we would all try to solve it. The challenge was to see whether we could nail it by the end of the day. Most more often than not, we didn't. But on the 10 odd occasions that we did, it was, it was a cause for celebration. So you know, we would do things like that. And then somewhere along the way, since I realized, okay, my future is not in engineering is going to be more in advertising and MBA in any case. So the attention that we paid, I mean, and it kind of felt bad, in some sense, because I knew I was taking up a seat, which I was never going to actually utilize. But I was also extremely practical. I was very meticulous about maintaining 75% attendance to the point where we had a so called cutter meter, where they would, you know, actually track how much percentage of attendance we had. And everything else is utilized towards anything that could get me towards the institute that I wanted to because to me, that was, you know, the larger thing, in any case, so it's not like I was going off and playing hooky on the side. So yeah, that was, that was about it. I think a combination of all these things together, the kind of things that I read, also change the kind of music I listened to change the the discovering what my strengths, weaknesses, all that were also sort of changed. I discovered a few skills that I had that I knew I had, which I never thought I would actually put out, you know, a combination of all these things. I think, if you look at it from a delta point of view, now I'm being an engineer over here in terms of the change that happened, I don't think any other experience has changed me as much like Micah was great. But, you know, the change that happened when I went in in 2007. And when I got on 2009, wasn't as much as the delta that happened when I went into engineering and out. And I think the I think the thing I had no plan when I went in, again, goes back to our first conversation, they just get into it, learn lessons along the way, many, many of them will be post facto. Like, for example, only now 10 years later, am I realizing the worth of a Micah education when I got out, it wasn't instantly apparent to me. So yeah, that was all these things put together, I think was why I said that college was really, I think those four years made in me in many ways, I don't think I have changed all that much from, like 2006. When I graduated to where I am right now, in terms of thinking in terms of, yeah, I mean, what I used to call logic then has become first principles now. So it's become more sophisticated, maybe I have, but the here's the thing, I still listen to music the same way how I did back then, the kind of music might have changed, but my approach to certain things have haven't changed. So yeah, I think all that is, I'm again, probably romanticizing those four years more than I should have. But yeah,"

And the thing about you know, that that joke competition being important, because it gave you the confidence is it makes so much sense, because what is important to one person, it might seem trivial outside. The other angle I want to explore is that when I look back on my childhood, and when I look back on my own growing up years and going through college and all of that, you realize that there are sort of two simultaneous processes working on you. Yeah. And one is you're figuring out who you are in terms of what you like, what kind of person you are, what your tastes are, and all of that. But the other comes from the anxiety of fitting in, because obviously, you want your peers to like you, you want to be seen as cool, you don't want to do uncool things, all of that. And there's a tug of war there. And with many people, I think this can be a lifelong process like in on both these margins, for example, I think there are many people who perhaps don't introspect enough or are self reflective enough, and their personhood who they really are is kind of determined in many ways by accident and serendipity and they let things happen to them. And they don't perhaps sit back and think and of course, one extreme argument could be made that there is no personhood you're acting even to yourself. But apart from that, and the other aspect is that anxiety of what other people think of you, I think is a lifelong anxiety that you have to learn to lose. And I actually started thinking about it in a mindful way, really, I think probably only in my 40s, where, you know, you realize that first of all, that anxiety is pointless, because nobody's thinking of you, everybody's got their head up. Nobody gives a shit. So you just, you just do what you do. So is this something that you've thought about? Because I imagine both these processes would have happened during those engineering years, because just in terms of age, how old you are, that is a formative period in everybody's life that one, you're figuring out who you are in terms of maybe your humor, maybe the kind of music you're discovering the kind of books you're enjoying reading. And at the same time, you're trying to fit in, you're trying to get that validation from the people around you, in a sense, you're asking yourself, even then, what is my role in the story? And maybe trying to form that role for yourself. Yeah. And it seems that humor in some ways, is also a way of fitting in of, you know, yeah, you're gaining"

So which meant I was going into one of the top schools in the city. With very smart people, I grew up in Barin and Barin for like has many things going for it.

So just to give you a context of the peer group that I had, along with this, all these guys were really good at playing cricket, they somebody played guitar really well, which I never thought was a thing. There was somebody else who was a great dancer, all of these guys were studying by day and organizing events. And I was in awe of my peer group, because I've never been exposed to something like this before. And those two years, the amount of imposter syndrome that I had the amount of the amount of trying to fit in, plus, I didn't speak the language all that well, all those things. And I think in some way, I told you about the first content creation exercise, which was the comics and all that. That was born out of a desperation to, I wouldn't say fit in, but to almost say I am eligible to be part of this group of people. Sure, I may not be able to play cricket terrible at it. I may not be able to play sport or learn something. I mean, let's face it by 11th. If you don't play some of these things in your formative years, you're never going to get there in any case. So drawing was one thing I was decent at, I thought, okay, let's try to convert some of that. And I was very happy when people were actually asking me, when are you going to do the next one, for example. So I would say that whatever you spoke about this wantingness to fit in and all that was more true for me in my 11th and 12th, because of the new change in circumstances and all that. Strangely enough, college was a little easier, because I stopped worrying about that at one level. A second level, I had a very tight group of friends when I was in college. So I didn't and it was a very small group, right? So I didn't need to impress the whole colleges needed to impress three people, all of whom had the same sort of interest, etc. And we were very, very tight. A lot of this pressure that you're talking about, it's very interesting, you ask this question, it just seems like a very natural question. And when you were saying that flashes of how insecure I was in 11th and 12th came, but engineering not at all, I didn't feel the need to do that at all. Also, because I knew that I will always be an outsider over here, because here you have a college that is entirely 95% Malayalam, their frame of reference, completely different, I will always be a niche out here, right? I will niche in the sense I don't say that in a positive way, I will always be an outsider over here. I'm okay with that. I know what I want from this place, I will get it, make a few friends and screw off from here. Right. And I thought I think I got that. So I think in some sense, that pressure was off. To some extent, it came back when I went to Micah and I had that, you know, again, need to impress everyone all over again. But I think by then things had changed, gotten older, had some skills, etc. did enough online notoriety for myself to have some sort of a reputation going in. And all that. So yeah, I'm not quite sure if I answered your question, but I didn't face that anxiety when I was in when I was in college in"

This could also be a myth because of the nature of the places where I studied. I studied in a Kerala college I studied in. Yes, I studied in Gujarat, but Micah is extremely not like the rest of Gujarat. If you know what I mean. And in that sense, those people always had some principles or some grounding, etc, which was never likely to change. Yeah, you're right. They put on weight, they've taken career paths that I never thought they would like serve some people from my batch at Micah who became entrepreneurs, who I never thought that would happen. That aspect is a professional aspect changed. But yeah, as a person, I don't think that many people have surprised me in that. I'm not quite sure why that is.

But something like a team sport, not just because of skill itself, I think it also involves a lot of interpersonal communications and all those little nuances which you miss. I still remember whenever basketball game was on, I felt very out of place playing as part of a team. So I, me and a couple of others would always just play by ourselves or we'll play solo.

So what's the difference between a you and a him? Is there also a certain difference in a lot of talent? Or is it just that he's put in many more hours from an earlier stage?

Yes, there was a time I tried to learn how to play the guitar made a fool of myself on stage enough number of times, but I don't think that is enough to qualify as a musician. So I like there were multiple questions you also try to answer them together. So one is, you could say I had a grounding in music because I was put through the Carnatic thing enjoyed it for what it was, but wasn't like I would definitely not want to go through that again, because I didn't see myself doing that beyond the point I honestly went more for the company of friends rather than for the art itself. In college, it was just something I wanted to try. I didn't start off with Oh, I'm going to become a great musician one day. Right? For me, it was just something I wanted to try. It looks like it looked like an interesting timepass sort of activity, I've used the word timepass activity. And it was also the time I started listening to slightly more challenging music than the, you know, Backstreet Boys, Bon Jovi's of the world with all due respect to said artists. Now, what happens is when you play an instrument, you start gaining immense amount of respect for the recorded music as well. So I thought both of those fed off nicely of each other, and learned enough to be able to perform a few songs on stage. And that I think really is where my, my journey as a quote unquote, musician should, should come into play. It taught me a lot, though, it taught me, being in a band is a different experience altogether, you experience a lot of highs and lows together, it's a logistically very difficult game, because you have to lug instruments all over the place, you have to practice a lot before you can even make a very basic four chord song, sound decent. There are lots of fights that happen, you want to perform one song, another person wants to perform another and other person wants to perform an original. So yeah, the number of fights we've had in bands, and we're just talking about two college bands over here, let alone, you know, I wonder what happened. Now we go back goes back to Beatles, right? Imagine what those conversations were like. And now I understand what creative differences mean, you know, when they when bands break up. That was really it with respect to performing, you know, just to use, you accused me of being a musician. So I'll leave it at that. In terms of how I might be different from a Warren purely from that perspective, one, of course, he's put in the hours and all that. But I think, you know, I think he also, so that obviously changes you right there. We may both have an interesting idea for a melody in our heads, but purely he but he's able to translate that into final output better, because he's got the skills for it, which you can argue have been built over, over, over a period of time. But then what happens because you know, the basics is that you're able to form those melodies in the first place better, you know, what's going to work better, you know, what audiences are going to react to better. So it's not just a matter of you sitting on the pot and coming out of the tune and saying, Hey, this might be a hit song, right? In order to get to that stage, you need to have done a whole lot of other things, studied music, put two and two together. And I think that I think is more important, right? I think, and I don't think that is something that you can be born with by itself. I think stuff like that comes from having learned music, study music, having tried a lot of things. No, okay, this is, oh, this sounds good, but it's actually derived from something else. It sounds exciting now, but in final version output, it won't be great or, you know, whatever the whatever the case may be. And finally, just the doggedness to pursue and get it out. You know, I think that's the that's a very, very big thing. Even if you have a very simple melody in your head, as any content creator will know, an idea sounds great until you need to start execution, right? And then the difficult job begins of putting it together, getting a band together, recording it and all that. So it's a scandalous question to ask Amit, but I think those are the, I think the few ways in which I humble Deepak Gopalakrishnan, I'm different from the finest guitarist in the country.

I think that's an important part of the story that I haven't mentioned, which is this website called Pagal Gai. Not sure if you're familiar with it. Also, for those who don't know, Pagal Gai used to be a thriving forum of MBA aspirants from around the country built on very old forum technology that you will find only certain hobbies communities using right now. Obviously, all those conversations have migrated to WhatsApp group, Facebook groups, and all that right now. But back in the day, Pagal Gai was the community of all MBA aspirants across the country. And I think that by itself and I hate to sound elitist when I'm saying this is a great filter by itself, because now you have some very smart people scattered across the country, different backgrounds. I think that entire experience of hanging out with those guys. So again, just to give context as to where I was, I was studying in a small town in Kerala, I had my friends who I was hanging out with, sure, but and a couple of them were also keen on doing MBA and all that. But nobody else had heard of Micah yet alone wanted that to be the only B school that they were aspiring for. And I suddenly and I went from that, you know, dearth of information to this place where not only were there people like me, but also, you know, with similar interests across the country and all that I was addicted to Pagal Gai like and this was just the time when internet cafes and all that started becoming a little popular in small towns as well. So I would still remember and my college was on the outskirts of the town as most of these big colleges tend to be. So I would take a bus right after college, I would go to what do you have?

Okay, cool. Whatever. Now, the question that you asked was very interesting. The internet and in particular, some certain creators played such a role for me going I told you how Mad Magazine influenced me a lot when I was in school, and that took me on one type of humor. There was another strand of humor that I discovered when I was at Micah, which took me on a completely different path. And that gentleman was Anand Ramachandran, aka Big Fat Phoenix. For those of you who are unaware, he used to write one of India's funniest, I want to say it's a blog, but it's more like a, it's more like a stream of consciousness, personal diary of sorts, come satire news sort of thing, called son of bossy.

And from there, to be very honest, like exactly what you said, I know you through those guys, a lot of Twitter guys, Naren from that entire like that opened up a completely different, you know, world to me, getting onto Twitter and discovering all this at the same time. So it's just a lot of, you know, happy accidents coming together, really. And that influenced me a lot. I think I think I was so influenced by and inspired by that era of great humor writers, very specifically, Anand, Naren, Krish Ashok, for example, a lot of people's tweets, Ramesh Srivats tweets, for instance. So I that was the, you know, that was the the a gang to me at that point of time. And I still think a lot of those guys are far funnier than many of the standup comedians who we see right now, with all due respect to even those set of with those set of talents. And, yeah, I think that influenced me a lot, you know, that entire, that entire thing. And I think and you, you, I think you will agree with me on this, that Twitter from 2009, to say, around 2012, 2013 was sort of like a golden period, like so many friends, friendships really made from there so many weddings of people who I met on Twitter at that time, still close friends right now, so many professional engagements have come up because of that.

But the other thing about that early Twitter era is how, how the humor was sometimes just so random, spontaneous. And like, I remember there was this one, you know, we would do random hashtags, and people would get it, you know, I put out for example, something like I tried to make a hashtag that was combined making puns on Iron Maiden songs with context of Mumbai. So Iron Maiden has a song called Power Slave. So I just said Powai Slave hashtag Iron Maiden Mumbai, that's it. I just left it at that with zero context, zero context. Five minutes later, people understood and they were riffing off it, which is the finest definition of what a meme is. And we will do random things like this. Again, Anand or Ramesh, one of these troublemakers, they had a hashtag called Twitter sounds. And what Twitter sounds was a person's handle said twice together, what does that resemble? So for example, and Anand would come out with all sorts of things. Ramesh Rivas Ramesh Rivas was the shuffling sound that students make in the backbench when they see the principal walking down the hall. You know, to me that one tweet personified early Twitter that you know that era.

Right? Yeah, I think and did you did you also try stand up and stuff? I did actually. So it is very strange. Actually, my story of stand up is extremely different from the wave that's happening right now, or arguably peaked a couple of years back. One of the early experiments I tried in when I was, you know, just starting off freelancing and all that was I used to draw comics for Pagal Gai. In fact, they were all based on MBA life and all that it was the idea that my editor at the time added a person who I've unfortunately fall like, we've had our differences.

And he would just change the text on the bubbles. This was a standard shtick. It was beautiful. He put out a competition one day, again, it goes back to competitions. Again, I think my life is life changes when competitions like this happen. He put out a fill in the whatever your regular fill in the bubble sort of competition, I won the audience, the same favor. So Saad selected somebody else. But, but some 15 people in the comments, I don't know, Deepak deserves like he is was the funniest, like, Oh, that's that, that actually, that makes me feel happier. So my editor, or who would want to be my editor, he saw this and said, Hey, you want to try doing something like this for Pagal Gai. The initial idea was exactly the same. He actually photographed some people in office, he sent them to me and see do what you can with these. So I did something it worked out well, at least the first two got received well. And then I said, Do you mind if I try drawing these and my drawing skills? Why had deteriorated greatly from the time I got to C plus for drawing a apple in a in higher kindergarten. But that being said, I did win a few drawing prizes and stuff along the way. So I tried doing it. And it worked out well, I think what worked more than the art, honestly, was the fact that somebody was making MBA related jokes, it is extremely niche in terms of his audience. But that was the community that Pagal Gai was at that point of time, you could make this is a little bit like Miss Excel. It is it very much is and I actually wanted to make that point. And so like, I'll tell you a kind of jokes that jokes again, quote, unquote, that would work and you will see why they would bomb better, say comedy store or something like that. There are some very subtle differences between I am Ahmedabad and I am Bangalore, which only people in the MBA circuit know, because it doesn't matter to anybody else. I am Bangalore, for instance, at least it this was a scene 10 years back, can't say whether it's the same thing right now. I am Bangalore used to be this place where, which was a wildcard with respect to whether you would get a call or not, you had people who would get a call from all other IIMs. And for some reason, Bangalore would not be there. And you would have people who will get a call only from Bangalore, even though they have only 92 percentile, they put it down to whatever, like some lemon in spoon race, you must have one in fifth standard, therefore, you've gotten this. So also theory. So, you know, bringing out humor in these, so would be kind of things that we that these comics would play on. And then I did another series is I'm very proud of actually, if you ask me for all the content, random content creation exercises done pre podcast, this will be the one I'm proudest of is a series for Pagal Gai called Aapla, a Pagal look at, which was basically some 30 or 40 odd MBA careers, but told in a comic format. So I actually went and spoke to like an investment banker, somebody who does market research, etc, etc. I would tell you don't be funny, I will try to do that you tell me what your job is. And then I would somehow find humor in there do the same. And I like as I did this, I was realizing, oh, man, here's where the mad influence comes in. Here is where the Anand Ramachandran influences coming in all those were like, coming together very beautifully. Eventually, the series ran out of steam, because one there are only so many times you can rehash the fact that MBAs faff a lot. And two, there are only so many MBA careers that are so that died. But is it is it online somewhere? It is online. It's not on Pagal Gai because the site is restructured. So what I have done is I've actually created because I'm too I like those comics enough to put them on a website. So I've created a WordPress for this. So obviously show notes. I've just put all of this and I've also picked my top 20. This is what I think are the best, best of the lot. And I was very proud of this. I'm very proud of these, the comics that I've done. So another thing happened along the way. And this actually is going to answer your question, which is Pagal Gai was such a strong community that we used to have meetups once in a while, right? Just imagine a forum where people all over the country would travel to Pune every year in order to meet fly down about 100 150 odd people and they actually had to start take registrations because of when you could only hold so much. Wow. Just imagine a community of strangers coming together, knowing each other only by avatar and whatever. It was beautiful. I'm within its heyday. Pagal Gai was the most beautiful community I could have hoped to be a part of. Sadly, of course, no longer a thing now. But fair enough. A product of its time, I suppose. The, the editor, he suggested why don't you take some of these jokes and try to convert them into a standup set and see what happens. Fair enough. What's the worst that could happen? Because, see, these are all a bunch of MBA related jokes. You say, you just say I am Bangalore and people will start laughing because that's the nature of it. Everyone's in a good spirit, whatever that little set I did, I was 10-15 minutes, it went way better than I could have expected. Enough for me to think what if I actually took this to B-schools because I wasn't and I must admit at this time, I had no idea about the Indian standup scene. I had no idea who Veerdas was or Tanmay, whoever, completely removed from that scene because that Twitter was very different from the Twitter that I was hanging out on. And I tried it and it worked. It kept working. It kept working, Amit, till people stopped understanding IIPM jokes. Okay, yeah, that was the time I realized. So this is I think the last show I did was early 2017 or 2018. So I had a decent run from 2012 or so all the way to 2007. Five years I milked that set. Along the way, I tried a lot of things. What the first standup show that I ever saw on video, I must admit pirated video was by an English comedian called David Gorman. And it's called Google Whack. Google Whacking is the practice of finding or searching for two terms, which yields just one Google result. So that's called Google Whacking. And apparently it's a sport. He had a complete standup set about this, which I will not get into. But what fascinated me about that was the fact that he was using a projector. I've never seen any comedian before or since you do that. I've seen some attempts like when AIB does like a show for something, but that is for a show. This was part of his, you know, his material. And I realized how much weight that added. It wasn't just supporting what he was saying it many times, it was the joke. Sometimes he would stop, he click his pointer, something would change on screen, his expression will be the same. And that, that was the joke by itself. You can't hear an audio version of that and laugh because everything was in the visuals. I got highly inspired by that. And for a couple of years, I actually made a PPT version of this because I thought, hey, what's the most MBA thing that could happen? If I'm making a set on MBA jokes, might as well have a PPT accompanying it. So I had a lot of fun with that. In fact, I think there might still be one video that I did from I am Kozhikode in 2016 or something floating around on YouTube somewhere. Please don't link that though. You've said it, so they'll find it. But I won't link it. Fair enough. No, but I have but jokes apart, literally, I had a lot of fun with that. And again, I went to a lot of B schools just to do this. And I had no aspirations to make this a professional thing, because I knew I would eventually get tired of it. I think I had enough self awareness at that point of time, to know that if this I need to take to the next level, the amount of work that I'll need to put in will be exponentially higher. And I was at a stage professionally where I didn't want to do that, because I knew what I was doing in my day job was fine. This thing let me have some nice memories while I was at and I did, I made some great friends doing the whole thing, the most beautiful thing. And there are some people from XIMB batch of 2016, who might kill me for saying this on air. I did a clandestine show at XIMB, because I was flown down for an event, where the rules out of respect, I will not say what the event was, but intrepid people will YouTube enough to find out where strictly the rules were the people who are being invited for this cannot do anything else. No commercial discussions can happen. No guest lecture, nothing of that kind. They're coming only for this event and have to fly back. But this kids over there knew, hey, you do the standup set, or do you mind tomorrow if you do over here, we won't tell anyone you can't publicize, but we'll spread it in the hostels and all that. I thought, wow, how beautiful is that, like doing us like clandestine show at a B school. So that's what I did all sorts of things like this. One day, one of the most memorable days for me, and I'm just reminiscing over here randomly, I'm sorry for that. In the morning, I performed at IIM Ahmedabad, in front of the very person who I was making fun of, Philip, not Philip Kotler, Abraham Koshi, who co-wrote the book with him, at least the version that's in India. It felt so amazing to get applause from professors and a filled hall of IIM Ahmedabad students. And one of the things that I would always do, actually, you know, later that day, I immediately took a flight and I performed at IIM Raipur, I think, IIM Raipur or one of those. So had a whale of a time doing this. One thing I would do is I would customize the jokes basis the institute so I would never take the same set to every place. I had some fillers where I would always speak to students beforehand and tell me five things about your college that only the students know, and people will make fun of. And these I realized over a point of time, these could be a few standard things. Tell me one committee, for instance, on your campus, which nobody knows what they do. And the moment it is mentioned, everybody laughs. So you get in something over there. One, one B school over here, for example, had actually, let's not use that because we'll get into trouble. But let's just say that there were committees that everyone would laugh at, then there would be some person with some quirk or something, there would be some subject that nobody understood. You, you are, you have been a B school student, you know, what makes your audience, you know, what makes these guys pick, work that into the set. I think that level of customizing really, really helped. Sometimes I would even take pictures and put them into the slides with people's permissions, of course. And I think that was fun. I think that entire period taught me a lot, again, about myself, content creation, all that sort of thing. I had a whale of a time doing it on stage, the anticipation of you, I've done this set about, I guess about 30 times in all in B schools across the country, and very proud of that. But the nervousness that you feel just as your name is being announced, because the number of things that can go wrong, because now it's not just a joke, it's also the fact that you're using a damn projector that has to work laptop has to work, everything needs to sync together. What if something goes wrong? You know, what if nobody laughs, which has also happened, there have been times when jokes have absolutely fell flat jokes that killed it at one B school, people suddenly don't like in another B school don't get at all. And like I said, the last show that my only regret is that my last show was a bit of a downer, because that's when I realized enough of this, because the jokes aren't working anymore. Because people don't understand the context, I'm still making jokes that are relevant in 2012 13. What is that IIPM? The worst thing to happen to my standup career was somebody realizing to shut down IIPM because that stopped being part of cultural consciousness, and had to end that entire thing. But yeah, I tried standup. And yes, on the side I had done, this gave me enough confidence to actually go and perform at your regular open nights where I made the usual kind of jokes. I won a couple as well in 2017 or something I'd won an open mic and stuff like that over here. And again, I don't want to sound like it's coming off as bragging or anything like that. Because here's the one thing I've realized about the standup circuit having been an outside participant, then an inside participant, then even working for OML, which is very much involved in the comedy circuit. It's not just the jokes that you make. It's also about the tenacity to stick it out for that long. It's about using the same jokes over and over again, having them bomb in some place, having them succeed in some place, come back night after night. And by then 2017 or so the circuit had become cutthroat in terms of the slots for an open mic would go in seconds. That's how competitive the circuit was at least in Bombay. And I didn't have the stomach for it anymore. Here I am pushing 30, have a day job that's paying me enough. There are other things to do. I don't want to go and sit with a bunch of 20 year olds pretending to laugh at everybody's jokes. Because that's not because I know that's the only way to climb up this ladder organically. And I wasn't too keen on shortcutting it and and and going the other way. Once I realized that the whole B-School thing that time was done, I sort of like hi, it's time to hang up the standup boots, as it were. A very long answer, I know, but I hope that answers the question."

I knew I possibly could if I put in the work, if I it, it honestly, to me was really about the work. It was about the work ethic to write, rewrite, perform open mics again. And again, it's really about that not saying that I'm born with talent or something, but I wasn't willing to do the latter one because so much competition was there too. I had too many other things happening in life in any case. And three, and very importantly, I had a reasonably decent captive audience. At the end of the day, what do all these kids who want to do stand up one, they want to perform in front of an audience of say, a few hundred people every day, or not every day, but a few times I had done that. The here, here's a very weird thing about my this very successful standup journey that I had, I had gone to open mics performing to audiences of the other open micers, having performed to an audience of about 500, 600, I'm about already. So when I put that in context, I realized, I mean, if that was a kick, I wonder I've already got it. I hope I'm not coming off as pretentious or like, pompous when I say this. The fact is, I had I took a niche at that point and took a chance on it. And then suddenly people like, wait, you're gonna say b school related jokes. We want to like tell me more about this. And I just wanted to have fun. I didn't charge a lot of money for this. I said cover the airfare, give me a place to say give me some amount of money. I'm fine. I really didn't make a lot of money doing this. For me, it was all about the experience going on meeting people trying out something new. And I think that worked for that period of period of time. Was I tempted to get into the space I was but when I look at the amount of work that that would have entailed, which it rightly should, I wasn't willing to, let me put it that way, purely because there were too many other things happening on the side, including my day job, which was going decently at"

Like, I'll briefly give you my views on it, which are likely to be outdated, and which are also likely to be somewhat superficial, because I haven't seen the scene too deeply. But my initial view when the early stand up in English started happening, maybe a decade ago, was that a lot of it was derivative of Western comics, a lot of it did not really come from so much lived experience. No fault of many of these guys, because they were so young, a lot of it didn't have that authenticity, the earthiness, which comedians in the languages could bring in. But I saw the scene changing in the sense that recently I've seen young guys who I think are just really, really good. And I would imagine that that's kind of happening because the ecosystem is so much bigger. And when you have a bigger ecosystem, whoever emerges to the top is likely to be good. Also, the other aspect, which I think will play out really over 10, 15, 20 years is to see what happens when they age. Because a lot of the best stand up comedy that I like from the West is stuff where people who are in their 40s, 50s have been there, done that, a lot of self reflection in comedy anyway, they've changed completely, they look back on their lives. And that makes for the best work. I mean, even if it's not, you know, politically correct to take his name, Louis CK's late work is just fantastic. You know, you see Louis CK performing at 25 it is shit. There's nothing to laugh at. You look at him at 50. It's just a whole new level."

Unfortunately, I don't have as nuanced an answer as I should have, because I stopped following and being interested as a whole in comedy about three, four years back, and I think a lot has happened since, but I can like definitely tell you what happened from that. I think it was interesting, because bookending my so called stand up career was the birth of open mics, they were they were struggling to fill in slots, like literally had people like Rohan, picking me and asking, would you like to? Would you like we are doing an open mic tomorrow? Can you come in and whatever, to a time, like I said, is selling out like IRCTC Tatkal tickets, right? That is sort of like the bookending in terms of content itself. Yes, you're right. A lot of it tends to be derivative from there. And I think also that was purely because that was the reference point that a lot of these guys had, they would see the, you know, whatever the Russell Peters or the Carlins of the world and a lot of the pop culture that they consumed was also sort of like that, I think things started to change. And of course, I think we have a lot of that credit has to go to Zakir Khan for that for making it cool to be vulnerable in another language one. And also not classically funny. Like if you see there aren't that many jokes that are littered around Zakir's comedy. And again, because my Hindi is not all that great. A lot of what he says goes completely over my head. But to me, it's like what he was saying about Shakespeare and sometimes poetry, the way he speaks the intonations, you can even if you don't know the language, you're able to understand it because of the way that he talks. And suddenly he gets you to a very serious point about a breakup that's happening at the table, where he said he's leaving the audience hanging. And he's holding his hand and said anything he's going to deliver a moment of shiry over here. And then he berates the waiter for putting elaichi in his biryani. That was a punchline. Sorry for the spoiler. But you know, his ability to do that and be relatable and all that I think he allowed people to I know a lot of people, for example, who come to open mics and do stuff in Hindi, they look up to Zakir, right? You can see you can see it. And if you ask them, they will definitely say Zakir bhai and the reverence that he is treated with. It's sort of unmatched, at least from what I have seen. What I've also seen is that people are trying other things. I think there are people trying to emerge with their own genres and styles to varying degrees of success. But that's fine, right? You need those varying degrees in order to have somebody like I've seen people try surreal humor, right? I've seen people go to an open mic and stand for 20 seconds saying nothing, and then saying something bizarre, like I was a fly. Great. I mean, he bombed but great that some people are trying stuff like this. I see those kind of things emerging here and there. My guess is that the trend is continuing. I saw two seasons of comic stun. And I think the guys who won or at least the top five in each are easily like better than a lot of the comics we saw back in the day. In fact, the comics themselves will be the first people to tell you this. They will say if you guys were back there, I wouldn't have had a stand up special on Netflix or whatever it is matter of timing, like you said. So that way, I think the quality of comedy will get better. I think the content that they speak about also will get better all conditions willing, of course. The other thing that will happen is I don't think the comedy is going to be restricted to the traditional format of coming on stage and talking in front of a mic anymore, I think because the formats are so many more, be it a podcast, be it a web series, the example that you often like saying Samay Raina's"

I think a lot of people are just bypassing that gatekeeper if you can think of that and then just going and trying some experiment of their own on YouTube or something like that with a friend, some of it might stick, some of it may not stick. So I think that's the other thing that's happening if you're seeing how comedy is sort of is sort of going and maybe on the basis of that fame, they can get a shoe in, in a open mic or something or even a show itself.

So at Micah, I had all these dreams of wanting to get into an ad agency and all that. However, the good folks at Wall Street had other plans. I graduated in 2009. So I don't need to set context, I think, basically clutching at straws and taking anything that we could get. Long story short, I went into a company which, let's just say that we weren't a fit for each other and left in about six months. I went into a small agency, far from my big dreams of working at Ogilvy or Burnett or something, two agencies that I did end up working in subsequently. So a couple of interesting things happened. I never considered digital as a career because, again, back in 2009, digital wasn't really a thing, right? If you told me that the website Orkut or whatever, Facebook was coming up at that time, would be a serious marketing platform at one point of time, I would have like, not just me, anyone would have laughed anyone out of the room. And today, as the statistic goes out of every advertising dollar that is spent 70 cents goes to either Facebook, Amazon or Alphabet. Meta, I should say. Anyway, so what ended up happening was, I found a, or rather a friend told me that one of his friends had joined a small company that did social media marketing. And he said, Hey, you are digitally savvy, right? So would you like to check this out? And digitally savvy, my creds were I wrote the Micah blog for a couple of years was on Pagal Gai, all those sort of things, which was apparently enough for qualification at that point of time. And I joined that little company. And I actually did pretty decently over there. It wasn't what I had signed up for. And when I say signed up, I mean, the whole advertising thing, including Micah and all that, but I turned out to be decent at what I was doing. And I sort of enjoyed it, I cut my teeth over there. And it's still the workplace that I have spent the maximum amount of time in. Subsequently, I wanted, I wanted more, more, not in terms of money, but more in terms of exposure, small agency, and all that the problem I knew I had maxed out that, that place gave me a lot of good learnings made. I had, I had a lot of good times over there. But I wanted to move on, spend two years at Ogilvy, two years at Leo Bennett post that. And I think a lot of good things and bad things happen. So I shouldn't come across as someone who's like super critical of, you know, advertising as a, as a whole, that is, to be fair, there are lots of smart people in the industry at all levels, right, right at the junior level, all the way up to the top. I mean, there's some genuinely good work that, that happens in these places. That being said, it didn't take long for the tint in the rose tinted glasses to, to wear off, I think a few things happened, I realized that, or let me put it this way, if I may be slightly philosophical about this, if I were to sum up all problems about the way advertising is done right now, not just in India, but really around the world, the focus has shifted from using creativity to solve business problems, which is really what advertising was to figuring out how do we retain this client. And that's a big shift, right? When you when that the needle shifts from what can we do what is best for the brand to how do we keep this guy? And how do we keep this? So when you start off with that as a fundamental problem, it leads to a lot of things, what does it mean? So one, now we'll get down to the micro things what this translates to one, it means that a resource that is technically billed as a full resource on one account and being charged to the client accordingly, is actually a full resource on three different accounts. So you don't need to need to explain what that will do to moral, creativity and productivity, right? So that's at a fundamental level is usually the bottom rung that tends to take that to there is a vast disconnect in terms of mediums and all that creative agencies, let's face it are not very creative when it comes to updating their knowledge of mediums and all that. And it genuinely pains me to say this, I feel no joy in trashing this industry that I was dreaming to be a part of. And genuinely, it gave me some good moments and still has a lot of smart people. But the bigger agencies, their default is how do we solve this with the TVC, which the world has moved on from that, right? The solution to every business problem is not a 30 second spot on television anymore, right? Especially if it is a digital brand. I still remember Amit, the day I decided to quit working in advertising, not the day I decided to hand in my papers, but the day I decided I want out of this career. It was when we were sitting in a Bangalore office at 2am. We had pitch three or four days later, a very cocky client who had come into a lot of money and had the gumption to say on a Thursday that I want to pitch on Monday. So you can imagine again, what that does to everything. And it was a digital brand for which everyone was desperately trying to find a ATL way or TV way of solving the problem, which was in my opinion, not the way to go about this. I was supposed to be the quote unquote digital expert on that. But again, digital has always been treated as the last two slides of the presentation, how you come along, you add some Facebook ideas at the end. That was generally the approach that pissed me off after. I mean, I could take it to a point. But you know, I mean, had enough of that I don't the profession and I don't deserve this anymore. I want out of this. So that is like number two, like, you're outdated and all that. Third is and this re I mean, this really cheesed me off the gulf between what was being pitched and what was actually being executed was so vast. And both sides were okay with it. It's almost like both client and agency know that the pitch is just a song and dance. And the song and dance is great. We will change the world we will do this we will change not just the people's perception of the brand, but we will do good for society this thing that thing everything like the world was your oyster when it came to the pitch, be as creative as you want to change everything. Right. And we were genuinely excited when we got the chance to do stuff like that and win accounts. When the account was one it was more like heartache. That was the that was for sure. Now get back to doing the same shit that any other agency would have done. It's just a matter of who has quoted the lowest amount of money or whoever the CMO likes or whatever the case may be. All these things after a point of time build up enough you have enough of your juniors crying about everything you have enough of your bosses not understanding. And because the emphasis is more on, you know, it shifted to things like headcount revenue per headcount and things like that. And I personally think it's very difficult to do that in a creative business. Sure, you might arguably be able to do that in manufacturing or some something like that. But definitely not in an ideas, ideas business because you can't you can't provide ideas per hour like how you can provide say screws per hour once you have the process process nailed down screws nailed down nevermind unnecessary joke. So yeah, I think it's a combination of all these things that really made me realize that create this is not a place for creativity really is a place for people who can game the system. To be fair, there are people who game the system and they enjoy it. Power to them. If they have figured out how to master the system and go up the ranks, generally good people it's not like they were slimy or anything like that. Great for them. If they get a kick out of this entire system, great, whatever makes you happy as long as you're not, you know, killing anyone and some cases that if you're selling tobacco, you're literally then killing somebody. So I think there's a combination of all of these things. I was also fed up with this whole I don't know if I don't remember if Ambi had spoken about this on his show, but it was the charade around awards. Did he speak about this by any chance? No, I don't. Yeah. So award functions are these lovely things that happen in the field of advertising where they award or this is the best campaign that happened in this or this or whatever, whatever. The thing is, all of this is based on a submission that the agency themselves has to make, right. And if there is any respect I have for anyone in an ad agency, it is people who write those cases. And Amit, I'm telling you, with all due respect to you, your course, you're writing India Uncut 80,000 blogs, whatever the case may be. Nobody can spin fiction like these guys. Like, goodness gracious, I have seen what people can do taking a simple Twitter idea. We ran a hashtag contest suddenly becomes something that changed the fortunes of the company. I had enough of the deception for a while. Like it was fun at the beginning saying, okay, let's see how much we can milk this. Let's see if we can have some fun with this and how much we can gas this up. At some point of time, you know, reality catches up to you and you start questioning, like, why am I doing this? You know, the other hilarious thing about awards is there are multiple award functions and all of them are super expensive to enter, by the way, that's how basically all these publications make money like AFAX and all that by holding awards, IAMII, whoever it is. It's well known that some agencies are going to win certain awards, award functions and dominate that. So some other agencies won't participate in those. So you basically have a system, a circle jerk, if you will, where every agency is the best agency in the country, according to a different awards function. You see all these things, you laugh at first, it plays on your mind. And then eventually all these things come together, another brief from a client comes in, unreasonable request, whatever, whatever you have enough after a point of time. And that really combination of all these things is why I decided to leave advertising. Do I regret my years in advertising? Absolutely not. I think I learned a lot over there again, about things that I was good at, I think I was reasonably good at what I was doing. I wouldn't say I was great at it. But I think I was good at it enough to earn respect of my peers. One thing I learned a lot of things and I think advertising made me extremely philosophical in that sense. One, I realized that I was a different kind of lazy. And I don't mean wanting to avoid work, I would get very good at preempting feedback enough to do extra work in advance so that I wouldn't have to do it later. Right? So I was very good at figuring out okay, the client will not like this approach. I don't want to screw my weekend over giving feedback on a Friday. So I'll tell you what, I'll give you two routes now itself. One crazy creative route that you want, another safer route that I know is going to work, and you know will work, which is what your CM was going to select at the end of the day. So I got very good at doing that. I also got very good at doing this inside the agency, both to my seniors and my juniors, I would tell them, take the time, give me an extra creative, the client might ask for the option. So I also realized that some things that I thought of as logical was apparently a nice thing to do. I would explain to the creative folks what the business was before asking them to create. In my mind, I wasn't trying to be a nice person or anything. I just thought, boss, the better you understand this, the better my the easier my job becomes, right? Because I don't need to spoon feed you every time. Right? Apparently, this is a good thing to do. Apparently, I was a nice person to work with, because I would do things like this, which tells you how low the bar is in the first place. So I would do things like this. So that's why I said a different kind of lazy, I would like work very hard in one go to make my life easier in the future. Basically, there was a time I going back to childhood when I my dad always used to park in rivers. And that had a like very lasting impact on me. At first, I was like wondering, why does he keep doing this? Why is he making it so difficult for him to park away? I just want to go to the garden and play or something. Then after the trip, it becomes easier. Okay, while everyone else is struggling. Okay, now I get it. I think that was a small lesson from childhood. I don't think my dad even realizes that he had this impact on me because of that small, small thing. But I inculcated that in some way. And I said, Listen, I am in the zone right now for me to take out another 30 minutes and do this will save me two hours of work later when I need to get to the zone again, all that sort of thing. So that was one thing I think I was reasonably good at. When I was in advertising, I also I, I think I also learned a lot about business. I think I, I took a lot of effort to understand clients, businesses. And the other thing I this this you might appreciate because you always talk about joining dots. One of the things that I always try to do is I would try to take lessons from one category or one brand example and see how they could be applied somewhere else, right? Because there are meta lessons to be taken away from absolutely everything. So you know, I would, I would do things like that I would do things like that. And I've always felt amid that, especially in advertising, and I guess this might be true everywhere. Gaining respect of your seniors is one thing, but I always was aiming for gaining respect of juniors because once you have that, I don't know, for some reason, I always I mean, I don't have a, like, as a result of doing that, my life is great right now. But I just feel that, you know, I have a solid base of people who I can count on and who will vouch for me, should I need something from them. And it's worked out brilliantly, like when I got into freelance, for the first time, I had all these people saying, get this guy, because he'll help out when I put out the course, a lot of them amplified, a lot of them signed up for it. To me, all of this was just, again, complete selfishness. This was just, you know, preempting and making my life easier in the future, in some way, if that sort of makes sense. So I don't regret my time in advertising, I had, I think I did some good work, we had some good colleagues made some good friends over there learned a lot about what my actual skills were, I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing today, if I did not go through both the good things and the bad things in in my career. But I think one of the things that I was always perceptive of was where I am right now in my career, I think I was very good at zooming out at all points of time. This is something that a lot of guests on Getting Meta also said that like Rohan Joshi, for instance, one of the most poignant parts of his interview was he was talking about when he got into stand up, and AIB became big, it was sort of like a vacuum that just sucked his life so much that he was just unable to gain, he was unable to sit back and see what this is doing to him, his health, his creativity, everything. And only once all that crap unfortunately happened, and he was forced to take a backseat, that he allowed himself to be exhausted to use his words, and put the last few years and his own life in perspective. And which is why deliberately now he's creating lesser content. And he has his own explanation for that, for which the episode is there for you to listen to. But I think I was good at that. I think I was always very aware of where I was in career, where I am right now, when I need to make a shift when I should probably stick it with some more time. I had the simple philosophy, like how do you justify every month of your job in your next interview? Right? So that was a simple heuristic that I had for myself at some point of time. The moment you find it difficult to justify it in your next job interview, you should, you should bounce. That's why I kind of left the last job that I was at Insider, I was enjoying what I was doing over there, reasonably good at it. But the work I was doing was took me like, almost a year or so back. And this is not disrespect to the company of people, lovely people. But because of restructures and all those things, I was doing things that I they didn't need to pay me what they were paying me to do what I was doing. Let me put it that way. And I kept asking myself this question, right? Okay, like, suppose I'm going for an interview tomorrow. And he asked, Okay, this is what you've done, but you were doing much more before. How do you justify this last one year over here? If I had an answer, like, yeah, there are, you know, ESOPs or some great product is coming or whatever the case may be. But I couldn't find that answer. And that's when I realized, okay, I need to take a step back from you. I think that's a decent piece of advice to keep like, how do you justify your what you're doing your last month? How do you justify it to one potential interviewer, and two to yourself? Because it's a much more difficult question to answer. I think a lot of what to do in career then sort of makes itself apparent at that point of time. Yeah,"

And but afterwards they don't deliver and both sides are okay with it. Yeah. And that it struck me that there is a principal agent kind of problem there, which comes down to incentives.

Yeah, the more likely this is to happen. And I just wanted to add something to the previous point that you said this is about retaining the client. And when you was talking about NGOs and all that and funding, it became clear to me, many times we had to sell services that we didn't think were in the right interest of the client, or rather, let me not say is going to harm the client that's but it's not going to add any value. And social media is a great example of that I'm an ardent critic of a lot of social media marketing. And that's a possible other five hours by itself. But why does a mutual fund brand need to be on Instagram in the first place, right? In your heart of hearts, you know, that doesn't need to be but your job is to convince the client that it needs to be done so that the agency can get another one and a half lakhs of retainer or whatever the case may be. I'm not saying that this is this happens across the board or something. But this is the way you know, incentives again, are sort of structured. So at some point, this breaks you down, because the principles that you stand for, not just your your own moral principles, but also marketing itself, like all the things that you learned, you spend so much money to learn at an institute and uphold these are the things of marketing and all that. Suddenly, everything all goes to pieces because of Mr. And the tragedy of it all amid this I don't let Yes, sure, you might let go of some business in the short run or something. But I think that's, in the long run, it's going to be good. Just imagine, I genuinely think that there is space for an honest agency in the country. And when I say honest agency, I actually mean somebody who says no, we will not do this for you. Because we don't think it's in the best interest of the brand. It is not in our short term interest to say this, because we will potentially lose this project and maybe even you as a client. But we genuinely think that this is what is going to be better for your brand in the long run, stop doing this nonsense, put your money in some Google search, I don't think this will help you achieve the objectives that you have right now. I think in the long run, that agency is going to get a lot more calls from that CMO than somebody who just goes along with the song and dance that is the scene right now."

First of all, there are small boutique agencies that are coming up and saying we will do only this. And they're taking that business. A great example of this is influencer marketing agencies. Now we can have another discussion of whether influencer marketing itself is a good thing or not. But the fact of the matter is, this is stuff that creative agencies should be driving. And that's being eaten away by these guys and other similar specialists for various other things, right? Then you're having consultancies that are coming in increasingly building their skill set, the Accenture's Accenture acquired Droga 5, one of the most revered ad agencies in the world, modern ad agencies in the world right now, all consultancy are stepping up their digital skills, digital skills, or not digital skills, sorry, their advertising slash communication skills, and they're tying it to language that the CEO understands. I was on this webinar last year, one of these marketing webinars and the global head of I think it was Citibank, I forget his name, Indian guy, he was saying something like the CMO is having less of a seat at the table, because he is increasingly speaking in language that is not relevant to the rest of the to the rest of the company. He talks about whatever the you know, metric, some impressions, this thing, that thing and all that. But boss, tell me how that translates into revenue or revenue today or revenue tomorrow, whatever the case may be, because what the rest of the C-suit wants to know, which is why now the CMO's role is being slowly eaten away by everything else. I remember the title of that talk, it was something like the make the CMO's role relevant again, or how can CMO stay relevant, something like that it was, I think it was a fascinating, it's happening both of the client and, and the agency. And it's also being eaten up by consultants, freelancers, for example, who are who some companies are increasingly finding, hey, let's just get some honest opinions from these guys. And then we'll go out and execute and all that. I work with some clients who actually have me vet agency ideas, for example, right for a for example, again, I really don't want to take names or anything over here. Somebody I know somebody very respected that from the space of advertising, slash marketing, etc, that I know sat in on a pitch that pitch a pitch for a client that he slash she was consulting with to listen to agency and these were the top agencies in the country. And the and he slash she came back to me and said, is this the way they're still thinking? And it mirrored so many of my own thoughts like why do they still why do they think that a TVC is the answer to everything? Why does everything have the same kind of build up lead to here is our script, not even saying that we are going to we think a TVC is the best thing for this just directly jumping into script, and then digital is there somewhere later, right? So their lunches already being eaten is it's obsolescence to some ways also comfort that these there are still legacy clients for legacy agencies that will keep the coffers running something or the other will happen. Once in a while some bright spark will have some idea. And there are some genuinely good ideas, which even dinosaur agencies will come up with pure media might they will. Oh, this is a great campaign. This agency has won award, etc. So it's that whole cycle. Again, the point is, while the business somehow still seems to be surviving, I don't see talent surviving in that industry anymore. And by that, what I mean is increasingly people wanting to leave. I have spoken to so many people over Okay, so let me or rather, let me put it this way. I don't know a single person who works in advertising that I have respect for, at my level or below who is happy with what they're doing right now, or are in advertising anymore. And that's a blanket statement that I can confidently make right now. Everyone wants to leave everyone wants to either move on to the client side of things, everyone wants to move over to something like there are so many more creative agencies, creative opportunities now with content being a thing right now people want to move to say spaces like OML or something that the Bangalore startup scene is willing to absorb a lot of these, many of them want to branch out as freelancers and control their own destiny in some sense. So talent, I think is going to leave way before clients will, because clients like you said, there's a certain comfort in running that hamster wheel. There's inertia as well. There is apps, oh, there is so much inertia, there is just so much inertia for this whole thing to change. They're very comfortable with the whole system, it's unlikely that change is going to come from that end. Startups have already figured this out. Startups have doing things themselves right now. And they will outsource a very specialist things. And yeah, that's, that's the way it is. That's the way it is right now. I think the entire it again, I must say, none of this gives me a sense of schadenfreude to say this. It genuinely pains me to see this industry that I grew up wanting to desperately be a part of crumbling like this. And it is crumbling, let me make no bones about I've been saying, this is not feasible as a business model, as a business model, because your people are not happy in this anymore, you're losing your best talent to others. Advertising is no longer the dream career that it once used to be there was a point of time when when I was arguably wanting to get into Micah and all that way, people say, Oh, I really want to work in agencies and all that. I must be wrong, by the way, I'm still waiting for people to listen to this and then told me saying, Oh, I'm very happy with my job, or whatever the case may be. But genuinely, in my circle, I'm not seeing this anymore. I'm seeing more people whose eyes are being awakened, or they're finally accepted the fact that yeah, okay, I need out from here, because there's also a sense of inertia over there as well, right? So yeah, I don't see that much of a future for the traditional way in which advertising is done, which is not to say that it can't be repaired or fixed. But then that's a different talk show altogether. I still genuinely think that there is a role, there is a role for advertising to play, which is to use creativity to solve business problems. The only thing is, I don't think defaulting to TVCs is a way to do it for any book to recommend over here, which again, would be a fascinating recommendation, irrespective of advertising context or not is alchemy by Rory Sutherland. Rory Sutherland is actually an Ogilvy guy himself, a big name in behavioral science. So anyone who anyone who's managed to read Daniel Kahneman, but wants a slightly more entertaining version, this is the place to go to. It's a fascinating book, which so the full title of the full Christian name of that book is alchemy, the surprising power of ideas that don't make sense. And it's exactly that it is a fascinating Venn diagram intersection of creativity and evolution is basically how I are human beings drawn to ideas that shouldn't make sense. Let me put it like the and some of the examples he uses, I'll just use one example, which I love citing again and again, suppose a sales guy wanted to establish contact with a prospect, how would they go about doing it? The easiest way to do it, the cheapest way to do it. And in some sense, the most guaranteed to reach way of doing it is sending them a message on a platform like LinkedIn or email, right? It's cheap, it's easy, I can do it now, the person's over there, I can send it immediately. What is the disadvantage of that? That same advantage holds true for everybody else. That person is going to receive hundreds of emails like this. How do you catch that person's attention? Write him a letter. He's going to remember that he she is going to remember that for sure, right? There's a reason and he goes on to that analogy. There's a reason why you don't propose over text, right? You want to make a show and dance of something. And then he goes and what I love about we challenge a lot of what I think about advertising as well, right? In the day and age where it is so easy to reach the exact audience that you want using all the powers of digital advertising. Why do brands still want to advertise on TV? Because there's a certain prestige to do that. Cred advertising on the IPL is not to reach creds audience. It is to signal to creds audience that hey, we are now big enough to go on the IPL. And it was a signal to everybody else that something called cred exists, you will never use cred we know, but we are around over here. So it is more a signaling device than it is a strategic marketing communication sort of thing. His book is filled with examples like this. And the reason I say that is some of those examples are not traditional marketing ideas. One of the solutions that some there was a business district somewhere in South I think it was in Argentina that needed that needed to be promoted. The ad agency refused to run an ad, they said, divert the entire ad budget into building a bridge, because the problem with that is not big. It's not about lack of awareness is lack of access, build a bridge that will solve your business problems more than any ad campaign ever can. Fantastic, right? So exactly right. And it's littered with examples. Another surprise. Now, the thing is, if you think about it, these are not very creative, genius ideas. These are things that should come naturally to us. If you think about it, strip away the see, the problem is also defaulting to communications as a way of solving this. This there is this business problem. How do we solve this? Communications is one of the way to solve that within that advertising is one way to solve that within that TVC is one very outdated way to solve that. When you put it in this perspective, you'll see the role of ad agencies, there is still relevance for it. It's just that there's a huge mind mind mindset shift that needs to happen. The first mindset shift will be how do we go back to solving business problems using creative communications, then getting out of the communications part and saying, how do we solve business problems with creativity? And that really, if you think about that, as a space in which ad agencies are playing with right now, now look at who they are competing with. Suddenly an Ogilvy is competing with an Accenture, right earlier when it is competing with a TCS, for example, who arguably think about these things in a manner that the CEO understands more than anything else. So yeah, all that really is distilled thoughts as to what I think the advertising industry state isn't right now, at least in India, I might be completely wrong, by the way, I'd love to hear counterpoints to things like this, especially on the lack of happiness at a lower level. If there's anyone out there who actually enjoys what they're doing in an ad agency, genuinely, right, and they still think that there is good in advertising, etc, etc. Let me know because I am I have struggled"

So you know, someday if the history of advertising is written, and you know, people talk about the day Indian advertising died, pin it down to really one event, which is also a great album title, which is the day Chuck left. So can you hear the guitars already? Opening riff is coming on the day Chuck left. Yeah. So epic music possible. So now tell me about freelancing, because you come to the stage where you are like, this is not for me, and you've lost faith in it. And you're freelancing. And this is a bold step, because it's a step into the unknown, you're giving up what is a regular income, you don't know whether your brand personal brand as it means anything outside of the context of working in one of these big places. Yeah. So what's the thought process that goes in? And then you wrote a brilliant thread on Twitter, which of course, I will link where you talk about all the all your advice to would be freelancers"

Because right after I was frustrated with advertising, etc, I actually decided I went to what was I went to OML, technically. And then I went to insider after that, we actually it was part of the same company just was a bit of a transition because Paytm had bought over that unit, etc, etc. I have a couple of there are a couple of fascinating thoughts points over here. So you jumping from advertising to what was the events was a completely like completely different shift by itself. And I actually have some of the free freelance work I used to do. Back in the day, one of the one of my earliest for my first byline was doing gig reviews across Bombay, I used to go to small venues. And I just did it because I loved attending shows. And I wanted to write something. So I used to write for a couple of magazines. As a result of this, I ended up interviewing actually a lot of people from big names on the scene, I guess that was somehow me trying to again, I guess it was the outsider trying to desperately fit in and shortcut very quickly. I think, as I'm saying this, I see the parallels with those comics I was drawing in 11th and 12th trying to fit in and trying to infuse myself in"

        "message": "it was this is hindsight. This is completely hindsight. At that point of time, I just wanted to try something out. I used to write for what was then a blog called Codwine. I interviewed Warren, I interviewed Baiju from Mother Jane, I interviewed Mother Jane as a whole, a lot. So I actually interviewed a fair bit of people like Aviyal. And it was interesting, like, you know, what is small thing, I mean, it's not enough cred to, you know, get a writing gig at Rolling Stone or something, but it was, it was what it was. And I, and people like knew, ha ha, you wrote that article, whatever the scene is small enough for people to know, right? I'd like to and then that led to another series of comics that I did, I there was a point of time when I was doing very specialist comics. For Pagal Gaya, I was doing MBA comics, there was another similar website called Crazy Engineers, for which I was doing engineering comics. And for OML at the time, OML had a website called Indecision. Indecision, it was a beautiful name. I was doing Indian rock music scene based comics. You can imagine now that's, that is niche. Super specialized. Super specific and like quirks of, but I realized I was like decent at that. I take one vertical, understand it fully, what are the things within that, that people care about, or, you know, can make a joke about or something like that. And then make comics. I used to like enjoy that little trifecta of comics that I was doing at that point. And by the way, I wasn't a great cartoonist or anything. I think I was just good at, I think I always consider myself a better writer than, than, than an artist. And even if you go back and see the Pagal Gaya comics, you'll see that the comics by themselves, just a panel, it's like a big paragraph of text. That was the sort of format that I used to love doing. But anyway, the point being, I think all those free, all those gigs and all that little cred that I had built up at that point of time, eventually translated into a job at OML because it was somebody who I had been in touch with at that point of time was that, Hey, listen, we need somebody who has your skillset, marketing events, NH7 Weekender, would you like to like, well, obviously I had enough of this. I want something else. Went to OML, it had its own shares of pluses and minuses as any agency, as any company does. And the reason I'm putting the story in over here is because categorically, I did not leave it on a very frustrated note. I was a little burnt out with what I was doing and I had sort of like hit a wall at what I was doing, but I left on extremely good terms with the team and the industry as a whole. Definitely not, it would be an industry that I would go back to unlike advertising, which I would not get anywhere close to with a PPE suit on as well. So with that context, yes, I decided to jump into freelance in late 2018. Again, that question I asked myself, how am I justifying each month in my next interview and importantly to myself and I was struggling to find an answer to that. I was wondering what I could do, what I wanted to do and all that. And it is very poignant. Again, I'm going to probably romanticize this more than I need to. We were at an NH7 Weekender where you remember that clandestine show that I was talking about a while back. So one of the guys from there, he was at that gig. Yeah, we had stayed in touch partially at that point of time. And I'm seeing him after four or five years. And he said, Hey, what happened to all those comics and stuff that he used to draw and all that? He said, Yeah, man, stop. That was a that was a era ago. He said, Oh, that's so bad. That's so sad. Because you know, I enjoyed those and you're good at doing all those things. You should try starting those once in a while and all that. So yeah, but no time work, whatever, this thing, that thing. And then he left it at that. But that like, I kept lingering on that. I'm like, huh, he kept saying that, like, what if what if and then the post rock of God is an astronaut started playing. It's very melancholy. If you're not familiar with the music, it's just very long instrumental that just makes you think you know, it's that sort of that sort of thing, even without needing any specialist chemicals for that. And, you know, it just, I just couldn't get what he said out of my head, which is like, Hey, you should be doing something like this. And I said, Yeah, probably like, I was also panicking at that point of time, because of what he said, because like, this is the right time for me to try an experiment like this, because young enough to make a mistake, fail and go back, like what if things, circumstances change later. Next day, I had breakfast with a very good friend of mine, Sriket, who is also a co host on Simplified right now, I think now we have mentioned all the hosts. The bingo that I promised them has been, has been done. So we talked over it. So next morning breakfast, I said, Hey, do you have like 20 minutes or something, I want to chat about something with you. And basically, he validated whatever I was thinking and said, Yeah, you should like 100% jump into this right now. And that's what I did. The speed at which my plan got accelerated, got executed surprised me, because when leaving Weekender, which was December 2000, early December 2018, I said, Okay, we I will put in my papers in or I will think about this seriously again, around June, July or something like that. Reason being, the IPL was a huge event for insider ticketing, etc. Work on that starts two, three months in advance, right? So you it would be a fairly dick move to quit in the middle of all that. So it had to be either before or after I didn't, I wasn't really thinking about before I was only thinking about let this thing get over, I will quit after that. This anyway, a long period of two, three months before the festival season, rather the music festival season kicks up kicks in again. Suddenly, then I thought, okay, what if I do that before? Oh, but if I say April, that'd be damn bad, because then I'm leaving just before the IPL. So what if it off? And then what was July became April became this became that and before you know it, I put in my papers, I put in my papers, I think about a week, week and a half after that gig happened. And I think I was in a mode where, listen, you need to do this, might as well do it right now, because you're giving the company enough time to find a replacement. So you know, I genuinely am fond of the company and what they did, I did not want to leave them in a lurch. So I thought it's the best thing to do for everyone went ahead did it, what I did do was not fight over my notice period, they said two months, I said I will happily serve out two months. The reason being one, I wanted to make sure that everything that I did got translated down. And two, I knew they wouldn't give me enough, they wouldn't give me that much amount of work. And I could use that amount of time to do sort of work for I mean, put out feelers and all that for myself. And they were very supportive. I have to mention that everybody like my boss, Tulika Shreyas, who is now part of the product team at Paytm, all of them were extremely supportive in me doing doing this. So have to thank them for, you know, for that. And yeah, that's, that's really how it worked out, I think. So a few things happened, I think, here's the thing, I got into freelancing already having a fair bit of work to do, because I'd done enough homework before that had enough, I also had the massive insurance that I had a wife who was working and earned enough for the both of us should my income for a few months be nothing, right? Thankfully, that was not the case. And that really was how it how the transition happened. And because there was so much work from the word go, I really didn't have a time to pause and think too much. And I did not want to because I had a big vacation coming up in any case, where I went to Europe and actually saw the band that I was that I'm wearing a t shirt of now. So I just slogged for six months and came back and I actually have been slogging ever since I haven't actually taken a break. But that is not out of choice. And that is mostly because of this ruddy virus that's doing the rounds. So yeah, that's how it started. But I'm but I'm guessing you'll have some specific question within that, or even something that I"

        "message": "Oh, yeah, absolutely. So when I say hustle, it's a word that's thrown around a lot these days, and maybe I didn't phrase it very properly in that thread. I think by hustle, what I really meant in the context of this is that, listen, boss, you're on your own right now, right? Everything that you had an office and its various departments for you need to do, you have to do your own finances, you need to have somebody going out. I mean, you used to have another team going out and getting business for you. Guess what, you need to do that. Now, you're making fun of your HR before guess what, now you need to plan your own journey and make your own excels and all that. So what I meant by hustle really was more that, that you need to be comfortable doing all of these kinds of things. You don't need to be an always on sales mode. I don't think that sort of hustle is something that's needed. It is, I think, also completely okay, if you're not doing full justice to the work that you're doing right now. Because again, I think it all goes back to objectives. I think it all goes back to what do you want out of this? If you create a piece of content and you feel, yeah, this has got only 1000 listens, I know in my heart of heart that this can get 10,000 people. If that is enough motivation for you, you will find the hustle for it. Let me put it that way, right? If it's if if the work that is needed to go from 1000 to 10,000 seems like too much work for you, plain and simple, you don't want those 9000 listens enough to put in that amount of work. It is simple and it is okay, it is completely okay to, it is completely okay to do that. So yes, we all want, if you were to ask a podcaster, do you want 1000 listens, do you want 10,000 listens? Obviously, they'll say 10,000 listens. But then what goes behind getting to 1000? What goes behind getting to 10,000? Two completely different paths. And you may realize you're happier with 1000, 2000, whatever it is. And I'm assuming that is what might be the case for you as well, right? Yeah, I mean, there are many different parts from 1000"

And I think that's a completely legit way of doing it. And to be honest, that's kind of like what I have been doing, which I haven't been actually putting out any. And also, I think the context in which both of us are talking with respect to hustling slash working is different. You are a podcaster, pretty much. And for me, podcast is just a side thing. And I make most of my money through whatever teaching or consulting or whatever, or whatever, I have over time grown to loathe the word consulting less and less for a long time, I was trying to find I can't stand that word, I need to find another alternative to this. But it's okay, I have made my peace with the with the so called C word. So that's what I mean by hustle in some sense. Again, I'll go back to one of the things I said before about advertising, which is what do you what is your objective? What is the ideal end goal that you want, or, or even like medium term goal that you want? What is stopping you right now? Okay, so I think that's the simplest way of looking at even freelancing, for example, okay, let's say that somebody listening to the show wants to eventually, for example, I'll take my own the space that I have sort of worked in a little bit, which is they want to write for a renowned music publication like pitchfork, or a Rolling Stone at that is their goal. Now, is that going to happen immediately? Absolutely not, right? Unless you are very famous, or whatever it is, which let's face it may not be. So now ask yourself a very simple question. And this is a very uncomplicated way of going about it. What is stopping that editor from opening my email or for or whatever the case may be, and then list down the reasons why one, nobody knows who I am to, I don't have a published body of work in the publication that is second run to pitchfork, or whatever. Or I don't have published work anywhere for that matter. Like if I don't even have stuff that I vomited out onto a blog, who am I to go and submit a pitch to pitchfork for that matter, or three could be that I don't have enough nuance to be able to pitch a topic of some substance, whatever it is, when you list down these four or five things, then take those and see, okay, what is stopping each of these. And then you will break when you do this exercise, you'll eventually say, okay, I need to start writing somewhere, wherever it is, whether it is on my blog for free, whether it is finding whatever your equivalent of codwine for me was put something out because that byline that you have over there, I'm there are some people who are opposed to doing free freelance work, I think there is a role for that. As long as you look at it in the context, not from exposure, I think this is doing things for exposure. I think that's rubbish. And that should never be done. It's not about exposure. I think those bylines mean something for you later, you're looking at it slightly more strategically, because that fits into your journey. Because of that article that you've written for somebody for free acts as credibility for you when you are pitching yourself to say, a small music publication that might pay you 500 rupees that access credibility for the next step, next step, next step, pitchfork. Similarly, everything else falls into place exactly that you figure out what your objective is either medium term, long term, whatever it is, figure out what is stopping that from happening right now, break that down, go all the way down to things that you can do right now. What the beauty of this is, you pretty much have a plan from zero content all the way to pitching to a Rolling Stone, pretty much drawn out over a period of time, along the way, you'll figure out other things are needed. Okay, he's not going to take me seriously, because I don't have a say for a designer, that would be a Behance profile or something of that sort. Okay, I need to build on that. Oh, okay, I don't have a website. Oh, I don't have this. I don't have this. I don't have this. See, see, I'm in a stage. I'm actually in a stage like that right now, because I'm, I'm at a point where I'm actually trying to do less of some kind of work and more of some other kind of work. And I asked myself, see, for me, I'll contextualize for me. Like many other people, I don't want to make a lot of money, I want to work fewer hours and use the remaining free time to pursue other things like create more content or consume more content. Honestly, right, I'll be happy working half of the day and listening and just listening to music for the rest of it. That would be my dream in like about two years time. That is genuinely my dream. I don't want to fancy yacht or a house in Malibu or anything like that. Now, that's a fairly achievable dream, I need to ask myself, okay, for that, what do I need to do? Okay, if I'm making 2000 bucks an hour right now, it needs to become 4000 bucks an hour to compensate for this. How is the client going to pay me 4000 bucks an hour right now? Okay, I need to have this and then work backwards. And then very tangibly, you have what you need to do in Jan 2022. That's the way I think about it. And I think that I have, I mean, there are lots of frameworks and all this and all but this is the way I think is the easiest way for anyone to approach because it's super flexible and it"

This is a time when the I guess it was I guess it was around 1516 or so when the startup boom was in all its glory. And you had, you know, all like insane amounts of money coming into the ecosystem and stuff like that. And I remember reading this newspaper article about somebody I might be getting the company wrong over here, got promoted to the head of marketing or a very senior role in marketing at a very young age, like some 32 or something like that at a fairly big e commerce company. I'm not mentioning it because I'm not sure if I have the name of the company, right. It was a celebratory piece. I read it and I thought, poor fuck. Like, yeah, he's gonna make a lot of money. But what is he going to do with that money? And I've spoken to enough investment bankers and all that to know that these guys have, like, whatever, eight, nine figure bank accounts, but they can't do anything with that money. I don't want to be in that sort of situation. So when I had that reaction, this was a very visceral reaction. Like, I do not want that at all. I do not want a promotion that is going to have to make me work 50% harder, even if I'm going to be paid 100% more. That's when I realized that it's very clear now in my head as to which path to pursue. And I think that is important. I think asking the why is very, very important. We live in a day and age where like, everyone's like, there's so much around, oh, you need to build a personal brand for yourself and all that. No, you don't. You don't need to build a personal brand. It all depends on what your objective is. The medium should never supersede the objective. This is true of marketing. And like, there is no like, oh, we were the first brand to use virtual reality. So what, what did that end up changing?

It's a nice aspirational career. You don't need to ruin their lives by telling them build a personal brand for yourself, you should put out content constantly this thing, that thing, you should constantly upskill this thing. No, you don't need to, you genuinely don't need to, as long as you're happy doing what you're doing, as long as you have confidence that you can continue doing that and not being replaced by robots or new technology or whatever it is, please, by all means, stay off social media. My first boss in Ogilvy, one of the smartest people I know from a digital thinking perspective was famously off social media. And I and at the same time, he had a great digital brain. So there's nothing like, oh, you need to constantly create content. And I think we live in a day and age, Amit, where especially youngsters, especially those scary 16 year olds that I teach, they are great at sniffing out fluff. They are great at sniffing out when somebody actually means it. And when somebody is actually being either paid for it or putting on a persona or avatar to showcase themselves in some sense. So yeah, that's how I think about these things. You know, it's just a few very simple things. One of the lessons that came out from getting Meta for me, and multiple people said this in different contexts, starting with Rohan Joshi, is just zoom out, like, it's very, very difficult to gain perspective of your career, yourself, your goals, everything. When you're in the midst of doing this on a, you know, very daily basis, step out, even if it's for a few hours, even if for a week, but spend that amount of time without the without worrying what Monday is going to be like, or which client has mailed you over the weekend, or whatever it is, take a step back and just evaluate what is it that you want? Is this thing that you're doing? If you continue doing it, where are you going to head to? Is that the logical endpoint of what you want? And I guess that's the reason why a lot of people who you know, go on Vipassana or meditate or something, I suddenly find meaning, which is completely different, I completely like understand what they're what they're doing right now, by the way, a lot of this gyan that I might have given over the last couple of hours or so is a lot of it is post facto, a lot of it is make sense now that I am out of the system. Yes, I had a good sense of where career was going. But the larger picture and all that comes only when you allow yourself to disconnect from the day to day. So yeah, that's another thing I would encourage anybody to do whether or not it's somebody who's looking to be a creator, get into freelance, even if somebody was extremely happy with what they're doing right now, just step out, evaluate, I think that little exercise can lead to a lot it leads to like, possibly what content should I create? Or, you know, what should I get into? Are there other fields that I can possibly get into adjacencies that I can get into and all that. So yeah, wise words. And you mentioned your"

And I figured, okay, productivity, New Year resolution, it'll inspire everybody. And now anyone listening to this is thinking, bastard, you made us listen to three hours before you got to productivity. But here we are. So this is something I struggled with, because you know, like, sure. And just to kind of go back for a moment to what you said earlier, about asking yourself questions about what you want to do, and is what you're doing, getting you there. And I've kind of been through those phases of questioning myself. And thinking about that, what I realized at some point, just asking myself the question of what does happiness mean for me? Yeah. And at some point, you realize that all your youthful ambition was pointless. You know, many of the big dreams you had, if they actually came true, they won't really make you happy. And they're probably not going to happen. Because you were just going too far. What really gives us happiness, if you think about it, are those small moments, small joys. So you want to build your life around the small joys. In your case, it can be half a day of listening to music every day, right? And in my case, like at one point, I kind of tried to define happiness for myself. And I came up with three parameters, which was that I want to be in a room, which is a air conditioned, be full of books, and see, I want to sit on a lazy boy."

But outside of that, if you look at me, I spend hours at my laptop every day, wanting to work but not being able to either I'm following rabbit holes on YouTube, or I'm playing online chess or whatever. So discipline is a big issue. The podcast means enough to me that I'm intense enough about it that I put in the work because I know how much it means to a lot of other people. You know, sentimental as it might sound, I know what it means to. So I, you know, I'm driven to do that. But that whole aspect of being self driven to do things doesn't come easily with other stuff for me like writing books or all the other things I might want to do. So how do you manage that? Like, in a thread at one point, when you spoke about calendarizing, you said that you can't go to sleep on Sunday night without knowing what you're doing for the entirety of the rest of the week. Yeah, yeah. And I'm like, boss, I aspire to that. But how? That's actually what's your journey towards that? Yeah, I'll tell you. Actually, I just"

        "message": "what that perfect self doesn't do. And you do. Yeah. I mean, in fact, you had given this advice to me approximately a year back when we had recorded the first episode of what ended up being getting better. And I actually have to thank you for that, because I've actually been utilizing that, especially on my fitness journey, which I've been like, pretty conscious of in the last year, there would be times when I would snack or something, but I had already pictured this avatar in my head of a super fit me, not even a super fit me, a fit me. What would that person say about this little snack that you're having right now or whatever the case may be? Right. And I find that is extremely disciplining for myself. So one, thank you for that. And there's a nice callback to that what is happening on the calendaring thing. I think, again, as weird as this may sound, I think it was born out of a couple of things. It was born out of one laziness of having to figure out what to do on a day to day basis. And to anxiety, I wouldn't say I'm a very anxious person, but I feel very at calm knowing what I've realized is over a period of time, it's not a, it's not something that I woke up one day to, obviously, when you're at work, you have to calendarize because there's so much happening. And then I realized if I just add everything else to that, it just makes life a lot easier. Because what was happening at one point of time was I was doing I was doing there was work. And there was, of course, multiple things that are happening within work itself. And then you have other things that are happening, like sometimes I'd go on weekends to teach, sometimes there'd be a gig for which I had to attend, and I had to go from Goregaon to Lower Parel to watch it, etc. So instead of having to meet, I just found myself using Google Calendar more and more. And over a period of time, I got good at using Google Calendar. What I mean by using Google Calendar well is, if a gig is starting at eight in Lower Parel, you know that you need to leave Goregaon at X amount of time. So I got good at factoring that in. The other thing that I got good at factoring in is potential rework, etc. that might be needed, right? If you think that a job is going to take you four hours to do, account for another two hours for it for some rework or something to happen. So building up little things like this is what I mean by getting better at calendaring over a period of time. I think it's a combination of these things, which is a sense of anxiety of not knowing what the next day holds. Because I genuinely have problems going to sleep sometimes, if I don't know what the next day is, I need to know purely to fulfill my own anxiety sort of thing. It's not a, I actually think it's less of a productivity thing and more of a dealing with anxiety sort of thing. Again, I don't want to use the word too flippantly, because you know, it's not like I have a big problem with that or something. But it's I'm using it in the in the semi casual sense in which it's, you know, I was using it right now. Here's what I do. So I have a sense of, okay, so actually, let me tell you the extent to which I do my calendaring. There is so and this again, if anyone who wants to riff off this and make your own versions of it, please go ahead. I haven't I just use it for myself. Maybe I should make a version of it or something like that and put it up. I use two sheets. One is Google Calendar. And the other is what I call my sanity maintainer. The sanity maintainer is every week from where we are right now, the week of December, December 5, all the way for the next six months is every week. So December 5 to 12, whatever, whatever, all the way to that, I have all my clients marked out, right. And I have by now a reasonable sense of how much time I'm spending on each of them. Actually, there are three sheets, I'll get to that, you know, because all of it needs to make sense together. So for every client, I put in, okay, this summer, this client, I'm going to spend five hours a week working on tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue, tongue, you put it in for the amount of time, you know, you're definitely going to work for them on sheet number three, which is my expenses and finance sheet, I put in how much money that is going to make me right. And where this work is done is done on Google Calendar. Again, I know this seems like a bit of work, but do it for a couple of weeks, and this becomes second nature, replicate this everywhere. And at the end of spending two hours, for the first time doing this entire process, what you end up having is this apart from the peace of mind and all that you have a decent sense of how your next few months look, this works for me, because I work on a freelance level, I must mention this may not work at the office level, or something like this is how I do it, please contextualize for your own situations, etc. So this includes the clients that I'm working on, etc. So I've, I try to keep a limit of x, like 40 hours a week, I'm going to actively work, right, that 40 hours needs to be split across so many clients, this might come later, this is likely to happen, you do all those permutations and combinations. What this gives you is you have a decent sense of how much you're going to be working over the next few months, right? It gives you how much that work is going to translate to in terms of income, which let's face it is the basis of life itself, right? There is a subsequent sheet where I break down month by month, how much what are the expenses that are going to happen next year, this thing, that thing, vacation, contingency fund, and all that. Google Sheet is where this meets week on week, every week on Sunday, or whatever it is, I adjust, I actually have some clients are recurring. So I have like a sort of recurring block, which every week, I just drag and drop into various places. So at the end of this exercise, again, I know it sounds like a lot. But again, this just becomes second nature after a point of time, I have excellent visibility over what the next couple of weeks look like, I have decent visibility over what the next few, I have good visibility rather over what the next two months look like. And I have decent visibility over the next six months look like, what do I mean by decent visibility, again, all this stems from me wanting to reduce stress, anxiety, all that. One of the things I realized in 2020, that gives me a lot of stress is being unable to commit to a project, because I don't know whether I'll be able to take it on. And I have been in situations where I've taken things on because they sound interesting. And then I realized I'm scrambling to do this. And suddenly, again, what seemed like an interesting project has ended up becoming how do I get this damn thing done and finished with, right? So I've realized I need to stop doing that, no matter how interesting the project sounds. I have realized that I will take up a project only have x number of free hours per week, right? Like I said, I'm working 40 hours after I deduct my existing clients right now. Suppose there are 35 hours, right? So that means I have five hours free. Now I have a choice, either I can assume that that five hours is not going to go into rework or whatever it is, or other admin work that I may need to take care of or something like that. Or I can take on a client for five hours per week, right? Now that's a call I will decide to take. For now, I've just kept I find that imposing artificial policies on yourself are a great way of just cutting to decisions, right? For me right now, that is if it is less than 10 hours, I'm not going to take it I can I will not take on a project if that is the available time is less than 10 because it will get subsumed into something else or the other worst case scenario if I am in a situation where those 10 hours are there great use them for learning or there will be some client or the other who wants something done immediately which I'll be able to turn on whatever so all this analysis etc etc I've done I have also then factored in when exercise is going to happen give yourself as few variables as possible one thing I realized when I used to do exercise last year is that I used to do it at my own time I used to do cult workouts or whatever and I was terrible at that terrible at that make one decision less join an online class where you have to join at 7 a.m or 6 p.m whatever the case may be commit to that reduce the variables again I cannot believe I am espousing Mark Zuckerberg a second time on a podcast but that thing that he once said that I wear only great shirts because it's one decision I need to make less it's a little extreme but I"

        "message": "biggest time sink really there is kind of social media so what are your sort of ways of dealing with that so I think it starts again I hate to say this for everything but I think it goes back to objectives like what are you using social media for I think different people use it for different reasons right some people would want to see what their friends are up to some people want to just give in to what is happening on twitter these days and be you know roll up their sleeves for a good fight sort of thing other people might actually go there to seek inspiration and or to give inspiration whatever the case may be and other people might just need a five minute break once in a while and just see some stories whatever whatever and go back it is that last mentioned thing that tends to spiral out of control and that five minutes ends up becoming 10 minutes becomes 15 minutes whatever whatever whatever maybe leads to some sort of anxiety because you read some news from somewhere whatever it is I try to avoid that as much as possible genuinely speaking and I have gotten to the point where I pretty much open up social media only when I go to the loo or something like that and of course during free time I keep it open just to see what happens I think my usage of social media has gone down and has become extremely inconsistent and I don't mind that at all because I think the conversations with people that I really care about happen on whatsapp and other medium that I'm extremely asynchronous on I think and I don't regret that at all when I go on to twitter it's usually just see what's happening on the timeline maybe and the timeline at any point of time gives me a sense of okay should I is there anything over here worth replying to or whatever and now I've realized to leave trolls alone this thing then whatever sometimes somebody's nice enough to write in and say the podcast was nice whatever so engage in a conversation with them or reply to them come back later whatever the case maybe sometimes something random happens today something beautiful happened Tony was complaining about his fan or something like that turns out I had the exact same thing but I didn't know whether there was a fan issue he said I was confused he said paging your wife for help whatever whatever all that sort of so it ended up being this delightful very random twitter golden era ish thread that that just ran dumbly happened so this I think would happen for a sum total of about 30 minutes a day which I think is okay I don't think I'm social media addicted one thing I do do is I actually log out and I feel that is extremely liberating log out and don't remember password and keep a very long complicated password here's what I've realized happens when you open up by instinct ctrl t and put t into the chrome or whatever browser user bar twitter loads up it is astonishing at least for me how much I like I say oh I need to enter my long email id and my long complicated password screw it yeah let's just like whatever close it and move on like for me I have been shocked by how much this has worked for me and if you do it on phone another level because typing out a password on even swift key is infinite time more difficult than on a keyboard for me that's how I control it genuinely speaking that's how I that's that's how I control it but I think honestly the biggest thing is I've just been dissociated from the for me let me put it this way Amit I think the appeal of social media has gone away for me in many ways right once in a while get onto twitter see something's happening great if that happens some people reply reply to them asynchronous as and when it happens great sometimes once in a while I might put out a thread or something that warrants some sort of reaction maybe I mean we're all content creators we want validation you go back see where people have retweeted like commented whatever it is like that freelance thread I wrote I was very active on twitter for those two like last last week I put out a thread about my headphone journey something was completely random how I graduated from say 500 rupee headphones that I had in college to a very expensive pair that I just bought right now which was my dream for a few years and all that I just put it out because I just wanted to put it out over there but I didn't realize the amount of love that it got because people contextualize that into their own dreams that they had for me it was headphones or somebody else it was a bike or whatever it is great so I spent a lot of time replying to that and all that this happens maybe once a month or or so so as you can see it's fairly inconsistent I'd like to think that I'm not very distracted by social media because I I think I've built that discipline in over a period of time also I have get my kicks more out of other things now if I need a dopamine rush I'd rather listen to a good song which happens very very often rather than just get on to social or something I have genuinely gotten the habit now more of listening to if I need a distraction I'll either listen to something on my system or load up something on YouTube maybe even listen to a cover or something like that got into that habit get those five minutes out of the way get back to work so rather than get that fix from social genuinely don't know what the when I logged on to Facebook for the last time was LinkedIn though I don't use too much in any case to be honest that's really about it I think I'm it makes me feel bad in some way because there are a lot of friends out there putting up I feel like I want to go back to the good old times on social where it was really about friends and less about posturing and content creation in that sense and I'm extremely guilty of it because I have so much content which I keep spamming so to so apologies to all my followers for these double standards that I have right now but yeah I think overall just to answer your question I think I'm lucky enough to have somehow managed to de-addict myself from social yeah while"

        "message": "retention and all of all of those sort of processes this is again a phrase that I have come to love after speaking to you and Ashok for such a long time we just go back to first principles right have a few pieces of knowledge from which you know even if you wake up 10 years later will still be the same in a sense strip away everything else right I and it's amazing how useful that piece of advice has been for everything including like say marketing right I think that for example a good marketing strategy will be the same in 2010 2020 1950 whatever the mediums might change right the mediums will change but the objective of what those things are going to be and the strategy etc will remain the same I find stripping these things away very very useful I retain those few things so firstly I don't use the system I tried Rome research for a while and maybe it's my fault because I didn't give it enough time and I was impatient and all that so that's my mistake it seems like a great tool I've seen great things written about it etc so including from you of course so I think that's one of the things I will try in 2022 for sure so I don't have a system as such but I'll tell you what works for me I constantly validate or invalidate anything that I have read or listened to etc against what I already know for example if I come across in the field of marketing if I come across a new example I say yeah okay it fits with that with this angle added to it so I don't know exactly how to call this but it's it's led to a it's led to a system now where I can okay you if you need an example of how Instagram was used in a creative way for this particular industry I'll just uh yeah okay got it yeah okay here's the example it's not like I don't think I have a great memory or something it's just that I retain a few very relevant examples constantly validate if I find a better example chuck the old one out replace it in that's sort of like how I manage it in my head by just retaining as few pieces of information as possible honestly and having enough examples to buttress those however what I try to retain are memorable lines and things that make I mean that have a lot more weight than just the five or six words that that they may convey those when I come across those in a book or in a podcast or whatever it is I immediately stop what I'm doing and make a note of it so I don't make a habit of this it's not like I have if I'm reading non-fiction for example I it's like I recently read a great book I read was Farid Zakaria's 10 lessons for a post-pandemic world for example I didn't make notes right I was very tempted to on the kindle so I was highlighting and I got very good at figuring out whether I'm going to use something for later or whether it is just an impulse oh I must save this right now like ha no yeah like I'm not going to sit and worry about the reasons why the cold war whatever whatever so I'm not going to bother highlighting this because I'm never going to refer back to this I always look for reusability in that sense but on the other hand there was this I'm a big big fan of Scott Galloway the marketing professor and also a very outspoken ex I mean I just love the way he thinks one of the beautiful lines one of the best lines about branding in general that I have heard he it was a very throwaway line for him that he said during some I guess on pivot with Kara Swisher and he said he was talking about how Google Facebook etc are taking over our lives marketing and the decisions that we take we you know we remember we retain fewer brands in our heads because Google and Facebook are where we go to figure out what our favorite brand etc is and the line that he used was so brilliant I've made part of my marketing presentation at least for me it was it was what is a brand a brand is just a shortcut for taking a purchase decision and I thought and I just stopped when I heard that because it just resonated so much I'm like yeah absolutely like if I haven't seen a Nike ad in the last two years and if I need to buy a shoe I will still think Nike first because why all the branding work that they've done what is the result of all that branding work they don't need to sell they don't want me to buy a shoe today but eventually this fucker is going to want a shoe at that point of time he should remember us similarly Volvo safe car whatever these are classic examples but then it goes down to it goes down to even individuals right I know for example there are some people in my friend circle who I will reach out to for a particular kind of design that needs to be done so whatever personal branding they have done for themselves inadvertently or whatever it is it is a shortcut for me taking a purchase decision of utilizing them for my project or for a client's project or whatever it is so these kind of lines I will retain and the way I try to make sure I don't forget it is by putting it in a place where I will reuse it again which works in my case in terms of presentations etc the other thing that I do is I run a newsletter called things of internet which is a pseudo marketing plus I just call it just general fun things that happen around the internet and all that this becomes an excellent place for me to save stuff and put in and retain that level of information once you put it down you tend to remember it a little more these are not like fully fleshed out processes or anything like that but these are the these are these are what have worked for me really at least in the spaces that I that I that I work in which is primarily marketing and all that everything else right I take a call like there are some things that I might read on politics is a very nice line or something but then I ask myself okay am I going to reuse this again is there a point in me remembering this or should I just enjoy it in the moment let it go maybe add it to one of your principles or or like does it validate or invalidate anything you're thinking and then I let it go that's it I don't fall under the tension that's another thing that used to give me a lot of anxiety oh I must remember each and every fact and all that that bullshit I realize doesn't work anymore I don't need to what is important for me at least is some of the marketing things and all that so that's really how I think about this right now it's not a very satisfactory answer I know because it's not a knowledge management system as such but it's what works for me and I'm happy with that yeah no it's a lovely"
