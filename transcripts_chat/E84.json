This is one with huge implications if I hadn't been born heterosexual I don't like the word straight because it implies that those who are not straight must be crooked in some way if I hadn't been Born heterosexual I would have grown up full of self-doubt about my own normalcy Feeling a guilt and fear and confusion that I should not have had to feel I can imagine What it must be to grow up left-handed I? Can empathize but I'm not sure I can imagine what it would have been like to grow up gay in India"

And in that understanding I learned more about what the church was not telling us you know The whole pedophilia racket and what was happening back in our own playground And my mom and I would have vehement arguments about that So hence the concern of like ever coming to terms with my orientation Was diminished because of the fact that I grew up in such a staunch community that would never accept me And hence the walking away from the church happened like a little more drastically than I imagined But it had to happen I feel"

So every night I would go and I would do this material about what's it like coming out you know and one advice I got as a comic was to stick to the material I'm doing for the first six months, do that same four minutes everywhere so you can understand how that evolves automatically, what funny bits remain and stuff like that. And for the first six months I was mainly bombing with that material you know so it became very difficult for me to like get spots and stuff like that and a lot of older comics like Sapan Verma, Kunal Kamra and Zakir and Biswa would advise me to stick to it you know don't don't change the narrative just because some jokes are not working because you have a really strong idea of how you want to build this material. So I would do that so from there it became easier for me to like channel my energy into writing better material and you know you transition from the four minute phase to six minutes and eight minutes and then 15 and stuff like that. So I was working at Hive, I was writing comedy, I was doing some writing work on the side as well. All of this was going well and I was creating queer content so to say on my own. We would do a small mic called the rainbow mic in Hive which was like calling all the queer contestants to come and do whatever they wanted. Some would like recite poetry, storytelling, dancing, you know slam poetry, comedy as well. So all kinds of queer performers were given a chance to like do their work. So that's when I found like oh my god there's an entire little undercircuit that we're building and we're not even realizing that this is a movement on its own you know. And there was not much happening as I said there was like always the gay party scene but culturally for like the queers in Bombay and other metropolitan cities not much was happening as much as I wanted to you know see. So we were doing the small little thing and from there I began again like you know questioning whether like sooner or later will they find out because I now had half an hour of material about coming out and my friends and homophobic."

And there was another comic called Nick Pillow who's a white guy who's been teaching drama in Bombay for the longest time. So somebody told me he's also a queer comic. So we came together and did a show called Homo's Odyssey which again a pun on Homo's Odyssey. You like puns. I love puns. And so Homo's Odyssey became like this one two person show where you know do a lot of little acts together like we would do small sketches interspersed with a stand up as well. And might I say the first stand up comedy kiss on stage."

You make a decision. You take the leap. You land on the boat. The edge though steep. The currents are strong. The journey is tough. The water is coarse. It's choppy. It's rough. You're scared to cross. Now you risk a glance. Your friends and family say you've missed your chance. The chance to stick to the regular show, the chance to be ordinary and cheat your core. The belief it surges and so does the wave. You don't need to look back. You're far too brave. The storm descends. The boat sails calm. The bridge it passes. You're befuddled with charm. The other shore arrives. You begin to strut. You know now the journey was tough but worth. The loneliness has vanished. You're relieved and glad. The past won't haunt you now. The past you once had."

And from there, I also would like do DMC on the weekends, they said, so that would give me some more money. So overall, I was like taking care of the house now slowly. And hence, like, there was still a certain level of attachment to the family. But they were constantly aware that I was not making as well and don't keep constantly, you know, planting it in my head again and again that, hey, if you were doing this would have been happier. Maybe you can go back to it. And I was like, no, I've left that life behind entirely. I was happy doing what I was doing. So it was like, for the longest time, I did not emote so much at home, which I also regret now because I could have been more abrupt about it. And, you know, like, I just tried to like, placate everybody at the same time and make sure I could hold all those things together. Because one of the main reasons coming out is difficult in India, because what if they throw me out and I have to like, then be on the streets. So I just have to make sure that I can make sure I can earn enough money at the same time and take care of myself if that whole phase happens when I have to go out. And then the second coming out happened around the same time because I was so away from the church for a while that I did not want to go back to it and, you know, be in the same environment with the same kind of homophobic because religion is kind of like very handy when it comes to homophobia. People start quoting lines and stuff like that, which I don't want to deal with. So proactively, I stopped going to church and that was a very hateful period in my house because they could not take that at all. Like, you know, I was raised in such a strong household that for me, not going to church was like the biggest sin I'd ever committed in my entire life."

And then you will see all the killings that are happening in the name of religion and you know, you read a little bit and you understand that, oh, all of this is kind of made up and the crusades happened. So you know, like when you would think about all of these things, you'd be like, oh, wait, like let's take a backtracking mechanism here and be like, the main reason you liked it so much because everybody's just like so into you and they all praise you and they all want to make the best out of what they're given sort of.

So I would just like stop participating in that and my sister was like, tell me why? And I'd be like, look at the whole way it's skewed and look at all this pedophilia and look at all how the church is, you know, like taking money from people, not helping them, all of that. Like, why is there so much disparity in African kids and Indian kids, we are so entitled, all of that. And my mom was like, just like for, for like five days more, go to church and try it out. I'm like, for five days, mom, you try to be an atheist, you stop believing in God and stop going to church. So like, how can you make me do something I don't want to do? And I'm like, touche, right now, that's what exactly what's happening. And she was like, oh, wait, then she actually took a step back and she realized she was doing the same thing to me, which I wanted her to do for a change. And then she was a little more calmer after that, she was like, okay, I think it's your call. But my dad, again, like my dad always goes to the extreme, does not exactly, he does not talk to me, talk to me, but also does not, like, he pulls the strings from the background, basically, he'll talk to my mom about something and he'll surnow her, and then her head is hurting because of my dad constantly, you know, bickering with her. So I was feeling like I'm causing all this stress in my family, I might as well move out now itself, because it's easier to like, just vanish from their lives. Again, a very stupid, impulsive teenage decision, I'm not even a teenager back then, I was 23. But I felt like going away from the house for some time would have been helpful. But that did not help at all, like they were crying more than they were usually doing that. And my dad would like, my dad picked up his phone and called me and I knew like shit's going down because he hardly calls me. And he's like, you've just like, gone and haven't told us where you are and what's happening. So after like 15 days, I finally got back home. And that's when I sat my mom down and I told her first. And there was a plan in action where it was like her birthday approaching, so we would not tell the entire family until her birthday. So we could like keep this between mother and son and then slowly tell the rest of the family in a more civilized manner when they all gathered together. So I could also do my piece and be like, hey, let me decentralize you, instead of you all just like assuming things. But my mom could not keep it inside and this is your third coming out of saying that, yeah. And this was the final official for me like being openly gay sort of thing.

The thrill of it is what actually excites a lot of people like it's all behind closed doors and everything. So it's easy to get laid. But then when someone says translate this love outside where you can walk on the street on the pavement with your partner's hand in your hand, or you know, go on dates and stuff like that, it immediately becomes a problem because then you're acting like two bros on a date who won't sit on the same side of the table, won't feed each other, you know, the cutesy things you want to do because you have to, you have to act a certain way. So again, like, you know, this happened because as soon as you want to show your love, it becomes too cumbersome for some people. And that's how most relationships don't work out in the long run. People online will tell you that he's looking for hookups and not for like longevity. And again, just like go from one guy to the other hoping that this one works out. So that was like for the longest time. And I was very gullible in my early 20s.

Dealing with that guilt is so difficult sometimes that just saying it out loud helps you. This went out so much of the of the aggression that you've lived with your entire life, you know, like with my mom at every stage in my life from the point I was 15 when I could like, you know, reaffirm my thoughts.

And hence the need for a queer community to be born. Because if it dates back to the American Stonewall period, right, where a lot of people would come together and party. And even though they had varied interests, for example, some had drag queens coming in, some had like lesbian butch women coming in, some had gay men coming into like hookup. The normalcy was found that they were all the same kind of heathens, right? And hence they would come together and party and they would like try to, again, back in the day, extort money, cops would charge in on them, the Stonewall riots happened. And like any riot that happens because of a community is because of the understanding that they've all suffered from the same problems. And if you were like a black lesbian, back in the 50s, you were already down the drain because you were like, the lowest rung when it comes to understanding, if you're a white gay man, you still have some privilege. But if you're a black lesbian woman, you have a different kind of privilege, which is not afforded to you. So for them, fighting the supreme power became like a common thing. And hence, the LGBT community around the world is fighting the same thing, finding the commonness in being who you are at the same time, also finding love and acceptance within the community."

It is because the commonness in the voice and the power with which the community hits back, because it does have the most creative individuals overall. And you know, if you look at the ad campaigns that have gone around the world in the past few years, with regards to finding gay voices and giving them rights, you'll find a very innovative way of storytelling because it's not just about fighting for rights, but also about the right to love, right to like, you know, find the same kind of housing that everybody else has. So when you look at it from an emotional level, gay marriage is making more sense, because then if you can't live with the person you love the most, then how would you even live? And hence, the whole community became more stronger in the mid 2009 when Obama was like, you know, and believe it or not, like everywhere around the world, America does influence the thought pattern a lot when it comes to all the liberalist movements. And so then when moved on to Europe as well, it became much easier for them to mimic these movements and you know, allow people to vote for the right thing. And if you look at like the ad campaign Ireland did to like get Paris to come out and vote for their kids favour, because like, it's a matter of love. And when you boil it down to love, it's all kind of coming together already. So that's why the LGBT community has been ever inclusive, because now it's gone to QIA. And you know, intersex, asexual, queer couples are also like a part of the whole gamut now. And we are just getting to the tip of the iceberg now is what I mean. And in India, how strong is it's pretty strong now, like in Bombay, and mainly metro cities like Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata and Chennai. So they have like a lot of collectives coming together, a lot of people do a lot of different things. So people organize parties, some people do actual donation work, some people do research work. And you have like eight centres to help people diagnose themselves. And research centres again for that very purpose. So a lot of things happening in Bombay, when you do the pride, like every year, the number of people participating increases along with the allies.

Don't go with the intention of hooking up to all of these, obviously, my whole thing is that first go and learn the community, understand, meet people, understand different behaviors, lifestyles, and you know, explore that side of it.

At what level, for you, when you think about the struggle that your life involves, does it involve not just a personal struggle of coming to terms with who you are and doing what you have to do and the personal struggles of your art, but also this larger struggle where, you know, you want to make India more progressive in this sense and sort of advance"

And also like to tell them that, hey, listen to these love stories of these people, you know, people, when they come to my show, I don't tell them like, oh, we're going to be preachy about this. Just tell me what happened in your life. So they'll be like, oh, I had a crush on this person. I was a girl and I had a crush on a girl. And then she fell in love with me. And then we had the longest dating time, you know, and that makes me so happy because they're not pretending to be anybody else than who they are and telling me a story that would happen in anybody else's life. So the idea was always to create conversations which are still normalizing the whole idea that we also have lives. It's just that we don't flash it too much because we're afraid that you won't like it. But maybe in this way, when you listen to our stories, you'll like it, you'll understand that we do come with a certain sense of fear because of how we are treated in society. So that's why we need all these stories to come out and say that there's a promise for a better tomorrow, even though it's going to be very rigorous and slow, we still have hope that it'll get just better. And that's what like last year's Pride was, it gets better, was the theme of the Pride."

So when a kid looks up for it, when they're discovering queer identities and everything, they'll have some kind of research work to go back to, which is again, like a very Indian voice, you know, because as I said, I went to men from around the world to understand what they went through. But the situation is very differently perceived in India. So I wanted to give listeners a chance to understand the queer Indian identity from the podcast perspective."

But there's also like, a lot of insight into what's it like to come from different backgrounds and have different identities also, from around the country that to like, you know, I've spoken to people on Skype and we had Alok Vaid Menon, they are a spoken word poet from America, femme and very proudly so, so, so they actually face a lot of homophobia in America when they walk on the streets. So it was important to get their story when they came down to India, I kind of found them and Shakti and Alok came and they did a great episode with me. So hence, I feel like, when you go back to understanding why you wanted to do this, there has to be a purpose to this, right? So when we finally got all these stories, and I'd look back at it, and people find me online and message me saying that, hey, I heard your podcast, it helped me cope with so much. It means a lot to me eventually that I did not go on a on a save your mission at all. I was just like, I hope that someone did this for me."

And what makes me hopeful is that there's a very strong ally movement in this country, people, women, especially, who have felt the same kind of, you know, the society's rebuked them on a certain level. So they understand. So I've made such great friendship with women who are so admirable in their own way, and they go out of their way to help me out, deal with my own mental anxiety."

Now I look at men who are flamboyant, and I lose my shit and I become one of them, you know, like, because I've always been an expressive kid, but I would hide that to become a part of society. But when I'm dancing with them, or whenever I'm being a very stereotypical gay character, but I'd be like, okay, girl, don't talk like that, you know, swinging our fingers and everything snapping around.
