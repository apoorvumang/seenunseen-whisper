        "message": "Before we move on with this episode of the Scene in the Unseen, do check out another awesome podcast from IVM Podcast, Cyrus Says, hosted by my old buddy, Cyrus Brocha. The 2019 general elections are upon us and it's a good time to ask, what do our political parties believe in? Most parties espouse principles only as a matter of positioning in the political marketplace. They will say anything and do anything that gets them votes. They are immoral and sociopathic. You vote for them on the basis of what you want in that political marketplace and how credibly they can deliver that. But there is one political party in India that is clearly different. The BJP does seem to have certain core beliefs. And because they are the biggest political player around, and because beliefs have consequences, it is worth examining their philosophy. What is this Hindutva thing? What is this Hindu Rashtra that so many people aspire to? What does it mean for our nation that the BJP's idea of India is so exclusionary, so full of resentments from the past, so dependent on identity? And most importantly, what are its intellectual foundations? Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Aakar Patel, a journalist and columnist whose work I have been reading since the 1990s, who is often provocative, usually insightful, and always worth reading. I asked Aakar to come on the show as a guest in the expectation of nothing other than a stimulating conversation, and I didn't have a subject in mind for him. Then Aakar mentioned that he's writing a book called Our Hindu Rashtra, which will be released by Westland later this year. It made perfect sense to talk about that, especially with these ongoing elections, to take a closer look at what is fast becoming an idea of India that has gained immense traction in the last few years. What is Hindutva exactly? Why has it become so popular recently? What are its intellectual foundations? I got the stimulating conversation I wanted and you're invited to listen in. But first, a quick commercial break. This episode of the scene in the unseen is brought to you by Storytel. Storytel is an audiobook platform which you can listen to on your Android or iOS app. They have thousands of audio books that you can listen to on your mobile, including hundreds in local languages like Hindi and Marathi, and unlimited monthly subscription costs only rupees 299 per month. And you can also get a 30 day free trial if you hop on over to storytel.com slash IBM. I actually use Storytel myself regularly. So as long as they sponsor the show, I'm going to recommend one book a week that I love. My recommendation today is a book I finished reading a month ago called Atomic Habits by James Clear. I have a huge problem of discipline. My mind keeps wandering. I crave the dopamine rush of social media. I never seem to get anything done. But Atomic Habits has some great insights on how the brain works and how we can discipline it one atomic habit at a time. James Clear also has a great weekly newsletter. But hey, you can hear his book for free on Storytel. And remember, you get a 30 day free trial only at storytel.com slash IBM. Welcome to the scene in the unseen. Thank you. Before we get going talking about the book that you're writing and the subject at hand, tell me a little bit about yourself. You've been a journalist, right since the early 90s. And now you had amnesty in India."

And then the series of Malwis came home, this was in early 2000. And they taught me how to read it. And at some point, I figured out that this was just the Hindi that I knew from Bollywood, written a different way. So the mystery and the romance left at that point. But I knew the language sufficiently to be able to do some basic translations. And I did that. And you also translated Montauk's works. Yes. So he's quite an interesting writer. He was autodidactic himself, didn't pass out of college, and wrote very simply, I think he wrote the kind of language that you and I would recognize as being Hindi. He would call it Urdu. So it wasn't that difficult. The perso-Arabic content, which tends to define Urdu in our time was fairly low in his writing."

Pakistanis that I know think that Bollywood is, is actually their language, Urdu. And when I asked them what they think Hindi is, they would say something like, it's what Vajpayee speaks, you know, whereas we would listen to Jio TV or one of the Pakistani stations, and it would not be that easy for us to pick it out.

And one of the things that I can't often figure out is that when Modi gives many of his speeches like his addresses to the nation and chooses to speak in Hindi, he's not actually speaking in the regular colloquial Hindi in which you and I might converse, but a shuddh form of it using those shuddh Hindi terms. And I've always wondered that if if he is trying to spread his thing as a national leader, isn't that strategically unwise? Or does that in itself imply some kind of message and positioning?"

I think Vajpayee wrote a much more Sanskritized form of the language. Mr. Modi comes out of a tradition where in Gujarati, it's been a language which has had access to Arabic and Farsi for a very long time. And the modern Gujarati vocabulary is not dependent on, for instance, English, to be able to have sophisticated communication in commerce. So we have words like say Hundi or Hawala, which are bad words, otherwise outside of Gujarat. But for a Gujarati, they would purely be these are both words from our area would just be purely words that would represent transactions. So I think he would be using a lot of Farsi words, you know, we call a door a Darwajo, which is actually a Persian word. And, and so on. So I don't think that it's as stripped as Mr. Vajpayee's was.

You did have, say, Muslims in your class, but because it was a school that was middle class, and English, there wasn't as much representation of the society that you would be in. And once you left school, Surat is fairly ghettoized, so it's it's a very old city. The Brits came there in 1608, but it was already a big city, then Tolstoy wrote a short story called the coffee house of Surat, where he says that a lot of people from around the world, you know, Chinese people and Armenians and all gather and talk about life. And it's true that it was a port city till the 18th century, it was both globalized and ghettoized. It was both globalized and ghettoized. Very, very true. It had access because of its port, it has a very sheltered port, or it did actually now it's silted over. But the port is inland from the sea. So you could have fairly large ships come into the Arabian Sea and then come into Surat and but then be on a river, the Tapi, which which cuts India in half, east to west. And so it had access to the Portuguese and the Dutch and the English and so on, much before the rest of India did. It was the primary port of the Mughal Empire. So it was where Hajj left from. And it was this city and is this city which was segregated in terms of caste. So you had something called a Sheri, which is a lane with a single mouth. And you've got homes on both sides, you know, sharing walls of one caste. So my mom grew up in a place called Sidh Matani Sheri, which is the neighborhood of the of this goddess called Sidh Mata and it was full of partidar homes. So when I go back to Surat, a lot of the neighbors there are still from the same caste and it's sort of remained that way. And how did that shape the young man you were? One big difference between me and a lot of the other people from my background was the fact that I went to a school there, where I was taught English. So Surat at that point had four schools, it was a city of about 25 or 30 lakh people, but there were only four schools that taught English, three of them set up by the missionaries and one by the Parsis, Hindus who were 90% of the school's population had not built a single one. But that access to the language gave one access then to books. There was there was one bookstore in Surat then, like a very large city. But whatever I could get my hands on, I would read and that sort of opened up the world in a way that would not have had I been like the rest of my cousins and so on, not in an"

That's why we see very remarkable things like a vote share of more than 50%, which is very unusual in democratic politics anywhere, but particularly in this country, because what happens usually in our country is that you've got two dominant castes. Let's say in Karnataka, we are in Bangalore now, you've got the Karega and you've got the Lingayat. So they would they would they would be a kind of a primary war over who would get access to the state and the goodies that the state gives. So it's usually that way. What's happened in Gujarat is that though it started out that way, where the division was basically the party that community supporting the BJP, which it does still the majority of all BJP cabinets that have been formed in that state since 95 have comprised of the Patel community. And the other community was the New York Shatria or what is called Thakur Darbar these these words which went to the Congress. But what has happened is that the split is not even seats that are reserved, for instance, for the schedule castes and the schedule tribes tend to go to the BJP entirely. And the Congress has stayed there in almost permanent opposition. I'm 49 years old, I came into the age of voting in 1988. Every single Lok Sabha election that I have been old enough to vote for there has been won by one BJP man. Of course, he was denied a ticket after Mr. Modi came to power. But Kashi Ramlana was the guy who represented Surat. And from being somebody who was 18 or 19 to somebody who was in his 40s to have the same person represent them, it's very unusual for the city especially. But that's how Gujarat has has come to be."

People who are much better at than you and you worked with women. I had never worked with a woman before in my life.

So you have you have an education drilled into you fairly, fairly quickly. So I think by the mid 90s, yeah, I was there. I also encountered some people whose writing stayed with me for a very long time. And there's a man called Khalid Ahmed, who writes for the Express here in India. He's he's a Lahori, he's a former diplomat in the Pakistani Foreign Service, a former newspaper editor, both in Urdu, in English, he wrote for a paper called the Frontier Post in Zia's period. So that was not an easy time for journalists, definitely not for somebody who was a proper intellectual, which which he is. And he was bilingual. So I think that really attracted me to him. What we have on the subcontinent generally, and in this country in particular, is that the intellectual narrative belongs to a group of people who are more or less a monolingual that they can read in their own language, but they do not regularly read in it. And they certainly don't write it. He was different in that sense. So he brought he brought up a perspective, which was quite unique, and I would recommend to those people who are sort of listening to this to try and find some of his stuff."

It wasn't called that then, a Morangabad, a man called Madhudi, self-taught, but smart enough to look at the modern world and build a structure that responded to the modern world from the perspective of his faith. We didn't have that happen from the Hindu thinkers.

So Afghanistan, Pakistan chose to have Islamic constitutions, so did the Maldives. In Lanka, Buddhism is a privilege, according to the constitution. Bangladesh was part, obviously, of the Pakistan movement, but its foundational direction was secular. So it was Bengali nationalism rather than anything else. But when they became independent, they put Bismillah-e-Rahman-e-Rahim on top of the constitution, which was then removed by the court. But all the nations have dabbled in it in some way, Bhutan has a king who can only come from a particular faith, and he controls both the physical apparatus of the state as well as the spiritual one. Nepal used to be what is called a Hindu Rashtra till 2008. Though, of course, it was limited in the sense that you cannot have a Hindu Rashtra. And that's what my book is also about, it's not physically possible. But all of these states, at some point, assumed that they should be in some way a majoritarian, except for the largest country in South Asia. So we started off as being unique, and we've remained unique. I think both for reasons that were positive in nature, that the people who were writing the laws and the constitution felt it should be that way.

And, you know, and when we sort of think about the last 70 years, I mean, obviously, elites write constitutions everywhere, elites run policy, and they design the country. But it seems that at some sense, what we see in the last five years, is also that there is a sense of reassertion by people who are saying that no, this is a real India and you elites have it wrong, and you're completely irrelevant. And obviously, a side note to that is all the ranting that goes on against the elites and how the word liberal has become a pejorative and so on. But what do you feel about something that I consider a paradox, being a liberal of sorts myself, that you had a bunch of liberal elites imposing a liberal constitution on an illiberal country.

One is the assumption made by people like Upadhyay and others that in some way, the constitution represents values that are foreign or that are alien. I haven't ever found a response to what else it should be. Okay, I accept the fact that the Constituent Assembly of India is basically the Congress Party debating itself, there's no particularly strong representation from what we would consider to be conservative, upper caste elements, exerting that sort of, you know, conservatism from the Hindu faith. But if they were, what would they do? The problem with the majoritarian Hindutva aspect is that, unlike Islam, where you can have a majoritarian constitution that discriminates against the minorities, and you do have that in a lot of places, including in Pakistan. Problem with Hindutva constitution, the way that I have understood it based on what I've read, is that it will discriminate against most Hindus. If we look at the caste system, there are two things that any state can do when it decides to be a majoritarian from the faith perspective. One is that it tries to impose the articles of its faith. The other is that it discriminates. We've got the latter, and we've had it for a long time. I don't think that it's the BJP that has done bad things by itself, and the people that came before it were in some way different. They were different in minor ways, but I think that for the most part, it's not that we were going through a kind of halcyon phase, and then it's suddenly become hell. That's not the way that I see it. The problem is on the other side, Pakistan can say through its constitution, and it has said that no non-Muslim can become the president, and they can't, because that's what the law says. How is it that we are going to impose the Hindu faith on a population that's 85% Hindu, where you've got a third of that population is Dalit and Adivasi, about 50% is from the community I come from, which is Shudra, based on the Smritis. As is Modi himself. As is Modi himself. Imposing the articles of faith would lead to wholesale discrimination against the majority of Hindus. And so it's not physically possible for us to have Hindu Rashtra in this country."

And you know, as you pointed out in the notes that you sent me from your book about this, that this was something specifically that, not in the context of the constitution, but in terms of what a Hindu Rashtra should look like, that Golwalkar felt that there should be no focus on individual rights at all, that the collective took precedence over the individual. So if I would imagine a Hindutva constitution, and obviously I can't because I don't have the kind of knowledge that you do, but if I were to imagine it, I imagine one of the things that it would not do, which the current constitution does partially, is protect individual"

And I think that that's probably what, what we are living through, that you're living through a default Hindu Rashtra that discriminates against say, women going to temple because they are seen as, you know, impure in some way, in terms of a practice, but that runs into law. The law says, I'm sorry, but you know, if you have a constitution that says equality, and I think we have a pretty mediocre set of judges in our Supreme Court, but even there, I think you would find that when the practice of sort of Hindu Rashtra runs into the constitution, the response is usually incoherent, that it is not able to express itself because the discrimination is underneath rather than completely externalized, like it is in Islam."

        "message": "Tell me a little bit about that. Pakistan can be seen in a few different ways. So I think the one thing that I came to learn pretty late in life was that the partition of India was basically the partition of just two states, Bengal and Punjab. And on the West, the transfer of citizens was almost absolute. So very few non-Muslims remaining in West Punjab, very few Muslims remaining in East Punjab. Secondly, and I know this because of the work done by the amateur sociologists and ethnographers that the Raj brought with it, who were really interested in communities and they would document stuff. What happened in Punjab was that the conversion of the primary mercantile castes, there were two of them, Khatri and Amaroda, other than the Baniyas, who were very small, did not happen outside of Sikhism. So 99.9% of the people from these two communities remained Hindu or they were Sikh. The 10 Sikh gurus were Khatri. Partition on that front was a partition also of castes because of this, that you had a fairly talented set of merchants who all moved after 47. And you had, on the other hand, a very hardworking set of Jats who had been given access by the British to the army. After the mutiny, they were the Balwak of the British Indian army. And they had been given lands and so on. So you've got this fairly martial population in charge of a large part of Pakistan, more than 50% of what is today Pakistan and what used to be West Pakistan is Punjabi speaking. So you had a dominant martial caste there in charge of the population without the leavening of the mercantilism of the Khatri and the Arora Punjabis. To my mind that had a significant effect in the way that the country evolved and has continued to evolve. I think the militaristic spirit that it shows, the love of the army despite being ruled by it for most of its post-1947 period speaks to that. I think there is some romance to the way that they view the military. The Pakistan project, I think, collapsed from the modernist point of view with the death of Jinnah where in his person, there was still some hope that they were going to some kind of Turkey type state which would. So Turkey in the 20s, romanized the alphabet, banned the fairs. And so that was seen as a sign of modernity and there were suits and they had guns and so on. And Jinnah was quite sort of enamored of Hamata Turk. He's named only two books that he's read. I translated a very short interview he did in Gujarati in the 1920s. And the two books that he's read, one is The Count of Monte Cristo and the other is a book called A Gray Wolf by this man called H.C. Armstrong who had profiled Kamala Tatuk. Were these his favorite books or do you think they were? I don't think he was well read. He's a beautiful writer. I wish I hadn't spent as much money on the Jinnah papers as I have because they're rubbish. But his, the way that he spoke and wrote is manifestly superior to what people of my generation who've studied English and you know, we are not there. He spoke and wrote it really well. He had a sort of felicity for the language. And he was an accomplished lawyer. He was a very good advocate. He was not a particularly good lawyer. I think the difference in that is that he was very good at taking a brief and then being able to represent it before a judge rather than doing the hard work of finding the details out and so on. So he was seen as a phenomenal advocate, but not that good a lawyer. So he dies a few months after partition as does Gandhi. And in the weeks up to partition, Jinnah has made statements that suggest that the constitution of Pakistan, he's careful to say that it is the work of the constituent assembly and not his own. But he says enough to suggest that it would have some sort of alignment with the faith. Then just four days before partition, he gives a speech to the, he speaks to the constituent assembly where he says things like in a post-independence Pakistan, Hindus will be free to go to their temples and so on. And he says that the state is not likely at some point in the future to look on citizens through the prism of faith, that they will just be Pakistanis. So that suggested to people later that he was trying to speak of a secular state, but he never used that word secular. And he left enough sort of evidence here and there for us to assume that he would be okay with the way that the Pakistani constitution, constitutions, I should say they have three of them turned out. And but he dies, he's got TB just before a partition, his doctor who's a Parsi man from Bombay doesn't tell anybody. And six months after he dies, the Pakistani constituent assembly, which has a fairly large composition of Bengali Hindus from East Pakistan, debate, they start their discussions on what the constitution should be. And Liaquat Ali Khan, who's this North Indian kind of royalty type figure, Sunni, Jinnah was a Gujarati from a very small community called the Seven Arshiyas, the Khojas. And he had actually converted out of it at one point. Liaquat proposed something called the objective resolution, which was a sort of a preamble. And Pakistan, according to that, a preamble would be an Islamic state, where sovereignty belonged to Allah. But it would be given interest to the people of Pakistan. And you would have democracy, you would have freedom, you would have tolerance, you would have justice, you would have all of that. But you would have all of these as enunciated by Islam. And this naturally alarmed the Hindus in the Pakistani constituent assembly. And there's a series of very learned interventions that they made. And it's worth reading them. And I hope to reproduce much of that in my book. Saying that this was not what Jinnah had promised, that this was vague, they were going into a space which no other nation had gone through before. Pakistan and Israel pretty much at the same time determined that they're going to be states that have a faith based component in the constitution. So Jewish state there and you've got the Muslim state here. But these words as enunciated by Islam didn't really mean much specifically. Islam itself broke into two right at the beginning. Not because of a theological dispute, but because of a political dispute who should succeed the prophet. And so there was no real means of saying what Islamic democracy was, what was Islamic equality. Being a desert people, they had the primary form of asset with the family was actually cattle, easy to divide. And so at a time in the world, 1400 years ago, when women did not have much by way of rights, the Prophet of Islam said that a daughter should inherit one half of what the son gets. And this was great for that time, but you can't have the same law after 1400 years. What happened was in the interpretations that they gave these very basic sentences, Pakistan applied them across law. So Pakistan started off and it still has the same IPC that we do. So they know what 420 means, for example, they know what 153A means. Or 124A sedition is right there. They've tweaked some of the punishments to make them harsher, especially for blasphemy in the 80s. But so they started off with the same laws, but they thought that they should Islamize the state in some way. And one way of doing that was to try and use a precepts and use some statements from 1400 years ago and try and apply them to the modern world, which doesn't work. So they had this constitution that came out in the 50s. Almost immediately, the army took over and kept power for a decade. The army had its own constitution. The army was tough on East Pakistan, Jinnah wanted to impose Urdu on the whole, he didn't speak it himself, couldn't read it. He spoke Gujarati and he spoke it really well. I've translated that interview that I told you about. His writing is really polished and he knows the language. And I'm sure being in South Bombay, the tough that he was, that would have been the primary language even in court for many decades after a partition. If you look at lawyers like Chagla or whoever else, a lot of the heavyweights in the Indian judiciary were Parsis, Muslims, Hindus who came out of the Bombay High Court. So they tried to adapt to a modern constitution, things that they believe they should be doing out of a sense of piety. Nobody's doing this to persecute people. The fact is that when they wrote the objectives resolution, the Muslims were probably confident that they were not going to produce a state that was going to in any way discriminate. But that is what it did. And they were never happy with it. The problem is with a utopian state or a constitution that aims to take you to a state that is in some way a utopia. It never works. So Pakistan had to go through one constitution in the 50s, another one in the 60s. The country broke. I was talking about Jinnah wanting to impose this language on the Bangladeshis, which they didn't want. And there were more of them, in fact, there were more of them. And if things remain the way they are, for the first time in the history of the subcontinent, in two or three years, the Bangladesh per capita income will outstrip that of Pakistan, which is remarkable for a country that was thought to be a basket case only 40 years ago. So Bangladesh secedes with help from India and the country breaks up. And there's a third constitution, 1973, written by the PPP under Bhutto. And that's the one that's remained in some form today. But over time, the discrimination has been written in. So you've got, for example, no president or prime minister can be a non-Muslim. You've got the law on a property, Zia ul Haq comes and extends that to rape. So a woman's testimony is seen to be worth only half a man's. And if a man is accused of rape by a woman, she must produce two male witnesses to the act of rape. And if she cannot do that, she's accused of fornication and jailed. And this is what actually happened. No party was able to escape it once it came on to the books. Once you had a written constitution that demanded that the faith be in some way imposed so that people could benefit from the blessings of living in a faithful country. It didn't stop. The PPP was a liberal socialist parties. They are the ones that changed the constitution in 1974. The Bhutto apostatized this community called the Ahmadis. And even today, Pakistani passport holders must, in writing, disown membership of that community. Why? There was a riot in the 50s. This is a community that comes out of Punjab. There are many of them here in India as well. So we think of Islam in India as being sort of very monotheistic, but it's not really that. There's lots of saints, just like St. Paul came and converted the polytheistic Romans into Christians by giving them saints, you know, you could go and worship whoever you wanted to, but you would now call them a saint and they would be a sort of intercessor between you and God. Islam's done the same thing. More people pray at shrines in Lahore or in Ajmer than have ever gone to Mecca. And that's the way it is. That is the subcontinent's faith. It's very powerfully colored with mysticism and the power of dead people. So one of these sects in Punjab, one of these men has visions and Islam has been quite firm in its belief that Muhammad is the last of the line of prophets that starts with Adam, that he's the first and he's the last. And anyone having visions then becomes a sort of threat. And therefore, there was some problem with the, it's a fairly recent community, it's not that old, late 19th century, I think. There were some riots in Pakistani Punjab in the 50s on the same issue. And then rather than surrender the street to mobs that wanted violence on this, Bhutto just sort of did the easy thing and rewrote the law. That's happened in a lot of places with the blasphemy law. So as I said, Pakistan's got exactly the same set of laws that we have written by Macaulay in the 1860s. And blasphemy was punishable by up to three years in jail. Almost nobody blasphemed. There were only eight cases of blasphemy registered before 1980 in India and Pakistan combined for a law that's like more than a hundred years old. So it's not that kind of place. I think the veneration of faith is very high in our part. So it's very unlikely that you'll find somebody deliberately blaspheming. And the judiciary was quite tolerant. So when you had somebody like Naikar in the South breaking idols of Ganesha in public, it was seen as something that he had the right to do. We can't do it anymore, obviously, in this country. But in Pakistan, what happened was they changed it to death, immediately the number of cases of blasphemy, especially against non-Muslims shot up to over a thousand. It was a tool to be used against people you didn't like for whatever reason, it could be reasons of faith, it could be reasons of property, which it often was. But it gave the law, the anger of society. And I think that that's what usually happens when you have a majoritarian state in South Asia, that there is an undercurrent, and it becomes more powerful. And it expresses itself through violence, when you turn it into law."

This might have been a debate when he was writing the book in the 20s, certainly it's not now. But he felt that the Hindu faith ought to own the word and the etymology of the word from Sindhu and so on. So we don't have any particular references to Hindutva till he writes his book in the 20s. He's a young man at that point, he's in jail and this is still pre-1947 India. So his concern is not what the relationship of the state is with Hindutva. That is not his concern. I think his primary objective is to his definition and he's trying to construct a nation which is whole, which is intact and which is pure. And he finds that idea in the word Hindu, which to him means two things. It means the land in which the Hindus live, beginning at the Indus and moving east. And secondly, what he calls the faiths that are of this land. So he includes Jainism, he includes Sikhism, includes Buddhism. He excludes Islam, excludes Christianity, but includes atheists who are Hindu. So maybe he hasn't thought it through fully, but there are some contradictions there that remain. But his idea was to develop a theory of nationhood. This is a period when Europe's going through a lot of that sort of thinking itself. And he arrives at this construct, which he calls Hindutva."

The Hindus are not merely the citizens of the Indian state because they are united not only by the bonds of love they bear to a common motherland, but also by the bonds of a common blood. They are not only a nation, but also a race slash jati. The word jati derived from the root jain to produce means a brotherhood, a race determined by a common origin, possessing a common blood. All Hindus claim to have in their veins the blood of the mighty race incorporated with and descended from the Vedic fathers, the Sindhu, stop quote.

I think this is something that that carries through into Hindu thinkers, there is no interest at all in what Hindu high culture is or what it should be. They don't care whether it exists at all. They don't write about it in any sense."

If you've properly studied Hindustani music, to be a bigot, I'll give you an example. A lot of the compositions I used to have, I used to learn how to sing kirana gharana and about 90% of the compositions that that are sung by that gharana are the work of a man called Sadarang, who composed in the time of Mohammed Shah Rangeela. Even if you've got something like Raag Shankara, and it's an ode to Shiva, it's written by that man and he puts his name in it. So and if you hear Bhimsen Joshi sing it, there's a lovely version of his shown on Doordarshan that's there on YouTube, where he's singing a Shankara and the name of the author, Niyamat Khan Sadarang, that's his name is there in that song. All his songs, he would put his name in, you know, it's tough after that to be able to be very rigid in the way that one looks at either one's own faith or somebody else's. But as I said, you would find very little interest in any form of high culture of the Hindu, what we would look at as being Indian or Hindu high culture within the people who tend to push Hindutva, whether it's food, music, anything dance, it's not there. And what is Savarkar's approach to caste? One thing that becomes clear when one reads these people is all of them are Brahmin. So the three names that you took are all Brahmin. I'm not saying that there are no non-Brahmin who have contributed to this, I'm sure there are. But the corpus is primarily Brahmin. And so, if you look at the RSS and the people who headed it, except for one man who is a Thakur, who was away for a very brief period, a Sarsangachalak, all of them are a Brahmin and most of them are Marathi Brahmins. So you have that narrowness built into the thinking, which has continued and it is entirely absent of what we would look at as being multicultural Indian today, which we take for granted, you know, you would have a figure like Shah Rukh Khan or whatever, and it's not really strange. But it was strange, I think, to them, in the 20s, when they were thinking this up, the levels of sort of intercourse between them and the other was very low. And there are mistakes, factual errors that they make in the book, including Savarkar, because he doesn't really know what he's talking about when he's writing about Islam."

And we can talk about Golwalkar and why he thought it was a great thing. But Savarkar believes that caste is beneficial. And he's, I think, to my mind, the first person to theorize this. He says that he has a problem with Buddhism. And he says that India became vulnerable because Buddhism took away caste from the subcontinent. And Afghanistan becomes Muslim, because it remains Buddhist. But India, because it reverts to Hinduism and caste, is able to save itself from being fully Muslim. So he thinks that caste has a positive contribution to make here. He and Golwalkar both thought that restricting the gene pool was a good thing. And that Brahmins had something special, which they could continue having, if they bred amongst themselves. And they could pass on if they were to sort of impregnate the non-Brahmin, that's what that long line always says. Savarkar also thought that, I don't know if he thought this, but he certainly wrote it, that caste was not fully endogamous or rigid, that it was permissible in times before ours for people to marry up or down. And he has these Sanskritic words that he uses, Anulom and so on."

I think these are views that the middle class today would hold. And I think they come to us in the middle class through these two men in the main. Golwalkar had a very outrageous view on this. And it's really surprising to me that though he's referred to as being the Guruji of the Sangh and so on, these things haven't been made as prominent as they should have been. Golwalkar says that caste is good because in the ideal caste based society, access to money is completely separated from access to power.

And the story is that Golgalkar, who was fairly young, had translated a work into English. He was reasonably bilingual. I have no record or I have no access to his language in some, but it seems like he knew a fair bit of English. And he translates this work, which is titled We or Our Nationhood defined. And that brings him into prominence for some reason, I don't know what it is. And on dying, to the surprise of many, he is made the head of the RSS on the dying of the first head. He dies in 1940, and he goes through partition. He's a fairly young man then, he's not particularly old, he's just in his late 30s. And he dies in 73. So he's headed the RSS from a period, which was before independence, through the violence of partition, the constitution, through the wars with China and with Pakistan. And of course, the partition of Pakistan later in 71, 72, and then he dies the year after that. So he's seen a fair bit. He's also the man who actually makes it a national organization, he's able to reduce the idea of the shakha down to a simple form, very basic activity, raising the flag, wearing shorts if you have the shorts, coming and doing your prayers and playing kabaddi, playing games with sticks, and you go back after that, there's nothing else, there's no sort of intellectual content. But he's figured out that this is an easy thing to replicate. And it's true. It's the largest non-governmental organization in the world. It's the most powerful non-governmental organization, or at least one of them in the democratic world. I've heard that people ascribe to things like AIPAC or the NRA in the US, the RSS is much more powerful than any of those groups. I think that's his doing. He takes the idea of the individual Marathi Brahmin, who is willing to take up this work in parts of the country whose language he doesn't speak, Gujarat, sets up shop there in one room, doesn't marry, gives himself up to this work. What is this work? Conducting the shakha in the morning, and then for the rest of the day doing work, whatever it is that they wish to do. But making a life out of this, very few people can do this, they still do it. You have people from the RSS that run single teacher schools across the Adivasi belt, but they're bringing people out of what they think as being a manimism and into a more puranic faith. So he formulates this sort of easily replicable model, and he does it. So very soon you've got hundreds of these shakhas opening all over the country. Ten years after he takes over the RSS, we have a constitution. Two years after that, we have the first election, and the Jana Sangh is formed. So then he supplies material to the party in terms of cadre, in terms of people who can stand, Vajpayee is one, Madhwani is another, who come out of that, Shekhawat is a third. And he's there behind all of this, running the shakhas, making sure that the organization is continuously built and built to the end that he thought it was right. I think the shakha should be seen in a particular light. Why do they do exercises that require training with lathis, who are they training to fight against? Are they going to fight the Chinese at the border? No, that's not. They're going to fight other Indians. That's what the shakha does. In a riot, the shakha is the locus of the violence. It's the one place where the neighborhood young men who've trained in the physical stuff who know one another and can bond and can trust one another, can take a collective action that the individual so called cowardly Hindu doesn't. And he does a very good job of it. The RSS can overwhelm the security apparatus of the average Indian city very easily, as"

They will talk very lightly of Greek thought or so Upadhyay says that there are that modern Western systems. And he says that the three main ones are nationalism, democracy, and socialism are in some way not whole and people in the West feel insecure because of this lack of sort of wholesomeness. And he says, the reason is that they are not able to satisfy the four aspects of human being. And he says that these four aspects are body, mind, intellect, and soul, how mind is different from the intellect. He doesn't explain and what soul is. He doesn't say Golwalkar talks about the fact that, okay, we are quite bad at science, fine. But Hindus are masters of the science of spirit. What does that mean? What does spirit mean? Does he mean it in the sense of sort of he and both, Upadhyay, do they both mean it in the sense of the transmigration of souls and things like that? You don't know because they don't really expand. They just assume that the reader will nod his head and say, oh, yeah, you know, there are four parts to the human being, body, mind, intellect, and soul. And that Hindus are the masters of the science of spirit. And what is the justification that Golwalkar gives for this? He says that, well, Jesus only saw Satan. And you know, Mohammed only met Gabriel. It is the Hindu saints that actually saw God and witnessed God and knew about his attributes. But from there to have a like, like an objective discussion is not easy, because you're talking to somebody who believes in that sort of thing. So it's quite vacuous in many ways.

Fairly recently, as a Gujarati, I'd say that my own sense of bigotry and prejudice comes out of a popular history of four volumes written by K M Munshi on Somnath. And even though you might not know much about histories, particularly in the sense of dates and such things, you will have had a sense of Somnath in Gujarat, purely through these four fairly recent novels. And I think that a lot of it might be that, that it's a, the fact that it's a fairly recently educated nation, at the turn of the 20th century, 4% of India was illiterate. I mean, it's quite remarkable to think of that, it's not that long ago, just 119 years. And secondly, that you're living cheek by jowl with a very large community, which doesn't share what you think are the pillars of your own faith, you know, vegetarianism or whatever else. So yeah, it's, but I don't know for sure. I haven't thought about that. This is the first time that I'm actually confronted, why do they feel this? I really don't know."

So part of the reason that these histories persist, or these grievances persist, must be not only because they're being brainwashed into it, but because they need these to validate something else. Maybe there's an innate bigotry and they need to build this backstory to validate that. Is that possible?"

So for us, when we are taught in school, Jinnah is the villain. And if you're sort of Hindutva minded, then the Congress got conned, or they were part of the game itself. But the idea that there was a legitimate claim to a share in power is not seen sympathetically. Today you could give data to the average Indian middle class person and say that the last person from Gujarat, who is Muslim, who was elected to the Lok Sabha came in 1985. And this is a community that has produced Premji, that has produced Khura Kiwala, that has produced Jinnah, Ahmed Patel, last one in 85, not a single person from UP today has no Muslim in the Lok Sabha. The BJP of the 1100 or 1200 legislators they have nationally have four Muslims. Does this make people uncomfortable? I would say no, they're okay with it. But in such a society, it's easy to see why you can demonize a community and feel no sympathy for it and have no empathy for the fact that you've marginalized them totally from power and any demand that they might make to share power would be seen in negative terms, you know, that you're trying to break up my country or like whatever else. So I don't know what the wellspring is, where it comes from for people in the 20s. But certainly, after 47 partition would be one great trigger for this hatred."

And at least when it comes to the BJP, there is some kind of however badly formulated this, there are some core philosophical beliefs, but where that seems to come under challenge is when you look at how they won 2014, for example, someone I had on my show a few months ago was Prashanth Jha, who wrote the book about how the BJP won. And he points out about how Amit Shah went along building those sort of caste coalitions. And so very early on in UP, for example, they figured out, okay, we are not getting the Muslim vote. Obviously, they will nominate someone there. But then among the OBCs, they know that there are resentments among the non-Yadav OBCs. So they bring them in among the non-Jatav Dalits against Mayawati. So they try to bring them into the fold and he tries to bring a coalition like that. And at a certain point, Jha in his book quotes a Dalit scholar as saying that BJP in some places is actually the Dalit party, because they're not only getting Dalit office bearers, but they're building Dalit temples, and so on and actually investing in the community. And my question here is not of how genuine that is, or whatever is obviously driven by political imperatives. But then with the BJP, there is, again, and I'm just thinking aloud, that there is then that dissonance between what seems to be a guiding philosophy, which is not an inclusive guiding philosophy, on one hand, and on the other hand, the imperatives of winning elections, which typically would make parties sociopathic in the sense that they don't really then have any core beliefs, they just do whatever it takes to win votes."

So the person who coined the word Pakistan was in London, Allama Iqbal, who thought of this kind of utopia in Northwest India, where people would reformulate Islam and make it modern was not a traditionalist at all. So you would think of them as being extreme. They were very, very advanced in the way that they were thinking. That's not the Hindutva project. The Hindutva project is most comfortable looking back rather than looking in front, that the stronger emotions are about the defeats of the past and so on. So I don't know whether it was a model. I do know that he wanted Sanskrit in some sense to be elevated, but he also felt that till such time as everybody learned it, it was okay to use Hindi. And of course, it ran into trouble because of the revolution in the South and the rebellion, I should say, and then he would have, you know, withdrawn that the vehemence. But for most of the 60s and 70s, the RSS had very little power. The Janasang, the previous version of the BJP had about two and a half percent of the vote in Gujarat for most of the 70s. Till Babri happens, they are a very marginal power. So even though they might have felt it strongly, and even if they might have externalized things like we should make Sanskrit the language of the country, they had very little power or means to be able to either amplify their view or certainly to be able to impose it."

But I believe that Hindutva would have found its sureness of foot elsewhere if it had not been for Babri. Babri was very important, it gave them a momentum as a political party, which they would never have been able to find, you know, otherwise. But we should also remember that the momentum and the expansion of the party happens primarily also through civic violence, when the BJP participates in some way in the murder of the Muslims of this country, it is able to expand itself. In the recent phase, the full blown, you know, riot has been replaced with a series of sort of episodes, lynchings or, you know, things like what happened in UP. But it is not just the symbolic aspect of the movement, I think the campaign is also built on mobilizing people, validating the violence that they perpetrate, and they have no shame in being able to accept that fact."

And it turns and this, this son is a flawless, he's not done a thing wrong in his life. He's only 14. And the court tries to figure out why he's died. And the high priests say that it's because of an evil in the world. And what is this evil? It is that a Shudra is performing penance by trying to, can't be the word read because he can't read. But he's speaking out words from the Veda, which he's not supposed to. Ram goes and beheads him. This is the name of the Shudra is Shambhuka. This is in the Valmikannamayana. That's what the faith, the basis of the faith is cast. You might say, no, it is an innovation. It's not the case. But if you open your eyes and look at the society, the distinction between Dalit and Brahmin is quite clear. The access is quite clear. The history of India, the modern history of India in terms of access to temples is not that old. What is it that we use from that faith to be able to make India a proper Hindu Rashtra? We can discriminate against minorities. That's what most of these states in South Asia have sort of ended up doing. But what part of the faith can we actually implement to make it a Hindu Rashtra for Hindus? You can have a Hindu Rashtra for Muslims, you know, you can't, you can't stand for PM. Pakistan discriminated through law. We've done it through a practice. It's impossible to conceive of a Muslim becoming the PM of this country. Maybe in a coalition, but even that would be difficult. What part of the Hindu faith can we reduce and say that this is something that is applicable to modernity that's missing right now that will make us more pious? I think that fundamentally that is the question. For the Pakistanis, it became things like Riba. So Jesus says that he chucks the money changers, they're called out of the temple and usury becomes a bad word in the Semitic faiths. So for centuries, the Jews have a monopoly in Europe on access to capital, they are the only ones who can charge you no interest. Though Islam is much closer to Judaism than it is to Christianity, and it brings back indeed into the Semitic faiths, the ideas of circumcision and you know, pork and things like that. From Christianity, they take the idea that usury is a sin. The problem is that there's no modern banking system in the seventh century. But all three of Pakistan's constitutions have has the same writing that the state shall try to eliminate Riba. What happens is that the Supreme Court in 1999 and in 2000 abolished interest. You pass an order saying interest henceforth is abolished. But the modern economy will collapse, there is no replacement. What is the justification that if we do this, we'll get the blessings from God because we're doing this pious thing. That's not how modern states work. Pakistan, there are five pillars of Islam, Shahada, Som, Salah, Zakat, Hajj. So let's take fasting. In Dubai, like in many of the Gulf states in Ramzan, they shut, you know, restaurants have to be shut in the period of Ramzan, you know, till dusk, and that maybe makes the state a little more pious. You can actually implement that. You're trying to enforce your faith onto law. That's one way of doing it. You can do that with, Pakistan tried to do that with Zakat. So that is alms or a tax. So under Zia, what they say is, okay, on the first of Ramzan, we will deduct two and a half percent from all the bank deposits that are there, except for non-Sunnis. So because the Shia have their own clergy and they give their own money to them and so on. What started happening was Sunnis started declaring themselves Shia, not have the money deducted from their accounts, and then they had to water down that law."

I can completely understand the fact that when we say Hindu Rashtra, we'll say we'll kick the Muslims out. They can go to Pakistan. They can't eat beef. They have to give us their mosque. They have to give us their constitutional autonomy in Kashmir. They have to surrender their personal law. All that is fine. What does Hindu Rashtra offer Hindus? I think that is the problem. The question is that it doesn't have anything inside the faith that can be imposed. And that's a good thing in the way that Islam was able to impose, say, prayer or fasting or, you know, the abolition of interest. That's what makes it impossible. But that also brings the focus entirely onto minorities and discrimination. The only way that Hindutva can express itself is in negative terms. It cannot express itself in positive terms.
