And while we were driving off, my friend asked, so how's the weather in Mumbai? And I said, great, no problem at all. And then I realized that my instinctive response came from the fact that I was sitting in an AC car, and I work in an AC room all day. Of course, the weather is good where I am. But what is it like outside? Of course, there are simple indicators that can tell us the state of the weather, the temperature, humidity level, and so on. But if someone asks you, how is the economy doing? That's a slightly harder question."

This episode tries to take a snapshot of what the economy looks like today, four years after the Narendra Modi government came to power. Now figuring out economic performance is always complicated. It's a whole separate discussion on whether GDP has any value as a measure, especially in a country with such a large informal economy. But let's leave that for another day. Even if you do have what you consider reliable numbers, you don't have counterfactuals. The numbers could be XYZ. But what if oil prices hadn't stayed low, or the monsoons hadn't been good all this time, or demonetization had not happened, or if Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump became US president, a million little factors affect the economy, and it can all get a bit too much. Anyway, to try and make sense of where we are today, four years after 2014, one year before 2019, I have with me my good friend and a frequent guest on the show, Vivek Kaul."

Vivek, rather than, you know, start talking about the economy in very broad sort of macro terms and in generalizations and so on, I thought we can start by talking about some specific subjects that you've written recent columns on, and use those as a lens to then examine the broader changes that are sort of going through the country. One of your interesting pieces recently was on Air India. Now, you know, it's always been an agenda of the reformers that we need to sell Air India for obvious reasons, the losses have now become staggering and we the taxpayer pays for it. And last year, the government, in fact, did announce that they are going to privatize Air India, though many suspected they didn't mean to, it was a sop for some of the reform minded supporters. Where do things stand now?"

Now, what is on offer currently is essentially 76% of Air India and 100% of Air India Express, which is the low cost arm of Air India. Along with that, any airline buying, you know, Air India has to take on two thirds of the debt of Air India. Now, these two thirds of the debt is not a small amount, it amounts to around 32,300 crores. Out of a total of 48,000 crores, which if you translate into dollars is close to $5 billion. So it is for any Indian airline, it will be like a death knell. So obviously, they are not interested in buying the airline, I mean, Indigo, SpiceJet and Jet Airways have all made that clear. The other thing is, the airline which buys Air India needs to ensure that they do not fire any employees of Air India for one year. After that, they can offer, you know, voluntary retirement schemes, which is another huge thing because, you know, when an airline starts operating, you know, they may want to do something, they may not want to do something. So you have to leave them to, you know, let them operate Air India in the best way that they think is possible. The third interesting thing is that, you know, the trade unions can create a lot of mayhem, which they already are. So all these factors make it, you know, very, very difficult for anybody to be interested in Air India. The other factor, which is also there is that government retains 24% ownership along with two seats on the board of the future Air India."

Now, the logic for that is very, very straightforward, you know, nobody wants to get accused of selling Air India cheap, you know, back in 1999, 2000, when the Vajpayee government sold, you know, a few companies like Modern Bread and the Centaur Hotel in Juhu, they got accused of selling those companies really cheap. So nobody wants to get accused of doing that. So you know, the government wants to retain some stakes so that if and when Air India does revive, then they can sell that remaining 24% stake and, you know, get some amount of money. Now, the problem is all that is in the future, you know, before that somebody should be interested in buying the airline and under the current terms and conditions, which include debt, the employees of Air India, and the government continuing to own, you know, nearly one fourth of the airline, it seems very difficult as to anyone would buy Air India. The sad part is that, you know, every year that Air India operates leads to a larger loss. So, you know, if you if you look at the numbers, I think between 2010, 11, which is April 2010, and December 2017, the airline has lost close to 46 47,000 crore rupees. Now, where is that money coming from? So every year, the government sort of invests some amount of capital into the airline. And I think from April 2011, till date, they have invested close to 26,000 crores, which is obviously not enough to keep the airline going. So over and above that the airline borrows money. So they're working capital loans right now are close to 31,000 crores. Okay. Now they're working capital loan of the airline is more than the revenue that the airline makes in a particular year, I mean, which tells you that there is no business model.

But the point is, you know, in fact, the interesting bit recently was that Mohan Bhagwat, you know, the man who is in charge of the boss man of RSS, if I may put it so, recently said that Air India should be sold to an Indian airline. I mean, I'm paraphrasing here. The interesting thing is, what that tells us is he's at least fine with the idea of the government selling the airline, which wasn't the case in the past, because, you know, anything that the BJP does, they need the, you know, clearance from the RSS. So he's, you know, he's probably ready to meet the government halfway there. But the problem is, the terms that have been set, I mean, no Indian airline in their right mind would be able to, you know, buy Air India right now, and I mean, they're not big enough. So the solution to this is, and if, you know, the government, I mean, I've read some media reports which have said that the government is looking into it, and if they are serious about it, the only way to sell Air India is to sort of divide it and sell it. So what do I mean by that? So look at an airline like Indigo, now they are clearly not interested in the domestic business of Air India, because they already have 40% of the Indian market, domestic market. What would they be interested in? They would be interested in the international market. What part of the international market would they be interested in? Probably the Gulf, the Middle East market, because Air India Express has a reasonably good presence in that market. And Indigo being a low cost airline, I mean, so you know, you would have that sort of synergy, you know, which the merger experts talk about all the time. So that part is very, very clear. Even an airline like Jet, which is not doing too well internationally, would be interested in the international business of Air India. Look at Tata's. Now Tata's essentially have stakes in two airlines operating domestic market in India, that is Air Asia, and there is Vistara. If you add the amount of the market that they have is around 8%. So they would clearly be interested in the domestic business of Air India. But would they be interested in the domestic business of Air India along with the employees of Air India? I'm really not so sure."

So against, you at least have an asset against those loans. So at some level, that makes sense. I mean, you probably bring down, you know, the two third part to one third, and the employees, I mean, you cannot negotiate on their behalf, you have to let the new owner decide, you know, what they want to do, because ultimately, Air India has around, I think 18, 19,000 employees.

And my theory is that, you know, as the economy expands, the currency in circulation also goes up. Okay. Now, if you look at the numbers, and if you look at numbers between 2012, 2014, and 2014 and 2016, the economy in both the cases grew by more than 20%. And here we are not adjusting for inflation. So this is what we call nominal GDP growth. At the same time, the currency in circulation also grew by more than 20%. Okay. I mean, it's not a one to one, more or less, more or less, there abouts. Now come down to the two years between 2016 and 2018. The economy again grew by around 21%. But the currency in circulation grew by only 10%. Okay. So obviously, there was a certain shortage, which was already there. Okay. Now, typically, if you look at the post demonetization, pre demonetization, and the post demonetization, you know, cash to currency to GDP ratios, there is a substantial difference. Now pre demonetization, the ratio was around 12%. As of March 31, 2017, it came down to 8.8%. And as of March 31, 2018, it had recovered to around 10.9%. So we are still that one, 1.1% short. Now, since around November, December, since October, the economy has started reviving. You know, when the economy starts to revive, obviously, the cash demand goes up. And that cash is not available in the market. What also happened was that, you know, around three to four months back, all these rumors around the FRDI bill and the government seizing money in banks started to go around. So people started hoarding cash, people started hoarding cash. And this is I mean, again, all this is anecdotal. And I mean, there's some data as well. In fact, if you look at so you know, if you compare the cash withdrawn from ATMs using debit cards during the second half of the year, vis-a-vis the first half of the year, so you know, the second half of 2017-18, the growth was 12.2%. And if you look at the data for the last six years, this has been the highest growth. Now, typically, people do withdraw more money during the second half of the year because we have festivals and at the same time the the agriculture, you know, the procurement season is also, you know, runs parallelly. But this increase was more than, you know, justifiable. So at some level, my theory is that people obviously, you know, got spooked out with all these FRDI rumors going around and started to hoard cash. You know, what happens is, you know, it is easy to hoard cash using the 2000 rupee note. And as the 2000 rupee note disappears from the market, you need four 500 rupee notes to replace it. So the currency has not been expanding at the same speed as the demand is, okay. So if you put all these factors together, you know, ultimately, the reason there was a cash shortage was because of demonetization. If demonetization had not happened, and the cash or the currency had, you know, continued to grow at the same pace as it had in the past, this would have never happened."

So if you don't refund money, obviously, or, you know, direct tax to GDP ratio goes up.

Also the larger point is that, you know, there has people say that there has been a growth in the number of taxpayers, which isn't exactly true.

So, you know, they would have collected, you know, more securities transaction tax, more short term capital gains tax. So which is if you look at the data for between 2005 and 2008, there was a spike in the direct tax to GDP ratio, and then it fell again. And why was there a spike?

And recently, the government answered in Parliament, they said that they've scrapped, you know, the surveys, which sort of, you know, on which those reports were based. In fact, they also said that a sixth survey was carried out, but that report has, it hasn't seen the light of day. So, I don't know, probably the Niti Aayog is developing some sort of a measure. So we'll have to wait for that. But having said that, there is enough anecdotal evidence, which tells you that an anecdotal data based, it's not like, you know, me talking to five guys. So that tells you that there are not enough formal jobs going around. So recently, I mean, if you've been following the newspapers, or you would know that the Indian Railways had advertised for 90,000 vacancies, against which it got 2.8 crore applications. So I did some rough calculations, and I came to the conclusion that nearly one fourth of India's youth workforce, which is looking for a job, I mean, not everyone is, which is looking for a job, basically applied for these railway jobs. And this is without getting the education factor, you know, in as a cut off, you know, if you get in the education factor, also, the one fifth portion will go up even more. So even, you know, so, and this is not really outlier data, we've been hearing these kinds of numbers for years. So you can, so basically, 20% of India's youth workforce looking for a job applies for 90,000 vacancies in Indian Railways. I mean, if this is not disturbing, I don't know what is. So the explanation people normally offer against this is, you know, everybody wants a government job in India, which is true. But that is not the complete explanation. Now you need to dig a little more to understand as to why everyone wants a government job in India. If you look at, you know, in India, we have this term called underemployment, which basically means that everyone looking for a job for all through the year is not able to find one. So if you look at the underemployment data, 60% of the Indians who are looking for a job all through the year, are able to find it, which basically means 40% of the Indians who are looking for a job all through the year are not able to find it. So the informal economy does not give you work all the time, okay. So if you are a part of the informal economy and a government job comes up somewhere, I mean, you are going to apply for it. That's the first part. The second part is that if you look at the kind of money that gets paid, you know, if you look at self-employed professionals, two thirds of self-employed professionals and contract workers make up to Rs 90,000 a year, which is basically Rs 7,500 a month, okay. Even the most basic government job pays around Rs 20,000 a month, okay, at the lowest level. So it is obvious people, even people who have jobs, these so-called informal jobs will apply"

And all these rents become an additional burden upon the business and make it harder for it to operate and at the margins, turn profitable businesses into unprofitable businesses, and make it more profitable, in fact, for an enterprising individual to be the government servant who is actually getting rent, rather than try to be an entrepreneur fighting against this wave. I had an episode on the scene unseen many, a few months ago with my very good friend Madhu Menon, which was on restaurant regulations, you know, he used to run a restaurant and he sort of enlightened me on what it used to involve, and he no longer runs a restaurant and I'm really happy for him.

In the public eye, certainly. It's coming to the public eye now, after Nirav Modi sort of defaulted on the loans and went away. So, let's talk in terms of that. And you know, I mean, it's not like, you know, so the first thing people, when you start talking about bad loans, first thing people sort of jump up and say, but, you know, Modi did not cause these bad loans, fair enough, he did not. But then, you know, he did become the Prime Minister and as the Prime Minister, it was his responsibility to solve it. I mean, it might have been created, or it was created by the previous regime, but that does not mean anything anymore now. Now, if you look at the bad loans, they have been rising and as of 31st December, they touched a total of 9 lakh crore, which is a huge number, 9 lakh crore on a whole, public sector banks, the bad loans are around 7 lakh 77,000 78,000 crores. Now, what has been done to sort of solve this problem? I mean, nothing really, I mean, the government continues to pump money into these banks. You have the bankruptcy code, which has been implemented, there are too many teething troubles, you know, that it's going through. But at a more, you know, broadly at, I mean, very, very practical level, you know, as we've also we've talked about in the past, you know, should the government be running 21 public sector banks?

I mean, nobody's really thinking through that. All that has happened is that the government has continued to throw money at the problem. Now, throwing money at the problem, our money at the problem, is not going to solve it in any way. Now, one of the things that I've sort of talked about, you know, in the recent past is that most of these smaller public sector banks, I mean, other than, let's say, the top five or the top six, should not be allowed to carry out corporate lending, because which is where the problem is. I mean, 80% of the bad loans of public sector banks are because of lending to corporates. So they should be, you know, what the jargon for this is narrow banking, I mean, they should be limited to doing retail loans and stuff like that. Now, there has been no such thinking, which is, you know, come out from the government. So you know, you, you have a problem, and you continue to throw money at it, and the money that you can throw at it is not enough to, you know, solve the problem, I mean, more money is needed. Now, where is that money going to come from? I mean, nobody's talking about these things. I mean, we've just done some, you know, basic patchwork, and we seem to be happy with it. And you know, there are so many repercussions of this, which people don't understand. I mean, you know, when you pump money into public sector banks, you don't have money for, you know, a lot of other things. So you know, recently, the, I think, the number two man in the army, the vice chief of army, a gentleman called Lieutenant General Sarath Chand, told the parliamentary panel that 68% of the army's equipment is in the vintage category. And I'll quote him here, funds allocated are insufficient and the army is finding it difficult to even stock arms, ammunition, spares for a 10 day intensive war. All three services are expected to be prepared for at least 10 days of intensive battle. I mean, I mean, this is a major problem."

I mean, this, I guess, I mean, I looked at some numbers for last year. I think that in 2016-17, not 17-18, the Ministry of Skilling trained some 9 lakh people, and the target was close to 2 crore.
