All the currents of history led up to it. And sometimes the future may even have been shaped by that event. If there was a story to our existence, that event could seem to be a critical plot point. But then we may look closer and realize that it almost didn't happen, that a series of lucky accidents took us to that point. And indeed, everything could be said to be the culmination of a series of accidents. You change one variable somewhere and different things happen. History changes, humanity changes. If you go back far enough, maybe there's no humanity at all. Today's episode is about one such event, a film that seemed to be the natural progression to all that came before and which shaped all that came after. But"

        "message": "Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Uday Bhatia, author of a wonderful new book called Bullets Over Bombay, Satya and the Hindi Film Gangster. Uday has been a film critic for many years, first at Time Out, then at Mint and also on his own blog. He brings a perspective to his criticism which is shaped as much by world cinema as a love and appreciation of his own culture. Bullets Over Bombay talks about the importance of Ram Gopal Verma's 1998 film, Satya. In his narrative, Uday traces two parallel traditions in Hindi cinema. One is the tradition of the gangster film, another is that of the city man. For Bombay, as it was then, is as much a hero of Satya as Manoj Bajpai or Chakravarti. And it's fascinating to see how these traditions evolve and come together in this one landmark film. Satya is also important because it brought together a bunch of young, talented people who went on to become stalwarts of the industry over the next two decades. People like Manoj Bajpai and Anurag Kashyap and no end of names from the brilliant ensemble cast. At the same time, Satya was shaped by circumstances and could even be called a product of a series of happy accidents. It's such a great example of how history can be shaped by serendipity. I loved this conversation with Uday in which we also discussed his evolution as a film critic. In some ways, this episode is a natural follow-up to the episode I recorded a few weeks ago with my good friend Jai Arjun Singh. I'll link that from the show notes. Before we get to this conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break. Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long-form articles and essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com which aims to help people up-level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long-form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. So, if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have a great program called FutureStack which helps you stay up-to-date with ideas, skills and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future. FutureStack batches start every Saturday. Also, check out their Social Capital Compound which helps you master social media.

So, I just watch as much as your regular moviegoer or maybe even less than your average moviegoer. And I think this continued through my childhood. If there was a big, big film, we'd go and see it in the theatre. Otherwise, it was mostly just on TV or we'd get a videocassette. And when I went to college in Delhi, that's when things started to pick up a little bit, though even then I wasn't into film as much. I was much more into music and music writing than I was into film then. But I started to get a little more interested. I remember there was this film by Govind Nihalani called Dev with Amitabh Bachchan. And I remember coming back in a very agitated state after I saw it. And I wrote like, whatever, some 700 words. And I think then crumpled it up after that. But that was, I think, the first time I put down my thoughts about a film. But still in college, I would say that even then anyone who knew me well, knew me as a music fan, and not particularly a film fan. Things kind of changed after that when I, two things changed. Basically, I got interested in world cinema and I started my MBA, also in Delhi. And that kind of, you wouldn't think they would be related, but they were in a weird way because we had three or four very serious cinephiles in the batch before me. And so they had all the Bergmans and Tarkovskys on a shared drive and you could just pick it up and watch them. So for the first time, I watched all these films and they sort of blew my mind and started opening up my idea of cinema. Things kind of went on from there."

        "message": "So that's kind of fascinating. And what's also fascinating to me is that, you know, growing up, and I did an episode with Jai Arjun Singh, which you mentioned that you heard, and Jai and I both kind of grew up in the 80s and then adulthood in the 90s and all of that. And it's almost a dichotomous experience taking in whatever cultural influences you've taken, whether it's cinema or music, because it's almost like they're two separate categories, like Indian music and Western music and Indian cinema and Western cinema. And it becomes after a period of time, an interesting situation to kind of resolve that because one is you can just code shift and you can enjoy Indian cinema for what it is and you can enjoy world cinema as it were for what it is. But the other is that which I think Jai has done in a very interesting way is that you don't actually see them as different things after a period of time that your love for cinema is just your love for cinema period and so on. And Jai has done that much better than me. And it strikes me that you would to some extent have had to do that with in terms of music as well, which you said, you know, you were writing about you were serious about and all of that. And you know, I went through those phases. One of the things I boast about is I'm the only person in the world to have my byline featured in both the Wall Street Journal and the Rock Street Journal. So in the 90s, I did a bunch of stories for the Rock Street Journal and all that. But I was heavily into kind of Western music. And it's only much later that I grew to sort of lose some of that snobbery and gain an appreciation for Indian music. So what was that journey for you? Because you make it sound really seamless in the sense I discovered world cinema and I was watching Bergman and Tarkovsky and all that. But at the same time, you write with such deep insight about Indian cinema, like I learned so much reading this book, you know, especially the first couple of chapters where you the chapters where you really go into the history of gangster movies in Hindi cinema, and then city films in Hindi cinema, I would read read something, go to YouTube, see if it's there, watch clips, it was like so much deep insight. Tell me a little bit about that. You know, were you closer to one kind of films than another? And was there an analogue of that in music?"

        "message": "So I actually approached films a lot in the beginning through film criticism, which was almost a byproduct of a lot of music writing, which I was consuming at that time. I read a lot of authors like Grial Marcus, Lester Bangs, David Frick, Peter Guralnick, I really, really enjoyed all their stuff in college, I gained an appreciation of how you could write about an art form through those initially. And I actually know the turning point from music criticism to film criticism, because it was in a Lester Bangs review of a Stooges album. And he talks about Pauline Kael, the great American film critic. And he mentions a review of Bonnie and Clyde, which she did a very famous review of the film, which she it was an early rave for the film. And it really sort of made it the sensation that it was at that time. And he called her style, wonderfully epigrammatic. And first of all, I had to look up epigrammatic. And once I did, I thought that's a really nice thing to say about someone's writing. And so I looked up Pauline Kael through that. And that was actually my start into film criticism. And it just sort of proceeded organically because I was getting interested in world cinema. I think at that time, you had just started getting foreign films on DVDs in India. So I, you know, I could buy a few of those you had a lot, which you could get second hand in Palika Bazaar in Delhi. And so I'd watch those and I'd print out the the Criterion collection booklets because they have the essays on their site. So I used to print them out and read them. So a lot of the film knowledge that I actually had in the early days was theoretical, I would, I'd have read about say Contempt or Band of Outsiders or something before I even seen the film. So I was coming at it almost backwards, in that sense."

        "message": "That's wonderful. And you and you speak about buying DVDs at Palika Bazaar. And it just kind of reminded me like I've just moved house. And a couple of the cartons, which the last time we moved house nine years ago, we had these, you know, a couple of cartons full of audio cassettes and a couple of cartons full of CDs and DVDs. And we were just trying to figure out what the hell do we do with them now, because this is Bombay, right, small flats and all that, relatively, and they're taking up so much space. And eventually, we kind of decided that, listen, I'm, we're just going to take pictures of the audio cassettes or whatever that, you know, just take pictures of the whole the pile for nostalgia sake, keep a couple of mixtapes we might have made back in the past for each other and just chuck the rest because there's nothing you do with that. And DVDs kind of feels like that sort of foregone era there. So you know, when you sort of start discovering world cinema like this, I mean, one of the fascinating ways of discovering it in this manner where you've read the criticism about the film before you actually see the film is that you're kind of viewing it in a different way, you're viewing it with different eyes, and so on. Does this carry over then to all the viewing that you do? Like I know that when people start writing seriously, for example, it changes the way they read, you know, they'll notice all the tools that a writer is using and the way they build rhythm, the way they use paragraphs, all of all of those things. And obviously, not that you were intending to be a filmmaker, but just shifting your gaze and looking at films in this kind of a way. Does that number one change the way you look at all the films you've already seen, for example, that when you revisit something, you see things that you didn't do. And then when you try to apply that gaze to Indian cinema, how easy or hard is it that there aren't really too many people who have trodden that path when it comes to say, Hindi films, right? So we can talk about Grail Marcus writing about Bob Dylan, and there's a rich tradition of writing happening out there. And with Indian classical music, I'm sure there's an equally rich tradition here. But when it comes to Hindi films, or the kind of work that, you know, you and Jay have done in recent years, and the kind of book that you have written, does that begin to change? And also, when you watch Hindi cinema, having, you know, watched the best of world cinema, what is it like? Is it that you're seeing more? Or is it that you're thinking of it less? In the sense, you realize all the different ways in which it is lacking?"

        "message": "So that's an interesting question. And I think the first thing I can say is that luckily for me, in my initial years, when I was getting interested in cinema, I wasn't really looking at being a film writer. I'd done my MBA, so I was working in market research for many years. And I was just watching films in my free time. And I was watching everything then I started, of course, with world cinema, then I just went back, I already had a reasonable amount of classic Hollywood viewing. So I'd seen the Hitchcocks, and I caught up on the Fords and Billy Wilder and Howard Hawks. I had a bit of those and also 70s Hollywood, I had those 80s, 90s Hollywood, I used to watch a lot of TV. So I knew a bit of that Hindi, I had to go and relearn or rewatch a lot of stuff which people already knew, simply because we weren't much of a film watching family and the default at home were Disney animation video cassettes and, and Tom and Jerry and like a few things like Mary Poppins and Sound of Music and stuff. So there really wasn't much Sholay or Golmaal or anything lying around the house. So I'd seen some of the famous ones, but I hadn't, like I'd missed entire eras, entire very famous actors. So once I started getting interested, I tried to catch up on all of it, not in any planned way. But I just kept, I just kept watching for about four or five years without doing anything much about it. And at the same time, I started blogging. And about, I'd say, a good 60-70% of those pieces were about film. And I can't read those early pieces now, because they're just attempts to imitate all the film writers whom I liked at that time and write things which I really wasn't in much control of. But it was useful in a couple of ways. One, it got me writing regularly, which I hadn't done before. And two, it allowed me to have something to show when I applied for my first journalism job, which was to timeout, because I didn't have any journalism training. And I really, I was really raw. At that time, all I really had was this blog, and I showed it and quite luckily, I think I was hired as their film and theatre person in Delhi. There were already people in Bombay doing the reviews, so that pressure wasn't there. But I was allowed to write at least some stuff on it."

What did you see yourself doing? How formed was it? And at what point do you then decide that the corporate life is not for me? And, you know, because we've never met, and I don't know you, therefore have to ask that, did you want to be just a journalist and write about movies? Or did you see yourself as making movies at some point in time? Tell me a bit more about how your conception of yourself grew and eventually led you to do what you did?"

And I knew that maybe like, two years in, I knew that but I didn't really act on it. And I didn't think that after I quit, I would try to be a journalist because I didn't think that I could. I had no training, I had no idea how it was done. There was no one in my family who was a writer of any kind. It didn't seem like a field I could break into, but I quit cold turkey. And I just applied on a whim to a couple of places. And I think that I got pretty lucky in that sense, that something landed. My conception of myself as a film writer, I think even that took a few years after joining Time Out to sort of solidify because when you get in to something like this, you feel that, oh, there's so much I haven't seen. How will I when I when I get to do reviews of like the next Salman Khan film that's that's coming out on the weekend, how am I going to do it with only four hours to write the review. And so it took a while for me to even sort of think of myself as a proper film critic. And the learning kept on in the first couple of years of the job."

Because as you're blogging, like one thing you pointed out is that one of the good things about it, which I sort of will double down on because I feel the same effect happened to me is that when you're writing a lot, it just gets easier and more fluent and less, less self conscious and all of that. But did you also kind of begin to feel changes in your craft? Think about your craft per se? Was the act of then actually writing for a magazine like Time Out and you know, all the people you wrote for after that, did that kind of affect your writing? Tell me a bit about thinking about your writing per se during this entire period."

        "message": "So in the start, it's a bit difficult to, to have a style of your own. And you're very conscious of that also, if you're a slightly self aware writer, and you know that, I like Pauline Kael, I like David Thompson, I like Jeffrey O'Brien, then you know that, oh, I'm I'm taking this phrasing from this person, I'm taking this sort of approach from so and so. And for the first, first few years, of course, there was a lot of that first few years of the job, I would say there was enough and you kind of grow into your own style, I think, as you said, the more you write. And also, I think the more you start thinking about film, you develop more original thoughts about it, and you don't have to rely on received wisdom about it. I saw those changes come slowly for me, it took a few years and I was in retrospect, I'm quite happy that I wasn't doing weekly reviews at the start. Because I think that would be a lot of pressure. And I see a lot of young writers made to do that now. And it's a tough thing doing that, like, just when you're thrust into your first job, and then writing a review. And in a few hours, sometimes, sometimes you just have to watch it on Friday, because the worse films don't have press shows now, they just release it cold. And so you go see it on a Friday morning. And by Friday afternoon, your editors asking why isn't the review up so you literally have to go with your first impressions, and more often than not, your first draft. So that would have been a very difficult thing for me to do when I was starting out. I'm glad I didn't have to do that. I think also just in terms of reading more widely, and figuring out how people do certain things, rather than just reviewing, I think how people approach criticism as as a whole. There's a British writer named David Thompson, whom I'm a big fan of, and he has a book called Have you seen 1001 films to watch before you die, something like that. And I would recommend that to anybody who is getting into film criticism, simply because he offers so many strategies of going at a film, he just he writes about all these films, and but he never goes at it the same way there are all these different approaches, which he tries out in this one book. And that really influenced me in terms of that you may be writing reviews, but you don't have to start at the same way you can find different ways of getting into it through character or through a particular scene, or through something in the newspaper or through something that really moved you. And those things sort of started becoming more evident to me as time went on. And then I guess a certain kind of style started evolving. And I started to realize certain things that I was interested in, maybe more so than other critics, I liked going back into film history and seeing where things fit. I like trying to situate things in a certain context of their genre and and pass people who have done something similar. And that I saw, I think the first long freelance piece I did was on Chetan Anand's Nicha Nagar, which is the first and only Indian film to win the top award at the Cannes Film Festival, also the inaugural Cannes Film Festival. So that was very interesting for me because it allowed me to do some crate digging and I realized I really enjoy that. And I've done a lot of that since I've written on the very first screening that ever took place in India at Watson's Hotel in 1896. And that was, again, great fun for me because I managed to speak to people who had clippings and ads from that first screening. And it sort of allowed me to recreate what it might have been like at that time, which has always been something very interesting for me. So I think then you just start learning about your own interests, especially within criticism through the years. I realized that I was very interested in the idea of film censorship. So I've written a couple of long pieces about that. And I continue to be very interested in that because India is the place to be if you want to write about film censorship. So, yeah, I think that it was just something that my style maybe and my approach to film criticism sort of evolved over a bunch of years."

But if you're writing for Time Out, if you're writing reviews for Mint, there is a sort of a word count that is expected. And also, I would imagine that in Time Out, there would also be some functional expectation that you have to kind of tell the listener what to expect. And, you know, do they have a house style there, which you have to adhere to? How does that then work? Does that sort of shape your work?

        "message": "sir? So even when I was blogging at the start, I didn't really write these long, long essays that people were known to do in the glory days of blogging in India, I think simply because maybe I didn't have that much to say at that time. And when I joined Time Out, if you remember, Time Out really had long word counts for anything. Even the covers weren't too long and the pieces were 600-700 words at the most. And reviews were often 400 words, 500 words. And I didn't even start off with theatre reviews. So I did DVD reviews when I was starting out. So those could be 250 words. So I think that really drilled in me the virtue of being able to say as much interesting stuff in as vibrant a manner as possible in as few words. And I see its effect even today where when I write something, and this was a big, this was a big issue when I when I was writing the book initially, because I did not have that tendency to expand on a thought. My approach was always to narrow it down to get to the essence of things simply because Time Out was in print, and it had small word counts. And I knew I had to finish it in this much time. And that became sort of set for me. So even later, when I moved to places, I worked for Sunday Guardian for a short time in Delhi. And since then, I've been in Mint, where the word counts are longer it took me a little while to adjust to that. And, of course, when I was writing the book, it took me a while to adjust to that, because I was like, you can't get to the point all the time. While writing a book, you have to, you have to set a lot of scenes at some lengths and you have to talk about everything rather than rather than some just, you know, whatever might be relevant in a narrow sense. So that was something I had to kind of unlearn or maybe an extra skill that I had to learn over time. So format has played quite quite a role, I think, in my in my side."

        "message": "Yeah, fascinating. And like, I think one place where I might have noticed this tussle during the book is when you're talking about sort of the gangster film of the 1980s. And you have a footnote about Subhash Ghai. And you kind of apologize for not mentioning his films in the main text, but you put a footnote and you talk about Vidhata and that scene where, you know, Dilip Kumar is doing what he does, which immediately made me go to YouTube and kind of look it up. And that scene wasn't there by itself. So I had to look for Vidhata and then try to find the scene within that. So tell me also, you know, when one starts reviewing and I sort of say this as someone who's gone through the process myself, though I reviewed music much more than films, did much more of music and books at a certain point. You know, when you are a young writer, you are sort of keen to also in a sense, show off not just your writing skills, but also, you know, your insights, which you're kind of building into it. And there might be a tendency there to sort of go too far, to stretch too far and to look for significance where there is none or to draw connections to show your intimate knowledge and all of that. So how does one kind of get past that? Because I think, you know, one step of getting past that is you become aware that you're doing this. And the other step is that you learn to kind of put yourself out of the equation and just focus on whatever you're sort of writing. So, and I noticed that you've tackled this extremely well in the book, which of course has come when you're many years down the line in your career, where one sort of temptation could have been to constantly insert yourself in the narrative, because part of gathering all the information about Satya involves you're talking to all these different people with their different memories. And that's kind of a journey in itself. And I can imagine the temptation to sort of also put yourself there, but you appear really extremely sparingly in the book, you just kind of let the story tell itself. And I'm not even saying that that approach would necessarily have been wrong. These are just different approaches. So how do you think about this? Like, when you look back on your older pieces, or your early blog posts, or whatever, what do you think? Is this something that you've kind of consciously thought about?"

I think two or three things help. Maybe, as you said, self-awareness, you have to, at some level, ask yourself when you write things like that, do I really want to go on that limb? Am I that sure that it will be the best film that people see? If you are, then go for it, because you may as well. If you don't feel strongly about films, about certain films that you think are great, and you don't want to say that, then that again, you won't be able to last too long. You have to sort of give voice to your enthusiasms. But again, there should be that self-awareness that if I'm saying this, I need to be able to back it up, preferably in the review itself. The other thing is, you really benefit from having sympathetic editors at that stage in your career, which I had, luckily when I was coming in, not only for Time Out as a whole, but also a film editor who would ask them that, you know, do you really mean this? Was it this good? Don't call him an auteur. He's just a regular director. I was guilty of calling some. I don't remember, but it was some Indian director and I just use auteur because I was reading so many pieces which had auteur in it and I shouldn't have. And it took someone to point that out. I don't think I've ever used the word auteur since then in anything. But yeah, so that really helps. And also, it just helps reading other people after you've written something about a particular film, even if you don't think they're the greatest critics. But if you read other viewpoints on it, you can at least argue with them and say, no, they're wrong. I think the film is still great. But if they are saying something useful, I think you should be able to incorporate that in your thinking. And at least if not, totally walk back what you said, keep it in mind for the next time you're saying something similar."

I have gone from being, you know, very influenced by it to feeling that a lot of it is very suspect. And I don't know, I guess the first name that comes to mind is weirdly a filmmaker who probably isn't my favorite filmmaker, but would fit the definition of an auteur most would be Sanjay Leela Bhansali, I think. Not a favorite of yours also, I think. And it's just that you can see his mark on whatever he does. He never makes a non-Sanjay Leela Bhansali film since he started. So in that sense, he would be the true definition of an auteur. But I don't know how much that really counts for now."

You and I may not like it for different reasons, but I mean, it is what it is. Now, you mentioned sort of always being curious about the history of cinema and going back to see, okay, this was the first showing and your book is of course full of delightful history, which sort of sets so much context. How do you do this kind of research? Because beyond the point there aren't, to the best of my awareness, there isn't such rich literature available in India for Hindi cinema beyond a few standard books, which will really take you deep back. So how are you gaining all this knowledge? And if a lot of it comes from, you know, talking to old timers, talking to people, you know, dredging their memories, how does that kind of work? Take me a little bit through that and whether this was something that you used to do deliberately before you set out to write a book like this, because this book, obviously it makes it instrumental to go back into history because you have to give all this context. But apart from this, you know, what was your approach and how would you manage? Where would you find your dope?"

It's also very difficult to view the old films. So that is actually the biggest stumbling block. When I had started the book, I was hoping to see that, you know, if I could see some things from the thirties, gangster films from the thirties, because I found mentions of things that were crime films made by Parsi filmmakers and other Bombay filmmakers and they sounded really interesting. But I didn't want to write about them only in theory, if I couldn't even see a still of any of them. In the end, I started the book with Kismet, the chapter on the gangsters with Kismet, which is a 1943 film, which you can actually see. It's on YouTube and the print is decent. And so that was as far as I could confidently trace the gangster film. But if there was more access and if we had done more to archive film history, I could have possibly gone further back. I would have liked to go all the way back to the silence, which was not possible. In terms of my work, it does involve speaking to old filmmakers, academics who have that kind of knowledge. There are a couple of writers who have done great work in Indian film history. There is one named B.D. Garga, who's written the definitive account of nonfiction film in India. And he's also written about early film and a history of Indian cinema as a whole. So he is the go-to person for anything that is pre-60s in Indian cinema. Besides that, you just sort of look around, try and get lucky, get newspaper clippings. I managed to do that for my piece on the first film screening and for the censorship piece that I'd written. And for this book, I found some interesting ones. I'd asked a couple of friends in academia to look around for me and they got me a newspaper account of a crime that had been committed in the 50s. It was a bank heist. And very interestingly, that heist then turns up in Aarpaar in a slightly changed form. And Anurag Kashyap had mentioned that when I had spoken to him, he got the name of the film wrong, but he mentioned that there was this heist that had happened. And I just took that nugget and I started searching and very luckily things turned up and I could write about that with a little bit of background then."

So at one point, I was discussing biographies of Indian freedom fighters with a friend of mine. And I wanted to refer to B.R. Nanda's biography of Nehru. But instead I said B.D. Garga's biography of Nehru. Have you read that? And there was this sort of person practically sorting through their mind to figure out what happened here. What is this kind of connection? And I can imagine that person then calling their nearest antique bookshop owner and saying dhoondo, kuch bhi karo, dhoondo. So anyway, so and I'm guessing a certain part of your job after a period of time, and especially when you were writing this book where you had to get in touch with all of these people, you know, you mentioned in the book about how you had to sort of it took you a year and a half or more than that to actually be able to speak to everyone. And you'd have to speak to the secretary and somehow get an appointment and this and that, which is both surprising and not surprising to me, because it's surprising because you'd imagine that, hey, this is something they'd love to talk about, right, but also not surprising, because hey, Bollywood. So what in general, when you speak to film stars, film directors, what is that process like for you? Like, do you at some level find it, you know, like can happen to young reporters sometimes find it demeaning that you have to keep chasing people and begging for an interview and this and that. And when you do meet them, you know, is there that pressure that I have limited time with this person, and I have to convince this person. And from their part, also, there must be a certain distrust, because they simply may not get what you do as a film critic, like we saw in that recent bust up between Taapsee Pandu and I think Shubhra Gupta, who wrote that review, where, you know, she said uncomplimentary thing about Taapsee's acting and Taapsee just took off. So how does that equation kind of work out? What's what have your experiences been like?"

So the abhi toh humein aur bhi zaleel hona hai was, I started off with that mindset, I knew that it wouldn't be easy and so I just kept doing my own research, along with speaking to people and I kept adding my own thoughts on the film and on the gangster film on the city film on the 90s on whatever came after Satya, while I also tried to then keep going through it and I had to try pretty much everything. So luckily, I was in Bombay, a lot of these people are in Bombay and are active in film. So at least they had PR agents and people whom I could go through. But yeah, it wasn't particularly easy. I'll say though, that once I did get through to them, everyone spoke with great enthusiasm, except Ramu, everyone spoke with great enthusiasm about the film, about their time on it, the impact it had on their careers. So it was very fresh in their minds, even though it's been like 20, 21, 22 years since Satya for them. They saw it as some kind of formative experience, most of them because a lot of them were starting their careers. So I didn't have to convince them about the importance of the project. I think they were very happy that someone was writing on Satya. I think just the problem was getting through to them and nailing them down, getting them for sufficient amounts of time. And in the rare opportunity that I got to follow up with some of them, nailing them down for that also. It was quite a long sort of thing, though. I think I wrote one and a half years in the book to interview all of them, but that was just the ones whom I went out and met. Even after that, I was getting hold of people on Skype or on the phone. I think Chakravarti and I in particular missed so many calls of ours. I think we may have had like upward of 50 small conversations. But the quantum of what we spoke may have been less than what I spoke with Anurag in one session."

I mean, I know a bit simply through like reading films and watching them and hearing people speak about them and the little I've seen here and there, the shoots I've seen, but it's really not much. So I am completely receptive to people telling me that, oh, you know, you were coming with all these things, but actually things just sort of fell into place and all. Which was, I think, to be fair, a lot of Satya was really that. This was to a large extent a film that was made on the fly. A lot of the writing was done the day before or on the morning of the shoot or just before lines would be handed to the actors. And that was because Varma wanted it that way. He'd had an experience early on in the scene where Sushant Singh gets slashed by Satya and he screams. And that scream was where the thing was supposed to cut, but it was such a loud scream that Ramu did not cut at that point. And he just let the scene play. And because Sushant was a theatre actor, he was smart enough to be able to improvise and the people around him also improvised and the scene became a lot richer. And Ramu liked that so much that he said that I want that energy in the rest of the film. I don't want things to go according to plan. And don't worry about the lines. Throw them out. We'll write them on the spot. You can improvise if you want. And he let his actors free and his writers free. And I think that sort of informed the way the film is. I think in terms of people saying that, oh, you're a critic, you're overthinking this. I got that mostly from Ramu, who would often deflate my bigger theories about things. And at one point he said, you know, I think people went like Satya because it was the first time they heard certain cuss words in the hall. And it was the first time they saw people being realistic as gangsters and not because they thought it was a particularly new kind of film or a different way of seeing Mumbai or something. So, yeah, I think that attitude mostly came from Ramu. But the others were pretty much OK. Some of them liked the theories and they were happy to encourage them. And it seems to me that the journey"

        "message": "that it feels odd for me to call somebody Verma, but and it feels odd for me to call somebody Ramu also because I don't know the guy. But, you know, there's a thing with public figures that you feel like you own them. So like Sachin did this batting, Ramu did that. So I'll just kind of get over that and call him Ramu or call him RGV. I'll call him RGV. I think that's a good compromise. So one of the interesting arcs that you've also traced is how his own style changed. And in Satya, it kind of seemed to come from one extreme to the other, whereas early films are like super stylized and everything is shot in a particular way. And you talk about how there are influences of old Bollywood, there are influences from Hollywood through the 80s. You know, Hong Kong cinema also started showing its influences and you've traced all of those in the works of various people. But at Satya, it's like he's finally, you know, comfortable in his own skin, at peace with himself, just kind of going with the flow and that's great. And I'll sort of come to that a couple of larger questions, though, before we start talking about Satya itself. And one of them is that it seems that in the narrative of your book, which is a great narrative in which I found convincing, but it is still nevertheless one narrative. Satya is sort of a central point in Indian cinema where everything that has happened before in terms of city films and gangster films and all of that lead up to it, you know, so you have gangster films evolving in a certain way, till you reach a point where the gangster is a real person, not a caricature anymore, not over the top, with real relationships in the real world as Bhikhu Matre has with his wife. And at the same time, you have city films evolving in a way where cities are shown in a particular way and eventually, they are as close to realism as you can get without calling it a documentary style. So your first narrative is about how all of Indian cinema seems to lead to Satya. And your next narrative is that whatever happens after that emerges from Satya, that there are these incredibly talented people within the film who become big figures in what is to happen in Hindi cinema later, whether it's, you know, Anurag Kashyap doing the writing or that incredible ensemble of cast, all of whom kind of became stars, starting with the stunning Manoj Bajpai himself, and even kind of the hangers on like, you know, the Sriram Raghavans and all of those guys. So it's almost like an whole ecosystem kind of emerges out of there. And this is a narrative and Satya is so central. Now, did you earlier before you conceived of the book, and I'll ask you how you conceived of it as well, because I guess that's part of the story. But did you see Satya as central earlier? Did all of these people see Satya as that central? Was it, you know, if there was no Satya, you know, and this is like the great man theory of history. So you could say the great film theory of history, if there was no Satya, would everything still have happened more or less the same way? Or was it just this stunning, serendipitous departure which changed everything and which was sort of an at the same time, an inevitable outcrop of what had come before?"

        "message": "I actually really wanted to look at what had come before Satya. Simply because by the time I was into film and writing about it, Satya was fairly well regarded as the origin of a lot of stuff that came after it. The Hindi indie film, the birth of the new character actor, as it were. Obviously, the new gangster film went from there and other things that we can come to. But basically, that part of the story was already fairly well established. People knew that Satya was very important and that it was some kind of landmark in Indian film history. Not many people saw Satya as something that came out of a tradition. There are a couple of reasons for that. The gangster film tradition in India, as I've tried to show in the book, is not one that emerged with the force that it did in any of the other countries. It sort of came up in fits and starts. And if you kind of directly try and link Satya to some of the earlier iterations of gangster films in India, there is nothing obvious. And Verma definitely did not have any direct inspiration from that, as he told me, and I completely believe him from that. But at the same time, you do see, say, from Arj Satya onwards, films like Arj Satya, Arjun, Agnipath, obviously Parinda, Nayakan, films like these are creating a certain sort of the grammar of the Indian gangster film, which Satya can then pick up on, in the sense it doesn't have to do all the groundwork itself. So it did build on what these films had, even if it was very different from all these films. And the twin tradition, which is of the city film, was again something that, something I hadn't seen Satya situated in very much. And it sort of occurred to me early on that this might be a fruitful way to think of this, because Satya, as we know, is a film shot largely in real locations. There were not many studio sets, there wasn't any extensive lighting, there wasn't much costuming, people got their own costumes, or they just bought stuff off the streets and wore it. It's very much ingrained in the daily life of Bombay. You can't really set Satya in another city. It just wouldn't work. It's not just a gangster film, it is a Bombay street film, in the purest sense. So I wanted to try and see the other films that had shown Bombay as a real place rather than the cinematic Bombay, which is nearly all of Hindi cinema. And, but there are films in between which have shown Bombay as a real living place where actual people spend their lives and speak in a certain way and negotiate the city and interact with its administration and with its transport, and in the 90s with its underworld. And I wanted to see, you know, whether these two traditions came together before Satya and you could see signs of that also by the late 80s with films like Salim Langda Pe Matro or Salaam Bombay or Raak, which are not gangster films, but they have elements of criminality and you can see how the gangster film and the city film might merge. And Satya was the first time that this was done entirely successfully."

        "message": "Both these historical strands were so illuminating for me, and I'm going to have to do a lot of film watching over the next few weeks. My other sort of larger question really has to do with the nature of fanhood and trends, like on an unrelated note, seemingly unrelated note, you know, there is this sort of study that looks into why people form sporting allegiances, and how that process works. For example, when do fans of Premier League clubs become fans of those particular clubs, especially if like most Indians have never even been to the city in question. And how that theory goes is that when you are a particular age, and you start following a sport when you're say 12 or 13, or whatever it is, I've forgotten the exact numbers, whichever club is doing really well at that particular point in time, you become a fan of one of those clubs, and you kind of follow that which is why you know, if you meet an Arsenal fan, you'll know they are a certain age and you know, kids today are probably City and Liverpool fans and so on and all of that. Now, it strikes me that there might be a similar thing happening in terms of artistic trends as well, that you know, what what happens in India in a social sense is you have the liberalisation of 91, you have a burgeoning of this middle class, you have many more people consuming cinema from everywhere, books from everywhere, music from everywhere. And at this point, comes this film Satya, which does some important things so well, which shows people in Bombay talking as people in Bombay talk in the kind of surroundings which people in Bombay immediately recognise, and even people in other cities would recognise as actual and real. And it's a confluence of so many things. And therefore, it captures the imagination. And therefore, it becomes really big. And one of the criticisms you could then point out is that you have these sort of Satya imitations happening or influences being taken to new places, whether you look at the negative or the positive of it. And you know, it's almost like, before that, when you look at the Indian literary novel, for example, like I think one of the things with Salman Rushdie getting the book of A Midnight's Children is too many people in subsequent generations tried to write like him, even after Arundhati won the Booker in 97, which is when Satya was shot. In fact, you mentioned her in one of your opening sentences to set the times too many people started, you know, trying to write like her. And I've often felt that in Indian cinema, one of our problems is that too many people want to be Anurag Kashyap, you know, in terms of the stylisation, the setups, the machismo, which is kind of there and all of that you kind of get what I'm saying just in terms of that style. And that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. It depends on the influence. You know, I think maybe Tarantino had a similar kind of influence on filmmakers there. And it just leads me to wonder that maybe if instead of Satya, there was another kind of film, maybe if Arsatya came out in 1997, at that moment where it is ready to capture the imagination, do you get something better? Because, you know, I don't know if you'd agree, but I just feel like Arsatya is a far superior film in every way, much deeper characters, just much better made much sort of everything is just kind of so much better and less on the surface. So I hope I haven't set you off by saying that. So what's what's your sort of reaction to this kind of trends that we pick up on that at a particular point in time where you are impressionable, you know, a Kashyap does something remarkable. So you are like, I want to be the next Kashyap. But it could have been something else. I mean, hopefully for today's generation, you know, Tamane can have that kind of effect. I'd definitely love to see many more Tamanes and Kashyaps. But I mean, no offence to Kashyap was such a fine director and writer. What was your response to this rambling of mine?"

You're absolutely right in how people sort of pick up and then stay loyal to whatever changes their conception of art at a young age. And Satya did have that effect on me, though probably not to the extent that you might think, simply because as I said, I wasn't really watching that much cinema at that time. But I did register the force of it, even then it did seem like something very new. And just the sheer aggression of Golimaar Bheje mein turning up on screens like a month before the film, it worked better than any promo for the film could have because that was just the film in a nutshell out there. And Satya, I don't think could ever have that effect, simply because, and I'm a big fan of that film also, so I say this out of love, but it's a very uncomfortable film to watch. I saw it a couple of times during my research of the book, and I'd seen it before also. And it's just such a difficult, difficult not in the sense that it's boring or badly made at any point, it's just a very stark exploration of masculinity and harshness of the Indian male psyche. I think if it had been made in 97, perhaps it might have been done at a better scale with a slightly better budget and the film might have looked better and reached maybe a larger number of people. Though again, would you have everyone working at the height of their powers like they were in the early 80s? Maybe not. But I don't think its influence would have been that much more. I think Arsatya had just the right influence in terms of getting a generation of filmmakers interested in showing a more realistic Bombay and a more realistic police force, more realistic gangsters. Rama Shetty, who's the antagonist in that played by Sadashiv Amrapurkar, is a very, very interesting figure for the gangster film, I thought, in India, because he's after decades of gangsters being like these saints or these tuxedo wearing people or Ajit or Prem Chopra or Prem Nath, you know, no shade on them because they did their thing with great style. But there was that image of an over the top, leering Indian gangster and he was different. He was quiet and he was thoughtful. And it really gave options for people who wanted to maybe work in a slightly more commercial format. And you can see Ramu run with the idea in his first film. Shiva, the antagonist played by Raghuvaran in that is also soft spoken relatively and doesn't get psychotic till very late in the film, which is unheard of at that time. And Ramu is, of course, working in a very different sort of space than Govind Nilani was when he was making Aaj Satya. But you can see that connection run through there. And of course, then through on and into the more realistic gangsters of Israat Ke Subha Nahi and Satya."

And he said he wants to make it into a film. So we met and it was an amusing meeting because I was trying to convince him it wouldn't be a good film because it doesn't have that kind of narrative arc and all of that. And he was saying I want to make it and then it was really sad because he sort of went on this lament about how no one takes him seriously anymore and how the ecosystem and was so much better in the early 1980s when he made the films he did Aaj Satya, Party and whatever. And he also bemoaned how he didn't even have a print of Party. He said I don't have that film. And you know, can you get it from somewhere? And those were the days you know, that was 2009. So I remember writing an email to a friend of mine in the US and saying just see if Netflix has it. Netflix was in the DVD rental business. So they had it, he immediately got a copy and shipped it to me. But by that time, I think it was available otherwise, as well. But that film never kind of happened after after a month, he kind of got in touch with me and we did a treatment together for a Hindi film. And then he said ki nahi abhi Marathi mein banatiya because I think and this is very interesting. He said the Marathi industry today is in the same stage as the Hindi film industry was in the 80s. To Hindi mein kuch hope nahi hai, Marathi mein banate hain. And we did a treatment set in Pune. But then I just completely dropped off from the map. So I don't think he'll be listening to this.

Thank you. Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Uday Bhatia about his wonderful book on Satya, but it's on a lot more than Satya. It's also about Indian film history and the evolution of the gangster film in the Hindi film industry and the city film in the Indian film industry. Let's sort of talk about the gangster film tradition first. It's interesting that you also sort of set the historical context of, you know, post partition Bombay where you know, there are 1.8 million people here in 1941, that becomes 3 million in 1951. There are migrants, there's unemployment, there's easy access to ports. So you have, you know, an increase in crime, but they aren't gangs yet. You know, there's petty thievery, pickpocketing, as you point out, mugging in the odd heist. There aren't gangs yet. And you talk about Kismet, the 1943 film, which very sort of quaintly and something that seems to have a tendency that seems to have made a recurrence. There is this review of it by Film India, which castigates it for setting the wrong example and glorifying the wrong kind of person. I'll just read this out because I found this amusing quote, Bombay talkies have produced Kismet, a picture which glorifies a handsome criminal all throughout, makes light of his pickpocketing crimes, lends humor to his petty thefts, and ultimately restores him to a waiting fortune and parentage, not to mention the gift of the charming bride. Which young man would not like to be a criminal and a pickpocket after seeing Ashok Kumar achieve all this glory and popularity in Kismet? Stop God, which is kind of hilarious. But while this is an early example of sort of the Bollywood gangster film, you know, you speak about how in Hollywood, gangster films have almost, you know, come up with their own army of cliches. You speak about how 1932 was significant in sort of films like the Public Enemy and Little Caesar and Scarface releasing and they just lead to a bag of cliches to the point that even the Public Enemy is just in 1932, it's just considered to be just a way another variation on a trope, where the New York Times writes about it, and you've quoted this in your book, which is where I'm getting it from, quote, it is just another gangster film at the strand weaker than most in a story stronger than most in its acting, and like most maintaining a certain level of interest through the last burst of machine gun fire. Stop, quote, which you could say about so many films in the decades since. So give me a little sense of how this is sort of evolving, like in the sense that we don't have gangs at that time, yet everything is nascent, we do have petty crime. So the criminal that you see in our films early on are sort of these petty criminals, while Hollywood has a much greater tradition. Tell me of how in the early years, this kind of evolves. And also, are Hindi filmmakers looking to Hollywood for inspiration for direction, picking up things from there, which may or may not fit here? What's the sort of evolution of the gangster film in those early years?"

        "message": "So they're absolutely looking to Hollywood for inspiration, because anyone who's ever made gangster films has looked to Hollywood for inspiration. It is one of the great American art forms, the gangster film, it is very much an American thing. Everyone who has ever made it has picked up things from them, whether it's the Japanese or the French, or Hong Kong or Italy. It's all come from those very early 20s, 30s and 40s gangster films, which then sort of are transmuted into various cultures and interpreted by them. But you can see the initial, the Cagney's and the Edward Robinson's and the Ben Heck, and those films, those strands sort of survive in all of those. And the people who made the first Indian gangster films, and it's a little misleading to call them gangster films, because, as you said, they don't really have bonafide gangsters, because there were perhaps not many real life inspirations for those, unlike the US in the 20s and 30s, where there were a lot of mobsters. So you just had to print the legend, as it were. Out here, there wasn't that. So you see a lot of con men, you see a lot of pickpockets. Raj Kapoor is a small time thief in Awara, in Baazi, Dev Anand is a card sharp, and there's a film called Pocketmar, which is obviously about being a pickpocket and Kismet, Ashok Kumar is a pickpocket. So all these films have these small petty crimes, even their rings aren't very big crime rings, they're like small little crime syndicates being run rather than anything large. And it's only when I think you start getting real life inspirations that the Hindi gangster film starts taking a bit of shape, whether it's Kareem Lala, who gets a version of him played by Praan in Zanjeer, or it's Haji Mastan, who gets a version of him in Diwaar by Amitabh Bachchan. These are when things sort of start solidifying as the gangster genre, but the initial Hindi gangster films were, of course, inspired by Hollywood very much. Sometimes they took the plot lines from them. Sometimes they took the look from them. Also, confusingly, they took a lot of their look from noir film, which is possibly why a lot of the people in the years since have completely conflated the noir and the gangster film in India, which is not the case. Noir is something very different from, well, it's not very different because the two intersect all the time, but it is different in the sense that gangster film is a self-evident genre. A film is a gangster film, if it has gangsters in it, the same way as a Western is a Western. There's no other way about it, really. Noir isn't really a genre. It's a certain set of psychological and aesthetic conditions, as it were, which can be applied to various genres. So you have noir gangster films, but you also have a noir Westerns like Red River, or you have noir science fiction, you can have noir melodramas like Mildred Pierce. The mix of gangster film and noir was very strong in the 1950s films that kind of started off the genre in India. And people like Dev Anand and Guru Dutt were very big Hollywood fans, self-professed Hollywood fans. And so they were very happy stealing like little ideas from them. And you can see a lot of those, the little things that Brando was doing and then earlier what Cagney and Robinson and all are doing, the surface in their performances, even though these films are a lot sweeter than those where you didn't really get hard boiled films in the 1950s or 1960s out here, but they had a little of that look. And they had some of the tropes of the gangster and the noir film."

And one of them was someone called Subrat Mohanty, who also does this excellent podcast called Hal Chaal Theek Thak Hai. And he gave us like a half an hour talk on the history of cinema and the history of noir. And he even spoke about the different sub genres of noir, like there's something called Florida noir, apparently, which is if you shoot noir with sunshine, with a lot of light, that's Florida noir. So I got to explore that further to see what that looks like. I want to talk a little bit about actually this early period of noir and what Navketan did. And the most striking aspect of that period was starting off and you know, there were a lot of knock on effects on to cinema later, which come all the way to Satya from there. But one of the most startling things about that was the impact of serendipity that Dev Anand and Guru Dutt actually met because their clothes were mixed up by a dhobi they had in common. And that's how they first met and they became friends. And then Dev Anand said, okay, you got a direct chit for me. And the two got together and just sort of made a bunch of films. There was Bazi and you know, you've spoken about Aar Paar and CID and CID is very interesting because one of the things that you sort of mentioned in your book, which took me down a rabbit hole, was you spoke about the song Leke Pehla Pehla Pyar, you know, which shows Marine Drive is desolate and empty. So instantly I went on YouTube and it's there. And it's a lovely song and it has 57 million views. And so just as an aside before we talk about the Navketan period and the Noir period, what is it fundamentally about so much of this older music that it remains so incredibly popular today? Is it just a selection bias that we just remember the best songs from all of these decades and we can't really compare it with all the random stuff that comes out? Or is it something that we have lost in some way, maybe in terms of approach or whatever? What's sort of your sense of this before, you know, we go back"

        "message": "to Navketan and Noir and whatever happened there? I think it may be a bit of both. We certainly have lost our way in terms of Hindi film music. And I say that as a huge fan of Hindi film music and someone who related to Hindi film music a lot earlier than I related to Hindi films. I was a mega fan of A R Rahman growing up in the 90s. It was the most exciting thing. Like I saw his rise and Sachin Tendulkar's rise as pretty much analogous events happening at that time. Of course, there have been one or two good decades even after that, but now things are in fairly dire state. So I think we can leave that for other people to try and figure out why that's happening, because I have no answers. But as far as the older songs are concerned, I think a lot of our engagement with Hindi film is through music. And that seems like an evident thing to say, but I don't think people realize the extent to which people relate to Hindi films through music. I think that has changed maybe in the last one or two decades, where if you mention a particular film, people will actually talk about things about the film. And maybe a few films in history have been lucky that way, that you know, like if you talk about Sholay, or if you talk about Kagaz Ke Phool, or Pyaasa, or Golmaal, or Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, people won't talk about the songs, they'll talk about the film. But if you talk about Pakiza, or if you talk about pretty much any film from the 1950s, or if you talk about some of the early color Vijayanand thrillers, which are superb filmmaking, Teesri Manzil is perhaps unmatched in terms of just fluent commercial filmmaking at its best. It's incredible. But people will still talk about the songs, more likely in conversation, and not too many will actually get to the films. I think it is just something in the way we relate to films, maybe because it is, you know, we hear it on the radio, and the radio was such a big part of Indian life for so many years, that those were our first impressions of the film. Those were what sold the films. And often they were what got people back to the halls. I think there is just something in that, that is very central to our idea of films. And we just go straight for the music, rather than the filmmaking. And that was actually something which I didn't do because I didn't have that much of a background before I got really interested in films. When I was looking at a lot of these older films, I managed to see them as a whole without having too much idea about, oh, this is like a classic song that would always play. So some of course I knew like CID or whatever, Pyaasa, Kaagas Ke Pool, Tisvi Manzil, these are just albums of which everyone knows all the songs. But the less, like the other films that were made by Navketan at that time, Aar Paar and Taxi Driver and Baazi, I didn't know too many of those songs. So I was actually engaging with them when I saw the films. And it was very interesting for me because I could appreciate them as craft, but within my appreciation of the whole film rather than having an earlier impression of it already in my mind."

Like you speak about how Badalo Se is actually not voiced by actors, it's like a montage and that's become common enough. But at the time, it was very unusual to see a Hindi film song where people aren't running around trees singing and lip syncing to it. And also of course, Golimaar Bheje Mein, which as you point out, you know, Gulzar had written and Ramu didn't like it and or RGV didn't like it, as I am supposed to say, and went with it nevertheless, and then later realised that damn this works because it really strikes a chord like Gulzar just absolutely, as so often in his career just nailed the moment and the thing. What also kind of strikes me just sort of going back to the Navketan type was one you've detailed out many of these films and made me want to watch all of them again, because there seems to be a lot of spectacular stuff happening there. But then you also, you know, when you write about post noir Bollywood and what's happening after that, and it strikes me that there is also an evolution of both the hero and the villain, so to say, and the relationship between them, in the sense that in these early pre noir, and maybe that if films of that era, your hero is just a poor guy, and society has been hard on him, and he's just unlucky. And therefore, he can be the hero, even though he's a criminal, you kind of understand you root for him. Later on, you have an evolving gangster as well. And that also seems to me to be natural to come out of those sort of Nehruvian pre liberalisation years, so to say, where your typical gangster will be the crony capitalist businessman, your typical villain rather will be the crony capitalist businessman. And you're supposed to root for the hero who is fighting against those odds. And this kind of comes to a peak, perhaps in the 1970s, where even economically things were most dire for us. So how is this now evolving? As you pointed out that the noir films that were made by Navketan, for example, weren't gangster films, they it was just a stylistic and an aesthetic thing, and sometimes just a vibe. But they weren't gangster films as such, because they weren't gangsters. They weren't gangs in India, those heroes like Kareem Lala, and you know, Haji Mastan, and later Dawood in the mid 70s, they emerge much later. So give me a sense of then the evolution of the gangster period through these years, how that noir kind of dies down, though, obviously, semblances of it remain. And at the same time, you have the gangster film evolving."

        "message": "So colour pretty much wiped out the noir film out here, because we didn't make films that were emotionally noir, we made films that were aesthetically noir. We made films that looked like noir, but they didn't have the true pessimism and the altered states of a good noir, we didn't really do that much. We just made films with a lot of shadows. And because it was by really talented cinematographers, like VK Moorthy and Rathra, they looked great. And they resembled the noirs that we'd already seen. But colour, I think pretty much wiped that out. In the 70s, then the gangster became this slightly cartoonish figure, because you usually get these wealthy businessmen cast as gangsters, and they weren't really, you couldn't really take them seriously. Even in the early Bachchan films, in Zanjeer, you can't really take, you take Bachchan seriously, but you can't take Ajit seriously. It's only when you start getting the real life examples that sort of you start moving towards a semblance of the gangster film. There's this film called Dharmatma, directed by Firoz Khan, starring Firoz Khan, 1975. Not a good film, though it was a big hit. It was a pretty blatant copy of The Godfather, the first Godfather film. But it also used a real life example of this guy who was known as the Matka King, because he would run numbers, which he would pull out of a matka. And that would be the number for the day. And then I think his name was Ratan Khatri. And that then you had perhaps the Charles Sobhraj influence on Don, maybe not directly, but sort of the Jekol meets Charles Sobhraj might have inspired Don. So you could see the gangster look for real life inspiration, even though the gangsters were still not very interesting characters at that. You could call Vijay of Diwar a gangster smuggler, but he really isn't presented as such. You don't really see him as that. If you think of Vijay in that, you think of him as a brother, as someone who had a tough childhood, who likes his mother, and not really as a gangster, because that part isn't really stressed. It was like, oh, society has made it so difficult for this person. It was only in the 80s that the genre sort of started taking shape. And when you got actual gangster films, you had Subhash Ghai make Vidhata. You had this other Dilip Kumar film called Mashaal. In both these films, Dilip Kumar is a reluctant sort of gangster. You had Arj Satya, which is the cop film, but again, with a very interesting antagonist. And I think that was a huge influence on the rest of the thing. And then as the decade kind of goes on, you get more and more examples of this. You have Arjun, which brings in the gangster politician nexus, which you see, of course, then in Shiva, and then you see later in Satya, and in all the subsequent gangster films, really. But Arjun was one of the first films that I think did it in a proper way, in which Sunny Deol becomes not quite a gangster, but he becomes this muscle for hire for Anupam Kher's antagonist in that. And it's only by the time you reach the end of the 80s with Hathiyar and Parinda in 1989, that I think you could say that we started making bona fide gangster films. These two films are bona fide gangster films, fully realised."

And I'm wondering if there are two impulses here for a Hindi film viewer. And one impulse is an impulse towards escapism, that hey, life is hard, and I just want to escape and I want to go I want to listen to songs, I want outlandish entertainment, which is why even through the 80s, you have cartoonish villains, like you've pointed out Sir Judah in Kars or Shakal in Shaan, or, you know, Mogambo in Mr. India, while at the same time in the same decade, you have this growing realism in films like Arsatya and Arjun and, you know, at the end of the decade, Parinda and Hathiyar, as you've sort of pointed out, that impulse might be the opposite of the impulse to escapism. It's the impulse that when you relate to something, when you see something that is real, and you can relate to it, there is that thrill of recognition. And I would imagine a greater involvement and empathy, therefore. And obviously, both these impulses can exist within the same person. So I can really enjoy an escapist film and at the same time, enjoy, you know, a real film, like enjoy Shaan and Arsatya together, if someone can."

And does that then make Indian cinema closer and closer to I mean, there's no such thing as a global mainstream, but generally, cinema anywhere or will there always be this parallel strands where, you know, even a lot of Hollywood commercial cinema is escapist to some degree.

Rahul Ravel made Arjun, M. Chandra made Tezab, a little later in 1990, Mukul Anand made Agnipath. These are out and out commercial films, they have no interest in being gritty for art sake. Any concessions that they make towards grittiness, towards violence, towards a certain realism in terms of their sort of psychological aggression, is all to the service of getting people to the hall. They thought that it would be popular, they thought that it was in tune with the times and so they did that. So I don't see it as very opposed to each other. I think it just became more possible by then to present a slightly more violent, more realistic portrayal of the streets, of criminality. They echoed what was happening in the cinema of other countries more honestly, I guess, than they could in the 70s. And it just sort of came about without, I think, too much planning. Arsatya would be an outlier. Something like in the late 70s, Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Daastan, which shows very much the effects of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver on it and is a very unique view of Bombay in the sense that it really sees it as this giant garbage dump and says as much, which was very unusual for any film then or now. But those were films that were made by film school students, which did not really hope to reach a large audience. It was actually, I think, the films that did want to reach a lot of people that managed to push the standard along and make it a little easier for things like Parinda and Hathiyar, both of which have extraordinary scenes of violence and are quite stark, in between being pure commercial films also, to be possible."

But Parinda was made by technicians who were at really the peak of their power, so it cannot compare. And Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a better technical director, at least than JP Dutta. But Hathiyar has that rawness in it that you can see in Satya, that the violence is the violence of desperation, of living on the streets, close to the streets. It's not something that is so much related to one's personal histories as it is a sort of larger social condition. In Parinda, it's a very specific story of these people who are actually fairly well off. If you look at the houses in Parinda, they're quite nice. They're at least upper middle class, both antagonists and protagonists. And they all drive around in cars and they seem quite well off. In Hathiyar, no one is well off. They're living in a chawl, same as the people in Satya. They kill people over food. It is a sort of desperate world. And even though Satya doesn't quite have the sort of star quality of a lot of the people in Hathiyar, which makes it quite a different feeling film. It feels like an Indie, whereas Hathiyar still feels like a film that wants to go out to a very large audience. There is that in common, that desperation and that feeling of being off the streets.

I think it started coming on TV, which is where I saw it first. And to me, it seemed very weird when I first saw it, because I wasn't used to that mix of genres, because it's kind of a gangster film, but it's also a bit of social satire, because this world of these yuppie ad men mix up with these gangsters and the clash is very interesting. It was an important signpost on the way to Satya, because you had fully realized gangster characters. More than perhaps any film before that, you had gangsters who were very much humans first. And just incidentally, they happen to be gangsters. The Ashish Vidhyarthi character, the Sourabh Shukla character, all of them are very much dealing with normal problems. Your father is nagging you, your wife is not getting along with your friend, your brother is taking up with some girl that you don't approve of, and the phone keeps ringing. And these are all like little things. There's this lovely little detail that someone must have added where one gangster has a stone in his shoe. So he's limping during a chase, which is just such a small little detail. And you can see that those kind of things must have appealed to the writers of Satya, one of whom was Sourabh Shukla. And Sourabh Shukla, of course, was not only played a part in Israd Ke Subah Nahin, but was rumored to have contributed a bit to the writing, even though he said that I was a bouncing board for ideas. I didn't really write anything, but I sort of this. But you can see that certain things would have appealed to him. And the brotherly relationship between the two gangsters at the heart of that film also is very much echoed in the shooting of Guru Narayan in Satya, the scene on the bridge where he is like, meri bivi isko rakhi banti thi, mere bachche isko mama bolte the. That scene very much has a parallel in Israd Ke Subah Nahin where Ashish Vidyarthi is charging Sourabh Shukla's character with similar things. Ramu was a bit non-committal when I asked him directly if it had an influence, but Kashyap and Shukla both felt that it was a very big part of it. So I think there is a bit of Israd Ke Subah Nahin in Satya. Bandit Queen is a very interesting signpost because it's a decoyed film, which is an entirely different genre in India. It really cannot be clubbed under the gangster. The same as the Western and the gangster film in America, it cannot be looked at as the same things. But Ramu saw it as somewhat of a model for him. He wanted that kind of realism. He said that explicitly in an interview that I want realism the way Shekhar Kapoor had done in Bandit Queen. And you can see that he picked up a lot of the cast and crew from there. You have Bajpai, you have Sourabh Shukla, you have Ashish Vidyarthi, stunt director Alan Ameen was from there. So a lot of people just were directly lifted off that production. I think with the idea that they would bring something of the stark quality of Bandit Queen"

Like apparently, which I learned from your book, Shekhar Kapoor, RGV and Mani Ratnam formed a film company together to make movies. So Dil Se is the only one they made, which is so fascinating. And yeah, you know, there's often stuff that we take for granted, but that had to have originated somewhere. And for example, you know, the different members of a gang having different personalities and interior lives and all of that, which as you point out, it was not common in Hindi cinema. And it was there in Satya and it was there before that in Israd Ki Subha Nahi. And similarly, a gangster having a normal family life, like that very famous scene in Satya where Bhiku Matre goes home with Satya and he has that charming spat with Shefali Shah, his wife over there. And you have this little domestic quarrel with this hardcore gangsters being involved. And that again, you know, may not seem so unusual today, but at the time, it certainly would have been given what came before. You know, before we come back to Satya and zoom down upon it and look at that in detail, let's go to the other historical strand, which is the strand of the city film, which also fascinates me no end. Like Bombay is of course, a character in Satya. In fact, as you point out that the film could not have been made anywhere else, it would fundamentally have been a different film if it was in any other city. So tell me a bit about how have Indian films in that sense, you know, looked at Satya. I mean, you've pointed out how again, going back to Navketan, you know, when Chetan Anand made Taxi Driver, the Indian Taxi Driver of 1954, you know, in the credits, you have the credits ending with the last cast member, court and city of Mumbai, stop good. So tell me a little bit about how sort of Bollywood looked at or Hindi cinema rather, I don't know if you have a problem with the term Bollywood, like Shekhar Kapoor does, it just become standard shorthand. But how, you know, cities evolved in the way that they were sort of portrayed, especially, you know, Bombay slash Mumbai over the years, since that's, you know, the base of the whole industry, as it were."

Because the two are, of course, linked, Bombay is the place or and pretty much the only place where Hindi films are made. So you will get a lot of the city in most Hindi films. But that isn't always anything to do with the real city. It's often just a glimpse of the sea can be a tourist site, or it can be a famous landmark. But it doesn't quite have much to do with lived experience. When I was tracking the city film, I wanted to see if I could run through a couple of films over the years that had dealt with this lived experience in one way or the other. And it's not as systematic as the as the gangster film thing where I could go from like one year to the other and say, okay, it went from here to here to here. And these gangsters, you know, these are gangster films. Out here, I think it jumps a little bit because I'm trying to sort of see certain motifs that are emerging, for example, through language. Now, our idea of Bombay has very much determined by the speech that we hear that the Bombay speech, the way it's sort of evolved has very much shaped our idea of the city. And you can see that through films like there's Aar Paar, where you have these mixture of tongues. And Abrar Alvi had written that before he wrote Pyaasa and Kagas Ke Phool, which are, of course, the films that he is remembered for. But in that film, he brought this sort of spokenness, as he put it to Hindi film. And Kashyap, interestingly, said that that was the kind of spokenness that he wanted to bring to Satya all those years later, because he tried to capture the actual rhythms of speech. And then you see that down through the years, not so much in the Salim Javed, Amitabh Bachchan films, but if you see the films written by Qadar Khan, Mukaddar Ka Sikandar and Amar Akbar Anthony, those have that real Bombayya bhasha being spoken. And those really give that feel of a certain city talk. You could also see it in films like Gaman and later in Albert Pinto, Gussa Kyon Aata Hai. So that was one way in which the city sort of emerges, even if the rest of the film doesn't have, say, a lot of location shooting. Then you had mentioned the 1954 Taxi Driver, which was largely shot on location simply because they didn't have a lot of money. So their only solution was to strap this lightweight camera that they had got from France onto the hood of a taxi and to go out and just shoot the streets. At that time, it must have seemed a little strange to people. Now it looks really fresh as compared to a lot of the other Navketan films, which are clearly studio films. This is shot in the outdoors. You can see a lot of the people and the surroundings and the city and it looks quite incredible. There was another film called Akhari Khat, which was made about a decade later. It's also quite remarkable in the sense it is a child's eye view of the city. They let this little toddler onto the streets and they just followed it with the camera. This is a Chetan Anand film. And it was again a very unvarnished look at Bombay. And these were later picked up by the parallel films and by the films made by the FTII graduates in the 70s and 80s. And you get a certain idea, parallel idea of Bombay almost running through these films and running through, say, the more commercial films. Even a middle of the road film like Guddi, which starts off very early on when Jaya Bachchan arrives in Bombay. Her experience of the city is through painted billboards of films of her celebrity crush, Dharmendra. And you hear De Do Pyar, Le Lo Pyar playing on the soundtrack. And so this is a film that even though it is in a slightly more realistic frame, she is experiencing Bombay as the cinematic city and not a real city. It's a very interesting play by Rishikesh Mukherjee, which you have an echo in Ramgopal Verma's Rangila, all those years later, whose opening credits have street noise on the soundtrack. And you have stills of film stars on screen with the credits of the stars of Rangila accompanying them. So you have like the city film as it were running parallel to the cinematic Bombay film at the same time in the opening credits, in a film which is about the people who sort of straddle real Bombay and cinematic Bombay. That's so fascinating. And"

        "message": "what I also found fascinating was, you know, you've obviously got such a fine ear for this stuff. You've given so many great examples of this Bombayya, how it's come down through the years. Like I was struck by Mehmood in Bombay to Goa, saying, tumko kidar jane ka, which speaks to you at multiple levels. And there's this great example that I actually want to read out from Rangila, because it's a great example of show don't tell, where instead of just saying something, you kind of show it. Like the example that I like to sort of give my writing class of an example of this is when JBS Haldane, the scientist was asked why he shifted to India in his 60s, after living all his life in England. Instead of saying something like I wanted to live a simple life unconstrained by convention, he said, I don't want to wear socks anymore, which is so beautiful, because everybody relates to it, you immediately get it right. And similarly, in Rangila, you quote this lovely dialogue where two touts are talking, and one of them asks another one, kaisa chal raha hai dhanda? And the other guy says, solid bole toh paisa lane ka, taxi mein jane ka kya? I love this, because taxi mein jane ka, you know, this is what he aspires to. This is that visual image. Instead of saying like mujhe bohot ameer banne ka hai, yeh karne ka hai, woh karne ka hai, you know, just this simple plain image, which tells you kind of so much and is so evocative. I also, you know, after reading about it in your book, I've tried to find Akhri Khat because, you know, just to sort of elaborate and I couldn't find it on YouTube, I just found a song from it on YouTube. And just to elaborate, I mean, I can't believe such film was made in 1966. And you know, what really intrigued me and what I wanted to see was how in the film Chetan Anand cuts back and forth through time, not just how you have the city through the infant's child's eye. But like you point out, the basic plot of the film is this woman goes to leave an infant at her lover's doorstep, and she leaves a letter to that effect. But she changes her mind and takes the baby away, but he finds a letter and that's Akhri Khat. And then the woman dies and the infant is alone. So now this guy is out going through the street to look for the infant. And simultaneously, you have the city of Bombay through the eyes of the infant, you have these constant flashbacks happening and it's cutting back and forth through time where you show the relationship and all of that. And indeed, the song that I found on YouTube seems to show be one such flashback and shows them in happier times and all of that. And that's fascinating in this interplay of the past. And again, maybe, you know, there's a sense of that in the final scenes of Satya as well. You know, as Satya is climbing the steps to, you know, get to his beloved, and he's injured and he can barely climb and then you keep cutting away to this image from earlier in the film where she's on the roof and she's saying, come, come, come. And that was really well done. Extremely sophisticated,"

Ramu explained it this way that he's like the film had become very dark towards the end. I don't think he meant dark emotionally. I think he meant like it was just like very dark. You hadn't seen the sun or the blue sky for a long time. So he's like, I wanted a little bit of brightness in that moment. I think it was the editor, one of the editors, Apoorva Srani's suggestion to insert those little glimpses of happier times with Vidya's character just before he dies. And with Agarika, what makes it even more audacious is that he folds a flashback into the opening credits, which is incredible. Like if it had been done outside India by some French New Wave filmmaker, they would have been like, oh, this is so audacious. And it's just a subversion of opening credits and things. And because it's India and because the film is not available anywhere properly, I was very lucky that I saw it somewhere floating around earlier when there was a good print floating around. Now, I can't get a print that you can even see the action underneath all the mark. But it's a fascinating film."

        "message": "Wow. And what a tragedy that these are not preserved. Another thing that, you know, struck me in the narrative was how so many of these choices, like how do you show the city and all of that are determined by circumstances. Like you talk about how in the 70s, the big Bollywood films starring the big stars could not show the city too much. Because you know, you put Amitabh or Shashi Kapoor out there in the middle of Bombay, they're going to get mobbed and it's just not practical. So today you could put somebody else there and do a deep fake and put their face but not then. And therefore, the sort of films where the city began to play a really big part were the middle of the road films, like the Basu Chatterjee films and Rishikesh Mukherjee and Bhimsen's Garonda and films like that. Films like that, which really begin to showcase the city as a character and therefore, the struggles of normal people who live there. Because like you said, you know, Amitabh can get mobbed in the market, but Amol Palekar probably won't. Which is sad. Amol Palekar should also get mobbed. So tell me a little bit about that period and therefore, how the way that they look at the city evolves. Because therefore, if you have middle of the road films with the kind of middle class characters that these directors put in their films, you also don't have that elite Bollywood-y look at the city, the South Bombay big houses, all of that. You have very much the common person like in Garonda, these two people who are just who just want a roof above their head, who are struggling to kind of find a place they can call their own, which is something every Bombay person can relate to, right? So tell me a little bit about then the evolution of how the city begins to be shown in Hindi cinema and becomes a character"

        "message": "in so many films. Middle of the road cinema was instrumental, I feel, at least in bringing Bombay to the forefront of Hindi films. I don't think it could have happened in commercial cinema had that not happened through the 70s and the 80s in middle of the road cinema. And it was done in such an unassuming manner that didn't call attention to itself. Now we look back at Basu Chatterjee films and say, oh, wow, this is like the Bombay of that times. We literally cannot see it in any other films. You can see it in Basu Chatterjee films because he really had an eye, more than, I would say, Rishikesh Mukherjee, who is equal in all other ways and maybe superior in some. But I think Basu Chatterjee did have the better eye and his eye for Bombay is incredible. I think there is no song on the Bombay rains that is better than the one in Manzil, Rim Jim Gire Sawan. And similarly, the double-decker buses, best buses would turn up in so many of his films. And now you actually, I had to do a piece on the double-decker buses. Someone else was doing a piece in Mint Lounge and I was asked to go and look through Basu Chatterjee films because they needed a still and they couldn't get an image of the double-decker buses from anywhere else. And they were like, okay, it must be there in Bato Bato Mein or Rajnikanda or something. So go and look through that, which, and we did find stills there. And you can see this through Pablo's slash middle of the road cinema, the Saeed Mirza films, I think were also very perceptive about life in Bombay. The loose trilogy of Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Dastaan, Albert Pinto ko kussa kyon aata hai and Salim Langde pe mat ro, they photograph Bombay very honestly. And you can draw some sort of line from them through to Salaam Bombay, through to Satya. They are also very perceptive about life in Bombay, about the mills, about the sort of disconnect between the new upper class, the new moneyed class in Arvind Desai and the people whom he deals with. He has great contempt for them. And that's unusual to see in a Hindi film, someone just calling Bombay a trash heap and saying that all these people are sold out and I am so much better than them, even though it's obvious that he is hardly any kind of virtuous man himself. And these are all very fascinating monuments to Bombay in their particular time period. It's good that they were spaced out by some years, because you sort of get an idea of how Bombay evolved through the films of Saeed Mirza. You also have Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho, which is a fantastic black satire on Bombay and housing and corruption and just the living conditions in Bombay. And then you have films like Katha, also indebted to the middle of the road tradition, Sai Paranjpe Katha, which is a beautiful look at communal living in Bombay. So I think the picture that came through all these films was something that you could not see in the commercial cinema of that time for a very long time until it sort of started to pick up in the mid to late 80s. And the torch was carried by parallel cinema and middle of the road cinema for a very long time."

There was a film called Aankho Dekhi by Rajat Kapoor, which I think was quite instrumental in bringing back the new middle cinema. And then it sort of took off from there. You had Dum Laga Ke Haisha, which was also very influential. And then it's been one of the brighter spots in my life in the past, say, five or six years.

        "message": "tradition. Yeah, and interesting that many of these actors who are acting in these middle of the road films also interestingly acted in Satya like, you know, Manoj Pawar and Sushant Singh and just a whole bunch of these guys. And sort of just an aside for my listeners that, you know, I was just while reading your book thinking about where do you see Bombay the best today? And it's actually not in cinema, it's in vlogs. So there are a bunch of vlogs I've started following, which I'll link from the show notes, people like Devdutt Dhani, Mohammed Saleem Khan, Satya Sagar, who, you know, and they are the starkest, the most real sort of images of the city as it is and the city evolving every day and growing every day, as you see, though, of course, you know, they are possibly more what you would call documentary sort of style than realism. And you've kind of written in the book about the difference between cinematic realism and the documentary style. But it's just that how through the years there is this progression towards greater and greater intimacy. And some of that, of course, has to do with the medium as well, because entirely different medium, if you're sort of vlogging for YouTube, as opposed to actually making cinema, though, I think there's a lot of good cinematic talent happening out there as well. Let's start talking about Satya now, we've kind of seen that it's not something that emerges sui generis, right? There's been this tradition of the gangster film that has gradually come to this point, there's this tradition of the city film, which has come to this point where the city is being shown for what it is. And then there is an enormous amount of serendipity and lucky accidents, which kind of happen and which sort of just come together right from you know, you know, Manoj Bajpai being one of the really important figures, and the way Manoj sort of runs into RGV, or I'll just say Ramu because that's what's coming into my head. The way Manoj runs into Ramu is that he auditions for Daoud, which is, you know, another film that Ramu happens to be making. And if he hadn't happened to be making that at that point, then you know, Manoj Bajpai would not may not have been associated. And therefore, Satya may not have evolved the way that it did. And then there are just a bunch of lucky accidents, which kind of come together. One lucky accident is actually a failure where RGV because he's influenced by Arsatya wants Vijay Tendulkar to write the film. And he goes to Vijay Tendulkar and there is some it's lost in translation and Vijay Tendulkar says no. And therefore, you know, Anurag Kashyap and later they get Sourav Shukla. And the way all of this is kind of happening where, you know, Manoj goes for an audition for some other film, becomes friends, gets Anurag in, Vijay Tendulkar says no, they get Sourav Shukla, all of this kind of just falling into place these incredible accidents. This kind of happens throughout cinema, right? So even Nafketan, you have, you know, some dhobi mixes up the clothes of Guru Dutt and Dev Anand and that's how they meet. And that's how those films happen. So what's your sense of, you know, looking at this that is there a counterfactual where there is no Satya, you know, where RGV does make something else entirely, and all these people go their own way. And perhaps none of us have heard of Manoj Bajpai and he he's in the footnotes of history as someone who played an interesting role in Bandit Queen and that's that. What does one, when you follow cinema history as keenly as you do, what's your sense of serendipity in the role"

        "message": "that it plays? Totally, I think there may not have been a Satya because Ramu is someone who doesn't sit still. If a project is not working out, he is on to the next project. And that is something that was true in his heyday. And it is still true today, where he is juggling four or five projects at any given time. Satya was something that he really did want to do. He wanted to make his first Hindi gangster film properly. And even though, like you mentioned, Vijay Tendulkar didn't work out. Obviously, he was influenced by Arjit Satya and he would have liked Tendulkar to be there. I'm not sure he wasn't happy with the way things turned out. Not only because, of course, the script was great, but also because if you see the rest of the cast and crew, there are a lot of people at the start of their careers without the anxiety of influence, as it were. For example, he gets Gerard Hooper from the United States, who was a professor then and a cinematographer, hadn't shot a feature film, hadn't watched a Hindi film. And he got suggested by one of Ramu's friends and he saw his stuff and he brought him over. And a lot of these decisions were taken. Sushant Singh was cast out of the blue just because he turned up and Ramu liked his look and he liked his buzz cut and he said, haan aajao. And he cast him in that part and then that really changed the way the film was shot. Sourabh Shukla didn't really want to write, he wanted to act, but he knew he wouldn't get to act unless he also said, yeah, okay, I'll write. So, and Ramu also knew he wouldn't get Sourabh Shukla unless he said, haan, you can act. So, both of them did a slight compromise and said, okay, fine, he'll do both. One of the editors, Apoorva Sarani, who was 19 years old then, hadn't ever cut a film. These were obviously deliberate decisions by someone who wanted a fresh outlook in pretty much every aspect of his film. So, in that sense, every film probably has these slightly serendipitous circumstances where you're like, oh, if these two hadn't gotten together, then how would we have had so-and-so in this film, so-and-so in this part, this person shooting the film. It's just that Satya was a very interesting time. All these people were at the start of their careers, and there was a director, very receptive and eager to use what they brought, rather than seasoned veterans at that time. So, I think the quality of the serendipity was perhaps a little different because the intent was to do something"

So, you had two writers, you had two cinematographers, and there also, it seems to be a very lucky accident. At first, you get Gerard Hooper, who is coming from outside, so he's bringing that outsider's view, and he's got that sort of realistic aesthetic and ethic, rather, and he just wants everything to capture Bombay as he sees it. And the cinematographer who takes over from him, Mazhar Kamran, also comes from that documentary tradition. So, stylistically, they are so suited to each other, and so sort of responsible for the vibe of the film. You also have sort of two editors, because one of them is working on an Avid, the other one is working on a Steinbeck, almost like, you know, again, the film is a literal bridge and Istanbul as it were, you know, between two different traditions, though, more a bridge in time than a bridge in geography, and the music, you know, Vishal Bhardwaj and Sandeep Chautha. So, tell me a little bit about, you know, what do you feel about the music in particular? You know, one of the things I discussed with Jai in that episode, which you also mentioned, which I wonder what your opinion is, is the role of sort of background music in films, like I generally don't want to be spoon fed, like where there is background music, I want it to be subtle, not in a sense of, you know, spoon feeding me and telling me how to feel and all of that. But just adding another layer to whatever the storytelling is doing and a layer that is not redundant. And Sandeep Chautha's music here is very interesting, because parts of it, I really liked, it seemed to kind of work so much, but you also point out how so many people sort of reacted negatively to the music and said that, hey, you've spoiled it all. And, you know, there's too much loud music and whatever. Tell me a little bit about, you know, what were your impressions of it when you first saw the film with normal eyes when you're not writing a book on it. And then when you watch it again and again, and all of that, and you speak to all the protagonists concerned, how is your sense of it evolving? And is it an important film also for the way the music was approached? So I don't really have a problem with button pushing"

Morricone also, I wouldn't call him a particularly subtle composer, but he's again, one of my favorites. I would say that I do not have a fondness for very loud scores, just in terms of the mixing and the way it's used. And Satya can be a very loud score at times, it drowns out dialogues as, as Sourabh Shukla pointed out to me when I asked him about the score, and it also distracts sometimes, I guess it may be more distracting for people outside India, people inside, people here are a lot more used to loud and blaring music coming out of the films. I have mixed feelings about the score. I think it's very effective in a lot of moments, the opening and closing themes when Satya is just arriving in the city is this sort of mournful quality to them, which is a very nice downbeat start to the film. And closing out also a very heartrending kind of flute melody, which is there. But there's also moments where it's just, it's pushed up to 11. And I was asking Ramu about it also, and he had said that, you know, I know that I do this to my film scores, but it's like after the dialogue is locked and the sound mix is locked, the only thing I can play with is the score. And so I keep fiddling with that. And I like to push it quite a bit. Interestingly, someone who we mentioned a couple of times already, Govind Nelani was shown a cut of Satya before it released. And he said that, Ramu, I think you've gone overboard with the score. And I think it's not going to work. And he changed his mind after the film released, because he said that the audience could relate to a lot of things that were going on in Satya because they're used to this kind of score. And some of the things in the film that may have been new to them, were sort of smoothed over by the fact that they were used to these kind of aggressive, loud button pushing"

        "message": "scores. Yeah, and I think you've also pointed out in the book that how, you know, Mazhar Kamran, who shot more than half the film, you know, saw a cut of it without the music. And he told Ramu that, hey, you know, I think we failed. And Ramu said, wait, wait, wait, see the version with the music, and then he changed his mind completely. So I guess at certain levels, it worked. My other question is about the nature of how the script evolved. Like you've pointed out that one, of course, there is that early scene with Sushant where the power of improvisation came through and Ramu said, okay, you know, let's kind of stick to improvising, we have the caliber of actor who can do that. But then also Gulshan Kumar was murdered just as the film was underway. Different accounts have it on the second day, the fourth day, as you've pointed out. And I'll ask you a question about memory also, a little later. And Ramu decided that, okay, we got to take a break. And we got to incorporate what we are learning about this industry and about what's happening in the Bombay underworld and all of that through this. And indeed, you have a sort of a similar assassination as one of the plot points of the film, and all of that. The upshot of this was that, you know, at one point, you write, I'll just quote from your book, you say, quote, Kashyap is probably exaggerating only a little when he says that after the scene at the tabela, the writing process became a series of one-liners conceived by Verma and fleshed out by Shukla and himself. Ramu would say, today we'll shoot this scene, this happens, that happens, and so and so is killed. We'd go there and write the scene based on the actors available. One can picture Shukla and Kashyap frantically scribbling last minute zingers, handing those to the actors minutes before the shot and saying, forget what we told you earlier, just say this. How exhilarating it must have been if you were an actor used to situations like this. How utterly unnerving if you weren't. And it, you know, and this can, of course, be a strength. You have some incredible actors, though I didn't think so highly of Chakravarti, but we'll come to that later. But you have some, you have an incredible ensemble cast here. But it can also make for weaknesses where everything doesn't seem to, you know, fit together so well. Like, you know, I can both say wow at that scene, the railway footbridge or whatever, where Guru is killed and they have that impromptu exchange, which tells you that there is a backstory between them. But it seems sudden and unmoored from, you know, there's no hint of that coming. Had you had a hint that there is a backstory, then even the decision to kill this person, the chase of this person would have had an added resonance that is not there, because this is just improvised. It's not kind of there. Perhaps the actors themselves didn't know it at the time till they actually start talking like that. And, you know, so do you feel that that's a sort of a fundamental weakness of the film? And again, an opinion, which I think will not go down well with many people, and I say this with the greatest of respect. But when I saw Gangs of Wasseypur, it just seemed to me that it's a series of brilliant set pieces, but the whole is less than the sum of its parts. And therefore, there might also then be this approach that are a great scene, great scene, great scene. But does it tie together all that? Well, and I wonder if some of the approach there was similar as well. So what are your sort of thoughts on this? And please don't troll me, Wasseypur fans."

I'll digress a bit at the beginning, because I wanted to bring in something that I had in an earlier draft of the book, but then I cut out for reasons of length and just not really fitting. But Jaws, the Steven Spielberg Jaws, actually, the writing of it had quite a lot in common with what Satya seemed to have been. There was a script by the original author of the novel that just didn't work. And it was rewritten by someone. It was rewritten by someone else. And finally, they decided that none of those would work. And by that time, shooting had started. And the shark, as you know, was malfunctioning, and there were like a whole bunch of problems. But also, they really didn't have a script. And so what they did was they wrote it from day to day. Spielberg and two writers and Richard Dreyfuss would sit at night after the day's shooting, whatever had been planned for the next day. And they would sit in right into the morning and the secretary would take everything down. And then they would try and catch up on a few hours of sleep and someone would cycle off and get it typed out. And those would be handed to the actors and they would do that. And that was apparently how Jaws came about. And it seems that Satya was quite the same. I don't know how much we should believe Kashyap in that, when he says that the whole film became a series of one liners, because Satya in many seasons does have a written quality to it, not an improvisational quality, even though people may have improvised within certain, you know, structured scenes. But for example, the fight between Bhiku and Pyari does have that quality of a scene written rather than things unfolding on the spot, even though there's a lot of natural energy to that scene. Whether this worked against the film, I'm not sure. I like the suddenness. You mentioned the Guru Narayan shooting on the bridge. I like the suddenness with which it bursts out of Bhiku, because I feel it may be in character for him. He obviously doesn't want to bring up in front of his gang how close he was to his big rival, now Guru Narayan. And I think it would take something like this huge betrayal and seeing that person sort of begging for his life to suddenly just drag it all out of him at that moment and almost like in a mania. If it had come before, yes, perhaps it would have been a little more resonant, a little more invested in him, in the whole chase, the way they run through and the way he's begging. But I think the suddenness also has a virtue to it. And a lot of it was apparently Bajpai improvising on a few broad pointers that he'd been given. He'd been told that whatever, that they knew each other and they were friendly and their families knew each other. But the specifics just burst out of Bajpai in that moment, apparently."

And it's so many little lanes that it goes down through both culturally, politically, socially, bringing in so many aspects of the life out there that I think it's quite a brilliant screenplay, really. So I say that, yeah, it fights with the with the set pieces simply because Wasseypur does have that many great set pieces. But I think it's actually as a structured screenplay, it is possibly superior to Satya in that sense that Satya does have a slightly haphazard quality. There's really not so much of a A leads to B leads to C quality about it. Whereas Wasseypur, if you map the whole thing out over its six or so hours, there is this sort of broad constructed arc to it, I feel. Fair enough. Let's sort of talk about another"

        "message": "haphazard aspect of Satya, which is Chakravarti in the main role. Like one of the interesting sort of narrative arcs of your book is how it's kind of understood that Manoj Bajpai will play the main role. And then the character of Bhiku Matre becomes so interesting, that RGV tells him that, no, no, no, you play Bhiku Matre and he's upset and he complains about it to Kashyap to the effect of that, you know, this was my one shot at playing a lead role, yeh kya ho gaya yaar and all of that. And he plays Bhiku and he's just absolutely incredible as he's been through his career. I mean, he was so amazing in Family Man recently as well. But Chakravarti seems extremely uneven, you know, the only scenes where his acting seems to work is where he's supposed to show restraint because he is, I think, naturally resting face restrained. And there are scenes where you see a combination of his being miscast, I think, or rather acting and also the impromptu script, like you pointed out that scene between Bhiku and his wife where they're fighting, where if you just look at Satya's reaction, just not reacting, and I think you've mentioned in the book also is one of those confusing moments for you and you pointed out it may be partly because he wasn't briefed on what his character is supposed to be. But it seems like, you know, here is an actor who, and I'm perfectly fine with the character's backstory remaining mysterious to us. I think that's fine. You don't need to spell everything out and explain everything. But it almost felt"

        "message": "to me that the actor doesn't know himself. So interestingly, Ramu took a lot of blame for whatever criticism one might level at Chakravarthy's performance on himself by saying that he didn't have a clear conception of Satya's character from the start. And therefore he couldn't give clearer signals to Chakravarthy. And therefore, like the kind of mulish confusion that you see in scenes like the Bhiku and Pyari fight where Satya is just standing there. Ramu at least said that it is my fault. It's not his. I couldn't tell him that this is how he's feeling in that moment. Chakravarthy, let's face it, is not as deft as an actor as Bajpayee or Sourabh Shukla or Shefali Shah or any number of actors in Satya. And I think his best scenes are when he has to express Satya's personality through movement and through physicality. He makes very quick darting movements which tie in with Satya's propensity to make quick decisions and bold decisions. I have to slash this random thug in the tabela. We have to kill Guru Narayan. We have to kill Amod Shukla. Decisions that ultimately backfired, but at the time they seemed like good decisions at least. When he has a lot of words or when he has to do big emotional scenes, it is a bit lacking. His scenes with Urmila don't quite work. And it's interesting because other people have argued that he's sort of the blank slate against which everyone else can be colourful and distinguished. I buy that argument to an extent. Whether he's miscast or not is, I think, a difficult question. He was cast, I think, partly because of his look. I think Verma just liked that he thought he looked like a gangster. He wanted someone from outside the Hindi industry. He wanted someone from the Telugu film because he'd speak a certain way. He'd bring that sort of man-from-nowhere quality. I think those are all smart ideas. They work at a theoretical level. Maybe at a practical level, some of them backfired and some of them worked."

        "message": "Maybe I'm being too harsh on Chakravarthy and maybe I think a part of it is that the character was certainly in my mind not drawn out well enough because there are inherent contradictions. Like one of the things that struck me about the first part of the film is that everybody's stupid in the first part of the film where Chakravarthy is randomly slashing people and hitting people where he can easily get killed for it. Later in the film, he's portrayed as a kind of Chanakya of action and all of that, a strategist and all of that. But he's doing these really stupid things, taking pangas in the first part of the film with gangsters who could just kill him. And these gangsters aren't killing him. And that is very much at odds with when he, I forget the first guy's name, after he does that thing where he starts beating him up, you'd imagine that these gangsters will just finish him off, right? Rest of the film, that's what you see happening. Gangsters finishing people off, but instead they sent him to jail where he meets Vikumathre which seems like damn convenient and all of that. So that part of the thing where he feels more like, you know, this village idiot who is just responding and not thinking, who suddenly becomes his master strategist in the later part of the film, didn't kind of make sense to me, but which is not taking away. I mean, I think I'm really quibbling over one tiny aspect. There's so much about the film that is delightful and pathbreaking and all of that. So to go further on that now, tell me about what was the influence of Sathya? We've seen why Sathya comes at this moment in time. And one influence certainly is that these incredibly talented people work on the film and even are sort of part of the extended ecosystem of the film. Like you talk about how, you know, Sriram Raghavan and Tigmanshu Dhulia, when they see the film for the first time at the premiere, and they're going back in the taxi, and they're both just sitting in silence, just taking it in what a powerful film this is. And of course, we know what kind of films those two went on to make. So tell me a bit about the influence of Sathya on what came later. And does it then justify, you know, the great man theory, we can call it the great film theory here that had it not been for Sathya, the industry would"

        "message": "have gone in a very different direction. I think that claim can be made for a bunch of reasons. The change or the changes really took maybe a couple of years to start appearing in and they were a lot of them were hidden, which was why couldn't directly attribute them as easily to Sathya as say, one could to something like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. In whatever changes that film brought, and one could argue that that is even more than Sathya, you could see on the surface, their entire plot lines picked up, entire types of characters picked up, look picked up. And you can see that till this day, with Sathya things were a little more at a foundational level, I feel for Hindi film. One was its legacy in terms of just the people who worked on it, what they went out and did after that. Vishal Bhardwaj making his films, Anurag Kashyap making his films, Apoorva Srani, Shahid and Aligarh, which went on to win a national award and Sourabh Shukla is I think one of the best character actors and definitely one of the most underrated character actors in the past 20 years. And Shefali Shah went on to do great things. Sandeep Chautha had a very flourishing career for a decade after that. Just the list just goes on. Secondly, you could trace the new Hindi or the new Hindi Indie film movement back to Sathya, I think with maybe a few more films that came around around that time. But Sathya definitely had an influence on it, not only in terms of showing that a specific sort of film, not pandering to a very large audience, but again, not an art film, could find success and could find cultural resonance. And I think that was picked up by people in the 2000s when they started making their own films, younger filmmakers who came in, even though their films may not have looked like Sathya, I think they took its lessons forward. They took its idea of casting forward. I think the influence of Sathya on Hindi film casting has been immense. You speak to a lot of casting directors and they will mention Sathya, specifically Manoj Bajpayee, Bhiku Matre, but also just the idea of the ensemble in that film as something that really brought that idea of a talented group of young actors and not any stars to the forefront, where it was just not common in anything like mainstream Hindi cinema at least. You would see it in your parallel films, something like a Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, but even in Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, the people were quite well known at that time, whereas in Sathya, nobody was known except for Paresh Rawal and Urmila at that time. That idea of an ensemble where people are cast for particular parts and where each part sort of manages to spark and have its little moment, you start seeing pretty early on in the 2000s and in Teghmanshu Dhulia's films, in Hasil, you can see that where Irrfan is surrounded by all these people and they're all fantastic little parts, brilliant, and you can even see it in more mainstream, the first Munna Bhai film, I think it had a beautiful ensemble and going on through the decade then all the way through to Aankho Dekhi and the kind of films that came after that in the new middle cinema, really have this idea of the ensemble and very specific casting that is continued till this day. Apart from that, Sathya really made space for a particular kind of character actor. It wasn't like they didn't exist before, but you really had a lot of character actors coming through in the 2000s and most of them, if not all, do credit Sathya with changing something in the idea of the public and in terms of and for producers and directors also as to the kind of faces they want, the kind of actors that they want in their things. If you look at Irrfan and Nawaz, of course, breakthrough in the 2000s, but you also have KK Menon and then you have Piyush Mishra and then later they're joined by Seema Pawar, Sheeba Chadda, Sanjay Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi and so on and on and on and on and now and Rajkumar Rao and it's just gone on from there and you have this flowering of character actors to the point where now they are no longer seen as character actors and they're carrying their own films simply because they were so convincing in those parts and they stole films from the people"

        "message": "who were the stars. So, you know, I'll leave it to listeners to kind of read your book and go through the rest of your narrative. There's so much detail and nuance in there. I'll end with like three final questions, which often becomes more than three because I think of stuff along the way. But my third last question is really about, you know, the interesting observation you made that while you were talking to people about this film, their memories conflicted so much with each other. Like nobody seemed to remember the same event in the same way. Like you point out about the, you know, the voiceover at the start of the film, where it's basically all you could figure out is which two people did not write it. But otherwise, there are different stories about everybody basically having written it from Ramu to Manoj to Saurabh to so on and so on, all of that. Obviously, nobody is lying. So, you know, because why would they do that? And this leads me to kind of thinking about the nature of memory itself, why we remember the things we do and how that evolves. Like one almost cliche on my show, because it's an observation that struck me so much that I keep making it from time to time is how the way memory works is when we remember an incident for the first time, we remember what happened. But after that, we remember the remembering of it. And therefore, you can have a kind of Chinese whispers in your brain. And you and I might remember something slightly differently to begin with. But that difference magnifies and becomes a whole new thing if you ask us 10 years later. So what's your sense? Like is this something that took you by surprise? Like what is happening? Why are they telling me different things? Should I look at their motives? Is somebody lying? And obviously, I think the most simple explanation is that no one is lying. Everyone's saying it as they remember it, but they remember it so differently. So what have your thoughts been while, you know, going through this process?"

        "message": "It completely took me by surprise. And it's not that long ago. I mean, it's 20 years, but books have been written about films that are 40 years older. And I think if people can remember that, then you'd think that events would be generally fresher for Satya, but apparently not. I was, in equal parts, very frustrated and quite amused by it. It was very funny. Like as you mentioned, the opening voiceover is attributed as people literally saying that no, that guy wrote it and no one is even claiming it. But everyone's pointing to a different person. But it's even weirder with something like the killing of Gulshan Kumar, which should be a very big event in these people's memory, considering they were working on a gangster film at that time, they should be able to remember where they were, what they were doing, maybe how many days into the shoot. They were nothing, all different, everything different. Even Ramu gave me two different versions of how he heard the news. So it was just incredible to me how much they mismatched. So it was a bit of a challenge for me to try and figure out which were the correct versions or which were the ones that they had sort of told themselves, which couldn't possibly be the truth, but which just sounded like a good story. And there's, I mean, there's a lot of value in a good story. I'll give you an example. There's a, there's a Anurag Kashyap blog, which he had done maybe 10 years back in which he had talked about Goli Mar Bheje Mein and he said that the song wasn't written then. So they were all dancing to Mera Piya Ghar Aaya on the set. And that seemed to me not correct, but I spoke to Anurag fairly early on in the thing. So I didn't have any fun to contradict him. So when I spoke to Vishal later, I asked him that is this thing, you know, he's like Anurag is talking rubbish. The song was very much composed and you can see them lip syncing the words in the song, which is what I had noticed before. But I was wondering whether it's just it, my eyes were playing tricks on me or something like that. So there are some stories which could be debunked a little easier. And there were some where I just had to choose the ones that seemed closest to the truth or present two different versions and tell the reader to just choose whichever one they wanted. Or eight different versions as the case"

Has it, you know, improved your workflow, you know, just your work ethic and the way you gather knowledge together and compile it, you know, because, you know, just writing a book instead of writing a piece would have required far greater rigor and that could just change your methods completely.

But I will say that it's brought a lot of respect about the filmmaking process and how much can come up through chance and also how much is actually dictated by what people plan and how these two things combine. And it's very difficult to sort of guess what will come out even if you are a talented bunch of people and you have some idea of what you're doing. And it is interesting that I, as my job is to sit in judgment of a lot of these films. And just to me, it was revealing to know that a lot of the time you're not quite sure about what you're doing as a filmmaker, as a cast or crew member while you're in it, and you are just conspiring to try and achieve something without really being able to control it to an exact degree. And that, I think, has informed my writing recently a little bit, just a little bit of respect for that process. In a more specific sense, I think 80s commercial film was something that I looked on with not much interest and a bit of contempt. And I think I had a renewed appreciation for a lot of that through this book, simply because that was the decade that gangster film started getting solidified. So I had to look at it with some seriousness. And I saw a lot of things that I wouldn't have seen, I think, if I wasn't looking at it through that lens and that sort of feeling that the 80s was a graveyard of Hindi cinema. I feel I have grown out of that now. I think it's now I think it's a very fascinating decade."

And I'll link your blog from the show notes as well, where you have some amazing pieces. And you know, maybe next time we can talk a bit more in detail in general about cinema. But right now, what I'll ask you to do is recommend Indian films, which you feel are underappreciated and people may not have seen, which are available to see ideally on YouTube. So not like Akhri Khat, which is not available anywhere, but which you know, the moment the listener hears the name, she can just go and watch it right away. So I know that I'm you know, I didn't give you time to prepare for this. So just 2345, whatever films that you strongly feel that hey, everyone should watch this that I was so surprised by this.

So I'll give a mixture of a couple of city films and a couple of gangster or semi gangster films, which I discovered through the writing of this. There is a Shammi Kapoor film called Chinatown, directed by Shakti Samant, which I think is the purest early gangster film of the lot. It's a black and white film. It's actually the plot of Dawn, some two decades before Dawn, where Shammi Kapoor plays a double role of a gangster, and this musician was sent to impersonate him so that the police can nab his crew. And it's fantastic. It's a bit of a comedy thriller thing. And a lot of the gangster tropes from the Hollywood films of the 1930s, 40s are there in it. It's a fascinating film, and you'll find it online in a decent print on, I think on YouTube, so you can see that. The next one is a city film. It's called 27 Down. It is the only film directed by Avtaar Krishna Kaul, who died very young. And this was the one film that he made. It's a fantastic look at this young man who wants to have a more artistic life, but because he has a slightly domineering father and he needs money in Bombay, he takes this job as a ticket guy on a railway. And it's a beautiful look at Bombay's trains. And it has this slight feel of a new wave film, but also just a very beautiful look at late 70s Bombay. And beautiful photography, again, black and white by A.K. Bir, and it should be available online. There were a couple of very nice prints floating around. I would recommend anyone who hasn't seen Arvind Desai Ki Aajeeb Daastan to check that out, because it's Saeed Mirza's first film, if I'm not mistaken. And it's quite an unusual film in the vitriolic nature of it. We don't quite make these films with such disaffected protagonists and such sheer contempt for our cities and all our institutions. So I think that might be very interesting. And you should, if you've seen Taxi Driver, you'll see a lot of parallels with that. So anyone who's seen Taxi Driver and likes it might want to see what happened two years later when this film was made. The last film I'll mention is this gangster cop film with Arshad Warsi called Seher. A very lovely film set in Lucknow. One of the examples of the gangster film slash cop film moving out of Mumbai, which it did very successfully in the mid 2000s, and then continued to do so through Wasseypur and till the current day, Mirzapur and stuff. Excellent, very tight, economical film and a very good example of how the genre became very professional and very rich just a couple of years after Satya. And yeah, I think that's about it. Thanks for these recommendations. Now I know"
