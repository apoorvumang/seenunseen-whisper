You can use cinema for entertainment and escapism, and you can also use it as we use all great art, to understand the world and our own selves better. Any true film lover will do both of these, often at the same time. And maybe as time passes and you grow older, you can map out your life and the person you are through the films that you have loved. And for a film lover to talk to other film lovers, there are few joys greater than that. This episode is about exactly that, as I got two close friends who are also cinema buffs to have a chat about movies. Now, I know that these days, authorities scan conversations for keywords and haul people off to jail if there's any suspicious language, regardless of context. But I can't help saying this.

These two guys both love cinema and also know a lot about it. And I thought I'd get them together to chat about films, the great films of the past that we miss out on because of the recency effect, how Indian cinema has developed over the years, how we watch movies as film lovers, how films have changed us, and so on. We also recommend many, many, many good films for you to watch. So you could think of this as an unstructured kind of film appreciation course. But before we talk cinema, let's talk money.

Currently, it seems Djokovic is a strong bet. Well, during 2003 to 2008, it was Roger Federer and Serena Williams. In the 90s, it was Steffi Graf. If you have to bet, you generally bet on the best. And the best are the folks who win consistently. Businesses are the same. A business with strong growth tends to keep growing. And this growth can often last several quarters or years. Stock prices behave even more similarly. A company whose stock price is accelerating or building momentum is often a company whose business is doing well too. What goes up continues to go up until it doesn't. Just like Federer met Natal and those wins became rarer. What if you only held a stock when it was in form? You moved on mercilessly when it stopped performing and were still okay to come back if and when it started up again. This is the crux of momentum investing. Buy stocks in momentum, stick with the winners, prune your losers and be vigilant about when they swap places. This isn't a new discovery. It's been studied and documented for decades. For everyone who says the market is efficient and that all information is priced in, research has shown that momentum is a well-documented anomaly. A portfolio of high momentum stocks has a strong chance of outperforming the broader market over time. Opportunities don't only lie when prices are low. Sometimes they emerge when prices are uncomfortably high too. I'm Deepak Shannoi, CEO at Capital Mind. In our portfolio management service, we have built portfolios using momentum as one of our core strategies. Talk to us and we'll tell you more about such counterintuitive but effective strategies.

You, you played cricket, you followed cricket and every single, you know, opportunity that you got to watch a film or see the straight run Do Darshan channel and watch those TV serials you did. And do not just watch them, at least in my case, I literally not literally, but I really drank them, you know, in the sense that every single scene, every single dialogue was, has been permanently etched. I often have this sort of, you know, bet with someone that I can pretty much sing every single 80s jingle fully in Hindi or English. Watch him run, watch him play. He's a winner all the way.

        "message": "I mean, yeah, the TV serials, their songs, so on and so forth. But so yeah, so there was a, I think, just the absolute lack of any other avenue to sort of, you know, engage yourself. But I think that was the case for most other kids also. But in my case, I guess it just became somewhat more intense than others, because I think a lot of us, you know, who have been on your shows as well are introverts. So you create your own sort of universe and you stay in it, you, you think about it, you, you know, play it back in your mind. Were you a daydreamer? Lots, actually, quite a bit. I mean, all kinds of imaginary friends in my head. And that took a long time to go. They were there for a long, long period of time. So yeah, and then the other thing was that my father was also into films. So in our home, the idea that you would watch a film had no sort of, you know, stigma kind of thing attached to it, which oftentimes I saw in my, you know, other friends, their parents would, you know, comment on it. But in our house, you know, you watch as many films as you want. And it used to be an event if there was a film on Doordarshan, like my father would start telling us the previous day that tomorrow, you know, there is, there is Kashmir Ki Kali, he would start giving us that, you know, where was he in 1964, when he watched that film, you know, then this song will come. And when the movie will start playing, the minute he hears the first train of the music, he'll say, now this is the song. And, you know, as a kid, all of those things seemed magic. In fact, the one thing that my father did, which I genuinely thought was magic, and therefore, then I sort of worked on it was, he, I mean, we would play the radio. And that guy will, you know, the announcer will say that, Abhi bhai, suniye film Mughal-e-Azam ka, Nata Mangeshkar ka gaana, Sangeetkar Naushad, and whatever Geetkar hai, Shakeel. And my father will say, Khuda Nige Bahan Ho Tumhara. And then the song will come. How did this guy know? By the time I was 12, I was beating my father in that game. So because it just became an obsession. So yeah, so I mean, just to, you know, go back, I mean, since it was a small town, we barely had any exposure to Hollywood. And you know, the whole Bollywood scene was initially, you watch whatever came in the cinema hall, there was only one cinema hall. But I possibly, you know, this is like genuine cinema Paradiso thing. Main wahan hota tha, projectionist uncle hote the, hamara kaam chalta tha. But then the video revolution also happened. And then this, you know, this 25 rupees main you rent out the video recording, that player for a day. And then the idea was, how do you maximize because that's, you know, economics, fixed cost of use pe kitna variable chala sakte ho. So then we would get six or eight cassettes. And then you know that you want to watch two, the other six were tukka, whatever was there in that guy's, in that library, right, you just picked up and you started watching them. So this continued till about when I was in school. And I think I can safely say that everything that was there to be shown on Doordarshan, Hindi, English, Malayalam, all regional languages, Saturday afternoon, I used to just watch every single one of them, any film related programs, you know, baato baato mein, this has been Handa's program and this Tabassum's phool khile hain gulshan gulshan and just, you know, watch every single one of them and just store it in your head. A few things happened then, one was the video, library wala possibly saw the, you know, initial change in taste of the people there. And he started stocking up some, you know, Hollywood films. So, Indiana Jones was one of those early ones, which was when I first realized ki kuch hai, there is something very different about these films and he had some, the usual Superman, the original, which as kids we all enjoyed. And then, and then by the time we were 14 or so, we were interested in other kind of cassettes as well. And so then that guy would give us one of the two, right, he would either give us some horror film. And I don't know if you know this, this, I mean, Evil Dead, as a film has been seen by every single guy in chota kasbah of India in the late 80s, early 90s, because the video cassette of Evil Dead was possibly the most most sort of ripped and copied video cassette of all times. Baad mein pata chala ki wo Sam Raimi ne banaya hai. And much later I watched it again. And I realized, maybe the craft is good. I mean, it's quite a quite a good film. But anyway, so either we were watching crazy horror shit, which none of us had any idea whether it's good or bad. So, you know, Evil Dead and this whole early graven filmography or carpenter filmography, some random, I mean, sometimes there's not even be full films. And we would just watch some parts of it and then the cassette would get stuck or something would happen. And then the Doordarshan, you know, also started showing on these Friday evenings, after 10pm films. And because I was a somewhat of a decent student, my parents thought that if he's sitting alone, and you know, after dinner, he must be studying, which I was most of the days, but Friday, I would turn on the TV, put the volume to zero and watch those Friday night Doordarshan English films. They were a mixed bag. I mean, some of those were really good films. Somewhere like she'll be wearing pink pajamas or something. So the return was variable. But I got whatever my teenage, you know, hormonal wants were, they were getting satisfied as part of that. So that that was how it went on till about 17. At 17, I went to engineering college, which was this complete disaster in terms of you know, liking, getting to see things etc. So all that I did in engineering college was watch the standard Bollywood fare. And then occasionally, you would get some video cassettes again the same way and watch some of those films. But thankfully, since it was a bit a bit of a bigger town, there used to be some like big releases, you know, The Fugitive or something, those kind of movies would come in the bodyguard in the mid 90s, early 90s etc. But then in one of those years, I went to Kolkata for my summer training. And I did that at, you know, one of those MNC plants in Calcutta. And since I was always interested in it, people told me that you must go to this place called Nandan. And I didn't have a clue about Nandan then, but then I went to Nandan and I realized this is like, you know, the cultural hub of Kolkata of a certain kind of a certain Badralok variety. And Nandan had then three halls, the two larger ones and one small, just about 40 seater. And the 40 seater would play like great films all the time. And so that those two months, I think I did, I watched all kinds of things. Mind you, in this during the same time, because of the sort of the desert that the engineering college was, I had gotten myself a membership of the local Max Muller Bhavan. That engineering college was in a town that had a steel plant that had a German partnership. You know, Nehru had done all these partnerships, each steel plant had some was German, some was Brit, some was Russian, something else or some other thing. And so I had told my one of my profs that please give me that membership. He was like, why would you want a Max Muller? Have you come here to do engineering or have you come to Max Muller Bhavan to study? I said, forgive me, give it to me. So I was reading quite indiscriminately, all kinds of stuff. So I would go into the library, no idea, there was no internet or anything to guide your taste. I was decent at quizzing. So I knew some famous books. So if I saw a famous book, I'd pick it up. Otherwise, it was like Milan Kundera. Genuinely, I thought he was an Indian author. So I picked up the first one. First thing I remember is I read The Unbearable Lightness of Being. I was not like you, Amit, who was reading the whole of Shakespeare canon by the time he was 10. But I was reading Kundera in 18. And then when I finished all Kundera, then some one day I saw Antichrist. So I thought maybe this is also a good book. It looked well-thumbed. I don't know who was reading. Some German expats were reading him, I guess, in that place. So I picked those things up. So I did the same thing in Kolkata. Kuch bhi aara tha, dekh liya. And that's where I think I saw some, I mean, I didn't know what, why they were looking different or appearing different, but I knew something intense was happening on the screen. I mean, I remember watching, you know, 400 Blows. And I realized yeh kuch toh hai boss. Something is there. And I mean, the usual thing was happening. It was some summer kind of fest and they were just playing French New Wave and some Italian New Wave and all of those stuff. Pasolini. And so I watched a few of those. Sodor and whatever. 120 Days. Then I came back. The usual life continued. But that got became a bit of a thing that I'm missing out on something. Something big is there out there. So every couple of months I would make the Kolkata trip. It was like about six or seven hours in train. And watch whatever was playing in the cinema hall. And Kolkata did have reasonably good, you know, new films coming in there. And then spend time in, in Nandan. And that sort of whetted my appetite quite a bit. By the time I left it, and then I did my postgrad in Kolkata itself. So that became a good sort of a place to do all of this. And then after postgrad, as luck would have it, I had a job that took me all over the world for the first 10 years. That I just completely sated myself. What also had happened one big thing that people often don't realize. The, you know, these cable wala started showing TCM in India. Again, you know, I don't know why they don't do it now in India. That thing just ran for some seven, eight years."

There is an app but you can't pay in India because that app is not available in India. There is a hack around it. I will tell you some other time. So, TCM used to just all the time, show you, you know, the great films of the 30s, 40s and the 50s. And it was available. So that plus the, I mean, I used to be at least 20 or 25 weeks outside of India. And as luck would have it, a lot of it in Europe. And as luck would have it for a long time in places like Poland and Czech Republic and in Poland in a place called Woods, L-O-D-Z, it's called but it has one of the great film schools of Eastern Europe. In fact, all the great Polish filmmakers actually studied or taught at the Woods Filmmaking School, Andrzej Wajda and all of these guys. But you go in the afternoon, you can just, you know, spend your time watching films peacefully. I mean, it was like a completely different world. So those seven, eight years where, when I sort of just watched whatever came my way. And then, you know, when I would be in the US, you know, two weeks in the US, I, my, kaam khatam hua, 6.30 get back, watch some of those US late evening television stuff, which was all great fun. I mean, all these light show and, you know, David Letterman stuff. And then around 8.30 or 9, turn on one of those film channels. And there were like six, seven of them and at any time, something good would be coming. So the one great passion of mine during that time was, I just got caught into these, you know, this American 70s kind of one pack of filmmakers, who I think are still somewhat underrated. I mean, you know, we talk of all of these 60s and 50s guys, but these guys are great, are great still. And that was staple HBO or whatever that free to air channels fair. I mean, they used to put one or the other one that time. So yeah, so that by the time, you know, by, by the time I was like, mid 30s, the combination of reading all kinds of stuff and watching all kinds of stuff and connecting the two had kind of made me what I am I mean, in the sense that, you know, I used to do my work, but you know, I, I was in a place where, you know, all of these things were coming together. And I always had this great interest in connecting it more than just watching one film or a book or what, you know, just by on its own. And there is a way to appreciate it on its own as well. My, the great fun I used to have was in sort of finding somewhat strained linkages at times. But it was good fun to find those linkages. And yeah, great memories of those days. I mean, being in New York, going to East Village, there is a Korean video store, very famous. I don't know if you shut down now. If you go there, you will, I mean, just the best of world cinema would be there for you to buy. And I remember actually meeting Spike Lee there, who was shocked to know that somebody in India watches this film. It was"

Borges once made a map of the world, wrote a story about a map of the world, which was as big as the world itself, you know, and I think the best stories can actually be longer than what their story is about. Because, like, it's not good. By the way, that Shakespeare Tana just reflected on that. I did read all of Shakespeare at 10. But my favorite play of Shakespeare was Titus Andronicus. So it is clear that I did not read with much discernment. But when the TK exciting story I want to take off on something you said, which intrigued me a lot and ask kind of both of you about that. You mentioned that, you know, your father would watch all of these films, and they had a lot of watch that song while I show and it had a lot of resonance with him and he'd be able to name the song before it came just from who the playback singer is and all that. And you could also do that by 12. And what what I see happening there is that there is obviously a part of your father which is touched by that, which is touched by a particular kind of culture, a particular kind of song. And through that, you are sharing in that. And typically, what happens is men don't share feelings, especially between father and son, especially in a society like India, we're never sharing feelings, you never really know the other person, you're kind of imprisoned in your respective roles and the grooves that you've gotten into. And I'm just thinking aloud here. But when you said that, it seemed that that is a very interesting way to get to know somebody else, especially in this particular kind of relationship, through a particular kind of art, like I think my father also, until the end wasn't really communicative. But I could get glimpses of his by the kind of things he wanted to read in his last days. He'd asked me to, you know, he shared my Amazon account. So he asked me to buy some Stefan Zwick for him on the Kindle, which I did. And then I started reading Zwick myself and all I had read of Stefan Zwick before that was the Royal Game, which was about chess and all that. But then you look at his writings on exile, on feeling not at home where you are, and there is something in that. So, you know, what are sort of your thoughts on this, on how these shared interests between people are not just shared interests, but they are a kind of connection, because you're getting, you're in a sense, when I tell you about a book I really like, I am bearing a part of myself to you and vice versa."

        "message": "Yeah, before I come to that, Amit, I just wanted to say, listening to Subrata, I was just reminded again of how even when the specifics of our lives are different, you know, someone growing up in a small town, someone growing up in Delhi, for instance, but there's something about there's a shared experience when it comes to Indians of a particular generation, going through this journey of the 1980s. So much of what you said was just instantly relatable, even though, you know, the specifics of my life may have been different. You know what you said about the horror films. Today, I think of myself as someone who's, you know, at risk of sounding pompous, something of an authority on horror cinema. It's something that I've been very interested in, you know, going back to the 1910s, 1920s, all sorts of horror films. But listening to Subrata, I was actually reminded that one of my entry points into horror cinema was for base reasons, which is for the potentially salacious content, because as you know, in the 1980s, certain sorts of horror films were among mainstream films that were somewhat available at video parlours. They were the ones where you had the most chance of seeing nudity, for instance. You know, you have the classic 1980s American cliche of the coeds making out before the monster comes for them, you know, and the whole moralistic thing, the evil dead, the Friday the 13th series and so on. So I was reminded of that. And of course, what you said about the Friday night films and what you said about the regional language, the non Hindi language films that would play on Sunday. There's so much shared experience there. To come to what you said just now, Amit, I was also, it's true, obviously, you know, the way in which we get to know other people through these shared tastes. And in fact, since you mentioned parents and since you mentioned a father specifically, I was also reminded that I had quite a problematic relationship with my father in the sense that my parents were divorced when I was 9 or 10. My father had a history of substance abuse, there was domestic violence, etc. It wasn't a very happy situation. And then he passed away a few years ago, and again, in very sad circumstances. And there's a lot of regret that I have whenever it comes to him not being able to bond with him or talk with him. Yet one of the fondest and gentlest memories that I have vis-a-vis my father, which is also something that's a reminder that there was a point in his life, at least when things were relatively normal, when he was interested in the same things that I would independently become interested in later. When I was 16, on my birthday, he gifted me an old book of his, which was actually a book of his dating back to the early 70s. It's Garson Cannon's book on Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Tracy and Hepburn. It's a very personal book on Tracy and Hepburn written by one of their closest friends. So it's a warm, affectionate, up-close look at these two great stars. And my father, when he was fairly young, just in his early, when he was around 20, 21, he bought the book and he had it with him. He gifted it to me more than 20 years later. And I still have it with me. He has a very nice dedication on it. And it strikes me that I never actually sat with him and discussed old films with him. That never really happened. But this did provide me a window into the things that he might have been interested in as well. And of course, with my mother, it was a different relationship. It was a much, much closer, much more long lasting relationship. Some of my movie love came from her. She was a very egalitarian viewer. She never really had highbrow taste, but she was into all sorts of films in the 90s, which was supposedly such a bad time for mainstream Hindi cinema. She would be sitting and watching video cassettes of everything and refusing to even fast forward the songs, which is something that everybody did back then because the songs were so lousy and you just felt like you deluded yourself that the rest of the film is worthwhile, but fast forward the song. She would insist on the song being played all the way through no matter how tuneless it was. So that, of course, also played a part. At the same time, she also from her South Bombay childhood, she had memories of Hollywood films of an earlier of another era, which were perhaps more sophisticated films. So that did come down to me a bit. But yeah, what you say about the shared experiences is obviously completely true."

        "message": "I mean, just on that book, Hebburn and Tracy book, they never married. Tracy was still, you know, he had, he was married and he never, but, you know, and Tracy was, I mean, he was really ill in his last days. And, you know, it's an industrial lore as to how Hebburn took care of him in the last few years. And again, these are things that, these are things that have picked up just watching some random documentary in some evening or somewhere. I mean, it's just amazing how many things you pick up if you just are interested in films about, you know, about just the people and the characters. But going back, you know, the interesting thing is my on, you know, about father and shared interests and things of that kind. I mean, there is always this part of you that wants to prove, you know, to your father that you are, you are good, right? And you're good in the things that he values, right? So, that obviously, so this was not the rebel phase. This was the early phase when, you know, you would like to show to him that you are, you are really a good guy. And so I was, I was interested in doing that. But quite honestly, somewhere the thing also changed where I really started liking that stuff. And I often, I mean, I have this arguments and sometimes written about it as to run that podcast, I have mentioned this a few times, you can, you can, you know, point to, you know, the 40s and the 50s and the 60s of Hindi cinema. And Hindi cinema is what I'm more comfortable with. I've seen some of the other language cinemas during that time. And some of that might be true, might hold true for them as well. Maybe the story might not be sometimes great, the acting could be a bit hammy and theatrical. But when it comes to music, for that 20-25 years, I mean, I've with reasonable amount of objectivity now that I've heard a lot of the, you know, just the Hollywood musical golden age of 50s and 60s. And then listen to, you know, the other songs, the other stuff. I think this was second to none, you know, just the idea of the composer coming up with those tunes, the lyric being written in a way that is both relevant to that script, but on its own great poetry. Some of the best singers, I don't think the three have come together so well. At any time, I mean, there might be just a few similar phases, maybe some late, you know, 19th century France and maybe Hollywood, you know, the golden age of Hollywood musicals. But I mean, it's very difficult to find that kind of coming together of talent and just the quality of that output. And I don't think people fully appreciate now in India, what was that phase like? And I guess it will take maybe another 100 years later, we'll just be wondering how did this happen. And for at least me, I was deeply invested in it. And it's almost like now it's, I mean, every day I just go deeper into it. So I'm never bored of it. You know, it's on a standalone basis. Even when I was a child, I realized this was something really good. And that often I realized also it was something precious, because I could compare it with what I was listening to then, which was sort of prevalent in the Ganesh Pooja pendals of where I was growing up. You know, and I realized that was we've lost something precious, but whatever this was, this is really, really good stuff. And that realization was, maybe my father stoked it. Maybe in order to impress, I continued to sort of invest time on it. But once I was out of it, and just on a standalone basis, I just became completely obsessed with it. And that obsession continues. I mean, I, I've not gone back and watched a lot of old Hindi films, a second or a third time, a few I have. But songs every morning, I mean, I start my day with, after the initial Bheem Sen Joshi and Mallika Arjun Mansoor and Kumar Gandha, that's like for about 20 minutes, my first port of call is Ratha. So I, you know, so yeah, so my father led me into that. And then, you know, I'm always grateful that I discovered something that has given a lot of comfort in some sense meaning to my life from there on. I mean, it's, like I said, it's an OSS in my life, if everything else is going wrong, that thing in the morning, just puts everything into perspective that no matter how things are, how bad they are, this will always stay with me and this appreciation of what is what I'm hearing will always stay with me."

Subrata, you of course, are talking more about the audio experience, you know, the combination of the song, the lyric, the quality of the singing, the composition and so on. There's that other dimension to it, which is not consistently there, but certainly in the films of some directors like Vijay Anand, Guru Dutt, Raj Kapoor to some degree, Bimal Roy, the visualization. And of course, we all know that there are many instances in old Hindi cinema of a great song not being brought well to the screen, you know, there's a lip syncing is a bit off, the actors gestures are a bit off, the editing is less than perfect. But, you know, there's so many other cases in the films of the filmmakers I mentioned, where there's so much attention to detail that's gone into how the thing appears on the screen, you know, in films like Guide, for instance, or Kagaz Ke Phool or there are many other films, some of Rishikesh Mukherjee's work as well, some of the later work and it's really quite a remarkable achievement to have all that brought together so well, especially given the conditions in which many of these films were made, where music was composed separately, the lyrics were written separately, very often, in some cases, musical sequences were shot by the assistant director, rather than the main director. This wasn't the case for people like Guru Dutt and Vijay Anand and Rishikesh Mukherjee, but it was the case sometimes. So that really, and I'm speaking now as someone who has to admit to having come a bit late to that particular world. It really, it was fairly late in life that I really rediscovered or properly discovered the Hindi cinema of the 50s, 60s, found myself sufficiently immersed in it, despite the many little flaws or little or big flaws that you pointed out, you know, the awkwardness, the tonal unevenness of many of those films, the formulaic nature of some of them. But the good stuff, you know, it's fairly late in life, it's just swept over me. And that's also one reason why I ended up doing this book on Rishikesh Mukherjee, because it just came from a place where I had suddenly in my 30s, I said, Wow, okay, I've discovered this world. And there was a time when I used to think of cinema only in terms of good cinema only in terms of the Goddards and the felonies and that sort of thing. And suddenly, this is a new language that I'm rediscovering and finding warmth and something really stimulating in it as well."

        "message": "Yeah, so I mean, you know, since we are talking about this, sometimes I, you know, mention this just to give people a bit of context about some of these people and some of these names and maybe later they became caricatures of their own, sort of what they were doing. So for instance, take Raj Kapoor. By the time he was 25, he was running a studio, he was a producer, he was a director, he got some of the best talents together, you know, Shankar, Jai Kishan, Hasrat, Shailendra, Lata, Mukesh, K. A. Abbas, for writing scripts, Ramanand Sagar was his assistant, of course, he went on to make Ramayana with those arrows flying from one end to the other, and one of them disappearing and much to the surprise of Lakshman. I mean, this entire Kedar Sharma, there were a whole lot of people that he brought together when he was 25. I mean, he was just leader of men, women, whatever you might call it. And then he was asking them to, I mean, those initial films, I mean, you know, Aag is a little uneven. I mean, it's still a very powerful story, and very different story. I mean, it's a story of three different women, one of who has actually had, and he kind of repeated the story later in Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram. But you take Awara, you take Shree Charasubis, these are just almost like, you know, for a 27 year old, for a 28 year old to be producer, director, then do all of these things together, and bring that story to light. And these are not like just domestic successes. I mean, Awara was just an international, global hit. I mean, even when you go now to Greece, you know, forget the Eastern Europe, that is of course, a well documented story. There's just fans of Nargis and fans of Awara. But just to point one particular, and sometimes people fully, I mean, don't appreciate this. So just take Shree Charasubis, right? There's Shree Charasubis, I mean, for those who have not seen the film, is a classic story of a guy coming from a village, comes to big bad, bad Bombay. He's a, you know, he's a simpleton, but he's a guy who sort of, you know, he knows the ways of the world, very quickly gets to sort of appreciate it, falls in love with a girl in the Juggi, who's Nargis. So this is Raj Kapoor who comes in. And then of course, is really a deft hand at cards. And so, you know, he starts playing that Amit. And after some time, you know, gets sort of drawn into this, you know, people who, you know, who are rich, but also who are, you know, doing all kinds of nefarious stuff. And then he there is a pivotal moment in the film, right, where he's taken Nargis to a party because he's been invited and this is all the rich and the famous of Bombay. This is a short, almost a replica of the Taj Palace possibly in the RK studio in Chembur. And there is Nadira, who's in some sense, you know, the other sort of love interest who's, you know, she has that long, thin cigarette holder, and she's smoking that and you know, all of that. And then Nargis feels uncomfortable and there are some, you know, remarks made and she decides to leave in the middle of the party. And then Raj Kapoor follows her trying to, you know, call her back. And that's when Nadira sings Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh, right? She's essentially don't look back. If you see that whole picturization, so what happens is she says Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh and then gradually after the first stanza, you can see that Raj Kapoor has realized there's no point following Nargis now. And this place is glitz and glamour and all of this is great. I mean, and you know, I have sort of arrived, why should I go back? And then not just he sort of, you know, he realizes this, he decides that he will accept this, right? And then he joins in the song. I mean, so far it was just Asha singing for Nadira, Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh, right? Now, Raj Kapoor joins in as Mandade and he, there are two stanzas that he sings, right? One of them is Naino Ke Saath, sorry, Mausam Ke Saath Jo Badalta Jaye, Jo Iske Saanche Mein Hi Dhalta Jaye, Duniya Usi Ki Hai Jo Chalta Jaye. Both the stanzas are deep in their meaning that, I mean, you just need to, if you have to be in this game, you have to play the game, you have to modify, change yourself. And that's how you actually win this game. That whole picturization for about seven minutes. You can't get more, you know, better visual sort of storytelling, right? It just captures everything in a nice lyrical format, great song, great dancing, acting, everything together. Very difficult to have so much of information packed. And so much of so many emotions, the change, the, and he was doing it when he was 27, right? He was himself dancing and you should see that the way he changes his, you know, the demeanor changes, his sort of how he behaves changes right after he's decided that, okay, she's gone. Now, let me just plunge into this,"

        "message": "you know, head first. He was also, I think, a wonderful song actor, Raj Kapoor, you know, and now someone like someone like Raj Kapoor is very easy to sort of think of in caricature terms today, you know, today, a lot of the cinema is just unfashionable today for many, for many young viewers, but even people of our age who are sort of perhaps a little more intuitively drawn towards restrained, subdued forms of storytelling rather than the melodramatic or the hyper dramatic forms, you know, you look at someone like Raj Kapoor or an actor of that vintage, you just, I was watching Barsad the other day on the big screen at the India Habitat Center. Now, I have to say that I really think there was a big quality leap from Barsad to Awara, because Barsad is a film that is difficult even for someone like me to watch. But the number of titters in the hall, you know, young people were just laughing almost throughout the film, at anything that that seemed to them even slightly more dramatic than what they used to. So, you know, then someone like me gets a bit defensive at the same time, even if I can sort of see the point of what's going on. But I maintain that someone like Raj Kapoor, I really feel was a wonderful song actor, which is something that, you know, it's an aspect of acting in Hindi cinema that many people have forgotten about now, because partly also because we've entered an age where there is very little lip syncing that happens, you know, you have the more realistic mode of a song, a very good song maybe playing in the background, there's not lip syncing and so on. And as a result, there was the earlier generations of actors who did this sort of thing well. When you watch the films today, many people look at it and say, oh, they're just singing, dancing. This is not acting. You know, whereas, you know, you look at some of the best of them and they've really thrown themselves into that moment. They are performing the moment as well. Raj Kapoor was one of them. I just wanted to add very quickly, since you said this, though I don't really like facile comparisons, when I watch the best of Raj Kapoor's early work, especially these scenes in Awara and Shree Chaar So Bees, which are visually so striking, you know, scenes like that long dream sequence in Awara, a moment where Prithviraj Kapoor is standing by the window and you have that you have that shadow flitting across that face. It always reminds me of Orson Welles in Hollywood 10 years earlier, and that famous quote where he was given, you know, full freedom almost by RKO to make his first film. And he said, I felt like a boy with this giant toy train set. And when I look at Raj Kapoor's early work, you see that same enthusiasm, where can I put the camera? What can I do with it? What can I do with shadows? What can I do? How can I construct this frame? And I think that's that there's something to be said about that as well, you know, at that age."

        "message": "Lots to double click on. And the first one is kind of this, like when you mentioned that, you know, young people watching that they're laughing because it's so melodramatic, it's so whatever. And that's resonant with me, because once upon a time, I would have been one of those young people, right, I recognized that, that I found a lot of, I mean, my tastes were obviously drawn towards a more minimal, the more restrained I was, in a sense, fortunate enough to be shaped a lot by world cinema. We discussed this in our episode together Jay that I once upon a time, I didn't, I looked down on Bollywood a little bit, which obviously was a sort of terrible attitude. And recently, I was sort of watching Squid Game, right. And I loved Squid Game, but a part of me who kept finding, you know, things to quibble about the way they acted, and you know, it's not kind of from the Western realistic school and all that there's a particular thing happening there. And, and I kept realizing that the quibbler was just getting it all wrong, that, you know, that I should just enjoy it for what it is, and not try to fit it into my perception of what is worthy art. Like I was reading this book called The Immediate Experience, which is a collection of Robert Warshaw's essays, famous critic from back in the day. And, and the title says everything, the immediate experience and Warshaw's whole contention was that, you know, you, you respond in a particular way to a film in the moment. And that response is what matters. You know, baaki sab jo theory lagate hai, jo gyaan bhatte hai, all that is irrelevant. How are you responding to a film in the here and now what is the immediate experience that is what matters and Warshaw, of course, was an enemy of pretentiousness. He never liked to use the term film, he would always say movie, he championed, you know, B movies, action films, which were otherwise ignored by, you know, kind of the mainstream sort of critics. And that struck a chord with me when I think that sometimes when we criticize cinema or criticize literature or whatever, are we overthinking it sometimes, that maybe what really matters is how does it make me feel in that moment, that you know, your father can see a classic film and hear a classic song and feel a particular way. And 30 years later, it can move you in the same way. And that alone tells me that my God, it's achieved something to have that sort of resonance. And after that, if you're going to quibble about ki yaar acting naturalistic nahi thi yaar editing aise ki, yahaan se yeh kiya aisa nahi karna chahiye tha. And I think and it's with age that I've kind of that I kind of recognize this that stop overthinking art. You know, sometimes you just got to sit back and soak it in. So what are sort of your ways of thinking about it? And you know, especially you Jai, you're a professional critic in a manner of speaking, you've made that journey through different kinds of criticism. And we've again discussed some of that journey in our prior episode. So what's your sense of that? Has there been a change in you as well with how you view films and art?"

        "message": "Amit, it's a difficult question. I can see both sides of it. You know, I mean, I, you know, I'd actually like to just go entirely with what you said just now about what about the wash-off position. You know, just let it let the experience sweep over you react honestly to what what you have experienced in the moment and just do that. And I've had some wonderful moments of that sort. Also, you know, I can just give you an example of the top of my head. I'd written a piece about this, you know, where, you know, I was watching Zoya Akhtar's Dil Dhadakne Do, which is and you know, and just and you know, there's this which is which is not really one of the most critically acclaimed films. It's one of those films that people think of as it's a time it's a it's a film about rich people's problems and it's not really gritty in the way that Luck by Chance or Gully Boy is. Honestly speaking, I still think it's my favorite of her films, because it just worked on every level for me and I was I was just watching it and there's Ranveer Singh on the screen just doing so, you know, just just walking around being this spoiled rich brat or whatever and I'm just you know, just interacting with his parents and I just intuitively at one point just lent across to my wife. I was you know, she was next to me and said, you know, I think this guy might be our best actor since since Bachchan, you know, I just said that very spontaneously. And of course, later, I sort of thought about it and said, oh, yeah, you know, this is that was a on the one hand I I get, you know, the value of that instinctive response. But at the same time, there are practical difficulties also, you know, you're say you're you're writing a review that's been written on a three-hour deadline or something, then of course, it makes sense. You're sitting in the hall and you're, you know, you're taking notes there. You're trying to capture the immediacy of your experience. You're very aware that that at some point, you will, you know, you'll be exiting this this dark hall and suddenly the world, the brightly lit world is going to be impinging on you. And then, you know, you will you'll be overthinking, you'll be remembering the film and maybe feeling sheepish about some things that you that you loved while you were watching them. You're aware of that. So you're trying to capture honesty, capture your reactions in the moment, and then write the review as quickly as possible and send it out. But what if you're writing in the form of writing that you have to do is a long form analytical essay with a deadline of three weeks into the future. At some point, you will, I think it's just human nature to to be analyzing a little too much to change your view to say, okay, you know, I sort of had this rush of emotion in the hall, but now I've thought about it a bit and maybe, you know, I don't feel that way anymore. So I can see the value of both positions depending on the sort of piece you're writing or the sort of discussion that you're having about the film. And, you know, I think it's just a practical thing. I think I may have mentioned this in our earlier conversation. But one reason why I always found it difficult, even when I was a much younger, more energetic, more enthusiastic film buff going to film festivals in my 20s. One reason I found it difficult to watch three or four films on the same day was because I needed that time to myself after watching one film, if it stimulated me in a certain way, I would need to go and sit by myself, maybe just make some notes, maybe, you know, get my bearings, articulate to myself or on paper or whatever, what I felt about that film before going in for the next film. Because otherwise, you're watching one film when you're watching another, you're watching a third, coming back home at night and and the immediacy of the experience of the first and the second film are gone. They no longer exist. So it's a difficult question. This is just I probably just rambled on and on. But I think I can see both sides of the way of doing this."

I'm not writing anything. But most of the, I mean, most of how I watch a film is exactly that way. I mean, I, it's just, just experiencing it at the moment, during the moment and enjoying it. And that really, in some sense, also explains some of these things. I mean, like, I just like sort of the big, you know, emotional kind of films. I mean, give me a Casablanca, I'll watch it any number of times. It's just a great film. I mean, you can say that maybe there are better films in 1942 than that. Forget about in the history of Hollywood. But I mean, I, I remember the first time when I saw it and how great it felt. And every time I again watch it, it feels the same way, right. So and the same thing applies to I mean, all of the 80s and the 90s. I mean, they were barren time, they were, they were my time. I watched all of them. Rajiv Rai for the win, any day, right.

I think both things can also go together if you're a professional writer. So, you know, so for instance, I mentioned the Rishikesh Mukherjee thing, you know, my starting point for the Rishikesh Mukherjee book happened when I happened to watch a number of his films close together. And I suddenly felt this thrill of recognising that in films that otherwise didn't really seem to have anything in common in terms of their plots, there were these little thematic, these themes running through the films, which seemed to point to a particular sensibility or a particular director or script writer who was interested in certain themes. And it could be a theme like disguise, pretense, whatever, something like that, in films where the storylines were completely different, maybe made 20 years apart. But so I felt that thrill of that recognition of, you know, that there's a sensibility here and I want to explore the sensibility, maybe write about this director who's made these different works. So that is the immediate thing, the immediate emotional response. But then when you're sitting and working on the book over a period of two or three years, while writing those same things, you're also, you know, perforce, you're just, you know, you are analysing, you're bringing in other things, you know, about other films from similar genres, you're providing that contextual stuff in. So all that also goes in. So the starting point may be the direct, immediate emotional response. But then, as a professional writer, you will also bring in some of the other post facto analysis that will happen."

And, you know, and what you said about film festivals is really is resonant to me in the sense that until COVID happened, my annual vacation was spent in Bombay itself, where the MAMI film festival would happen, and I would go and I would watch four or five films a day or whatever I could, I was an expert at optimising, obviously, and just watch 28-29 films in the week that I could. And I get that, that you don't have the space to sit back and reflect. So it is all visceral, visceral, visceral, you're not really thinking about stuff. But at the same time, I guess, you know, you don't have a choice, you just want to take in as much as you can, because some of the greatest delights are the unexpected ones, something you've never heard of, and it just kind of blows you away. And of course, I think the last couple of years I was, you know, life tweeting, I was putting out a tweet about every film I watched. And that was, in a sense, I realised post facto a way of taking notes for myself also about, you know, what I liked and didn't like that. And I'm just thinking aloud here, I remember this quote by some translator, I've forgotten who I came across this while researching for this episode on translation I did with Aruna Vasana. And the quote was something to the effect of that even the act of writing is an act of translation, because you're taking your thoughts and you're translating them into language. And it strikes me that when you're trying to write about a film or write about anything, you know, where you come out of that experience mode, and you get into describing it or understanding it, it becomes really difficult because it can then be contrived. Like when I think of the great moments in movies, which really moved me at the time, which just had me tearing up immediately, you know, as a young person dead poet society, the last scene, right for those who haven't seen it and enormously affecting for me, those scenes are so powerful, because they just capture the essence of the whole thing. And they hit you in the gut with it. And for me, they are impossible to write about, I can write about other aspects of the craft and, you know, other things here and there. But for me, I can't capture that essential thing, you know, and I understand that part of our job is not just to experience the world, but to write about it. That's what writers do. That's what we all try to do it, you know, differing levels, but it seems incredibly difficult in one person. And you're right, I agree with you that it's possible for both to go together. And to me, my favorite film critic for that reason is Roger Ebert, because you got a sense of both conditions, you got a sense of how a film moved him deeply. And at the same time, you got insight into the craft and, you know, like his writing about Ramin Bairani, for example, when he wrote about the film Goodbye Solo, you know, the review moved me so much that I watched the film and was blown away by it, you know, where he you know, Bairani is getting to the heart of the human condition with that film. And, you know, Ebert's writing about that film, you know, leads you there as well."

And of course, we know her body of work and where it came from and the passion. It's not in doubt at all. But she never kept herself open to revisiting a film and possibly changing her mind about it. That's something that can also be done, right? You can, you might very honestly have a particular emotional experience to a film, watching it the first time, and then 10 years later, you're watching it again and you have a different sort of emotional experience, which might be, you know, it might not be as good as before, or it might be good in a different way or whatever it is, but you feel differently about it. Someone like her did not did not keep herself open to that possibility. And she has been criticized for it by other critics as well, you know, for just closing that. I wanted to ask you, Amit, since you mentioned sometime back that you feel like you've become a little more open to other modes, to the more dramatic or, you know, the other forms of expression that aren't necessarily psychological realism. I remember I'm asking you this because on two or three separate occasions on email lists that we've been on or conversations that we've had, I've seen you put up your list of 10 favorite films. So you know, so I remember the first time I saw this may have been around 15 years ago, and the last time may have been four or five years ago. So you have films like Decalogue in it, you have John Huston's The Dead, which is a film that he astonishingly made in his 80s, from the James Joyce story, In the Bedroom, if I remember right, films like that, films that are mostly, you know, from a certain mode of understated psychological realism. And I remember that I saw two lists that you had made maybe a few years apart that were more or less the same, more or less the same films in them. Do you feel like if you were to make a list today, that there would be you know, you don't have to name the films, but that there would be one or two films that don't fit that particular mode of psychological realism or understatement, something that's louder, brassier, would there be something like that, a film or a web series even?"

        "message": "Devdas by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. In fact, I remember Devdas by Bhansali, Devdas and Parineeta came out around the same time. And I really liked Parineeta as an example of melodrama well done. And Devdas is an example of melodrama overdone. But anyway, I won't elaborate on that. But that's a great question. And it's also a great observation. Because, you know, in the note that I sent you guys in the email, I said, let's talk about five under appreciated film. And that got me to thinking about what are my favorite films today. And I realized the folly of ever having made a list like that, like, of course, we love making lists, 10 films, 10, whatever. And I think when you're a teenager, it's fine. But I think later, I think I mean, I for me, everything contains multitudes in a way that I cannot put rankings, I can no longer, you know, rankings and star ratings and all that just just seem weird to me. And it seems to reduce a film down to a set of qualities which you are then quantifying. If I am to talk about, make a list of films, I would probably do that on the basis of what moved me at the time what I felt like at the time and, you know, not pontificate on greater artistic merits and all of that. And the thing is that my sensibilities are what they are, and my tastes are what they are. So there's no value judgment, I may not have a taste for a particular kind of maximalist expressionistic art or film or whatever. But unlike in the past, I will no longer say that is bad. I will simply say keep matlab mere vibe ka nahi hai, right. So even in terms of literature, for example, I recognize that Salman Rushdie is a great writer that Arundhati Roy writes gorgeous prose, but their writing is, you know, I, my taste is more towards the minimal, which is why, for example, Japanese and Korean authors are much more likely to like them among Indians and like Vikram Seth more than Rushdie, for example. So I think that is where I kind of, I mean, your tastes are what they are, you are who you are. But I can appreciate other stuff and there are things I like now, there is art I like now, which would not fall into that psychological realism sort of domain. Like, for example, I think one of the great novels of all time is Raag Darbari, right. And I love reading Woodhouse as a kid. And those don't easily fall into, you know, those narrow categories. But broadly, I would say that, I mean, I was just about to say, you'll never find a Bhansali film in my top 10. But the point is that Bhansali is a bad melodramatic filmmaker, I'm sure there are good melodramatic filmmakers. So my appreciation of melodrama exists, but not his."

That one, when there was such a perfect confluence of great music, which was not great music, which wasn't appreciated by people, everybody loved it, you know, when there was that confluence of great music, and all of it kind of coming together, the lyrics, the musicians, all of that. One, why did we lose it? Why did it go? Because you'd imagine that even left to pure market forces, that is what is successful, that is what is working. So why would it suddenly go, especially given that today we live in a time where there is scope for diversity, it is not as if the mainstream changes, you're stuck. That's all you have. That's not the case today. You have a, you know, 1000 flowers are blooming all over the place. So one, I mean, I'll ask you two questions, but one at a time, I guess one, why did we, you know, why did it? What are your theories on why that era ended? Why did we lose that?"

        "message": "Yeah. I mean, of course, I mean, one of the good things about life is to sit and theorize on what happened. And I think I've done this conversation with folks a few times in the past. But just one point on Raag Darbari. I don't know many people if they realize that in 86, 87, Doordarshan actually had a TV adaptation of Raag Darbari. And it used to play on Thursday nights at 10 o'clock. With the opening, you know, whatever the title song of just about a minute by Bheem Sen Joshi. Wow, I didn't know this. And the song went, saath sur ke saath rang hai, is duniya mein saath something hai, is ke uske is duniya mein Raag Darbari. It was a beautiful. Yeah. And Alok Nath, fresh from his success as master Haveli Ram of Buniyat. And well before the world knew of his predatory ways. And yeah, well before he became the Sanskari, you know, father, was the Pehelwan. It was a six or eight episodes. But I remember that because I actually saw Raag Darbari before I read Raag Darbari. Oh my God. But was it good? Was the series? Yeah, I distinctly remember watching. I remember watching everything. And I was watching everything. But it clearly left a mark because I realized again ki kuch alag ho raha hai. I'm not processing. I was 10 years old. But I could sense ki haan yeh kuch hai. And I, it stuck in my head that there is a thing called Raag Darbari. And then later the moment I came across, I mean, by the time I was 14 or 15, you know, there used to be this magazine, Hindi magazine called Dharm Yug. It's a legendary magazine. The editor was a guy called Dharmveer Bharti. If we lived in a country that appreciated its own writers well, Dharmveer Bharti would have been in the same league as Hemingway or Faulkner. Because Dharmveer Bharti, before he turned 30, by 1954, had written three of the greatest Hindi novels of all time. He wrote Andha Yog. He wrote Suraj Ka Saatva Ghoda. And he was just, and then he just left, I think, if you remember Sara Rai in your episode, she mentioned that her mother used to be corresponding with Dharmveer Bharti because Dharm Yug used to be a Times of India publication or whatever, now Bharat Times publication. And Dharm Yug used to have some of the best cartoons. I mean, the last page, the best writing on Hindi literature, even really quality writing on cinema. And why did I come to Dharmveer Bharti? I don't know. I've lost the thread on this one. But yeah, so sorry, yeah. So, Srilal Shukla and then, you know, I started reading all these Dharmveer Bharti and you know, all of these guys. And, you know, I realized that there is more here, you know, in terms of just the Indian literature, which again, gave me a lot of satisfaction as I went through that. In fact, some of these things like Suraj Ka Saatva Ghoda was an unreliable narrator way before sort of unreliable narrator was a sort of a thing in the 60s and the 70s. Anyway, going back, coming back to the point on what happened with, you know, the talent. One is, you know, it is difficult for such talent to come together and then have very extended stay. We almost had 20 years of it, which is by itself just amazing. And, you know, these initial set of people, I normally start with Anil Biswas, and then, you know, possibly SD Burman, I place Shankar Jaikishan a bit lower, because I think part of the reason why we lost it eventually was because of Shankar Jaikishan. These were good guys, but they were after sometimes got driven by a lot by what market wanted, and also did a bit of politicking in terms of awards and all of that screwed up the sort of just normal environment of people coming together and doing good quality work. But just that early set of people, Anil Biswas, SD Burman, Chitragupt Roshan, they were, see Ramchandra and Madan Mohan, these are like really good quality composers. But you only had that much of time. I mean, many of these guys actually had very poor lifestyles. I mean, almost all of them died of cirrhosis of liver. Almost all of them who died early. I mean, it's not, it's normally not mentioned as specifically, but you will realize that some of the great names, they all died before they turned 50, only for one reason. And so, in some sense, one reason is it's just natural. I mean, they died, who replaced them were somewhat, you know, ersatz, you know, versions of these guys, obviously wouldn't have the same quality. So that was one. Second, I just think that what happened was very gradually at the margins, there was this attempt to have more and more of orchestration, which up to a point was good. So, you know, you don't realize that by the mid 60s, there was almost this, you know, there was this competitive race on how many piece orchestra can you put in with Noshad hitting 100, right? I think he hit first 100 in Aan, an early 50s film. But after that, you know, and so what he would do is he would book the studio. And he would book every single, every single, you know, instrumentalist in town, all 100 of them. And they would play. I think the first one I think where he did something of this kind was Aan. Aan, by the way, was a film, very famously, it was a long film and they took it out and you know, in various film circuits and one of the famous reviews of Aan was it went Aan and Aan and Aan. Dilip Kumar and Nadira, Man Mera Ehsaan, and many good songs. So this kind of a race to bottom on how many pieces you can use, how grand the music can be in the hands of somewhat of a better quality, you know, composer and artist, it can still be managed. And let's be honest, I don't want to get into controversies here. Many of these music composers are completely dependent on their assistants. And it's reasonably well known, most of our great music composers couldn't write music. They were just not taught that way. These are all harmonium melody and then the assistants, some of whom are lost to history because they have not been documented well now a lot of us and a lot of other people have documented them. They would actually fill the you know, the substance of the song, right? When the some of these great names, Sebastian de Souza, Anthony Gonzalves, these are mostly Goan guys, because they were taught in the church how to write music. And then they could write and they could, you know, give it to other instrumentalists and they could play Dattara. Naushad had a very famous assistant who himself composed for Pakiza Ghulam Mohammed and then of course, Mohammed Shafi. These are great names. But anyway, coming back, you had this race for more number of pieces as it started becoming, you know, it started going into less talented hands. It started turning into a bit of a noise, but then you know, people were not, you know, bothered about that they would push that. And for some reason, you know, I think every decade people have lamented that music is becoming worse, but nothing would reverse it. I have no idea why, right? I mean, you know, you just got into this gradual decline of having more and more noisy work. And then somewhere the nature of the story and the script sector also started changing. And I think we started taking in, you know, a lot of this with less discernment. I think people were, there would be, you know, sort of pauses in this. I mean, you know, some of the good work was continued. I mean, Khayyam was there. Khayyam was one guy in every decade since 1950 to 1980, he would make good quality music. RD came in and he had, he contributed to some of this noise, but he also continued to do good work. But I think, I mean, I don't like to take specific names, but for many of us, you know, Kalyanji, Anandji, Lakshmikant, Pyarelal, later parts, they were just creating, you know, just noisy stuff with no melody in it, occasional good songs. And by the time then we had Bachchan, then somewhere the whole thing had changed and what people were going to watch films for had changed. And I also think that, you know, as radio started becoming less important, because in radio, you would listen to the song, you were not having the benefit of the visualization. By 80s, then radio was also on terminal decline. Then it didn't matter then what you're presenting and how visually attractive that was. That's all that mattered, right? So, that also started changing. So, I just think that the primary reason is, you just had a good fortune of 20 years of great people being together, the moment some of them dropped off, you would have had the eventual decline of that, that kind, that quality of music."

Because, you know, you put someone from a different environment and make him sit down and listen to say, Anil Biswas or SD Burman or whatever, and it may not strike a chord at all, there may be absolutely nothing happening there. I shouldn't say it may not strike a chord, of course, it will strike a chord, but it won't strike a chord, strike a chord. And does, you know, the kind of art which you consume, also shape the kind of person you are. And this could work sort of in a, you know, in a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle or whatever. I mean, those kind of tend to imply that there's a judgment call about what is good and what is bad. But you know what I mean? They could feed into each other. If you are a sort of a reflective kind of person who likes quiet music, and you listen to that, and it just matches. And, you know, you listen to more and more of that, and there is a market demand, and there's more and more of that getting produced, and so on and so forth, you know, and equally, you could enter a cycle of a different sort, you know, and what I sort of find delightful about the present, the present era, maybe the last 10-15 years, not in terms of music, which I know nothing about, but just in terms of creativity and art and all that, is that the means of production is so democratized, that everyone has it, that there is a potential for niches forming, which you would otherwise not even have assumed are there, you wouldn't know they exist. You know, you can have a gardening podcast, where you would have thought, where is the market for this? But it can be wildly popular, or at one point, people would have said, you don't know who will listen to a five hour conversation, right? And I'm just thinking in the one domain that I know about. But I would imagine the same is true for music, that what you should have in this era, I would assume, is that the long tail is being catered to that no matter what your tastes are, someone is making something which, you know, feeds into that, and vice versa. But instead, a and this kind of bewildering that why should a particular kind of music just vanish when it was clearly so popular and please so many people in such a way that we still remember it fondly? And secondly, does it mean that a particular kind of life a particular kind of terror of a particular kind of person is,"

And you can add, see the I mean, there is a truth to this that you are as you have to be a certain type, or you become a certain type as you continue to appreciate this kind of music. I've seen this for this kind of Hindustani classical or even for ghazals. You know, you we tend to be of a certain kind. Although, even among us, you know, the sort of that, whatever you call it, the tyranny of small differences between us is often we are more judgmental about each other. I listen to better stuff. But it does happen. I mean, you do tend to become a certain type. And I think that's true. The one thing in, at least in my case, like I say, I keep my ears open. And I trust my ears also reasonably well. So it is that, you know, then gradually, after I sort of got deeper into this, I kept my ear open to the idea that you could have good music even in Hollywood, because the first time when I heard, say, for instance, the sound of music, you know, I got that plastic pack with Rodgers and Hammerstein written. Pata bhi nahi tha yeh dono hai kaun, sound of music. First time I heard, barring that, Doremi, everything else seemed like noise to me. Yeh kya hai? Then after, you know, after many years, and then you heard everything, you know, the showboat, Learn and Lovell and all the other greats. And then, then wo kaan then open to them also. You realize ki yeh bhi ek music hai. In the same way, then I got into, for various reasons, into some of the opera stuff, right? I mean, some great, both Bikini and Verdi. I mean, if you don't, again, many people don't remember, Doodarshan is to actually air the, some of the great operas as well. I mean, one of the great Saturday afternoons that I spent was actually watching Tosca on Doodarshan on DDI. Nobody remembers. Nobody even appreciates what Doodarshan was doing for us during those days. And I had no clue. It's just that for two days, they were showing ki Tosca aayega Saturday afternoon ko. Aayega toh humne baith jayenge yaar, humne kaunsa kaam hai. But then you started appreciating that as well. So if you keep your ears, and off late, I mean, again, just to go back to this point, at least in the last couple of years, maybe the lockdown and everything else gave me some time. I'm listening to all these people, yeah, this Dua Lipa and Olivia Rodrigo and, you know, the Lizzo, Billie Eilish, of course, but you know that this latest, this Lizzo song, which goes as about damn time, great music and whatever the latest Beyonce album Renaissance. Absolutely fantastic. I mean, mostly she's again gone back to dance. And you know, it's quite pumped up. It's not like those reflective, like lemonade stuff. So, I mean, I agree. I am, people often say that I'm of a certain melancholic disposition."

I mean, I'm not one of those who have concluded that Hindi cinema, Hindi film music of 40s, 50s and 60s is great, because I like it. I mean, and then over a period of time, I've only gotten deeper into it. And now I'm, you know, extremist about it. And I don't listen to anybody else, you know, saying anything else is better.

And then that, of course, led to a lot of outrage from from Rafi fans and and so on, because there was that confusion of, you know, of what the film is saying, as opposed to what a character in the film is saying, which is a very standard thing. But you know, everything you said, you know, for me, I just think while there probably is such a thing as a certain type of music or a certain type of film that you're naturally drawn to, depending on things like your early conditioning, the things that you're exposed to early on, and so on. Also, but I think to a great degree, this is also just a function of how much time you have, and how much inclination or willingness you have to engage with many different things and to begin that process of discovering something new, something that might lie outside your comfort zone, and then going with it for a while until it, you know, it sort of, you know, it burrows into your ears or whatever. So speaking for myself, I've, maybe this is just a function of the fact that I've spent a disproportionately large amount of my time on movies, and on cultural stuff, on movies, books, music, compared to a lot of other people. So I tend to have very, very diverse tastes when it comes to music, you know, if my personal playlist will have old Hindi film songs from the 40s, 50s, 60s, you know, these beautiful numbers, I was listening to Aarpaar songs on the way here a while earlier, Geeta Dutt and songs like that. But at the same time, I will also have Eminem, or I'll also have some heavy metal, which is stuff that, you know, when I was in my mid teens, you know, 15, 16, or so on, I started really listening to contemporary Western music for the first time, became a big fan of all sorts of things, from the Pet Shop Boys to Guns N' Roses, you know, with U2 and R.E.M. in between and Stone Temple Pilots, everything, while at the same time retaining my basic love for old Hindi film music as well. I think it's largely, and you actually hinted at this also in what you were saying, Subrat, it's a function of how much time you have for these things, and how much you're willing to just explore different types of things. And then chances are, you will find something that you like in different genres and different modes. Also, one other thing that, you know, since you raised the subject, Amit, one thing I've always been a bit curious about, I haven't really quite figured it out for myself yet, is that when it comes to the songs in the two main languages that I know, Hindi and English, it's a strange thing. But when I first started listening to pop and rock in English, not just with people like Dylan or Kohan, people who are known for their songwriting, for the lyric writing, but even with bands like R.E.M, U2, etc. For some reason, once a song really embedded itself into my head, I knew the lyrics, I just learned the lyrics very quickly. So even today, there are songs, entire albums by some of my favourite artists who I first heard 30-35 years ago, and I just remember the whole thing, I remember all the words. But with Hindi film music, and I know there are a few others like me, I've always engaged with songs at the level of music, primarily. And very often, I just haven't registered the lyrics of even iconic songs, unless there's something really simple and straightforward, like Mera Jhoota Hai Japani or something like that. So it's so relatively late in life that I've really started appreciating the nuances between a Sahir Ludhianvi or a Majrooh Sultanpuri as lyricists. It's always been engagement at the level of music. So that there could be something in the brain that just sort of prioritises certain things depending on what language you're listening to. I think that's"

I almost, I mean, there are a few of us, lots of us now actually, it's almost like you can play any song at any time and we can just take the lyrics and do that. I mean, some of the workplaces that I've been, I have this bit of a, you know, fun contest that goes on that they can play 100 songs, one after the other. And I can tell them the movie, the director, the music director, lyricist that I can sing the entire song, at least the lyrics. So, so yeah, so the lyrics are my point of entry.

You know, in a completely different context, you know, the Ganesh Ka Gai Tonde character played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. And, you know, and Dharti Ke Pukar Ke is being used there. And it just, you've taken something that that's so much of, of its time, you know, belongs to the Do Bhi Ka Zameen situation as Subrat was saying, but you've transposed it here to a completely different, you know, aesthetic and a mode of storytelling. And it just works there as well."

I think someone who has imbibed the best of the past and is just doing this, you know, bringing it into the work that he does now, which is influenced by so many things. So I confess, I had no idea of this. And we didn't discuss this. But, you know, personally, where I come from, I'm much closer in terms of that music versus lyrics sing to where Jai is, where it's always a music, it's always a vibe with exceptions. And the exceptions being the singer songwriters like Springsteen and Dylan where, you know, you get into them for a specific reason. And therefore, you kind of remember the word. But most of the time, my experience with music is essentially of not only not knowing the words, but often misunderstanding them. So like, my catalog of memories is full of what is called Mondegreens. Like the recent one, which I just discovered yesterday that I had sort of misremembered, it was a BG song tragedy. I always thought the lyrics were tragedy. It's a Vulcan sonic tragedy. And obviously, that's not the not what it is. I don't even know what it is forgotten already. But in my mind has always been that and I'm content with it being that, because I don't need anything more than that. For, you know, to enjoy the song, though I don't even like the song. I mean, it's just one random example."

        "message": "Palekar was always looking for Sabudana. That's me. That's me. That's me. Right. Yeah, exactly. So here's my next question. And it strikes at what both of you just mentioned, like Subrat, you mentioned about Tosca. Tosca aaya hum toh kuch nahi kar rahe hain, batke dekhenge. And you spoke about how getting into something requires you're devoting the time to get into it. You can't just listen to something casually or whatever you actually, there's an investment you're making of yourself. Now, my thought is and I remember having this argument with my dad back in the 90s, where he felt that so many channels wasn't such a great thing, like, which is, you know, the very old Fabian socialist point of view, but my scene was ki yaar choice aagaya hai, you know, abhi like star movies had just come. Star movies was heaven boss. Poora din movies hote the usmein humein, you know, where would we get to watch that? In 94-95, they had that 100 years of cinema thing, which went on for weeks. And you just saw so much stuff. Pagla gaye, khushi se baukla gaye. I remember that. Yeah. So and my father's sort of romantic point was ki nahi ek channel jab tha, at least you could look forward to things you knew they were there. Today, 30-40 years later, I kind of understand where that's coming from, if I don't agree with it completely. In the sense ki Tosca dikhaya, bachche hain jinn ke baas kuch nahi hai, they're sitting and watching Tosca, they're taking it in. Today, what you have is number one, as Jonathan Haidt has pointed out, most of the content we are consuming was produced in the last three days, right? We're not going any further back than that. And if I may add to that, we are just scrolling or swiping. Everything is scroll, swipe, scroll, swipe, aage chalo, peeche chalo. It's, you know, we are having, we are living in a world of 15 second experiences. And that kind of immersive thing, where you're not scrolling, you're not swiping, you're just sitting, you're taking something in, you know, even if it's a three hour Amar Akbar Anthony, you're just sitting there for the whole experience. You know, I don't mean ki aapko baith ke Tarkovsky dekhna hai. But, and I think that that's fundamental, because everything that you consume in terms of art is going to shape you, right? So if all the time I'm watching 15 second things, you know, the rhythm of my thinking, just, you know, it's shallow, I'm not really taking anything in, the rabbit holes I enter will also be will have this staccato rhythm to them. Ki acha theek hai, yeh accha laga, yeh pedia dekha, yeh kya, wo kya, wo kya, but that immersion is kind of not there. So is this something you've observed? Does it change society in a fundamental way when it happens? Or would you say that this is not happening to everybody that, you know, there were enough sort of people back then, there were people who didn't watch anything or read anything, you know, toh matlab utna farak nahi parta hai. The handful of people who are still going to be drawn to fine art are still going to be drawn to art, you know, pompous terms, but so what's your sense of this?"

Because I need that time to, you know, if you're watching a 90 minute film or a two hour film to then reflect, think about it. And I try to watch it at one go, minimum distractions, darkened room, even if I'm just watching it on my laptop or whatever. But even so, I know that even I 70-80% of the time do find myself distracted by something else, you know, and I won't be able to sort of resist pausing the film for a while and checking something, you know, I mean, I might just go to the film's Wikipedia page to check something that I do to follow. And then that might lead me to meet me to another rabbit hole, because Gmail happens to be open. And there's one unread mail there and you go there. That happens even to someone like me, to whom immersion comes quite easily and who doesn't normally get sucked into too many different things. So I can imagine that it does on some level, it is affecting the brains of many of us, and definitely younger people who have only ever known this sort of life who, you know, who are just inundated with information all the time, information, the binging culture that we talk about, you know, the, I'm sure it's not great for the for the eyes as well or for the for the ears, if you're listening to listening to things or watching things with with your phones all the time. That's also the physiological side to it. It's and I'm sure Shoaib does on the whole, I don't want to make very sweeping statements, but on the whole, it must be affecting people's attention spans.

It feels like, they're missing out on so many things, right? You know, just sit and watch 2001 Space Odyssey and wait for 30 minutes till the first word is spoken. Listen to Strauss, see what is happening. Look at what Kubrick is doing. But then you know that there is also this system to thinking about this, which is how was Mirza Ghalib, for instance, received in his what we might consider his, you know, peak? I don't think I mean, I think the narcissists and the purists of his time, including, you know, the ones in the darbar and, you know, those of us who watched the great television serial Mirza Ghalib by Gulzar in the in the late 80s. He wasn't necessarily the, you know, the court poet or something. He was there and thereabouts, but it was Zouk and you know, then there was Meerta Ki Mir and so on and so forth. Ghalib was often considered to be a bit of a people's poet, a bit of someone who was pandering to popular taste. And if you recollect the series, there, you know, there was Neena Gupta who played, you know, Kotesan Nashne Wali and she would often get in Radhi paper, some of Ghalib's songs, not often, she got a few times and then she would be singing and Ghalib himself hears that Tere Wade Pe Jiye Toh Yeh Jaan Jhoot Jana Ki Khushi Se Jee Na Paate Toh Yeh Aitbaar Hota. You know, the fact that it went to those people and they sort of sang it and therefore it sort of continued and perpetuated and hundred years later, you know, Ghalib is high art, high culture, while it might not have been during that point in time. So, some of this, you know, I would say that one has to look at history and pause and say that it's maybe we should reserve our judgment. Who knows that, you know, this two minute thing is possibly high art. I mean, for instance, I mean, we can go back into just the painting stuff, right? I mean, Lichtenstein, you know, he did the drowning girl, that very famous, almost comic book like art. I mean, I'm sure nobody thought that to be anything great at that point in time. I mean, you know, now looking back is there a Kya Kiya Hai or even Jackson Pollock and, you know, all these abstract expressionist or, you know, Rene Magritte and, you know, all those, you know, crazy stuff, Golconda and, you know, they were all interesting stuff. But, you know, people would possibly compare that and say that even impressionism and post impressionist stuff was better than what are you putting up now, right? And then if you go back another 30 years, people were asking, Picasso, Kar Kya Rahe Ho? Yeh Kya Hai? Why is everything appearing like a cube? And then, you know, go to impressionism and even when impressionism was happening, there was then in UK, this Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood who said that, listen, all these guys have gone crazy. Let's go back, you know, completely. So, the likes of Rossetti and others, they just, you know, went all the way back and, you know, so they would paint Ophelia or something like that, which is very Pre-Raphaelite. So, they almost leaped back 300 years. So, sometimes I'm like, you know, history should teach us ki hota rahata hai yaar, istare ka. And maybe 30 years later, you might find this very different and this might be high art. And therefore, one has to be somewhat, I mean, obviously, in the present, you crib about it, but who knows later, how will people see this? I mean,"

What I was really talking about was more about how much there is competing for people's attention right now and how in that process, you know, even TikTok can be good art. And I mean, I think you've pointed that out as well in things you've written or spoken about. But if there's so much available competing for people's attention and people then don't approach these things with some discernment, with some regard for the limits of their own mind, what they can process in a single day, then of course, you know, you just have stuff washing over you all the time. And I think this also sort of this inevitably will lead to situations where people are not really, where people are dabbling, you know, with, I see this a lot in my spheres of work, book reviewers, reading novels or whatever, and writing reviews. And you can tell that the engagement has been very superficial. It's just been, you know, there hasn't been a real sort of effort to sort of get into it. It's skimming, skimming more than anything else to sort of just get the easy takeaway from the thing, from what might actually be quite a complex, nuanced work, but you're looking for the takeaway, you're looking for a single takeaway. That happens with films, a lot of cultural criticism these days, which we've talked about elsewhere, where, you know, you have, you have criticism that's centred on ideology, or very often on on blinkered ideology, is just sort of is centred on looking at a film and saying, what is the message? What is the filmmaker? What is the filmmaker's own politics? What is he trying to say? What does this character represent? Is he supporting this character in the film? Or is he sort of judging the character? And, you know, and these questions are presented as if they will always have very easy, straightforward answers, which they very often won't, with a good film, with a good complex film, they won't have those answers. And I think that that also is very often a function of just, you know, we have very finite time to, you know, we just need to sort of watch this film, not think about it too much. We just sort of, you know, just looking for that one easy takeaway from it. I think that some of that is happening a lot."

        "message": "I think part of that, that tendency is that we live in the age of the Ghoja moment, where you're looking for someone, something to pass judgment on. Because then if you, the act of passing judgment on something means you're placing yourself above it, you're elevating yourself, whether in terms of aesthetics or morality or whatever. And it's a toxic tendency. And I agree there with you. And we'll talk about politics and art later. But I'll just agree with both of you here, in the sense that, yeah, I mean, you know, I briefly taught a course, TikTok and Indian society, and the very month that it was banned. But I thought there was some tremendous art happening there. A lot of great expression from people who don't otherwise have platforms, and who don't otherwise see art from people like themselves. And suddenly, you just have to turn a phone at yourself and make something. And initially, you're doing lip syncs and memes and all of that. But later, it was going beyond that. It blew my mind. It just like, made me so happy to kind of see that happening. At the same time, Subrata, your point is great also that, you know, one, of course, how we, you know, if you go through history, one should learn not to place things on a hierarchy and say, this is good, this is bad. But also, I don't think attention spans are necessarily declining as you know, we're having this conversation, people listen to the show, listen to the podcast and you, you know, one of you, I think Jay, you spoke about binging as well. And binging also indicates that I mean, I do see the addictive nature of binging and you're just watching mindlessly through the night. But at the same time, it shows that people have that kind of stamina to really get into a story and just really get into it, right. And the fact that somebody today can binge something like The Wire or something like Decalogue is delightful to me. And that brings me to my next question about a change in form itself. Like if you look at the history of cinema, all films are basically short stories. If you look at the literature definition of it, there's a certain amount of depth you can get and not much more than that, and so on and so forth. Whereas, with the modern web series or OTT content, you can stretch out like a novel. Like what I loved about The Wire also was how slowly it unfolded, how there wasn't one or two or three major protagonists, where there were 14, 15, 20 people who were painted with such depth that you could care for them and remember those characters 20 years after the show was over, you know, it's almost that long since I saw some of the things I remember. And I think that's a beautiful progression in what is possible, as much as the two minute form is possible, the 30 second form is possible, and all of that is not necessarily a bad thing. At the same time, now, we can stretch out, you know, earlier it felt like an hour long interview is a deep dive. Today, it feels like micro content to me, at least as a consumer. Now we can stretch out. Now we can bring that herav into our viewing experience. And in a sense, what contradicts a question I ask or makes it moot in a certain sense is that, you know, you have long form content kind of flourishing like this. So what's your sense of it? Does it change the kind of art that is being produced? And does it also then in a positive way, change the kind of viewer because consumers are so high is clearly?"

        "message": "Yeah, well, you know, I mean, I agree completely. And this is what I'm saying is necessarily going to be a little more theoretical than as opposed to sort of coming from first hand understanding of it, because I haven't watched that many of these really long series myself. I've seen enough of them to know that enough good ones to know that it's a very exciting new development. This this especially this concept of the multi the multi season series where you know, you have five, six seasons over five, six years, and yet you know that, that the showrunners or the scriptwriters had a grand design in mind right from the very beginning. You know, so this I keep hearing about this in the context of shows like Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, which I haven't seen myself, but I've heard enough about it from from people whose whose judgment I respect, whose taste I respect to know that it's something very special and that we really haven't had a precedent for this sort of thing done well in the past. So yeah, so there is something to be said about that. But but I also do I think I'm just coming back repeatedly not to the question of quality, whether it's something that's that's a 60 episode show, or whether it's a two minute TikTok video or whatever it is, I'm just coming back to the way in which people engage, you know, whether it's it's something that you know, I know, I suppose it sort of depends on the sort of consumer you are that that makes a difference. I still know even in today's day and age, I know, I have friends, writers among them who managed to just switch off all social media, their phones for hours on end when they have to sit down and read a novel for work or, or whatever, or just for, for pleasure or something that you just need to do on a particular day. So this was suppose that is still very much there. But on the whole, I suppose what I'm just saying is that maybe it is a somewhat conservative position that just sort of dates me in a way is that a lot of people I know a lot of young people in particular, do seem to be taking on more than their minds can actually process in a single day, in terms of the volume of content that's out there. And I see that when I see for instance, on on Facebook, for instance, if I'm part of a film club forum where discussions are had about films, it's very common for me to see people who are clearly very serious film buffs, and who are keen to really engage with things, watch as many things as possible, but who when they when they say something about a film about a particular film, you'll find them saying something that just sort of that, that to my mind, at least just indicates a very superficial takeaway, you know, you've just perhaps engaged with it at the level of plot, you're saying something also that there's this tendency to, and perhaps there's something I'm becoming more aware of, because I've been, I'm in the process of teaching. And I've been doing that for a while, and I'm going to be doing it in a more consolidated way from from next month, there seems to be this reluctance or inability to really research something. So, so someone will someone who's clearly a very passionate film buff will watch a new film that just come out, and will not even after watching it will not even take the trouble to, to perhaps go to the Wikipedia page to sort of find out something about the antecedents of the film, what it's based on what it might have been inspired by. So, so for instance, there, there might be a film that that is a remake of an earlier film. And this person will not know that at all, but will they write a long post on a film film discussion forum, discussing the film almost exclusively in terms of its plot and how it's so interesting, it's such a good film, because it's, it's such an such an original story or whatever it is, without even realising that, that the plot is actually the least original thing about it. It's, it's a direct remake of something that that happened 30-40 years ago. And that to my mind is a very surface way of engaging with things. I think I maybe I just come from an old school thing where I need a lot of context for things. And I need to sort of have that background, especially as a professional writer, when one is one is actually putting your thoughts down about something you need to have a depth or breadth of knowledge about, about the background of the work that you're writing about. So that's maybe maybe that's what I'm talking about."

Actually, you're, what you get out of that piece of art, you know, increases tremendously. So, it's, you will just like it if you are getting deeper into it. So, it's not about some kind of, you know, snobbery around just knowing more about it, just improves your appreciation of art. And the other way of coming at it, which is if you don't believe this, for instance, is that almost everyone who, whose art you like, who's creating good, you know, even these long TV series and who's creating good cinema today, you will notice that they were deeply steeped in the history of the kind of work that they are doing. Always, it's, you know, Martin Scorsese knew every filmmaker of the 50s and watched everything, right. And, you know, Tarantino knew everything about, you know, whether it was French New Wave, or, you know, he knew everything, right. And even today, if you, including Nolan, right. So, if these guys appreciate what that was, right, and, and you have to respect the fact that they appreciated all of that, and therefore, they are creating this work, which you all are, you know, thoroughly enjoying, and possibly comparing more favorably with what has gone on in the past, then you should respect that guys, you know, the person that you are really appreciating their taste. And maybe give that benefit of doubt that we should go back and understand what was happening at that point in time, because they seem to be coming off a particular chain. And maybe there is something more to be done there. In fact, that's how, at least in my case, you know, it's not, I mean, in some cases, it has been random, you know, jump into someone. But in many cases, it's been this kind, you know, you read somewhere, some Coen brother interview and mentions Preston Sturges, and you're like, yeah, man, I love these guys. I mean, these guys, for me at a particular time in, you know, early 2000s, and it was like, I mean, Coen brother toh kuch bhi karega, purana, apneya, sab jaake dhoond ke dekho. So, why are these guys talking about someone who was like, 50 years before this time and in such favorable terms. And so, then you go back to, you know, Sturges, and then you say that, okay, by mistake, maine ek picture dekh liya tha. I don't even remember, Ball of Fire or something I'd watched. And then you figure out, you know, that the Lady Eve or what, and then you realize ki kya, as a scriptwriter, kamaal tha. I mean, you know, the guy could do, you know, really great script, really tight. I mean, he had a fairly short sort of, you know, real dramatic peak for 5-6 years. He just wrote, you know, these next level screwball comedy stuff, you know, the banter, the back and forth. So, yeah, so then you discover that, then you discover it. I mean, then you find more, then you get deeper into it, then you realize you've never fully appreciated Barbara Steinweg, then you go down Barbara Steinweg path, and you know, you get so much out of that stuff. So, I, you know, you will be richer from, you know, the deeper dive is my sense. I mean, you'll be richer by much more than what you do."

So, so for instance, I was just, just to take one example. And what you said, you know, is, is of course, right, but I have to say that Martin Scorsese is such an outlier when it comes to these things that he should"

And they are definitely lacking on the whole, in knowledge about about the period that you mentioned the Preston Sturges period, the period of the 1940s, or the 50s, and American cinema, for instance, which I think is one of the great, great for great founts of, of everything.

But we'll come to that after the break. One final big question before the break, which sort of takes off from what you were just talking about. Howard Bloom has a book called How to Read and Why, right? And, and I'm very curious about how you guys would answer the question of how to watch a film and why. And I don't mean this in a prescriptive sense, ki bachcho ko batao, ki, you know, ye points hai, ye aapko likhna hai, ye karna hai, not like that. But just in a sense of the first time we watch a film, we are as children, we are watching the film as you know, it's a linear narrative, it's a story you're interested ye hua, iske baad ye hua, so on and so forth. But later layers begin to form, you begin to see more in the film, layers form in your own head and of how you watch it and the different things that you look for and the different connections that you make, and so on. And there are also other layers which you may or may not engage with what the filmmaker intended, where is he coming from, and even everything you just described, the giants on whose shoulders, you know, she may stand. So, in terms of just that experience of watching a film, and not necessarily watching it to write a review ki aap notes le rahe ho, ki ye likhna hai, ye likhna hai, ye likhna hai, but just you're watching a film for pleasure, you know, how has that changed over the years in the sense that you guys look at cinema?"

        "message": "Star star ratings. Yes, yes. Well, stars and their films. So when you have that particular imperative, that's something very just a few people have, right? I mean, most people, bless their souls, because I feel very envious of them are just content to watch a film, you know, with enthusiasm without, you know, necessarily getting cerebral or, or, or even putting down thoughts about it. In fact, some of some of my friends who I'm most envious of in this regard are massive film buffs who can who can have these incredibly informed and intelligent conversations about cinema, but who don't have that, that writerly impulse at all, that day that they would they want to sit down and put it down. And I've had that for as far back as I can remember. So then someone like that, when when you when you're watching a film, inevitably, you are sort of trying at some conscious level to pick up on certain things also, depending at what stage in your development you are, as a as a film watcher. Of course, it's true that I think it's true for the vast majority of us, that that our first point of engagement with a film is purely at the level of what happens next, what happens at the plot level, actors, stars, I think a majority of us as initial film buffs, and maybe even through a lifetime of film watching are most interested in the people on the screen, and you know, and you know, and developing certain sort of affinities with star personalities, projecting their own feelings onto them, which is which is why we have the phenomenon of the big movie star, who may or may not also be a very good actor. Really, there's, I don't think there can be any one one size fits all answer to a question like this. It just depends on, you know, what stage of your film development you're at. Now, today, if I were to watch a film, even if I'm not writing about it on a deadline, chances are that my mind is sufficiently trained to, on the one hand, pay attention to what's happening at the plot level to sort of follow what's happening and to be stimulated by that, ab kya hone wala hai, etc. Assuming that I don't already know much about the film beforehand, but also picking up on little things at the level of cinematography, sound design, etc. Or at least deriving some enjoyment from how a well made film is bringing all its elements together and putting them at the service of creating the experience. So just to give you one example of this very recent Malayalam film called Malayan Kunju, which is a Fahad Fasil film. And he's already quite a big name, even among non South Indian viewers who are seeking out Malayalam and Tamil cinema. It's a film about this character played by Fahad, who is bitter and he's resentful for various reasons, he's not very happy inside. And then around midway through the film, he finds himself caught in a landslide, and then it becomes a survival film. And I was watching it even though I watched it on a laptop screen, unfortunately, I wish I could have seen it on the big screen, I missed it. I watched it on a laptop screen with the full earphones plugged in. And while I was very engaged with the story, because it is an engaging story, you want to know what's going to happen to him from one step to the other. At one point, I also found myself really reveling in the sound design of the film, because he's a large part of the second half of the film, he's trapped underwater or somewhere in a cave below where his house used to be. And there's a sound of a baby wailing in the far distance, which is a pivotal plot point in the film, a child who used to feel very disturbed by, but who now sort of becomes like this something for him to hold on to an oral experience for him to, you know, to remember that there's a world out there that he has to try and get back to. And I became really fascinated by the sound design of the film. And aware, while I was immersed in the film, I was also aware that this is what the sound designer and the director what they've done this, what they've constructed to heighten the experience of the film. Just one example, you can apply that to cinematography, you can apply that to editing, background music, whatever. So really, that's, it varies. It also also varies depending on the type of film it is that there are films that are that are not narrative films at all the anti narrative films. There's, you know, if you watch a Goddard film from the 60s, which is, which is not about telling a story in a linear way, or even about telling any sort of story, sometimes, you're sort of looking at it and, and trying to sort of, you know, pick up on elements of, you know, the atmosphere created by the film, the perspective that is being expressed, the little playful things he's doing at the level of forming it, and maybe it won't be immersive. For you, as a viewer to be more about actually sitting and being more analytical throughout the thing. What is he doing? What, what camera angle has he chosen here? Why is he just sort of why is he got a camera fixed on this person for five minutes, or on this coffee cup with the coffee swirling inside, you know, standing for the cosmos or whatever it is, you start thinking, thinking, thinking about those things. It depends on the type of film, the depends on whether you're writing about it, whether you're watching it primarily for relaxation. So many things."

        "message": "Yeah, I mean, see, I think one way to look at this is, you know, if you consume something in fairly regular and large quantities, you start then figuring out what is good or not. It's just natural. I mean, you know, I love biryani. And over a period of time since I've eaten so many biryani, the first morsel is enough. And it's very difficult to explain what's going on in your mind the minute you eat the first morsel, but you know, and even if there are different types of biryani within them, I know the difference. I mean, the macro difference is potato, but the micro difference is something very different. And then you have it, you realize this Kolkata biryani is better than the other one. And so might be the case with the Mopla biryani or the, you know, the various kinds of rice that they use in the talap katti biryani or the dindigul biryani. So one is if you watch a lot of it, you automatically something, you know, you get in your head in terms of how you are able to appreciate that. So that's definitely happened with me. So in the absence of any formal sort of learning or anything of that kind, it happened. And I'll tell you some very simple things like you know, you watch Mukkaddar ka Sikandar. And many people watch it. And sometimes I tell them that actually it is Devdas. People completely find it, you know, as a revelation ki yeh Devdas ka story hai. Because, you know, they've just watched it. But when you just explain it to them, it's the same thing. There is one, you know, Paro and then, you know, the Rekha's character is a dancer, is a courtesan, she's Chandramukhi and it's exactly the same. There is Churnilal in the form of Inod Khanna. Chalo Amjad Khan aajaata hai and so on and so forth. And last mein mar jaata hai. And on the, you know, dies next to Rakhi and stuff. That only happens if you, you know, after sort of while watching it, you have watched so many films that you're not just watching it, you're just trying to make some sort of a meta connect about, you know, what the story is and what does this sort of, you know, is this similar to some other pattern or some other kind of similar story. And that's at that level. Forget, like, Jai was mentioning the soundscape and, you know, the camera angles, etc. will come later. Sometimes people just miss the very obvious plot itself. It seems very, because you just watch and come out of it, right? So that's, so that's, like, that's one thing. And I see this even in reading, right? I mean, you, all of us sort of first started off with harka phulka reading, you know, we did the Woodhouse and the Agatha Christie's and all that. And even there, by the 10th, Agatha Christie, you start appreciating how firstly intricate it is, who's saying what, etc, etc. And by the time you are in the 12th or 13th, you are trying to guess because you now figured out how she sort of leaves red earrings and clues and things of that kind. Same with Woodhouse. I mean, those plots might be farcical and silly, but very intricate. I mean, and everything falls in place at the end, right? And in very sort of funny and in a twisted sort of logical way, but you know, it falls in place. So I think if you just consume more, you will find it and you might not be able to articulate it, but often you'll find it. So that's sort of one way of looking at it. The second is then, you know, one of the things that came to me over a period of time is just the way the director is showing you the film, right? Not just you as a viewer watching it. I mean, you know, he could have placed the camera here, or he could have taken it up and shown you a different view. What does that do to your viewing experience? You know, and same with, you know, the sound and when you start realizing that, you know, he's actually or she's actually, you know, playing God, I mean, they're actually taking you through this, how they want you to experience that particular scene. And that, I think, that was a moment of sort of, you know, revelation that I, I mean, I, with some directors, I started realizing that there is something at work here that you, they are in some sense manipulating or in some sense, they want you to watch the, you know, drama unfolding in a certain way. And that once you've seen that, then you can't unsee it. I mean, in the sense you just, you know, next time you're watching a film, you're doing it both as a viewer and sometimes also as how you are being, you know, you're being asked to view it. And then of course, that plus the sort of there is always a subtext or sometimes a subtext or a meta narrative of in every film. I mean, even if the director sometimes is not fully thinking about it, you as a viewer can appreciate and take away. And often I've realized, even if it is Prakash Mehra in Mukaddar Ka Sikandar, boss, he's thinking about it. He's figured that it is Devdasi Banarao. But he's also thinking at multiple levels the way, the reason he names the character Sikandar, who's technically means, you know, unconquered or whatever, cannot be defeated. But then, you know, loses in love. Kar raha hai boss, wo Prakash Mehra hai, par wo poora dimaag laga raha hai, including naming the character in a certain way and, you know, all of that. And then of course, with better filmmakers and like one of the films among many rare films, I just love Nayak. One is, you know, it's just, it's in its own way, contained sort of environment film, right? They're all in the, in the train, you know, in that single compartment. There is Sharmila Tagore, who is not taken in by these guys, you know, the fandom or whatever, the fact that he's a celebrity, the fact that she can, you know, critically ask him questions that makes him go back and, you know, think and reflect about the journey that he's had. You realize then that, you know, at a general level, it's a story of somebody sitting there and she's there and you're seeing a little bit of chemistry, but she's also asking him some questions, he's thinking about it. But then after some time, you realize that it's a genuinely a deeper examination of, you know, success, also of, you know, the fact that you are a celebrity and how do you personally, you know, what do you have to deal with, you know, thinking about the compromises you have made, so on and so forth. And then you get a better appreciation of, you know, how the filmmaker has, you know, put that thing together. So I mean, like I said, you know, there are just these two, three things at least that I can articulate that sort of opens your mind to it, you know, just the idea of is there something more where you can connect the plot to the story to how the director wants you to see it. And, you know, and then once you figure that out, it's how the, you know, what are the deeper questions or, you know, things that the director is asking. And after some time, you sometimes start overthinking it, maybe even the director is not doing it. But you're like, why did he or she wear something there of that kind? And, you know, all of that, then, why did they suddenly show, why was it raining at that point in time, and so on and so forth. So, and then you build your own, you know, context and narrative. But again, it's fairly enriching. And then if you start seeing a body of work of a director of you then find that there is, then you see that there is even more a pattern because"

Yeah, that's, that's a very important, I was about to come to that, that, you know, if you're talking about the process of watching films, how does one watch films, then of course, another important factor is you watch multiple films made by the same director or even featuring the same actor, or the same cinematographer, you know, music director who has a certain part to play in the in the making of the film, you start seeing patterns as well, right. And of course, some of those patterns might just be coming as you know, from from your, your own projections and overthinking, over reading or whatever you want to call it. Though, as you know, I'm also a big fan of subtextual analysis taken as far as it can go. I just also wanted to just interject and this is the sort of thing that happens, this serendipitous sort of thing that happens when movie buffs are just sitting and talking, right. Complete coincidence this morning, I was actually writing something about Mukadarka Sikandar. You know, as part of an essay about Prakash Mehra and Bachchan. And I just wanted to add to what you said, you know, yeah, you know, it's not just is it, is it very much a Devdas film? It's also one of the most interesting Devdas films we've had, because it may be the only one where across the many Indian cultures, where the man is not laying this heavy guilt trip on the woman, on the woman who, you know, who doesn't reciprocate his, you know, so one of the moving things about that film for me is the relationship, the fact that the Bachchan character, even though Rakhi, the Rakhi character, we want to call her the Paro, Paro like figure, she doesn't, you know, it's unrequited love, she doesn't reciprocate. He never stops feeling grateful to her and beholden to her in a sense, because of, at a purely platonic level, what she did for him when he was a child. And that, that devotion is always there, that that that acknowledgement is there. It doesn't really, it doesn't devolve into, you know, I'm the, I'm the angsty male who's been rebuffed, and I'm going to put this major guilt trip on the woman, it doesn't turn into that. So it's quite an unusual Devdas in that sense."

Now I had this conversation with Varun in my episode with him, which you haven't heard because it's not released, but it'll be released well before yours, of course, where I asked him about the ending of Masaan, right? Beautiful film. And the film, of course, and I, since I've already given the spoiler away in my episode with Varun, I can just do it again. But essentially, there are these two parallel tracks of these two people who have loved and lost in different ways. And at the end, they are on the steps at the ghats of the river. And that's the first time you see them in one frame. And it's a beautiful moment. And I would have ended the film there. Now, how a typical Bollywood treatment of the film would have been is that you show them talking, coming together, all kinds of things happen, they get married happily ever after. Basically, you spell everything out. The way Neeraj and Varun treated it is that they talk to each other briefly, and they get on a boat, and then the boat sails away. And then there's a song where the first two lines of the lyric indicate something to the effect of life not ending the world continuing, which spells it out a little more than I would have, but in an elusive way. And it's not as you know, the Bollywood kind of thing. And what's and I of course, as you know, Jai, we discussed it last time, I sort of have a bias towards, you know, being allowed to think for myself and not being spoon fed in the typical Bollywood way would be spoon fed you in every way, you know, show you everything that happens, put background music that forces you to feel in a particular way, all of that. And I remember Jai, you pointed out that one of my favorite films, Moonlight actually does have a lot of interesting background music happening, which therefore seems to go against what I'm saying. So I one, I'm wondering if it is simply a question of taste? Or is it the case that as you watch more and more movies, you sort of, you know, sometimes you might be in the state of mind where you're completely passive. But I mean, there seems to be a continuum along complete passivity, where you're not thinking for yourself, and a little bit of involvement where you are using your own imagination and putting two and two together. And it seems to me that and perhaps it's my bias speaking, but that the more powerful kind of art is where you allow the reader or the viewer to be a participant in the sense of that and, you know, not kind of spoon feed them. So and that changes the nature of the art that that plays to what the viewer might be wanting at that moment. What are your feelings about this? Am I?"

        "message": "No, no, no, I was fine with the way I mean, I actually watched it when it came out and didn't remember it very clearly. But then you described this quite vividly just now. So yeah, so then I remembered I was fine with the way it ended. I sort of agree that, that if it would for that film for given what the film had already been for this entire duration, it would have been a big misstep to turn it into a Bollywood, Bollywoodized, as you put it spoon feeding sort of ending that that would have been a that wouldn't have worked for me at all for this film, for this particular film. I don't know what you suggested, what you proposed, I suppose that could work also, it would obviously be be even more subtle and spare could have worked. The thing is, I don't actually sort of remember the experience of Masaan very clearly right now to really but but yeah, I think I think definitely not the hyper Bollywoodized version that that that would definitely not have worked for that film. What I was saying was, there are different ways of being a participant also right now, you know, when I get your point about spoon feeding, or about, you know, an insistent music score underlining things seeming to play your emotions seeming to sort of tell you what what to feel, but, and again, I suppose this maybe this is different for different types of viewers, you know, it works differently. The point about moonlighting, moonlight, by the way, was that that I felt like, like it had a lovely, lush music score, it could entirely I haven't gone back to see the film a second time, it could entirely be that that that maybe when I was watching it, for some reason, for whatever reason, the score just sort of, you know, just imposed itself on me or I paid extra attention to it, whereas, objectively speaking, it may not even have been a very insistent score, maybe it was just the right score for that film. But I liked it so much that it that that it played a part, especially in the dialogue less portions of the film, such as the swimming pool scene, or things like that, it affected me and and maybe you watched it and the music didn't even sort of feel insistent to you. So, so it's two different people responding to it. To come back to what I was saying, I think even though, you know, a film that that might seem to you to be a case of a lot of spoon feeding the viewer, just making the viewer passive as you say, and you know, and just the film constantly telling you what to do. There is a part of participative process in that as well. Now, you know, if you look at if I look at some of my favourite masala Hindi films of a past era, including the big, brassy musical numbers and things, I feel like I'm part of participating in a different way if I if I see a lovely song sequence that I'm really enjoying with a big star or three big stars Amar Akbar Anthony, all on the screen, I feel like I like I am, you know, just just by virtue of enjoying the way it's done, the the stars on the screen, my own projections of who these people are, Bachchan, Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor, whatever, I feel like I am there, some part of me some, you know, some closet, extroverted, boisterous part of me is up there with them, you know, perhaps performing with them, you know, just defeating the villains through the power of song or whatever. So that is a different sort of participation as well. It's not just like, to me, at least it's not like, I'm just sitting back in the seat and you know, and Manmohan Desai is just sort of feeding me mishti doi or whatever and I'm just sort of just gulping it down without, without thinking about it, which is one of the reasons why I get a little defensive when when people use words like mindless, mindless entertainment for for mainstream films, because to me, or when when they say, oh, you know, you do by the default assumption is that with a Manmohan Desai film, you know, you just sort of you're just it's it doesn't require, you can sort of watch it leaving your brains at home or whatever. I need my brain for everything. I need my brain. I mean, I'd be very afraid of misplacing it. I need to have it in here for every sort of experience, whether it's the the Tarkovsky experience or the Manmohan Desai experience, there are different forms of engagement. And I don't really, I've never seen myself as a passive viewer with any film that I've truly enjoyed, no matter what category of film it is."

And I guess it's a question of degrees and quibbling and, you know, all of that. Subrata, what's your take on it? Because you watch the because you are a lover of both the most overstated Bollywood films as well as the most understated and quote unquote, realistic international films. How do like, do you have to mode shift from one to the other to appreciate them as they are meant to be appreciated?"

So I think, you know, just picking on picking up from where Jay left, one of the things that should be there is just the within the film itself, it should have, you know, integrity, right? So that it should not be uneven within the film, because that's, then you know that you are in for this experience, and the director is giving you all of that. And he's not, you know, thematically not, you know, sort of going in different directions within the same film. And I think that's very important, because then you can enjoy it, you know, just as a single piece of work. So, like Jay mentioned on Masaan, you were watching a certain sensibility right through the film. And therefore, the ending could not have been a different one, and maybe you could quibble about, could they have pulled back a little bit more, I think where they left it was, in some sense, still consistent with the overall sensibility that the film had. And then therefore, Manmohan Desai is completely consistent, right? And therefore, not mindless at all. I mean, you know, people don't appreciate, there was a time in 76, four Manmohan Desai films were running at the same time. I don't know when the guy made those four films together."

        "message": "So it would have been 77 actually. 77. 77. All four films. And, you know, it was like a combination of characters, I mean, it was same, there was Amitabh, there was Vinod Khanna, in somewhere there was Dharmendra, somewhere there was Randhir Kapoor and Dharmendra, Chacha Bhatija. So all different films. I remember watching these films at different times in my life, you know, mostly mid to late 80s. And much later, I realized the guy was making all these four films simultaneously, all great entertaining films. I mean, Parvaresh is all these, you know, one, it's like Nature, Nurture, one brother, other brother, all those kind of stuff happening, Chacha Bhatija is complete sort of, you know, two tricksters and things of that kind. And within themselves, they are fully consistent. So that's one point. The other point is, there is some cultural context to, you know, where the film is being made and who's watching it. And I sometimes think that while there is a lot of universal sort of thing about watching a good film, good cinema everywhere, I mean, a good cinema being good cinema everywhere. So a good example of this is this, you know, this Man, Woman and Child, this Eric Segal's book and then that was made into a film and Shekhar Kapoor made it into Masoom. Had he kept that ending of Man, Woman and Child in India, it would have been, you know, it was not a mega box office hit, but it was a very well received popular film. But I mean, again, this is 40 years back, so no spoilers here. So, you know, in the original book, the Jugal Hansraj character doesn't stay back. He is sent off to the, you know, the boarding school, although the mother, you know, accepts the fact that he's there, but he goes back. Whereas in Masoom, they accept Jugal Hansraj and he stays back as part of the family. I think, you know, that you could not have done that. And maybe in the US, Indian ending would have felt ki yeh kuch zyada kar diya, yaar aisa koi nahi karta hai. Whereas in India, we needed that at the end, that emotional sort of closure. I mean, I would not have accepted that film if they would have sent him back. But you would have thought about it more after it was over. Maybe, but I would have been so disgusted with the idea that they sent him back. Because I mean, you know, at different times in that film, you're so invested in the, in that boy and you know, his story and everything. You didn't want anything bad to happen. I mean, I remember that film, even I think I watched it five, six years back, not the whole film, there was something was happening, I was just watching it, there is a particular scene at the later part, in the later part of the film where this young Jugal actually, you know, cuts his hand with a knife. And he winces in pain and immediately runs, but he knows that he's not having, you know, Shabana's sympathy in any case. And Shabana looks at him, he wants to tell her, but then he knows that he will get no sympathy. So he just puts his hand behind and doesn't tell that he's actually cut his hand, right? It really broke my heart even after so many years while watching that. Uske baad agar usko phir bhej doge, I would have never accepted the film. So I think there are certain choices, which some of the directors will have to, you know, offer based on just what they think is right for themselves, because they are, they are part of a particular milieu, they have grown up in a particular cultural context, and they know their audience. And in some of them, I think we will be different. And therefore, there is some merit in saying that Indian films will be of a certain kind. I mean, some of us, maybe you Amit, might not otherwise have that Indian sensibility in general, because of the, you know, some of your, you know, past, etc. Par logon ko chahiye yaar wo."

Masoom is actually somewhat difficult to classify film in some ways, but yeah, broadly speaking, it is from a tradition of the dramatic, the emotion soaked film, even though it's got Naseer and Shabana in it, and it was made in that period. But around the same time, the stuff that Shyam Vennigal was making, or Govind Elani was making, was, of course, representative of a different Indian aesthetic or sensibility. And of course, that's without even getting into the many non-Hindi films from around the country. So of course, that's, and today, of course, as you know, there's just so many different types of Indian films or web series or whatever from the 200 crore blockbusters that we think of as sort of catering to the lowest common denominator or whatever, to the Hindi film, to the South Indian films, whatever, it's just so much. So I'm not sure there really is such a thing as an Indian film in that sense anymore."

To Money Call ki Uski Roti TV pe aaye, I assume it was one of these Tosca things, film aaye abhi toh dekhna hai. And so they sat down, they're watching the film and suddenly the screen freezes. A few seconds pass, the screen is frozen. So immediately, boy is dispatched upstairs, uncle is leaning out of the window, the boy is moving the antenna here and there and shouting, theek hua ki nahi, and uncle is saying nahi thora left try karo, thora right try karo. After half an hour they discover antenna ka fault nahi tha, TV ka fault nahi tha, it was a film. So ki Money Call ne waise hi banayi. And all I remember of Uski Roti is that the sound was out of sync at one point and I asked my father what's going on because I must have been watching it with him back then."

And very poor projection, generally the International Film Festival of India was going on. But because this is a Goddard film, and we were all primed for, we had seen Goddard films. At one point, the screen sort of just goes completely out of whack, you know, this is sort of it becomes like a split screen with part of it going down and the bottom half going to the top half, etc. And we sat there for two minutes, sort of around 80% sure it was deliberate. It was part of the film, you know, just sitting with this sort of this hallowed sort of expression on our faces. It's the reverse Narendra Nooyi story. And then of course, it got corrected.

There were good films, I mean, you didn't have to do what Bresson was doing in India with this. You could still make good, good films. I mean, I never understood that phase, for instance, you know, I can watch an interview of Mrinal Sen or whatever Calcutta 71, I mean, but, you know, watching Uski Roti again is very tough.

And then a few other people started sort of, you know, commenting on his blog. And then, you know, things came together. And then, you know, the idea was, we'll do something called Passion for Cinema. And I think, you know, both of you, I used to follow both of your blogs at that time. It was a moment for blogging in India, right, with everyone doing something interesting in that, I think the two of you, there was Sepia Mutiny, and I used to follow all of them. So, we, seven, eight of us initially started writing. And everyone had a particular niche. My kind of niche was sort of humorous take on sort of social issues through the lens of some old Hindi film or song or something and then do random connections in between Pyaasa and some other, you know, film. And then I used to have this sort of a, you know, character called Professor, you know, who would answer questions of people. And so, somebody would ask a question on what is noir and the professor, I mean, it would all be sort of laced with some kind of humor and, you know, that kind of stuff. But you know, seven, eight of us would write. And then what happened was, just because that there was that kind of a platform that platform was gaining salience, some people started coming in and writing and one of the big names and not big then, but clearly someone who had a point of view at that point in time was Anurag Kashyap, who came in and started writing, so he had his own corner. And you know, he came and wrote firstly about the making of Black Friday and just the fact that it wasn't released for a long period of time. And he wrote it really well, I mean, just you could feel the angst of a person who has made something good, but was not getting a release and if you sort of combined it with the fact that Punch was not released as well before that, I think it touched a sort of, you know, chord with a whole lot of people. So, you know, just started getting a large number of people reading it. And then since all of us were also writing stuff, you know, people started engaging with other content, and then just it just took off, I mean, you know, by the sort of sixth or the seventh month, we were getting more than a million page views and stuff. I mean, we would then sort of write in started, at least I am always ready to play to the gallery, start writing stuff so that you could get 100 comments and you know, those became metrics that how to write so that you get 100 comments, I have a complete Manmohan Desai at heart. So, it was great fun and then, you know, because of Anurag, others started coming in, you know, gradually you had, you know, Navdeep, Sudhir Mishra, you know, and then, you know, people would write about some of their iconic work and how that got made. So, it just started becoming a bit of, you know, history, process of filmmaking, and we started running a one minute short festival, people would upload their short films and someone Anurag and others would judge it. Some of the guys who won that then would get an internship with Anurag and some of them became big, you know. And so, that whole thing between 2007 to 2009 was just phenomenally, you know, energizing I mean, and there's just so much of talent coming in. And maybe it was always the case that Bombay was attracting some kind of talent, but you know, just that platform made it somewhat more democratic than what it was in the past. In the past, you would stand outside famous studio, Mehboob studio, RK studio, bribe the watchman and then go in and have a cup of tea and try and, you know, get an audience. But here, you know, somebody could come in, do something, write a good, I mean, there have been cases of that kind, right? People would come, write something good, write two, three times and something and then Anurag would say, let's have a Bombay meetup and then people would land up there and some two other filmmakers or young filmmakers would come and then two of them would click and this guy would start assisting him, which is exactly what happened with Neeraj for instance, it's exactly how Varun possibly wrote a few things and got in and a lot of other cases. I mean, the early, in the early days, Chaitanya Tamhane, all these people were there, Rajkumar, what's Rajkumar's full name now, the guy who made No One Killed Jessica, I forget the name."

Ho raha tha sab kuch, maza raha tha, people were bouncing off ideas with one another, you know, people are getting breaks and stuff of that kind. So, I mean, my general sort of role in all of this was, like, I've always seen myself as a consumer than creator. But I sort of fancied that I could write a little bit reasonably well. And since others were doing stuff, so sometimes, yeah, the thought did cross my mind ke kuch karte hain aisa. But, you know, you should have a good, strong enough pull. All my interests that I had in films and everything, I just never was pulled strongly enough. By pull, you mean your internal desire? Internal desire. Because, I mean, whatever work I was doing, I could see a lot of people were not, they used to be deeply unsatisfied with just the regular work that they were doing, which, for whatever reason, never happened to me. So, I could never go down that path eventually. But I got to know a lot of these people, peripherally, sometimes directly. And a lot of them in the course of the next three, four years after that, and then, you know, the passion for cinema had to shut down because like most good things, creative people together, then they started fighting. The whole idea was at the core of it, should we be controlling for quality on what comes on the site or not? And which way should we go down? Should we start raising funds and funding our own independent cinema? All of these things happened, including pitch books were made. Some of my background in that was useful to raise funds to say that we'll make our kinds of film and all of that. Could have happened, something could have happened if we went down that path, because they were just reasonably talented people in the mix. But, you know, it was always, I mean, whatever, ego battles and stuff. So, after three years or so, it shut down, four years almost. But those four years were very good. I mean, quite exhilarating. And I think in some ways, in whatever small way, I think it contributed a fair amount to Indian films. At least I can name 15 or 20 people today who have come out of passion for cinema who actually are directly involved in the Hindi cinema, whatever in Bollywood, and doing fairly good work. So, and a lot of film critics also, some of their early work was there. I remember, I mean, I do not want to name them, but a lot of them started writing first on the PFC site. So, that was my brush with the Versova crowd. I kept in touch, I still am in touch, although it's becoming more and more distant. Many of them have done so well that it's difficult to sometimes find time. I've also kind of moved and, you know, in my career, so it's tough. Looking back, I think, you know, there was a, it would have shut down on its own. Blogging was a certain point in time kind of a thing, phenomena, and it would have, Twitter was already there, and it was starting to disrupt this. But maybe if we had transitioned onto something as a platform, with funding and stuff of that kind, we could have had, we could have done something. We could have been contenders. But hua nahi. But for me, that was a lot of my, you know, bachpan ka all the sapna and everything of being on a film set, you know, meeting people who actually do make films. I think wo sab satisfy ho gaya. I mean, I could never imagine that this was possible. Although I must tell you that in the first year or so when I came to Bombay, the keeda was so strong that I did all the stuff. I went and met Babbar Subhash B. Subhash, who directed movies like Disco Dancer Tarzan. I mean, I just love the guy. I'm just, so I went and met him. I have like all kinds of stories of meeting him. I somehow found my way into catching up with Bappi Lahiri. I mean, this Dance Dance, Kasam Pehda Karne Wale, these are like, you know, people later, I mean, it sort of became like you should like them because it's of one kind. I genuinely watched these films with full enthusiasm."

So, there is this early in the film, I mean, this is Dance Dance is a story of Mithun, you know, as a child, I mean, their parents are sort of killed off by Amrish Puri. And because they go to Amrish Puri's mansion, and they start and they're like dancers and singers and Amrish Puri takes fancy to the woman and then he knocks off both of them after that. And so Mithun and his sister who turns out to be Smita Patil later, they are left on their own in Bombay. And so then they have to sort of make a living. So they start dancing in Chowpatty, Mithun starts dancing. And, you know, people put money and stuff. And then there is a Halwawala who comes in, and then the Halwawala gives them Halwa. I've never seen on a Bombay Chowpatty Halwawala ever. But you know, it's tribute to Babar Subhash that he could think of Halwawala. Not just that he thought of Halwawala, he even decided that he will put a Halwawala song in it. And that became the iconic song called Aagaya Aagaya Halwawala Aagaya. And somewhere in that film, just at that early stage, this Smita Patil older sister character tells Mithun that agar tujhe halwa khana hai, toh tujhe naachna hoga. Dance, dance."

I mean, before that, before coming into the passion for cinema kind of circle and meeting these people, I mean, I had paid my homage to a lot of these things by being at those places where these famous films were shot. You know, I don't know, maybe you folks who've lived in Bombay long or who were in Bombay before, you know, just going down that Marine Drive the first time, and if you're a film fan or you've watched films, you know, it's a different feeling. I mean, pehli baar, you've seen this so many times. You've seen this in Leke Pehla Pehla Pyar, Bharke Aankhon Mein Kawar. From then, Devanand walking down Marine Drive, to Amitabh, Rote Huye Aate Hai Saab, to Rajni Gandha, Kai Baar Yung Hi Dekha Hai, Jo Man Ki Seema Rekha Hai, to, you know, Rim Jim Gire Sawan. I mean, there are, it's like, the first time I came into Bombay, and the first time I went to Nariman Point, in fact, my office was at Express Towers. And I, you know, before reaching office itself, I was like, you know, I was overwhelmed. Because there are just so many scenes that, you know, you have seen the same drive. But I did all of that, and I went to different places, RK Studios and stuff like that. But passion for cinema became a medium where I could actually directly interact with people, see the shoots and everything. Somehow, it also took away something. Once you demystify the thing, man, it becomes somewhat less... The making of the sausage. It somewhat becomes less magical. In fact, there is a thing that from 2012, 13, 14, the intensity with which I would follow cinema, etc. started, you know, ebbing. Maybe there was also because of other things in life, you know, having a family and things of that kind. But, and now it is definitely, it's not at the level that it was 10, 12 years back.

And how much of a factor is that trade-off? And I imagine anybody who wants to be a filmmaker, there's both of these matter. One, the pull can be so intensely strong that you are like, I can't do anything else in life. But if the pull is not strong, the push could still be strong in the sense that your job could suck so bad. Or you're so fed up in your family business. Or you're so fucking useless at other things, you don't have a job. That you're saying, okay, I'll do this. And the opportunity cost is not that high as it were.

I mean, you know, in the sense that it's they would have just not been able to do anything else. That was never the case with me. And therefore, that itself solves for the problem. The second is, of course, you know, how badly you feel trapped in whatever you're doing. And some of that how badly you feel trapped in what you're doing is a matter of pull also. But sometimes, like you said, the opportunity cost is nothing. You know, you feel so terrible in what you're doing. And maybe what you're doing, you're also bad at it, that you go down that path. I mean, I've never thought of that that often. I mean, there are some other like, sometimes I do feel writing something, I mean, maybe even just a script or, you know, writing a book or something. I feel that if one had given some time to that, I might have, I don't know whether I might have been good at it, but I think I would have done something well, you know, something good as part of doing that, you know, getting into that. Overall filmmaking, I don't know. I think that phase has gone. I don't regret or I don't have any what if kind of thinking in my mind. At that point in time, for a period of time, it was there. But now it's gone, it's gone. Will it come back? I think the writing thing is definitely going to come back. Filmmaking, I don't know. It's like I said, the intensity with which I feel for cinema now is much lower than what it was in the past. So that's one of the things that I think is permanent almost now.

And perhaps the diminishing of intensity may also come with a calmness of vision and a terror that could also lead to something. So I'll ask you another question. And this, in a sense, is for both of you. And partly because, you know, many of the people will, you know, that I'll ask about personally. But also to really to both of you, because you have also seen Indian cinema evolve. And you mentioned how passion for cinema at the start wanted to be like a Kayyadu cinema, right? So there's a great Andrew Cyrus quote about Andre Bazin, who was one of the founders of Kayyadu cinema. And Cyrus wrote, quote, Bazin was the antithesis of Russian film theorist and director Sergei Eisenstein, who posited that film didn't become film until it was sliced up and served montage style. Eisenstein advocated for the collision of images and conflict of classes in films. Bazin believed that film should be smooth and needn't be so socially weighty. He felt that film should have a realism to them. He focused on mise-en-scene as opposed to montage, stop quote. And the sort of the progress that this indicates is, I think, also a way in which young filmmakers would mature. In the sense that when you first want to make a film, you're very conscious of it being slick. And maybe you're influenced by, you know, maybe Nolan, as JSA Today's kids are, or before that, Tarantino and so on. And style matters a lot for its own sake. And at the same time, you want big ideas, you want weighty films. But I would imagine that as time goes by and you mature, you don't necessarily want to do that anymore. You just want to let stories tell themselves and, you know, you kind of move to a different sort of place. So, you know, with the filmmakers you've known, for example, and you've known guys who've, you know, made a journey and evolved a lot in their own way. You know, for example, I love Chaitanya Tamane's work. I think he's just mind-blowingly good. Court must be one of the best first films ever made. And equally, I think there was a phase where a lot of young directors would possibly have been in the thrall of stylists and trying to, you know, make films in a particular kind of way. And, you know, maybe they would have grown, maybe they did grow, maybe the ecosystem changed overall. So what's your kind of sense of the journey that, you know, these filmmakers have made and that films themselves have made in India?"

Oi Lucky Lucky Oi is a much more fast paced film that draws attention to the nuts and bolts of its construction. Khosla Ka Ghosla is more in the tradition of the Rishi Keshmukherji, Basu Chatterjee, middle cinema, where everything is at the service of storytelling. And to my mind, I mean, I love Oi Lucky Lucky Oi, I like it better than Khosla Ka Ghosla. And I think even something like LST, where Dibakar sort of then allowed himself to sort of just get experimental and sort of bordering on avant-garde, you know, by the standards of the cinema. Like you said, it represents a movement in the opposite direction from what Amit suggested just now. But again, I don't think it's, you know, it was to his detriment as a filmmaker, it just meant that he was doing, he was trying different things out.

But I just want to point out that that Bazin quote was also very sort of explicitly directed at these ideas that the Russians, Eisenstein in particular, had about montage and the idea that film acquires meaning only when different unrelated images are placed next to each other. Like the lions in the Odessa, the step sequence and stuff like that. Whereas what Bazin was doing, and this is still very early, relatively early in the 1940s or 50s, but Bazin was pointing to filmmakers like Renoir, etc. Who didn't need to use montage in that way, who very often had gliding cameras, long takes, but still it wasn't theatrical. It was still very much cinema because the camera was still choosing what to show you, etc. So a lot of editing and a lot of cuts was not required, but it was still a different form of cinema. And I think if you're sort of moving that binary to the current day, 70 years later, I think it can sort of lead us down to some very sweeping generalized statements about directors and their trajectories. I think the Barker, I'm glad that example came up because he really is, in addition to being a filmmaker of a certain quality, even in his lesser work or whatever we might agree his lesser work might be, he's just done all sorts of things. And he hasn't, his career in terms of what he's done stylistically, his stylistic or formal choices, has not followed any clearly observable trajectory in either direction. He just seems to sort of just pick his subjects, his mode of storytelling, and then go with it. So Khosla Ka Ghuzla can be followed by LSD, which can then be followed by, again, a relatively straightforward narrative film like Shanghai, and then something like Biyomkesh Bakshi. Again, irrespective of what we think the quality of the films is, just talking about the way they are filmed, the style of it. So again, I think it's just, you know, if a filmmaker makes an honest decision based on the subject that he has, and how he feels he given his own sensibility, how he feels that subject is best tackled, then I don't think one should sort of, you know, really, really, really get judgmental in either direction about, you know, either the Eisenstein principle or the Bazin principle."

Whereas in Kurosawa's case, of course, everything serves a film and what he's doing, and there is great style, but everything serves sort of the substance. But before we get back to Subrata, I have a question for you, Jai, which is, is it pronounced Bazin? I'm not sure. Because Andr\u00e9 Bazin, so I thought I was being damn sophisticated."

And partly one reason why Tokyo story is just sort of an aside really, I tend not to, you know, rate Tokyo story as highly as most people do is simply because I'm a huge fan of a 1937 Hollywood film called Make Way for Tomorrow, which, which is a film that influenced Osu when he was making Tokyo story. And it's arguably the first major film that deals with the subject of, of elderly parents being neglected by their children and sort of looking forward to a life of, you know, of neglect and just, just being alone by themselves. So it's a lovely, very atypical film directed by Leo Macare from 1937 and Tokyo story owes something to it. So, so because of my for special fondness for that film, I just sort of feel like, you know, there are other Osus that I prefer personally, but, but yeah, back to what you were saying."

But it's very spare, very to the point about the way this, you know, that that typical tatami mat angle of Ozu, you know, with the camera barely moving or moving maybe two or three times in the whole film. It's just used to just observe the society with the shifting equations within a family with, and maybe because I'm sort of I'm Indian myself, there's things about it that I could relate to. The whole joint family set up, some of the themes that emerge in Hindi cinema, when it comes to these subjects, arranged marriages, things like that.

There's so much of that and yeah, you know, when you have things like that, that, you know, at film appreciation, you know, you're appreciating a film on those terms. Then, of course, you're looking at a film that has completely different strengths from a film made by a Godard or a Felony or a Kurosawa.

So, in modern times, do you think that there is a greater scope for young filmmakers to develop in unusual directions, which may not depend on what their peers or the people they're working with are doing? For example, we're talking about Ozu, and earlier I mentioned Tamhane's Kote, and you know, Kote has a lot of Ozu like characteristics of the still camera and things are just unfolding and all of that. And I can't imagine how a film like that could have come to, could have been made in the 1990s in India, for example. And today, I think something like that might even be more possible in the sense that the means of production have become so incredibly cheap, that really anybody can make a film. Like one film that I saw in Mami, which I loved is the Japanese film One Cut of the Dead, great horror film, which by Shinichiro Ueda, which was made for the equivalent of 20 lakh rupees. And it ended up grossing more than 200 crores, you know, and obviously an outlier in that sense. But in the sense that a today the means of production have become much cheaper, it's much easier for someone who wants to do audio visual storytelling to say, I'll do something on YouTube, I'll do a vlog first, I'll experiment, I'll do this, I'll do that. So the big bottleneck as far as I see in the film industry, in my naive understanding is really distribution more than anything else. You know, the filmmaking part and, and also because, you know, you learn something by doing it, and it's so much easier to do something. So one, there is that. And two, there is also the matter that now influences from everywhere are pouring in, you no longer need to be say in a particular theater in Calcutta at a particular point in time to be exposed to good cinema. Good cinema is all around you. In fact, just leaving the term cinema aside, good audio visual content is all around you can get inspired by anywhere. So do you think that there, you know, that one should therefore be hopeful about a greater diversity of influences and therefore styles and growth in young Indian filmmakers today?"

But, but I always sort of find myself disagreeing when, when, you know, there's a certain sort of nostalgic, you know, talk on social media about how, you know, the films that used to be made earlier are not made now. And I feel like we are living in an age where pretty much any sort of film can get made and is getting made to some degree or the other. Now, of course, like you also pointed out, it's a distribution or the right sort of publicity is a different matter. There'll be, there'll obviously be with the amount of material there is and the amount of content there is now, there will always be films that, that many people won't even notice or won't realize are available out there. I'm regularly sort of, you know, I'll, I'll see someone mention something on Facebook about a film that's on Amazon Prime, that's on Prime or Netflix or whatever, which I didn't even realize was there or existing, despite the fact that this is partly my job to know about these things. But, but I think already we are in the situation where all sorts of films are being made, all sorts of, there's probably a greater variety of approaches, you know, currently than there has been at any time in the past, you know, in terms of the different, different aesthetics, different approaches to form and content, everything. So, so, so I think that's already happening. And of course, in terms of the means available, you know, you have internationally, I suppose in India also, but internationally you have, you have a filmmaker of the stature of Steven Soderbergh shooting a film on a phone and a good film, you know, a film with an A-list star like Claire Foy, I'm talking about this film called Unsane, which was shot on an iPhone, directed by Steven Soderbergh, starring Claire Foy and solid feature film that just sort of works as a, as a very immersive experience.

        "message": "There we are entering very subjective territory, you know, once we start talking about underappreciated films or filmmakers, then everything, you know, I was going to, this sounds funny now, but Buster Keaton, okay, who, you know, most knowledgeable film viewers today, or, you know, people who know anything about film history actually regard him, quite rightly, in my view, as one of the most important figures in film history. There's a revisionist thinking now that places him above Chaplin, which I don't quite agree with, but I see the point because Keaton was known for his deadpan expressions and his lack of emotion, expressiveness, his athleticism, whereas Chaplin was more about the pathos and so on. And when we're living in a time where that sort of drama, melodrama is out of fashion, as mentioned, so it's easy to see why Keaton is so highly regarded, but he was an absolute great who was neglected for several decades. And yet, you know, if you were to ask me about some of my favorite underappreciated films, I might actually mention Keaton for no better reason than because so many people, and I'm not just talking about young people. The snappers who don't even know who Chaplin is because he was before Nolan. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, there's so many people have no idea about Keaton and his importance. And, you know, so I would probably I might even name one of his films as, you know, an underappreciated film that needs to be rediscovered. So that's a subjective thing. So if you, you know, if you were to ask something like that, Peter Weir is actually a pretty good name, I think, because he's really not."

Yeah, but again, I think he's been I mean, I would still sort of put him under the underappreciated category right now. I mean, if you take, I think that day, we were sort of just we just alluded to the, you know, the hanging rock film. It's like, I mean, the way it's done, plus, you know, just the meta point around these white men, not white people not understanding that the land that they are in has this other mysterious stuff that happens, etc. He did it really well. I mean, that that film really holds, I would say, I think I watched it again, some 7-8 years back. It really holds and that other one, Mel Gibson, Gallipoli, about the war. Gibson is just amazing. Nobody considers Gibson amazing these days. Politically wrong statement."

        "message": "Well, you've pretty much put an end to my plan of naming John Ford as one of the underappreciated filmmakers. But the reason I say that, of course, he's, you know, in his time, and again, for knowledgeable people, one of the most iconic directors of all time. Well, also, but that's the least sort of interesting thing about him. But today, you know, he's so out of fashion, because there's this, in my view, very unfair, you know, I had a long, long chat once with our mutual friend Girish about this. Ford just is out of favour in so many liberal, quote, unquote, liberal circles, because many people, including people who should know better people like Quentin Tarantino, have just got him pigeonholed as someone who just made these racist films about cowboys killing Indians, and Indians reserving it. And you go back and actually look at his filmography, look at it closely, you see much more nuance than that, in addition to, you know, him just being a very important filmmaker who influenced people like Orson Welles and Kurosawa, etc. But, you know, so on one level, it would be laughable to refer to John Ford as an underappreciated filmmaker, because he's one of the most well known directors of all time in most film circles, knowledgeable film circles. But in this context that I'm discussing, you could probably sort of, you know, name even someone like him. But to give perhaps a more satisfactory answer to your question, looking at someone contemporary, there's one filmmaker, as you know, you know, one of the most revitalizing things for me personally has been getting into contemporary Malayalam cinema and to a slightly lesser degree Tamil cinema in the last few years. You know, in your 40s, to suddenly discover a completely new filmic culture and to sort of start engaging with it the same way that I was engaging with Kurosawa, etc. as an adolescent, that's very empowering, it's exciting, you know, it sort of makes you feel alive again as a film buff. But even within Malayalam cinema, which tends to be somewhat, you know, rooted, grounded compared to the mainstream Hindi cinema, there's a filmmaker named Don Palathara, who I have a lot of regard for. He's even within the world of Malayalam cinema, he's someone who's a bit of an outlier. You know, he works outside even the, what might be called the mainstream of Malayalam cinema. He's made five films so far, I've watched all but one of them. And he just has this very distinct sensibility where, you know, you just sort of watch his films and you get a sense of honesty, that, you know, here's someone who's just being true to what he sort of wants to do without any sort of frails or without being influenced by the outside world. Most of his films are in black and white, by the way, very, very resting black and white. One film of his that I really, really liked, even though it's the sort of film that some people might find pretentious or problematic in terms of, you know, if you look at it in a very superficial sense, you know, from the gender lens, it's a film called Everything is Cinema, which both in terms of the title and in terms of the treatment of the film could easily be a 1960s Goddard film. It's just, you know, a story about a documentary filmmaker whose face we never see and who was voiced by Palathara himself. So, it's got this meta quality. He's in Calcutta to shoot a documentary along the lines of Louis Mal's Calcutta film and he's there with his wife and then the lockdown happens in 2020. So, they are basically stuck. They can't go out and do their research, etc., any shooting, etc. They are stuck in one room together, in one little flat together. And then, you know, the whole film basically just takes the form of this guy whose face we never see. We only hear his voiceover, pointing his camera repeatedly at his wife, you know, he's getting fed up of her. They are sort of cloistered together and, you know, saying these extremely, you know, chauvinistic things about her, criticizing her, you know, just saying things like that. And it's such an interesting film in terms of what it, you know, this perspective it provides of the nastiest aspects of the male gaze or whatever it is. Plus, it's got this experimental side to it because of the very nature of the filmmaking, the handheld camera, the meta-ness of it. It's very interesting. It was along with all of Palathara's films, it was on Mubi India. I don't know if it still is. It might be. But that's one example of someone who, even within the world of Malayalam cinema, I feel he's someone who's just so interesting and should get a wider audience at some point."

Definitely an underseen film compared to a lot of the major noir films of that time. It's a B movie, generally regarded as a B movie called Gun Crazy. Which is interesting in particular because it's nearly 20 years before Bonnie and Clyde. And it's very much, it's one of the prototypes of the couple on the run film. The couple sort of operating outside the law on the run. And it does some very interesting things with location, for a film made in 1949. It does some very interesting things with location shooting, with long takes. There's one, there's one shot. Coincidentally, I mentioned the Palathara film just now, which is a single take shot from the front of a car. Gun Crazy has a bank heist, which is shot exclusively from the back of the car that the couple are sort of, you know. They park outside the bank and then he goes in and so on. It's a very unusual long take for that period. So that would be one on my list as well. You mentioned Lady Eve. Now if you're talking about Preston Sturges, I'm a huge fan of Sullivan's Travels. Which of course is the film that the Coen brothers referenced in O Brother, Where Art Thou? Because that title appears in Sullivan's Travels for the first time. There's so many others. There are the westerns of, you know, I know there's a very strong Hollywood film bias going on here over a certain period. But the westerns made by Anthony Mann in the early 50s with Jimmy Stewart, films like Winchester 73 and Bend of the River. Which were just such interesting films, you know, psychological westerns as you'd call them. Which where the accent is a little less on action and shootouts and a little more on characters and their interactions."

Although in Shaheed, Vatan Ke Vaaste Vatan Ke Naujawas Shaheed Ho was a Rafi song. But Talat was singing quite often for Dilip Kumar. In fact, almost the voice of Dilip Kumar in the early 50s. And in Andaz, Jhoom Jhoom Ke Nacho, Aaj Tu Kahe Agar, etc. were all Mukesh songs, which was picturized on Dilip Kumar. And some of those early V Shantaram films also of 1940s are quite good."

Also because there's an excellent print of it available online. Gulzaaz Mere Apne, which is a 1971 film. And of course, we were talking about Haal Chaal Theek Thaak Hai sometime back. That's the name of the song in Mere Apne, which is a very hard hitting commentary on various things, various problems that the country was facing at that time in 1970-71. And as is so often the case, you know, when we are living in the present moment, there's this tendency to sort of, you know, the recency bias or whatever, to think that the problems we are facing today are exclusively of today. And very often it's quite surprising to go back and look at a film made 50 or 60 or 70 years ago and see the same things being talked about. I don't know if, I don't remember now if I have in our previous talk, if I mentioned this wonderful 1953 film called, 1952 film called Mr. Sampath, which was a\u2026"

I mean, this is, I mean, the plot is like, you know, there is a village, and there is like the whole village ecosystem, panchayat, and there is a particular event that triggers chaos there, you know, which is, and it's a nicely done thing. Everybody then starts suspecting that people are jockeying for things. Great songs, of course, O Sajna Barkha Bahar Hai, Saril in just peak form. But that's a good movie. There's a movie called Uche Log. Again, I recommend that this is a movie made by a very old sort of director of the 30s who was still working then called Fani Majumdar. And Uche Log is a copy of a Tamil, you know, play called Major Chandrakant, K. Balachandra had written that. Ashok Kumar and Feroz Khan, Feroz Khan in one of his early films. It's like a good story. Has one great Rafi song, Jaag Dil Hai Deewana. Do you sing? No, no, I don't sing. Please don't tell. Otherwise, I would have asked you to sing a little bit of it. I mean, it's just, it's Chitragupt, the father of Anand Meland. There, his music and Majrooh's lyrics. But the film is great. I mean, if you just, you know, if you can't watch it, just read the plot somewhere, I mean, on IMDb or something. It's a great plot. I mean, to have made that film in the 60s. Fani Majumdar, by the way, I mean, just to go back into time, in the 30s, Calcutta was a big hub of Indian with new theaters, right? So there was this guy called B. N. Sarkar. B. N. Sarkar was a sort of, you know, aristocratic feudal sort of a guy with a lot of land and everything. He had gone to London, studied in wherever, Cambridge, etc. And he was very fascinated by films. So he came back to India and he set up this new theater. And then he just decided that all good talent should come here. So, and the fact that there was generally this whole Bengali renaissance, etc. So there were people who were writing, listening to music and all that. So some of the earliest playback stuff, music and all of that was done in Calcutta with new theaters. So there was this three guys, Raychand Bural, R. C. Bural, Timir Baran. So these couple of people came in and they started playing. I mean, they started actually giving playback music. And till then, the classical Indian music has no concept of harmony. There is no guitar in the sense, right? So it's like monotonic, a single instrument or two instruments going. So in that sense, R. C. Bural was actually almost the pioneer of bringing the notion of music in that sense of having harmony and different instruments and getting organs and all of that into this."

And Wajid Ali Shah, if you remember, he was not necessarily interested in all this statecraft, warfare, etc. Loses Awadh. And he's famously that guy whose portraits always have him exposing his left nipple. So then they exile him to Calcutta. And then while going, he writes this Babul Mora Nahi Aur Chhuto Na, meaning I'm leaving this. And of course, going back to the biryani story, Wajid Ali Shah is the reason why Calcutta Biryani has the potatoes. Why? Because they came in here. He was living off a British pension. So they wanted to add substance as the story goes. Nobody knows this for a fact. So they wanted to add a little bit of weight to the biryani. They didn't have enough meat. So they started adding potatoes. So Wajid Ali Shah came to Calcutta, started living in a particular place, brought in two iconic Calcutta dishes, the Calcutta Biryani. And there is something, if you go to Calcutta, there is something called the Rezala. Rezala is a particular kind of chicken or mutton dish. Both were brought in by Wajid Ali Shah.

Lucas, Kubrick, Altman. So, I mean. Prakash Mehra. Prakash Mehra as well. But, you know, it's funny that, I think, Spielberg also at the time. So, it's funny that Spielberg and Scorsese, who, I mean, Spielberg always knew some kind of a thing about the pulse of the mass. And I think he was very good at that and not too sort of taken in by vision, etc. And very sort of that kind of a guy. And I think Scorsese, because his films were in some sense very sort of internal. They're always biopic like with story of a person. I mean, everything. I mean, including some of his names of his films are also very sort of. Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Aviator, so on and so forth. So, I think that's why they kind of, whereas the two guys, whereas Coppola was big theme guy. And I think once the time went, those themes didn't resonate. And the other guy was, I think, Palmer, who was very style sort of driven guy. I think when the style went, I think he got a little dated. He could not keep up with the style. But during those times, those guys just did fantastic work."

So, one of the films, for instance, is The Missouri Breaks, which has Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson, which is directed by Arthur Penn, which is a quite interesting film. It's not really a major work in that sense. But what is interesting that is also Scarecrow with Gene Hackman and the very young Al Pacino, which is interesting that some of these that are worth looking at. When Coppola was sort of, when he was being set up as the leader of this group of directors, Peter Bogdanovich was right up there with it, except that Bogdanovich, of course, he made two or three very acclaimed films and then he sort of faded."

But that isn't it, because there's another much more recent film that I love is Mad Max Fury Road, which I think was just a wonderful film. No qualification at all that it's a wonderful action film. But jokes about Christopher Nolan aside, because obviously the guy has a lot of strengths, etc. One of the problems I have with his Batman films is that the action sequences in them are so cluttered. I very often just can't make sense of them. I can't make sense of them at the level of where is one character in relation to the other character. There's such a thing as doing chaos deliberately, which is a different thing. But with some of the action sequences in Christopher Nolan's films, including the Dark Knight and so on, I just get the impression that it's just messy because he hasn't been able to declutter it. And then when I look at something like Mad Max Fury Road or The Terminator 2, those are examples to my mind of really clean action films where you're getting the thrill and the adrenaline and there's a lot going on at the same time. But you know exactly what's happening at all the time."

Then I thought that shit, why did I volunteer myself for this? And I didn't really feel like choosing five. And also I keep talking about films, so I don't want to go through the same ones ki Decalogue achha hai, yeh achha hai, woh achha hai. I've spoken so much about films. So I decided to narrow the focus down so sharply that it becomes easy to choose. So I narrowed the focus to films that I watched at Mummy over the last three, four years. World Cinema that I discovered there. So very quickly, these are the films I'd recommend. There's a very fine film called Wild, directed by Nicolette Krebitz. Have you seen it? So it's a lovely film about this woman who's, it's a German film, who's in the city and she's got a bad job and her boss is an asshole. And she's kind of fed up. And once in a while, she'll go out into the woods, into the forest and all of that. And through a mysterious turn of events, she kidnaps a wolf. And she gets a wolf back in her apartment with her. And I think the wolf, if I remember correctly, is kind of serrated when she manages to bring it back, but obviously snaps out of that state. And now there's a lot of work. She's got to feed the wolf. She's got to build a relationship with the wolf. She's got to make sure the wolf doesn't kill her. And it's very interesting how it develops. It's a very interior psychological kind of film. I mean, this is a real wolf, it's not a wolf played by Andy Serkis. No, no, it's a real wolf. And it's a lovely film. Sexual overtones and all that. And it's a very, it's a very, you know, a different kind of film. Just to have the courage to conceive of it and then make it so well, kind of really impressed me. Another film is actually a mainstream Hollywood film that didn't get any Oscar nominations, didn't make waves, which is very sad. It's called Waves. It's by a director called Trey Edward Schultz. And I thought it's an absolute masterpiece when I saw it. And it did get some rave reviews from some people I respect, but made absolutely no mark, either in the box office or at the Oscars or whatever. And it's a lovely film, which has two sort of rhythms to it. Like if you enjoy listening to, if you enjoy the part that music can play in a film really well, you know, you kind of get it here. Where the first half of the film about this young man who's, you know, pumped up and on adrenaline and all of that. The first half of the film, it's like the music is just driving it forward. There is this relentless propulsion that is happening. Till giving nothing away, the guy dies. And then the rest of the film follows his sister and how she copes with it. And it's very quiet, slow, lot of tear off. It's a sudden change in rhythm. And yet it's so beautiful. And these halves fit together so well. So I thought it was a masterpiece, but just went unnoticed by almost everyone. The third film, perhaps controversial, is Gaspar Noe's film Climax, which is about a bunch of people at a party. And somebody mixes psychedelic stuff in their drinks, I think LSD. And it just, it just goes nuts. And it's a film that doesn't have a logical plot from a point of view of things happening beyond what I just told you. It's kind of hard to describe. But they kind of, like, they kind of go mad. Everything goes crazy. And it's just so visceral. It's like you're sitting in a movie hall and everything about it, you know. And it's a very choreographed film in the sense there's a lot of movement. You know, the way everything comes together."

And again, it's one of those things where you just have to kind of sit back and experience it and leave your brain out of it. So if you misplace your brain, Jai, as you were saying you'll never do, you should probably watch this. And finally, a film I mentioned earlier in this episode, One Cut of the Dead by Shinichiro Ueda. Japanese horror film and it's like a film within a film. It's about a bunch of guys trying to make a single cut film and it's a horror film and what happens to them. And it is no other film that I have ever seen has communicated the joy of cinema better than this. I mean, at the surface level, it's a bunch of guys trying to make a film and taking joy in that. But the joy I got from sitting in the audience was kind of incredible. So I narrowed my gaze down to films I've seen at MAMI in the last five years. And these five would be, you know, among the ones that really hit me hard and moved me. So, yeah, that's my list."

It used to take a fair amount of production work, quite honestly, because we used to do it during the pandemic. It was at home and I was doing many much of that. I can't do that. So maybe we get a studio, we just come together and start and finish within three hours and that gets done. So that's, that's that. Again, I think I mean, there are some book recommendations. I mean, I like to read a lot, you know, people can..."

And I've built up quite a bank of people whose email IDs are on this mailing list of mine. And it's been fairly American cinema centric so far, and of the 30s, 40s, 50s, different genres. But I'm open to all sorts of conversations. And once a month or so, I try to have a solid online conversation. So if anyone wants to just follow me on either Facebook or Twitter or whatever, you'll get the information there. I usually put it up on my blog as well, Jabberwock, which is searchable if you just search with my name on Google. But yeah, so anyone who's really interested in conversations about films, very informal, free flowing conversations where everybody can participate, just show up there or just get in touch and all I need to do is put your mail ID on the list."
