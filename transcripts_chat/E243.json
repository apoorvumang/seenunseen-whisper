        "message": "Here's one way to think about journalism. It's a business driven by supply and demand. People want news, analysis, narratives, whatever. You form a publication that delivers and cater to what readers want. Your bottom line is the bottom line. Your dharma, as it were, is to your shareholders. Principles matter only to the extent that principles are in demand. You gotta be rational. You gotta stay solvent. That's one way of looking at it. But there are other impulses that can drive journalists. You can say that truth matters, especially in these polarized and complex times, and that searching for the truth has a value of its own. You can be driven by the urge to tell stories about the world that would otherwise be lost in the din. You can tell yourself that the world is often shaped by what we know of it. And therefore, it is important to seek out the full picture. And you may believe that enough people share this view for it to be worthwhile, for the bottom line also to be taken care of. As you would have guessed, I believe in the second school of thought. I believe we don't always have to follow our audiences and second guess what the political masters of this country may want. I believe journalists and storytellers can lead from the front, can form public opinion by informing public opinion, by relentlessly deepening our understanding of the truth. I admire the handful of people committed to this quest. One of them is my guest today."

        "message": "science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Barkha Dutt, a fearless and pioneering television journalist who's seen it all. She's been at the frontline of wars, terrorist attacks and pandemics. While others sit at home and pontificate or signal their virtue or wisdom on social media, Barkha goes out there and reports. She started in NDTV and after more than two decades there, has ended up forming Mojo Story, an indie outfit that is breaking new ground on YouTube. Her coverage of the pandemic over the last 16 months has been incredible. I enjoy chatting with Barkha and we spoke not just about journalism, the media, Indian politics and society, but also about her own self, how she has grown, what she has learned, how she now looks at the world and her place in it. She also has some great advice for young people who may be trying to figure out who they are and what they want to do. Before we begin this conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break. Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects I discovered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have a great program called Future Stack, which helps you stay up to date with ideas, skills, and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future. Future Stack batches start every Saturday. Also, check out their Social Capital Compound, which helps you master social media. What's more, you get a discount of a whopping 2,500 rupees 2,500 if you use the discount code UNSEEN. So head on over to CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com and use the code UNSEEN. Uplevel yourself. Barkha, welcome to the scene and the unseen."

But we finally managed to make the time and it's a Sunday. Now typically, I start by asking my guests about their childhood and how they grew up and all of that, which I will do for you also. But before that, I'm intrigued by what your routine must be and I'm sure all your viewers also must be intrigued at what is your workflow? What do you do on a Sunday?

There have been some other stories that I've turned my attention to. But otherwise, this has been a singular obsession for 16 months now. Sundays now are difficult days for me. Before my father died and my father died to COVID earlier this year, a few months ago. Sunday was the day that all of us gathered at the family house in a colony in Delhi called Changpura Extension. It's the house I lived in till I was 40 years old. And I lived with my dad in that house. He continued to stay there. And Sunday was always family lunch with my father. And we continue to gather even after he's gone at the house for lunch. And unless you know there's something catastrophic happening or I'm traveling in terms of work. And otherwise, that's it. I don't have the idea or the notion of a weekend. I work pretty much through most weekends. Other than the Sunday lunch, which is some sort of time out. My weekday and my weekend is not that distinct. But because I think my team does need more time off than I do. We do try and not do any show or broadcast on Sundays unless we're reporting and traveling."

What I find interesting when I chat with a guest of this vintage on the show is that we are the one generation that in a sense had to learn about the world twice. Like earlier we learned about it, you know, in the pre internet days through whatever we could get hold of. It was a question of what was accessible to us. You and I I think had fairly privileged childhoods access to books, all of that was there. But the world was, you know, remarkably close to us relative to how it is today. And then in my own case, there is another kind of learning about the world that happened when the internet came and you could, you know, you could read any book you wanted, you could get a wide cross section of opinions rather than have it come at you through specific gatekeepers and all that. And that's another kind of broadening. And we are the one generation that kind of went through this right the people before us, the internet came too late for them. And and those after us only know the world where all information is on your fingertips. And you don't have to, you know, scrounge to somehow get that cassette mixtape recorded that you've been trying to for months. So for that reason, I always find it interesting to learn about the childhoods of my guests. So what was your sort of childhood like? Where did you grow up? And you know, what did you do as a kid? What was your conception of yourself?"

        "message": "It's a really interesting question. And I think my childhood pretty mixed up, which might explain why my adulthood is just as mixed up. So I grew up in Delhi, but also partly in New York. So I had an atypical growing up for a middle class family, very middle class families, salaried employees as parents. My father worked with Air India as in the commercial and tourism department. And my mother was a journalist, pretty big trailblazer for her time, worked with the Hindustan Times. To the age of five, we lived in this neighborhood called Sujan Singh Park, which is, you know, next to Khan Market on a rented flat. And then my father's family, which had come in as refugees from what is now Pakistan during partition, they had been allotted a small little plot in Jankura extension, which was really a refugee colony. And my parents were able to build a house on that. And then from the age of five to 40, I pretty much lived in that house where I just spoke about having Sunday lunch. But in the interim, my father got a pretty longish posting with Air India to New York. And my mother, because she worked with the Hindustan Times here and did not want to give up her job, but then took a sabbatical, worked with the United Nations in New York. So we spent, my sister and I spent our early years shuttling between these two cities and actually studying in two schools simultaneously. So we studied in modern school in Delhi, and we studied in public school 99 in Kew Gardens, Queens in New York. And therefore, we had a pretty muddled, not a typical childhood, probably more global exposure than is possible for middle class Indians, especially those of us, you know, as you said, of this vintage. And equally, while in Delhi, still have very distinct memories of, you know, the one rupee book from the colony library, such as it was, the camel guy who would come around, the guy who would come around with swings, and you'd pay them and you know, you do those rides in front of your house, had a tire strung from a tree as you know, the swing that you could step out and, and play on. So it was a strange mix of a very typical, ordinary middle class home in terms of economics, but unconventional, at least for what my mother did for her time, and atypical for the global, somewhat westernized early exposure we had because of my father's postage. So I think there was a little bit of there was a kind of hodgepodge in the in the growing up."

And, you know, and your observations of them would have been partly from the outside and, and therefore, kind of more interesting than just, you know, one girl looking at another girl, but you've also got that extra layer there. So what did you feel when you looked around you at your friends at India? Did it in any sense, feel a constraint to be in Delhi after having lived in New York? What was that like?"

And when you asked me the question and I look back at my childhood, I think I was a misfit, not just because of this sort of bicultural upbringing, but also because of the way my personality was. And so before we come to what happened when I came back to Delhi, I grew up, you know, if there's any other city I even consider calling home after India, it's New York. But I grew up in a, in a racist New York. I did not grow up in the New York that the world knows today as this all accepting, you can be whoever you want to. This was still the early seventies. There was still a lot of, you know, a kind of white assertion. My mother who used to wear saris and used to walk us to school and used to wear a bindi was taunted. I have very distinct memories of kids running behind us and taunting her for her bindi and her sari, not being especially friendly with me at school. There wasn't that complete fitting in there. And I don't think that there was a complete fitting in here, which doesn't mean that I didn't have an easygoing personality, but I didn't always have a gregarious personality. And in fact, like my mother wrote a series of stories about a semi-fictionalized character named after me in a children's magazine called Target. And one of the stories that she wrote in this Barkha series was called Barkha and the People Tree. And it was about this girl who on family holidays, when the cousins were all playing amongst themselves, would choose to sit under the people tree and have a conversation with the people tree instead of talking to the cousins. So when I think about it and I piece all of this together, maybe I was always a bit of a misfit."

        "message": "There was an interesting book which came out in the nineties, which was really controversial. It's a book called The Nurture Assumption by Judith Rich Harris, where she kind of argued against a myth that parents really form their children. She looked at different studies of twins who were separated at birth and so on and so forth. And her kind of conclusion, which was backed by the science and which was very sort of solid was that kids when they're growing up are shaped more by their peers and their parents. Like, of course, they get the genes from their parents and all of that. I mean, it is what it is. But apart from that, they're shaped more by their peers. Now, in your case, you say that one, you were a bit of a misfit where you were people tree and all that, and maybe you were shaped by the people tree also. But at the same time, just looking at the bare biographical details that your mother is a pathbreaking journalist at a time where it was much harder for a woman to be a pathbreaking journalist in India. And both her daughters have also gotten into journalism, which kind of seems to go against the normal kind of grain there. So if I were to ask you what shaped you, like one, what was your conception of yourself as a teenager? For example, what did you want to become? What did you see yourself as? And two, what kind of shaped you? What were your big early influences in that sense, if you can, you know, put your finger on it?"

        "message": "So I think that the binary doesn't hold, right? Like I can, I can trace back distinct influences that belong to my parents in different ways. I think it took my father to die for me to realize what an overwhelming influence he had been in my life. I had always identified with my mother. She had the most dramatic story. You know, she had the story of being the first woman war correspondent of India. She had the story of being the rebel who walked into Hindustan Times and was told by the editor, well, if you want to be a woman journalist, we can send you to cover the flower shows. You know, she had the story of the struggle, the rebellion, the fight, the gumption, the courage. And she died when I was really young, which also amplified her influence. And then it took my father to die for me to realize that actually he'd been my main parent just by the fact that he'd been around longer and for decades. And there were other values that I had drawn from him that maybe I hadn't even consciously realized, but it's equally true that I believe that who I am was also very formed in the ages between 18 and 20, where I went to college, the kind of friends I made, the kind of broad value system that took roots then. And it was not, in my case, it's unusual because I did not come from a conservative, typically conservative family in terms of values. So there was, my pure values were not at odds with my familial values. And sometimes that happens, but for me, there was a sort of continuum that was possible. And so I do feel that if I'd studied elsewhere, my school shaped me in being this sort of tough nut and, you know, extracurriculars and playing basketball and doing theater and doing all of that. But in terms of core values, I was shaped very much by my college and my parents. So I think for me, it was both. But in terms of the self-image, I don't know, you know, I don't remember my self-image before my mother died, but I have this memory of being a nightmarish daughter, extremely rebellious, extremely surly, broody. My mother used to call me grumps even when she was alive, because I was this broody child, thought too much and argued too much. And I think in my image of myself growing up, I was the ultimate rebel. You know, I thought of myself as very rebellious. It's taken me to get into my 40s and almost 50 to kind of see that my life is actually pretty pedestrian and boring almost, like I think now. When I was 13, 14, 15, I thought of myself as this grand rebel. That was my conception of myself. Wild child, you know, I wanted to imagine myself to be a wild child. I'm horrified that you should describe your life as pedestrian. What about the rest of us? You know, you kind of alter your own standards, right? I guess that's what happens. You have a conception of your life. I would have loved to be, and I don't know why I didn't go that route, but I would have loved to be actually an international correspondent, you know, traveling to like crazy parts of the world and reporting from the world. But at some point, and I always wondered if it was a fatal error, at some point after my post-grad at Columbia, I was like, I want to work in my country. That's the only place where I care about the news. And I came back. But you know, when I say my life is pedestrian, like I'm saying at the end of it, like what is so rebellious about what I do? Okay. There are certain things like I'll get into a car and I'll just sit in the car and go and cover COVID when very few other people will. I have that. I have a capacity for risk-taking, but on a day to day basis, I live a pretty mundane life."

And I think just looking back when I was much younger, the mistake I perhaps made was forming that in terms of the things I want to do that I want to do A, B, C, these are all my achievements, which I want to be lauded for and blah, blah, blah. And as you kind of grow older, at least in my case, the realisation came that that is a mistake. And one, of course, it is easy to rationalise it as a mistake, because one hasn't managed to do most of them. But the other part of it is that that's not really a route to happiness. I think it's much more thinking about the kind of person that you want to be, focusing on the concrete details of everyday life rather than abstract goals and dreams and whatever."

And that is one of the things that makes me a misfit, because I literally, I may know one or two other people who think like me, and I've known them a long time. So, you know, we were in a way shaped similarly, but my identity is totally tied up to my work. My sense of self is totally tied up to my work. My sense of purpose is totally tied up to my work, and my sense of happiness is totally tied into my work. So when people say work-life balance to me, I don't even begin to understand what it means, because I carry my work everywhere. And equally, the reverse is true. We sometimes carry our home into our work, and we carry our work into our home. So I never understood this millennial idea of work-life balance. But I literally am quite, I would say, unusual. Also, I've been told, I'm not trying to romanticize myself, but this is what I'm told, that I can work nonstop. I can just keep working. I, you know, get off on it. I hide on it. It keeps me occupied. It keeps me sane. It keeps me happy. It defines me. So I, I have, I'm never tired. I mean, I might be tired and the damage shows in other ways, but I've never consciously, I'm too tired to do this. So that's what I meant by saying that, you know, you keep trying to talk yourself into, you know, life is elsewhere. Oh, I wish I could also do this. Oh, I wish I could also do that. But actually, if you took away my work and you gave me all those other things, I'd be miserable. So that's the first thing. Then in terms of core values, I mean, I'm not saying that how my father and mother thought and how my friends at St. Stephen's College thought is very similar. I'm sure had my mother in particular remained alive, she would have possibly, despite being the trailblazer, been a more conservative parent than my father turned out to be. I think my father was also a little hapless being a single father to two completely, you know, uncontainable daughters. But what I mean is that there's this idea of integrity, which has defined my closest friendships and which I think was a very, was a big cornerstone of, of what I saw happen with my parents. I saw both paying professional prices for holding on to what they believed to be correct, not hustling enough in their workspaces, getting left behind sometimes in their workspaces because of their idea of, you know, integrity. And the second thing was just the stubborn individualism, right? That the thing that you will not be defined by anybody else's idea of you. And I think I remember watching my mother and learning this from her early on that if you do well, sure you'll be popular and there'll be accolades and there'll be a lot of love. There'll be a lot of great things said about you, but there'll also be a lot of dislike and a lot of resentment and a lot of pushback and a lot of bitchiness. And you're going to have to wear your skin so thick that you cannot alter yourself because of what is said about you. As a child, even I remember watching my mother go through this. My father was a different sort of person. Everybody loved him. My mother was much more like me where she triggered love or hate. She just never triggered indifference. And I think that those are the two, I would say the cornerstone values, your notion of integrity and stubborn individualism."

Where there is a meeting point of what you love doing, what you're good at doing and what people will pay you for doing and wherever all three meet, that's what you should do. And that's what you are doing. And that's what I am kind of doing. And that's also what I tell young creators that this Venn diagram becomes inevitable if you persevere at what you love, because if you persevere at doing something that you love, iteration makes for excellence, eventually you'll be good at it. And then eventually you'll get paid for it. So it's just a kind of a question of sticking to it. Now speaking of conception of ourselves and all of that, we've kind of, you know, gone here and gone there and all of that. But the one thing that I'm interested in is when did you kind of decide to become a journalist? Because obviously having your mother as a role model at home must have been a really big deal. And what part of you, what part of it rather kind of excited you? Like I think when I think of what you're really doing, one thing that you are doing, at least for us, for all the people who watch your work is you are making sense of the world, that you're giving us more and more dots, which we can connect and we can get a better picture of the world. And that's what you're doing. And that that would be as a fan, that would be my one line definition of it. And in a different way, I try to do the same thing. So is there a way that like, when you're drawn to journalism, are you drawn to, let's say, an aspect of it that I you know, I want to uncover something about the world? Or are you also drawn to that sense of adventure that I will go out with my camera and I will, you know, uncover something and I will do investigation and all of that. So what drew you about it back then? And what do you love about it so much? Like when you went out in the COVID trail last year, right at the time the lockdown hit and what you've been doing for all these months, that is out of obviously love and it's a labor of love. It's not about the money. It's not about how many people are watching. You know, you would do that anyway. What is that? What is that urge?"

I am sitting here where I'm sitting, talking to you today in my basement office and the lockdown gets announced and I say, Oh, let's go out and see what's happening. And I drive to the border of Delhi and I see a long, I see nobody on the streets. And I see a long line of men, women, and children walking. And I see nobody there, no police, no bureaucrat. It's like the state has gone missing and these people are walking. Then I go to a different border. Right now I'm still in Delhi and I'm just, just literally driving in my car to these borders to see. And I see the same thing at all the borders of Delhi, this exodus. And I come back and I cannot sleep. And I know that the story cannot be reported by sitting in Delhi. And so begins my, from within almost, it is involuntary. It is almost involuntary. It is something that you feel so strongly that you know that you cannot tell this, you know, a particular, you cannot uncover a particular truth. You cannot tell a particular story without actually being part of a certain kind of journey. I don't know if I want to call it something as lofty or self-important as uncovering the truth, but I do see the job or the role of a journalist, or sometimes I call myself a storyteller because not all stories I tell necessarily have news value that day. But I do see myself as a bridge between situations and people. And where I feel that my readers or my viewers cannot travel to, cannot go to, cannot comprehend, I can be that conduit. And I also see myself as this kind of reflection board of which people's stories, problems, passions, emotions can bounce off. And, you know, I can be that kind of white reflection board that they're bouncing off on. And it's just, if you had asked me in school, do you want to be a journalist? I would have said no, because the rebellious part of me did not want to do what my mother did. Right. It seemed very boring. It seemed very predictable. It seemed like doctor ka bacha doctor, lawyer ka bacha lawyer, journalist ka bacha journalist. It didn't seem cool in my head as a young kid to end up where one of your parents is. And I trained to make movies and my first master's degree was in film and television production. And I thought I'd make movies. It's just that I did not enjoy those two years. I found them too pretentious. I found them too precious. I found everybody thought that they were going to like, you know, be these poet philosophers who are going to come in and alter the universe. And I just, you know, didn't, I didn't see myself in that. But I trained to be a film editor. I trained to be a sound mixer. My first job was as a television producer and not as a reporter. I wandered into reporting by accident. And then once I did it, I just, I just loved it. I mean, like, it was just, it was love. I mean, like, you know, it is the most intense emotion of all emotions that I have ever experienced in my adult life is the love I feel when I'm out in the field reporting a story. There's nothing compares to it. No human being, no experience, no other emotion. And I guess that, you know, for all the corroded dimensions to Indian media today, it's still something I love. I still love it in the way that I did when I was 22."

You know, I, I think one of the reasons, I mean, we know that the right wing doesn't especially like me, but one of the reasons that there are sections of the left, I think that, that, that despise me just as much is that I just am not able to feel, I'm not able to feel an ideological worthiness. I feel my, I have my values. I get things that I feel strongly about and I will fight to, to the end about those, right. But I find it very difficult to be affiliated to a thought, to a ism, to a, you know, and, and, and one of the things that puts me off, and I'm sure there are people who think that I think of myself as worthy and we can't control other people's perceptions of us, but I am put off by worthiness, you know, the sense that we are, we are so deep, we are so artistic, we are so creative. So, you know, like, so to that extent, like, and I remember when we were in Jamia, people used to smoke in class and like, imagine they used to think that this was cool and, and, and the teacher used to smoke and the students used to smoke and I never used to smoke and I used to, I was made to feel like I was like this board, right. And it's, it was all this sort of, you know, the gold flick creativity, if you will. And I just was a misfit, I was a total misfit. And I think that's when I knew that I just can't be, I'm not artsy enough for this, whatever artsy means. This isn't happening for me, but I thought when I started it, that is what I wanted to do, that I wanted to make movies and I enjoyed much more the technical part of it. You know, I enjoyed learning, you know, even today it's, it's painful for me sometimes to watch Netflix because I can tell where a shot ends and another shot begins because my eye is trained to see it. I can understand sound. I've done sound mixing in the days when you carried a Nagra, whatever thing around and separately picked up audio and who does any of that anymore? But I trained to do that, right? I used to make sound in the NDTV studio where I started. So I, I liked the technical stuff. I found that quite magical, but I couldn't be this clubby, creative, we are the artists, artists unite person. I just couldn't be that."

Let me hasten to say that there are two isms. If you ask me, you know, I don't shrug off all isms. Who are you? Are you a feminist? Yes, I don't blink. I've answered yes to that question since I was 16. And I'll answer yes to it today. But I might have a notion of feminism that is at loggerheads with a 25 year old or a 55 year old, or even someone my own age. And that's what I mean by not fully fitting into any ism."

        "message": "quote of containing multitudes has almost become a cliche on my show, and I keep invoking it. And I think it's necessary to invoke that sentiment, because a lot of the politics that we see, especially in the polarized spaces online, are based on pigeonholing people on reducing people to one thing or the other, that oh, you are a cishet white male, or oh, you are a Muslim, and therefore anti national or whatever. And it comes from both the right and the left, which is why I react so viscerally to all kinds of identity politics, whether people are bhakts or voks. Because I just think that, you know, the world is far more complex to reduce people to just one aspect of their identity becomes a problem. Let's go back to journalism in the sense that, when I look back on those times, and obviously, we've already discussed how the influences coming in are not so many today, I can go online and all the best journalism in the world is out there in front of me. And some of it from India, thanks to people like you. But back in the day, you don't really have that. So like you, you've kind of formed your values of who you are. But how does one form values of what good journalism is? What is your conception of good journalism, like in the little time that I spent in journalism in the aughties, I found that most mainstream journalists around me, this is in the context of sport, because I was a sports journalist, when I was doing it as a profession, were completely out of sync, like, that's not the kind of stuff that you know, you would teach or you would want people to do. So when you go there, what is your conception of journalism? How much of it comes from the people you are working with, who are your seniors who are guiding you? And over time, how does that conception evolve?"

        "message": "So again, I would not be typical, because of growing up as the daughter of my mother. And because I actually, you know, had a reference point of her stories, and her daredevilry, and her courage and her ferocity, in a way, like I think by osmosis, a little bit of it, I was able to imbibe as reference points that, you know, a story is a story is sacred, like, that's one of the things I learned from her, not your ideology. And I'm seguing a bit because it relates to what we were discussing about polarizations. But just to give you a recent example, you know, the farmers protest, when it was taking place, I spotted one day online, a video of a Sikh man at a barricade arguing very politely and effectively with a police officer. And I had no idea who the man was. So I started talking to my small team. And I was like, hey, do any of you know who this guy is? He seems like an interesting person to interview. So they said, oh, his name is Deep Sidhu. They found out his name is Deep Sidhu. And he's an actor from Punjab. I had no idea who he was. I was like, oh, he's speaking so interestingly in this video. Let's, maybe he'd be a new voice to get on this farmers protest. So we track him down. It's an online interview. He's in the back of some car at the border. And we're doing this interview. That particular day, the sort of right wing trolls have gone on saying that the farmers protest, you know, farmers have been spotted with Bhindranwale's pictures in their pockets. This is a Khalistani movement, so on, so forth. I haven't seen this myself. I have been to report by then a few times. And I went a lot after that as well. And I hadn't encountered this. But it was very much a kind of online troll. And I thought that I would ask him about it. My expectation was that he would simply dismiss it and he would, and we would move on. And it wasn't even the sort of centrality of what I was asking. And I asked him about Bhindranwale and I was absolutely taken aback because he launched into this long defense of this guy. And so he and I ended up having an argument. And, you know, usually I don't think that the views of my guest have to be my views and I'm able to hear something that I find unpalatable. But it was a very abrasive sort of exchange. Unusual for me. I wasn't shouting or anything. I was saying, look, you're defending a terrorist and I'm extremely uncomfortable with you defending a terrorist. You assassinated an Indian prime minister, etc. And he was like, he was giving his view. And I, and then I said, let's agree to disagree. And we moved on and the interview finished. My younger colleagues who were working with me at that time said to me that I should not have asked him this question because they felt that it would hurt the cause of the farmers. And you know, that had we played into, in their minds, a right-wing trap. Right. So I said to them that, look, the story, and when I use the word story, I mean it loosely for that issue that I'm reporting on. The story is sacred. Whether the outcome or the process of getting that story is a set of things you like, don't like, it ends up hurting the side that you identify, don't identify with, has to be irrelevant to you. Right. And we had a pretty fraught argument and sure enough, in the 24 hours after the interview, I had a whole bunch of people on the left on Twitter attacking me for being a sellout to the BJP for just saying, asking these questions. It was only many months later that Deep Siddhu gets outed as the guy who actually sabotages the farmers movement on 26 January and ends up being that extremist that he had clearly shown himself to be. And I remember telling you this in a subsequent interview. I said, you remember that interview I did? And all of you said to me, oh, you know, you're playing, you're pandering to the BJP. If you had just flashed out this guy then because he had indicated who he was. Now I bring this up because there is such an ideological filter that we put on the process of reporting today. Right. I learned from my mother that you pursue the story, not the outcome. The outcome is not relevant. Right. It has to be the process. You have to contribute with the process. So when I am walking with migrant workers, I find it bizarre the number of people who ask me, why didn't you give them a ride in your car? I mean, I can explain to everybody that in my Maruti Ortega, four people fit along with my clothes at the back, but that is not the point. My role is not to ferry one family, then a second, then a third. I can't do it anyway. If I could at some humanitarian personal level, I did, but that's not my professional role. My professional role is to tell that story and hope that that story will lead to the policy change by which they will no longer be working. Right. So for me, the first value is that the story is sacred, not yet. And I know what you will say. I take that point that ways of looking, editing, who you interview, what your camera angle is, visual grammar, they're all subject. Yes. But over so many years, I've done so many stories, but the outcome has not been one that I like, but I still believe the story to be sacred. Right. So for example, in 2019, I came back and I told every single person I knew that Modi was going to sweep the election. And because everywhere I went, I found people who, you know, who said, aur kaun hai? And I remember writing a column saying, it's the aur kaun hai election. And nobody, none of my liberal friends was willing to believe me. Not one of them was willing to believe me. Today, I tell them that it's my sense from doing travels across India, that people are very sorrowful, but they're not enraged. And therefore, I don't think that there will be a political consequence for the mismanagement of the pandemic and the mismanagement is acute. And I've never minced my words in calling it out, but nobody wants to hear this. So when we put these filters of our own preferred outcomes on the process of telling a story, it is very problematic. So my value above all values is the story is safe. And the second old fashioned value that I have is that you do not force a person to talk. By which I mean, you know, yes, it's easy to caricature, you know, even all of us as Mike, you know, Mike, you know, chasers or whatever, Mike chasers, chasers or whatever we call it. I have chased a few cars in my younger age and, you know, mostly in funny moments like, you know, but mostly when there'd be police barricades around them and you're not being allowed to get in. So it's more actually trying to break the barricade than to force the person to talk. But I believe that I'm not comfortable with sting operations. I'm not comfortable with hidden cameras. I'm not comfortable. I'm just not comfortable with covert ops reportage, right? I think that your reporting should be able to get a person to come on camera or find some other way to tell that story. The agency belongs to the person whose story you're telling. Yes, it's complicated when you're trying to do an expose, but find a way to do it without doing stings and, you know, hidden camera ops, just uncomfortable with them. I'm not saying I've never been associated with the story that's used it. I'm just saying that I'm deeply uncomfortable with it. And that the story is sick. The outcome can't decide what story you tell."

And some thoughts emerge, for example, you know, just thinking aloud on why stories matter so much and why stories can get the kind of responses that they do. Like back in, back in the good old years, we sound like two such old people. So back in the good old years, you know, if I had thought about this, I would have thought that stories matter because they explain more about they show more of the world to us and therefore they matter for that reason. But today they, you know, invoke such harsh reactions because people have formed narratives for themselves of how the world works. And they want your story to either confirm that simplistic narrative or you are therefore an enemy, which is why someone like you is always getting attacked on Twitter by one side or the other or both at the same time, because nuance is not acceptable. Either your story confirms a narrative or it doesn't. And either you're kind of with them or you're sort of not. Now, what I hold and what I think to some extent I have discovered through doing the podcast is that these are vocal minorities. So you have vocal minorities who are part of these echo chambers who are also signaling within their echo chambers to raise their status, who are smoking in the class in Jamia, as it were to go back to the metaphor. But there is a silent majority out there, which gets what you do, which which wants depth, which wants nuance, which appreciates that good faith effort. And I would imagine that someone like you would probably get a greater sense of that silent majority because you are interacting with many more people in the real world and in the road and not just in the screaming matches of Twitter. So what would your reaction be?"

And I'm like, of course, like sometimes it can be hurtful, sometimes it can be enraging. But it's not my experience of the world. It genuinely isn't. My experience of the world is actually more positive than negative in terms of the reaction that I receive. I, you know, I meet students all the time. I meet old people all the time. For me, the loveliest thing is people talk to me like they know me, you know, like just complete strangers will have full conversation with me about their lives, like just completely intimate details. And it's the loveliest thing. And it was reinforced for me, actually, through these COVID travels. You know, I have seen so much kindness in these times, so much generosity from people. And the people can be famous film stars and sports people, and they can be like just somebody I meet at a, you know, on even on Twitter, even on Twitter, like, like, even people off Twitter have sent me messages saying, do you need a place to sleep? Do you need food? I mean, I remember in the first wave, so the second wave was logistically easier and emotionally just ravaging. And the first wave was a logistical nightmare because there was no place to sleep, no food to eat, dhabas were not open, you couldn't get a samosa or a glass of water. And you had to, for me to find places to stay, I had to keep calling up district magistrates, getting them, getting permission for some hotels or some guest house or something. And I was often staying in, someone knew someone, someone, someone in a house, in a room, you know, in Kota, I remember we stayed in some student hostel, in some other place, we stayed in some kheer, one night we spent in a, in the car. I mean, they were just, it was crazy. But because people saw this, they sent food, they sent clothes, my shoes broke and the number of people who just wanted to give me shoes. And there was somebody I didn't know and she's become a friend today. She lives in Mumbai and she was like, I can see that you're out of clothes. Can I run a wash for you? I mean, she just randomly, complete stranger, ran a laundry wash for me and said, how many days has it been since you've eaten a home cooked meal? It was COVID, first wave, nobody was ready to invite anybody. She said, I don't care. You come home. I'll be socially distant. I need to feed you. Like, I, I actually think that if you stop paying attention to these echo chambers, right and left, I still believe that most people are broadly commonsensical. What these sides disparage is sitting on the fence. I don't think it's sitting on the fence. I think people make up their own minds. They agree with some of what you do. They disagree with some of what you do. They like some things about you. They may find some things irritating. That's life. I mean, which people do we know about who we like everything, right? I don't know anybody whom I like all the time. So I think if you are like 75% of the time, that's a great score. And my experience of life is I am liked, even loved 75% of the time in, for among the people I meet. And so I've trained myself to not get distracted by these very vocal, very voluble, sort of ideologues coming at me from often both sides."

And there's a similar distance between the camera and the people. And it's a little distant and television brings it closer. You know, the TV is two, three meters away. And similarly, the camera and are separated. So you have friends and Seinfeld and all and YouTube is intimate, you know, you're watching something on a laptop screen, or you're watching something on your mobile phone, and the camera is also relatively close to the person. And that creates that kind of intimacy. The other aspect of this, besides the intimacy of the medium itself is I've heard you speak about the importance of being authentic to yourself, especially in the context of leaving NDTV. And we'll come to that a little later down the line. But the notion of being authentic to yourself, which is something that really means a lot to me, because I think no matter what you do, you should not see yourself as a functional tool that there is a story and I am just fulfilling a function of getting the story out there. No, it's important to actually, you know, if you have the privilege of doing so to pursue the kind of stories that mean something to you, that keep you awake at night, like you said, and that authenticity is important. And when that authenticity comes out, like podcasts are really the most intimate medium in that sense, which I didn't realize when I got into it, because you're a voice in somebody's head, you know, and that sense of intimacy with the audience is incredible. So do you have some thoughts on this? And do you also therefore just thinking aloud again, feel that moving to Mojo, moving to YouTube, maybe what has happened over the last four or five years, made this happen more, because now you're working for yourself, you decide what stories you want to do. So on the one hand, you don't have to follow what a corporation may feel is the right thing to do. And on the other hand, you're not somebody on a TV screen, you're somebody on a mobile phone, which they're holding in front of their face. So has this made a difference in one how you're received and two, then in how you view yourself and the kind of work that you do?"

        "message": "So I think the two questions, let me answer both of them separately. I mean, they're linked, but first on authenticity. This is something I really feel strongly about, right? And it comes down to even the clothes you wear, you know, how you dress, what you think you need to look like. And it is perhaps even more important to drive home this message today, because, you know, because of my work, I am forced to be on certain platforms that I may have chosen to avoid otherwise. So one of them would be Instagram. I would not be on Instagram if I didn't, like, I believe that I want to reach all kinds of audiences and I want to understand all kinds of platforms. So I'm on Instagram. But when I look at Instagram, I find it completely flattening out an idea of, in particular, how women should look like. And, you know, there's this sense of performing for your phone camera and pouting at the camera, putting the filter on, making sure you're shot, you know, you look, you always take a selfie in the best light. And I'm not saying that, you know, I'm free from all vanities, but I'm saying that there is a flattening, there is a cookie cutter impact of the body size of the face, of what you're supposed to project. And there's so much projection and there's such little grit and there's such little reality that I feel like we're entering this sort of perilous universe where almost nothing and nobody is real. And yet, paradoxically, I feel that the people who make the deepest relationships with their audience are the ones where the audience sees them as real. Right. I think realness and that realness can just be you being you, whatever that you is, whatever that you is, you know, it, and I think that, you know, I have many other issues with what she does, but the one person who was the queen of this was Oprah Winfrey. And I remember thinking this when I was interviewing her at the Jaipur Lit Fest, that she defied the stereotype. One of the reasons I did not want to be a presenter in American television when I graduated from Columbia was because what the presenters I saw were all blondes in black. That's what I call them. There were white women, blondes dressed in New York black. There was a stereotypical look if you wanted to be an on-air person. And Oprah with not just the color of her skin, not just for the size of her body, but also the informality, the loud laugh, the, you know, just, she was authentic. And I just think that I can't think of too many people on camera who are able to be authentic, but you will find that between men and women, both those who are authentic to themselves, with whom you feel that even if I met them at their home, they'd be like this only, like they are on camera. They wouldn't be different. Those are the people whom strangers want to give samosas to and say, you know, you become like some everybody's child. And, and I just find that for me, my ordinariness, by which I mean that I do not know how to be this gentrified, glamorized cookie cutter, female presence on camera, I think has helped me build relationships with people because there's a relatability with authenticity. So that's on authenticity. On Mojo, yes. I do not think that if I worked in an organization, I would have been allowed to sit in a car and leave and just do, and at the height of COVID, firstly, I would have been told, we can't take responsibility for you. We can't, this thing, you can't go, whatever. Secondly, there would have been a resource issue. Thirdly, there would have been a, no, is it really necessary because who spends money on reporting anymore? So there would have been so many issues, right? You know, I can't imagine that if I worked in an organization, even in an organization like NDTV that did encourage reporting at least in its earlier years, you know, there would have been so many other complications. So at one level, it's been very liberating and there's a, there's much greater space to build that intimate relationship between yourself and the audience. But of course there are, you know, there are other struggles with all of us who are now independent content creators that, you know, you, I, I was sort of cosetted by an organization. I was used to sort of, let's say small things like to, to, to produce a prime time show on television takes about 15 people. We do it with three now, right? One is it's the magic of technology, but you also adapt to doing a lot more yourself, you know, and you, you learn new skills. It's at one level, very exciting, but let's not romanticize it. You do fight for things you never had to fight for. Like? Mostly resources, mostly resources. I mean, not, you know, and especially when you're at a building stage, right? So like for me, it's ironic, but like these toughest 16 months of my life, it's, it's, it's probably been the toughest story I've reported on more than war, more than conflict because because if it's one length, how long it's lasted to not being able to identify where the danger will necessarily come from and therefore having no mechanisms to really protect yourself three, you know, have facing some colossal personal loss in the middle of it all. So in, for many reasons, it's been probably my toughest, toughest assignment. And yet it's been so rewarding in terms of how quickly we were able to reflect in our audience size. You know, we, we started at about in October of 2019 at that time, a YouTube channel, which was just like this parking lot. I did nothing with it. I had, I think 80,000 subscribers and you know, we're at 630,000 today and it's all been through COVID. It's just been for our work, nothing else, not one bit. I haven't spent a paisa on digital marketing, not one paisa, not one paisa, nothing. It's just pure organic things. So at one level, like all this sort of BS that people aren't interested, people don't want to watch this. This is not true. In fact, our numbers begin to fall when we aren't out there reporting. That's when our numbers fall. The moment we are, you know, where it could be farmers, it could be huntress, it could be the Delhi riots, which is when we kind of started. It could be the citizenship protests. And then of course, COVID and we see a spike when we go out and we tell these stories and we bring them back. It's in peacetime that actually we find it very difficult to grow our numbers."

But before we get back to that, I'm also struck by a strand that came up when you were earlier giving your two part answer. And the second part of that was where you spoke about your ethic in terms of approaching the people that you do stories with that, you know, you don't like sting journalism, for example, and neither do I, because I think that, you know, the means are never justified by the end that, you know, even your means should be above board and should respect consent and all that. So there, I agree with you. Now, my question is about how one approaches the people that one is doing a story with, especially if it is at a traumatic time. For example, on your Instagram page, I came across this lovely poem by Varsha and Shair. I think, I hope"

It's a dilemma, just in terms of life, that to what extent are you treating people as a means to an end, instead of relating to them as people itself? How do you approach that? And I guess this is a sort of career wide thing for you that you know, and I know obviously that your consent will be paramount for you that you're not thrusting mics in the face of people at a cremation ground. It's only people who are willing to speak to you and all of that. But how do you approach this? How hard is it? And sometimes at a fraught emotional time, like reporting during COVID on any given day must be because it's just so hellish. How do you approach it?"

        "message": "So, you know, my first encounter with this debate around consent during tragedy, oddly came during the 26-11 terror strikes when a certain class of viewers, and I emphasize the word class quite knowingly, was extremely angry with me for interviewing. And I wasn't the only one doing it. But as often times happens with me, I become somehow emblematic of a media discussion. Why were we talking to people outside those hotels when their families were inside? And what was strange, and I remember writing about it later, is that I had reported on any number of terror strikes, but mostly in those terror strikes, it was poor people who were killed or injured or maimed, and their families would speak and the audience never complained. But this was a PLU audience, a People Like Us audience. And for the audience, it was too close to the bone, and they were extremely uncomfortable, extremely angry, and they're extremely argumentative about why is this necessary? You people are vultures, you people are feasting off tragedy, and all the rest. But I would always say, and I continue to say that even today, I remember interviewing a husband whose wife was inside the Taj, and he said he wanted to do the interview because maybe she was watching TV. Maybe she was watching TV. There was somebody else who wanted something else. What I have found, and the reason I'm bringing this up, is that as uncomfortable as some parts of our audience may get, with the rawness of tragic moments, of difficult moments, especially of moments that you think could also be your story one day, I find that most people want to tell their story. Most people I have ever met in life, yes, there are some people who say, please turn the camera off. Go away. Please go away. And you go away. Mostly, my way is to gently ask, would you like to talk? And I would say eight and a half times out of ten, the answer is yes. And when there are grave tragedies, great losses, great churn in society, just at that precise moment when you think the world is about to end or things are so insurmountably difficult, you would be surprised, but everybody wants a personal history to be recorded. Nobody wants to die or lose somebody as a mere statistic. Everybody wants to tell their story. It can come from different places. It can come from a place of sorrow, of anger, of hope, of frustration, but mostly people want to talk. Now, what should be your emotional tone? Some 25 years later, one of the things is that I never watch anything I do, because if you play back what you do, you'll just sound weird to yourself, right? On the odd occasion that sometimes it plays back to you in the middle of a show or some clip plays, there is something firstly very weird to watch yourself. So I just don't do it. But of course, you can never reach that, you know, you're never so good that you look back at everything you do and say, you always think, oh, maybe I could have been a little softer, or why was I being so loud, or maybe I was too emotional, or I shouldn't have done that. So you always have a little bit of doubt about the pitch of your tone, about the questions. You know, so I'll give you a small, small example. Like I edited it out because it sounded so abrasive, but about the kind of mistakes one can make in a difficult moment. This is not in the context of COVID. I was interviewing an Afghan parliamentarian who was deported from India when she landed. And she said, I've come to meet my doctor and I needed to go to a hospital. And very naturally it came out from my mouth and it came out wrong. You know, what were you being treated for? Right now, what I meant was, did you need a doctor in an emergency? And did anyone at the airport, like, were you in the middle of a medical emergency or were you kind of having some long-term treatment for which, you know, yes, you needed, you had a doctor's appointment, but there wasn't an immediate medical crisis. And because of shared experience, I was able to recover and say in the next sentence, I'm so sorry. What I meant by that was I wanted to understand, were you having an emergency that needed immediate medical attention? But the sentence was so intrusive that I edited it. And my point is that the best or the most experienced of us make mistakes when we are talking, having difficult conversations. And these are extremely difficult conversations and you will never fully like yourself for how you behave in them because you will always feel that you could have been a little better, a little more sensitive, et cetera. It is a skill to draw people out in these times without imposing on them, right? So there's always that slight amount of self-doubt. However, I will keep insisting that people have a right to decide whether their stories need to be told. And history is written and recorded by the testimonies of individual stories. And therefore, you know, one way of reporting the Kargil war was to talk about the Bofors gun. But another way to report the Kargil war was to interview Vikram Batra. And that is why Vikram Batra, and to ask Vikram Batra, aren't you scared? To which he said, yeh dil mange more. To which is the reason that 20 years later, he is still so iconic, right? Now you could say, why are you interviewing a soldier? The soldier's in the middle of a war front. Is this the time to ask him, aren't you scared? In today's age, the same audience that celebrates Vikram Batra for that interview would shit on me for asking that question, right? Or sections of that audience. And that's the hypocrisy and the kind of short-sightedness that has entered our media discourse. I think people must have the right to decide whether they want to tell their stories. And none of us can judge that. People have the right to say yes or no. And if they say yes, they have the right to tell their stories. I mean, obviously a war will come with its own compunctions on how much a soldier can say and how much you can ask. I don't mean to simplify the example, but just broadly speak."

The other thing that I feel is that as long as you're not being inclusive, it's necessary to just keep asking no matter how banal it feels, because you never know what might emerge. Like I was very moved by the story you did during COVID of this nine-year-old in Bhivandi, who was, you know, getting on a bus to go to Azamgarh, and you asked him, what does the COVID virus mean to you? And he said, it means that I don't get anything to eat. And that's also such a great moment of show, don't tell, because you ask a question about a virus, but that one answer just reveals so much about society and about, you know, just so much in that one sentence, which just becomes a standout moment like that. And, you know, people would otherwise criticize you for asking a banal question that why are you asking a nine-year-old whether he knows what the virus is, but you get that moment from that."

Now, I've never actually asked someone aapko kaise lagta hai, but I have said to them, you know, when you heard this, what was the first thing you thought? Now, it's a non-complex, non-intellectual question, but people need simple prompts to open up, right? People don't want to write a PhD thesis or whatever. There's a child getting onto a bus, right? I'm just asking him, do you know what the virus is? It's completely organic. Whereas if I had asked him some other question, it would have seemed tutored. He would may not have given this answer. So I just find that my, you know, to draw people out intimately, sometimes you just keep it simple. Don't try and show off how profound you are. Too many of us make that error of, you know, wanting it to be about how much we know, so as to not appear banal. And I understand that. I understand that there's a pressure that you don't want to be an also-ran. We all feel that pressure. You know, you want to somehow be distinct. And if you're asking these simple questions, you don't feel distinct because you feel like even an intern would ask the same question. Like, I'm sure like maybe there's a part of you that thinks that, right? Like a kid starting out would also be, but it's many different skills. It's a skill in, do you bring your camera to the height of the child? I mean, I have gone mad telling the camera people I work with, don't shoot children from the top, right? Do you kneel down to the height of the child? Do you talk to the child playfully, but yet as if he or she is an adult? It's not just the question. There are multiple skills that, you know, it's, I had a teacher at Columbia. I mean, show don't tell is one way of putting it. And I had another professor who used to say, you know, write like you speak only better. And in the same way, you know, you've got to speak as if it's so casual and natural, but there's a whole set of skills that are going into that, that are acquired, that are intuitive. It's a mix of a lot of things."

It's difficult not to. If you're actually out there reporting, I don't know how I would manage, frankly. So do you then with practice train yourself to have this extra layer where you kind of step outside of yourself a little bit and you realize that you don't want that kind of reaction coming from you. You've just got to be cool and calm and kind of continue doing what you're doing. Is that something that you've had to do? Because in many of these difficult moments, you've been calm, you haven't broken down, but at the same time, you're engaged, you're there, you're not just a blank face. What is that process like?

So it can't be surgical. But I will tell you that in that way, reporting COVID and reporting military conflict is similar in that you do have to keep one part of your mind to the sheer, I don't want to say craft, but logistics, right? There has to be. So if in Kargil, it was how do I get this tape to Delhi? How do I find a place to sleep? How do I get something to eat? And some of those similar things in COVID, what it does is it one displaces you, it displaces fear, which is very important in difficult situations. Because if you're scared yourself, you know, if you're constantly, if I'm going to go into Dharavi, which I, you know, I remember when the first time I went to Dharavi, people were like, are you crazy? You're going into Dharavi in the middle of this COVID, what are you doing? So you have to put these things, you have to take the precautions that you know how to take, and then you have to leave the fear. So there's that, the fear has to be displaced. The second thing is that you have to allow yourself to be emotional, but not to a degree where you lose craft. So it comes back to authenticity. You have to be as you feel in that moment. But this is where experience counts. Because over the years, I have been in these situations. It's not my first time, right? I remember I was doing a story on Neelavati, who was an old woman sitting outside the Bandra railway station in Mumbai, and she'd been abandoned by her family, and she didn't know how to get back home. And she started sobbing, and I just couldn't help it. I had to hold her. I had to hold her. At that time, people were, we didn't know enough to know that it wasn't by surface and whatever, and I had to. She was an old woman. And we got her onto that train. But I had a 19-year-old producer at that time. She was just out of college. And she just wouldn't stop crying. You know, she couldn't film because she was just looking at this, and she was sobbing. Whereas I, because I have seen so much tragedy and so much distress and so much violence and so many bodies, and my heart was breaking, and it was breaking enough to be engaged with this woman. But it was able to have one filter that still allowed me to function. So functionality doesn't go, though sometimes, very rarely, it does. And in COVID, I can remember two times when I have lost functionality. One was in the first wave when I was interviewing somebody, a doctor in Chennai. And the doctor was describing how he had gone to bury his best friend, who was another doctor. And at that time, because there was so much phobia about, and so much ignorance and, you know, bad science around COVID, that the neighborhood had stoned the ambulance that was carrying this doctor's body. And they kind of went from burial ground to burial ground, and they were not able to do it. And the ambulance was smashed. And this doctor just broke into tears while he was doing this interview. And he broke into tears, and I broke into tears. And it just happened, and we ploughed through it. And the second time was, I was doing this series on how hundreds of government schoolteachers in Uttar Pradesh had died, because they were sent into enforced election duty. And actually, of all the mistakes that have taken place by the government and other bodies during COVID, I feel the strongest about this, because in every other case, whether it's electioneering or Kumbh Mela or, you know, whatever other Eid celebrations or funeral processions, there was a certain amount of choice that was exercised. It could be ill-informed choice, but it was a choice. But these government employees who were forced, not given any agency, I feel very strongly about it. And I was interviewing this lady and her daughter, who's 15. And my father had died, I think it had been 10 days. I just recovered from COVID. So maybe it had been a little longer, maybe two weeks, two weeks or three weeks gap. And I was interviewing this mother and daughter. And the daughter says to me, well, you know how I feel, because your father died and my father died. And I just couldn't, like, I broke down like I never have because the pattern was false. Because my father, whatever my pain is, and I told her that, that my father was not forced into a situation where he couldn't say no, he did not get COVID because his choice was taken away. Your father got COVID and died because his choice was taken. Right. So just that she, even in that loss, you know, saw it the same way without rancor was very painful. But largely, I would largely, I would see that it's something internal. It's a threshold. You've got to keep the emotions open because if you close them, you'll come across as cold. And many people do. And the thing is the camera catches you. If you're cold, it'll show. But you can't be so distraught that you can't tell the story. And by the way, this is why it's so difficult. And this is why it can sound jarring at times to our audience, because it's not easy to get this balance right. And even now we make mistakes. At least I do. Yeah. I mean, the important thing is if you're"

And it's almost like you're on the ground floor of an India remaking itself and of this new media coming up, right when that happens. And just as you know, journalism changes India changes. So tell me a little bit about that kind of journey. Like, you know, what were your early years at NDTV like, you know, where did you think it was all going? What were the things that excited you back then? Like, of course, you're at Cargill. And that was a big story and that excited you. But apart from that, what was the kind of work that you like to do? If you were then to be asked that, you know, when I'm 49, I will be this, what would you have said?"

        "message": "So firstly, I think it's very important to understand that much as I disparage the state of television today, I see myself as a child of television. And you know, what I mean by that is that when I joined NDTV, most of my colleagues were converts from the print media. And I was a pretty rare entity who had like basically done college, done mass communication and then come into like, this was my, it was my first job and I never worked anywhere else. And I very much saw myself as a sort of child of the visual media, which I continue to do. I do write today, but I still very much see myself as a visual storyteller. So that was the first thing. Second was that, as you said, I think the journey of the media in India has mirrored, reflected, and perhaps altered the story of India as well. Like, I think all three are true, right? So I start NDTV at a time when there is no, the only private broadcast journalism that exists is a half an hour capsule made by NDTV for Doordarshan in English by NDTV in Hindi by Aaj Tak. This is, so I'm literally there at that journey of, of private television news. And it is obviously coinciding with, you know, the media playing more of a role in how politics is shaped. This thing that we now take for granted called narrative, you know, narrative, what is the narrative? What is a politician's story? In those days, it was reflected in very simple ways that, you know, you had these performing politicians, you had a Lalu Prasad Yadav and a Farooq Abdullah, who would perform for camera and then you automatically assume that they were better politicians because they knew how to perform for camera. So you saw all of these sort of, you know, as I said, media reflecting India and India getting altered by media and vice versa. And even today, I sometimes wonder, does media reflect the polarization or did it contribute to creating it? And I suspect both of it is accurate. So I continue to want to keep one foot in technical production. So for a long time at NDTV, I wanted to continue to be in what we call the PCR, which is the back-end control room. I wanted to rotate roles in that. I did sound mixing. I learned how to edit. I mean, I learned how to edit in Jamia. I continue to be able to edit my own stories. I was somewhat crazy in that way that I remember when I went to report the tsunami. In those days, there was no digital editing and we used to do what was called cut-to-cut editing and it was on a machine and we had a portable editor and my camera person, Jamia and I, even into a tsunami, we carried our own editing machine so that we could have full control over what pictures we were sending and, you know, so on. So what excited me was always the same. It was going out into the field and telling the story. And I know so many people ask me during COVID, oh, is this Barkha 2.0? And I was like, no, it's actually Barkha 1.0. I forgot that this is what I love. This is what I love. And yes, of course, I can't be out every day. So there are days in the middle when I'll be behind a desk, but I don't like being behind a desk. And I didn't sign up to be a journalist to be behind the desk. Amongst my earliest and most well-established stories, most significant stories, Kargil is well-established, but one that is lesser known is in terms of how much it impacted me. And also as a story that really altered India was the gang rape of a woman called Bhavri Devi. And now I was this 20-something, fresh out of this liberal cocoon of St. Stephen's College and the worthiness of Jamia Millia. If you had asked me about my feminism, it was very borrowed from the West. I read all my German Greers and Gloria Steinem's and all the rest of that, right? If you asked me what my caste politics were, I would say like a typically privileged elite that I don't believe in caste. I mean, I still don't believe in caste, but I recognize today that I can say it. Like for myself, I don't believe in it. Like if you ask me, what is your caste? I would say, I don't know. I don't have one. I don't know, etc. But today is that recognition that I can say that because I'm not oppressed on the basis of my caste. But as a 20-something, I did recognize that. I just had these very simple-minded notions. And then I am sent in to Rajasthan to report on the gang rape of this woman who's raped for trying to stop the child marriage of a one-year-old baby. And among the rapists is the father of the child. And she's still fighting her case. It's been forever, like 25, almost 25 years. But from that case is born the Vishakha Guidelines. So we owe to this Dalit woman in a village in Rajasthan, the sexual harassment guidelines that govern all of India. And she and her decision to go to court, deliver this to us. And all these big words that we know today, intersectionality and all of this, this was my education. This was my education. And this is when I discovered that, you know, you'd ask me early, is it the adventure? Is it telling, you know, being that bridge? But what about how much it teaches you to unlearn? Every day I abandon something I used to believe because being a journalist has taught me other things, right? The unlearning is the greatest gift of journalism. The way it challenges you to rethink your own positions. So Bhavrit Devi, that story at NDTV really did that for me. What was NDTV like? Look, we were very young, all of us. And NDTV was a very benevolent, encouraging, almost parental environment. It was very easy to be a beloved, bright, sometimes errant child in that environment. And that is what it was like. And the tensions began, as they do even in families, when the child grows up and develops a personality of their own that is no longer necessarily the best fit for the way the family has been used to bringing up the child, right? So, of course, those early years were very heady. And they were heady for a number of reasons. I think there was genuinely a belief that we were all going to be storytellers. It was the glory days of television, not just in the resources available to be able to go out and tell a story, you know, travel budgets, the emphasis on pictures, not the reductionist talking heads driven sort of journalism, very sort of starry-eyed about journalism will change the world, all of that, right? I mean, they were just very, very intense, exciting, educative years. And being a first generation television journalist, I always believed in the medium. I didn't disparage the medium, like so many people who were in it and disparaged it, which I never understood. I was like, if you hate it, why are you here? Right? I mean, my disillusionment with it came much later. Like I think in the beginning, I just mostly just loved it."

Like you mentioned talking heads on television, or there are even those, you know, talk shows like you used to host, We The People, where I was a guest three or four times, back in the aughties, where Smriti Irani got angry at me backstage, because on your show, I think you had asked me, do you believe in sacred cows? In the context of it was a show on the national anthem and flag and all that, you asked me, do you believe in sacred cows? And my answer was the only kind of the sacred cow I believe in is a divine steak on my plate. And Smriti didn't take nicely to that. But you know, to kind of get back to the question, was that also a factor that in terms of form, you wanted to expand a little bit that you found that these particular forms are constricting, and in fact, some of them have become caricatures of themselves, like talking heads on TV, and you'll have like 15 windows on a Republic TV screen."

In the sense that what I mean by that is that I feel, I don't know that anyone, even my worst critic would ever call me lazy, but I feel I grew lazy. I feel that. When I put a lens on myself, and I do my own appraisal, you know, for someone who has the energy to work all the time, it is not clear to me how I slipped into that space where I became an anchor. I never wanted to be an anchor. I only ever wanted to be a reporter. And I would keep telling all these young people would come to NDTV and you know, that all want to be so positively want to be me or be like me. And I would be like, all I want to be is a reporter and all of you want to be anchors. But I now understand that organizations had made anchors superior to reporters in what they were paid, in the time slots they got, in the attention they got from the organization and the attention they got from the public and the people that magazines chose to do profiles on and all of that. So everybody wanted to be an anchor. And I think I, the form definitely started to bore me. But I started, maybe in a phase in my life, there would still be breakout moments, I would still something would happen and I would take off. And that never stopped for me. As long as I was, you know, in TV, and even today, it's it never stopped. But the proportion of time I was spending reporting in the proportion of time I was spending in the studio changed. And I was spending way too much time in the studio. And some of it was budget cuts, and you know, channels not wanting to spend that kind of money anymore. But some of it was, I guess me, I mean, I that's what I'm saying. I grew, I grew lazy. Like, you know, that's, that's what Anui is, right? Like, you know, you like it to be stale, but you're kind of drifting along in that staleness. I mean, in the end, my parting with NDTV was not amicable. But if I were to be today with the benefit of, you know, I'm calm, and it's all good. And I look at it calmly, I think the mistake I made was that I should have left a lot earlier, when things were still decent, they were still friendly, they were still pretty good. But I had clearly outgrown both the organization in not in a bad way. I've just outgrown it. I was just that old familiar misfit. And the formats were boring for me. And I needed to go out there much quicker than I did. And for someone who's quite adventurous, the fact that I remained in the same job for some 18 years, 20 years, I mean, I don't I've now lost count of how many years, but that in itself is so counterintuitive. And so I should have done that a lot earlier. That was a mistake. It's sour things. I think it's sour things at both ends."

        "message": "Look, maybe I recognize today because I'm calmer that there is no completely free newsroom. That if we think there is in today's India, I don't think that newsroom exists. And therefore you look for the newsroom that allows you relatively the maximum freedom that you can enjoy or you break out and you work for yourself. Right. I don't think that there is this, you know, absolutely free space. For a variety of reasons. But what happened with NDTV and me, I think was a lot of different things. So I've told you about the form. I told you about the misfit. Like, I think that, like, I think growing up and becoming your own person, suddenly it's not the same easy fit. And, you know, you clash on a number of things. But certainly there were one or two stories that had been sort of, I want to say censored, but they were not fully blacked out initially. They were argued against. Parts of them were thrown out. Parts of them had to be argued through. I mean, I remember when there was this whole focus, for example, on Narendra Modi's, that suit, when Rahul Gandhi had said suit Puttaki Sarkar. Till it made its way to Parliament, NDTV didn't think we should report it because it was not their style to, you know, it's his clothes. Why are we commenting on them? And I felt, you know, it was a legitimate story. But till it actually entered Parliament, we were not able to, we were not given the go ahead to report it. There was another story around Robert Wadra and that took a little bit of argument and jousting to get through. And then finally the surgical strikes happened after the Uri terror attack. And I am at the international border doing what I love, being in the field, and I'm looking at the consequences of what's happened at the border. And I get a call from the, from the news desk from a colleague in Delhi saying that, hey, listen, this whole thing has become quite politicized because the Congress is now saying to the BGP, we've also done these surgical strikes and Chidambaram is giving these interviews. So can you get us an interview? Because he's not agreeing to, our people, people in Delhi have tried, they haven't managed. So I called Chidambaram who I obviously just by virtue of having been around so long, one knows most of these people now. And by the way, also in the BGP, it's not only in the Congress. And then I called him and he said, where are you? I said, I'm at the border. He said, I'm not going to do an interview with you while you're at the border. So when you get back to Delhi, you give me a call. So I came back to Delhi. I called him. We did an absolutely anonymous, in my opinion, boring, unremarkable, 10 minute or 15 minute, I don't remember interview. And in which he repeated the same thing that the BGP is politicizing the surgical strikes, et cetera. And, you know, this is not on, there are posters of it in UP and something basically in particular with the defense minister, if I remember correctly. Why are there posters of the defense minister? Why is he saying this? I actually thought it was a highly forgettable interview. The news desk has wanted me to do it. I handed it over and it was supposed to air in full in my show that night. I had done the interview in the morning and I got a call basically telling me that, you know, you can't run this interview. Sorry, but you can't run this interview. And I was like, why can't I run this interview? And they said, no, because, you know, it's politicizing the surgical strikes. And this is the moment for us to stand by our army. So I said that, I mean, I said one that I don't think it's an anti-army interview at all. It's an anti-politics. In fact, it's a pro-army interview in that sense. And I said, to what extent will we apply this policy? Because the story has clearly entered the phase of politics. So if we don't run Chidambaram tomorrow, if the BJP says something, we won't be able to run the BJP. And how many people will we stop? So this argument to and fro went on. And I said, well, I have to inform Chidambaram that his interview is not coming. So what should I say? Say we have decided to withhold it for this reason. So I texted Mr. Chidambaram and I said, I'm really sorry, but the interview will not be running and it's a decision taken right at the top. It's above my pay grade. And they believe that this is a politicization of the military strikes. They don't want to report on. I was flying to New York that night. I'd just written a book and I was going for some book event. And I was, and then I saw that Amit Shah was holding some press conference and Rahul Gandhi was holding some press conference. And so my colleague called me and said, you know, you're going to have to sort this out with the Roy's because how are we going to cover this story if you're no longer covering politics or what politician is saying? I said, how can I sort it out? Like, I'm just following instructions here. The next morning, the Indian Express had a front page story on the fact that Chidambaram's interview had been dropped, given to them by Chidambaram. I think Chidambaram had said that the anchor sent me this message saying that it was a decision above her pay grade. I was at this event in New York where Shashi Tharoor was on the panel and he asked me about it and I had to repeat it and say it's above my pay grade. I don't, he said, do you agree with it? I said, of course I would agree with it. No journalist agree with it, but it's not a decision that was in my hands. I mean, what could I say? That was what I thought was the appropriate thing to say, trying to be civil, remain loyal to the organization, but at the same time say as a journalist, I'm uncomfortable with what happened. And then the last sort of crazy development in this story was that there was an internal email that was sent out, which basically said that we will not be reporting any political proclamations around this because we will not be taking a position against the military. And somehow they felt that it was the same thing. And that email leaked and The Wire published that email. And I don't know if they thought that I had leaked that email. I don't know what they actually thought or that I was not organizationally loyal in defending that decision when I was asked about it externally. But from there onwards, it was a really steep downhill. I just started feeling uncomfortable. They seemed upset. I was upset. And, you know, my, my, I was a consultant by then. And because I always had it at the back of my mind that I want to do something of my own. And my contract was up for renewal in maybe a month or two months from that time. And basically, when it came up for renewal, they said to me that, you know, you have too many arguments about about the news. And so therefore, we don't think that you should be in the daily news space with us. But we'd love for you to continue to do with the people and another weekend show. And I said that I've not done anything wrong. I have stood up for a story that I believe in. And I mean, punished for an interview that I was asked to do by the organization. And so if you feel that I'm not, you know, if I'm too opinionated for the news space in this organization, I don't want to be. And so that is how that relationship basically came to a very, very volatile end. And, of course, after that, for me, the real shock of was to discover that, let's say you descriptively agreed that I was among India's top 10 journalists. Let's say, hypothetically, I found that every promoter of other channels met with me very nicely. Three of them offered me detailed contracts and then withdrew them. And it was a hell of a journey to discover that you could have been more than a decent journalist, you know, giving your life to journalism. And basically, you actually could not get an alternative opening. And at first, I thought it was something to do with the BJP because there was a suggestion that Mr. Modi doesn't like Barkha. So maybe the promoters are scared. It didn't fully add up because NDTV still existed and the BJP didn't love NDTV. There were one or two people, not too many. And then I started thinking that maybe it was just some peers in newsrooms who didn't, you know, who were like, maybe there was a moment of Schadenfreude. I don't know. And then there was a disastrous experiment with that Tiranga, Mr. Kapil Sibal back channel. And then finally, I was like, what am I even doing? I just need to be doing my own thing. I need to give up this crazy, even my heart is not in it. I had outgrown TV even while I was in it. And I just needed to have the courage to find my own sort of path. And then that's how, well, here I am. And Mojo was born and built and still being built. And there was a lot of learning. I mean, for me, it was like at the height, at the top of my career, I basically went back to the start line again. And it's fine, it's life, but it teaches you a lot about yourself, about the profession, about the fraternity, about the medium, about your country. So there's"

        "message": "been a lot of learning in that. So I have like one question coming from two different directions, but the same question. And one direction is just looking at, say, you know, after NDTV lets you go, and you've spoken about it eloquently elsewhere, also how these all these different people approach to you, and they've given you a time slot, and they've spoken about the show, and everything's been agreed, and then suddenly they just turn back, right? And there, the thought that strikes one is that the imperatives for big media houses might make it difficult to go against whatever the political dispensation of the day is the way things are. And even if it isn't the case that say Modi or Amit Shah have said ki isko mat lo, still, as you know, was famously said during the emergency, that the media when asked to bend, instead chose to crawl. And it's kind of a similar thing that preemptively these people just decide ki panga nahi lene ka hai, isko nahi lene hai. And they kind of do that. And the, like the first part of the question that emerges from there is that, therefore, can there can there be an independent future for big media? Because, you know, every media house will also have interests elsewhere, you'll have a newspaper, but you'll have a chemical factory, chemical factory pe IT raid hogaya, toh that's kind of the end of that. And that's the way the incentives go. And it's very difficult to fight against that. And therefore, all the people that you see kind of fighting against that today are the brave independent establishments, like the scrolls and wires and what you do, where they just don't have so much leverage, of course, they can pack you up and put you in jail on whatever charge, but you're presumably too small for that. So that's one angle I'm coming from. The other angle I'm coming from is that big media just because of technology and the way people discover content and filter content and consume content has become become redundant anyway, you don't need those particular gatekeepers, you don't need those particular platforms as a way of bringing creators and audiences together, or of being the middleman through who the revenue comes. Technology has changed all of that. And I don't, I don't think big media has figured that out yet. So the question that I'm coming at from these two directions is, that is big media inevitably dying then?"

        "message": "Let me answer the second one first, you know, one learning in COVID has been exactly this, that technology has been so disruptive, that actually, if you have a reasonable understanding of certain production barometers, which I do, because I did two masters in establishing shows. So what I mean by that is that if you if you see the programs on Mojo, they will not look like a Zoom call. So there will be some effort put into lighting, into sound, into graphics, you know, they may not be what we, you know, they may not be at the top scale of what I want. And as I grow, I hope to keep improving that but there will be an effort to professionalize the look. But as I told you, what used to take 15 people to make an hour of live streaming, is now done by three people. I have even done shows where sometimes, you know, it's been a Sunday, like the one I'm talking to you on, suddenly I have to do something, I'll come from my house into my basement office, and I can toggle my own show, just because I know the software, you know, I can toggle it, I can take the banners, I can take the graphics, and I can anchor while doing all of this. If you had asked me this, like when I was in NDTV, I would say it's not possible, it's not possible. But the other thing is that, you know, if what what has happened, as we all get used to what, and this is a very strange thing that has happened during COVID, is because virtual became so normalized. So if earlier, there might be somebody who chose to be mean about the fact that you weren't sending them an OB van or a live view camera unit, today would actually, you would not be considered smaller, or, you know, shoot, you know, bootstrapped, you said, here's the link, join us on this link. Nobody thinks like that anymore, right? I think, and the third thing is that the power of storytelling is now what sets you apart. So big media with all its resources, and you know, some of my, some of my, when every time I say this, I get a pushback on Twitter, and I say it, I continue to repeat it, because I believe it. I believe big media flunked the first COVID, they flunked it, right? They just kept interviewing doctors, the same doctors, the same doctors, I'm not saying that they weren't some local city reporters who were exceptions, I'm saying largely the trend was big media was too terrified to step out into the lockdown and report the story. And therefore, people like me, you know, another person who I think is just a fabulous, he's a photographer, is Praveen Jain, he works with the print, you know, three, four people like this, whom I can cite who just went out there, the people who went out there, it actually just after that did not matter whether they were in organizations of one or four, they were making more impact than all of these big corporate organizations. So technology, plus passion, plus effective storytelling equalized that opportunity. So yes, I do think that if, if independent media is supported either directly by audiences, or advertising learns to shift to it, I do think that big media is a slowly getting redundant, almost there. The only time it has an advantage over independent media is when something colossal happens. And you need 40 things. You know, let's say that, God forbid, the plates went into the Twin Towers, you know, you'd need scale to be able to tell. So we don't have scale. Yet, I think I reported COVID on a scale that no big media house did, you know, the kilometers, the states, the, you know, so you have to find, I think there are ways to do it. I think there are ways to compete. And if you look at YouTube numbers, you'll find the small media and big media are competitive in numbers. And it actually just depends show to show interview to interview, story to story. So that's the first part. Your first part of your question was the political environment. And I do want to talk a little bit about that, right? So I do think that there is a courteous being more loyal than the king environment. And it is a bit like, you know, when asked to bend, they crawled, etc. So certainly, yes, I was, I mean, I, like, they were time slots, salaries, the number of people that I needed, all of it, with multiple people who then took it back, some saying, you know, it's a bit risky for us, etc. And, frankly, I mean, I've never, I actually used to know Mr. Arun Jaitley reasonably well in the course of individual, I said to him one day, that, you know, your party may not like me, but for your party to try and take away my right to work is absolutely not acceptable. And, and he said, why do you think it's my party? You think that we have the time to call individual organizations and say, hire so-and-so and don't hire so-and-so? And if that's the case, and he argued it out with me, and I didn't have perfect answers. He said, how do you explain so-and-so is still around and so-and-so is still around? And, you know, the BGP doesn't like them either. And you know that. And I had no good answers to it. And then finally, I told him, I said, no, it's the environment, right? So even if you're not making those calls, there are people who feel that if I take this person, it's too much. But if I would evaluate it, honestly, today, I would say it's partly the environment, definitely. And it's partly our fraternity. Unfortunately, we are a divided, extremely competitive, small hearted fraternity. And we enjoy when somebody who we compete with, we think is down and out or one less person to compete with. Why would I allow my competitor into my newsroom? He'll come take away my slot. Let's be honest. I mean, it's a combination, I believe, of both. And for myself, I fault myself for chasing that television chimera when I knew that it was done for me. I knew it before I had that final parting with NDTV. If I had just been more authentic to myself, I would have probably left on better terms. I would have left at a more, you know, earlier, I would have had more years to build Mojo, all of that. So of course, it's, you know, all of it is simultaneously true."

And one aspect is, of course, you're moving from one form to the other. And you are kind of doing the kind of stories you want to do. Now, earlier, you spoke about performative politicians, which was very much a thing that I remember from the 90s. And one of the things that you know, you obviously encountered a lot is politicians who were playing to a certain script on camera, but were completely different off camera. And therefore, everything that they are presenting on television, and therefore, everything that you're showing off them on television is in a sense constructed. It is a sort of a battle of narratives that is playing out there and off screen, everything is kind of completely different. So how does this affect the way that you look at the sort of storytelling that is going on? Because at some level, even when you're chasing a story, you're constructing a narrative of it in your head, which is very much of course, shaped and limited by what we ourselves are. But then I mean, if you're authentic to ourselves, that's perfectly fine. We just put in the best faith effort that we can. But when our subjects are politicians, when you see that, you know, they are one thing on screen and another off screen, then what is the value of telling that story which is on the screen? You know, how do you kind of get past that?"

But you know that that conventional form of political journalism, one, I think I don't understand data and caste in the in the way that so many other people do. And I think without that understanding and without that love, you can't really get into the underbelly of the electoral process. And that leaves the sort of more cosmetic interview format with these politicians, right? I do it. I'm not saying I never do it. But it's not interesting to me. It's not especially interesting. It's not especially challenging. And mostly for that reason that there's very little discovery in it, right? So it's so you, you almost do it because it's something in the news. Sometimes there are characters that are interesting to people. So for example, if you know, Tamil Nadu has this new finance minister for a while, he's interesting because he's, he's interesting for that context. You know, he's having some battle with Sadhguru. He's a believer in a Dravidian party. So it's a very specific, finite context, right? But there's very little discovery. I also think I'm bad at it. Like, I consider myself a, you know, a very good storyteller. But the one thing that I don't tell interestingly is politics. I don't know how to make it interesting. And what happened was that, you know, when I was in NDTV, in mainstream media, the hierarchy was so tilted towards political journalism, and you kind of felt that you couldn't be very much if you weren't going to cover politics. And so there was always this pressure. And it was also a male-female thing, because, you know, men were reporting politics and, you know, there was that pressure that you felt for yourself. And I, and I tried, but I frankly find it, I won't say boring, but I would say unexciting. So I agree with you. I think there's very little discovery possible in political journalism, especially in India, where, unlike, let's say, the Washington Post, where I'm a columnist, you know, you had spoken earlier about, and I didn't address that about the corporate ownership of media. Either your institutions have to be so free that Jeff Bezos has no say in what Washington Post writes. And one of the reasons for that is that Jeff Bezos' companies are not controlled by the government, you know, how his business grows. So here, it's a very complicated thing. One of the reasons that corporates are scared, and I'm not defending them, is that governments can control the outcome or the future of that chemical plant, or, you know, that fertilizer plant, or someone who needs a license, etc. So they will then use the media either as prestige or vanity or influence. And the moment they're using it is that you're never going to be institutionally free. And without institutional freedom, I don't know if there's an interesting way to report politics. The only other interesting way to report politics is one that I'm weak at, which is to use data or caste, and I'm weak at both of them. So I personally, if you will see, I don't do that much political journalism in the way that I once used to, because I've recognized it not to be my strong suit."

But the question here is that in the course of your work, you come across and I don't know if you consider him unsavory, but I certainly do.

And of course, doing what I do as a little labor of love, I have the luxury of not inviting unsavory people on my show. But you won't always have had that, especially when you were at NDTV or especially if you have the imperative that if something is newsworthy, if it is in the news, I have to do it, I have to kind of cover all of those, even if I personally find the idea of talking to this person abhorrent.

And I'm not always consistent with this because one part of me feels that we can't just be interviewing people we like, right? I like such few people. I'll have no interviews. So in a genuine way, I like such few people, right? So the point is, but more seriously, I don't think our subjective likes and dislikes should determine who we talk to. That said, I do believe the interview format in particular is a format that civilizes and mainstreams. And I can tell you two interviews that I have refused to do. One is of Hafiz Saeed, which was offered to me. I said, there's no way I'm going to interview him. I can imagine doing a narrative ground reportage driven, this is the headquarters of Hafiz Saeed. And in that context where I can provide context, maybe getting two short soundbites from him, because there would be an opportunity to place him in a narrative. But I find the interview format extremely, extremely civilized, right? And therefore, I do not believe that at least I have it in me to call somebody for an interview that keeps shouting at them and saying, oh, you're a disgusting person. Like, I don't think that I've been brought up like that. However, sort of South Delhi elite that sounds. So I said no to him and I have stubbornly refused. And I don't know how long I can carry this on to interview anybody from the Taliban. And I have been extremely uncomfortable. Even before they took over Kabul, I saw the spokespeople on, you know, on these channels. I find it extraordinary that these, these hate mongering anchors who, you know, will vilify any Indian Muslim who has a slightly cauterian view to theirs will give this respect to the Taliban spokesperson. And I don't know if this is a logical position for me to take, because, you know, they are now the government in Afghanistan. Now, am I going to say that this is a government that I will never interview because these are areas I do report on. So these are not easy decisions. I certainly think that the interview format is a form of legitimacy, mainstreaming, civility. But equally, I think that you can't just interview people you like. You have to interview people who are either newsy or interesting or relevant. And Taliban is relevant, but how do you shake off the fact that they're terrorists? So, you know, I mean, the honest answer is every day I just take a subjective, that's the freedom of being on your own, right? You just take the decision that you're comfortable with, if your audience understands. Yeah."

So tell me about Mojo, because you know, when I look back on the last 16 months since COVID, really, it's been a great learning experience for me in terms of new media and what creators can really do, where I've been watching tons of stuff on YouTube by independent bloggers and whatever. And one of the things I've kind of realized is that just the way that in the aughties, blogs freed you from the convention of written journalism, that, you know, blogs, if you were a blogger, you did not have to conform to the news cycle, you could write something that was that didn't fit within 800 words, it could be 80 or 8000. You had freedom of style, you had all of that, and different people used it to find their voice. And I find that much more in the audio visual medium. And I would imagine that carries through to anything creators do, including creators slash journalists like yourself. So when you were forming Mojo, what was your conception of what Mojo can be like, did you have any role models for Mojo that hey, look at the work these people are doing that they're breaking past these forms and formulas and conventions and so on. And from that initial conception of Mojo, is your current conception of it different because of what you might have gone through in these COVID months, for example?"

        "message": "So I mean, you know, it was actually many years ago that I first thought and that's when I first became a consultant for NDTV that I do something like Huffington Post. In my simple minded way, I didn't really understand Huffington Post, but I saw one Ariana Huffington being able to create this sort of, you know, content driven thing. And I was like, Oh, I could do something like that. But I didn't really understand at that time that Huffington Post didn't pay the people who contributed to it. I hadn't examined it that carefully and all of that. When Mojo was conceptualized, firstly, everybody, this is the really irritating thing. Everybody thinks Mojo means mobile journalism. Mojo just means magic. It's like the song, right? Like, I don't know. It's like, anyway. But I had a few things I was clear on. And a lot of people argued that I was wrong. And I actually think that my instinct on this was right. So if you see most digital platforms, typically do text and then they do video. And video comes second. And one of the reasons is video is more complicated. It's more expensive. It takes more people, etc. I was very clear that I was going to be a video first platform. That was the first thing. And the second thing I was very clear about is that I needed to find something that would pay the bills, right? So how was I going to pay the bills? And it came to me that I need to do something somewhat in the field of journalism, but not necessarily conventional journalism that will help me create some kind of resource funding. So even before Mojo was born, I created this, created and curated this gender festival called We The Women. It was the only way, you know, approximate way of using We The People without getting copyrighted. So I took We The Women and we started an annual festival at Mehboob Studio in Bombay. And the idea was somewhat influenced by Tina Brown, whose sessions I had attended in New York as a speaker who used to run something called Women In The World. And what I saw was some, she described it as journalism on stage. And I found that a very interesting concept where you had the skills of the interview, but you also had the editorial craft needed to read a set of conversations and create that light and shadow, but the energy of a live audience. And I used to find it a very magical thing. And I thought, Oh, maybe I can do something like this in India where the glamorous person and the grassroots person is equal. And if we could get them on stage together as equal people in the speaker's lounge, how interesting would that be? And so that's how We The Women was born. We found that, you know, I'm a lousy sort of marketer. So I like a lot of people that have made, you know, done more with it than I've been able to, but we found that there were sponsors willing to back it. We started with We The Women and Mojo was really almost like this parking spot for We The Women videos while I was still thinking I'll do TV one day. So We The Women was born. And then in the October of 2019, when I finally said, okay, now this is my life. By this time, I was clear that I needed to go back to being a reporter. And that is what Mojo was going to be about. And it was going to be about putting people first. And it was going to be about issues that either mattered to people, as I imagine that they matter to people, or issues that people didn't know about, but would matter to them if they knew about them. And about people who did not have a voice to amplify their stories. So this was broadly it. And, you know, it was a, in my mind, it had two motives. One, returning news to the people. And two, going to where the story is. As often as you can, go to where the story is. Don't sit behind the table and do a story. These were the two guiding principles. And we didn't know that COVID was coming then. So when Mojo started, we had the citizenship legislation protests and the student unrest. And, you know, we were deep into that. Then came the Dehti riots. We were deep into that. And then came COVID. And we were deep into that. And so we stuck to that conception of Mojo. But what's happened is that I've been so busy reporting that I have not had time to pause and build. And I would really like to build this beyond myself. I don't, this is not a Barkha Dutt channel. This is, hopefully, will be a platform for journalists who want to go to where the story is and pick up these kind of issues. So that's where I am. So I won't say the conception has changed, but it's got solidified. It's got reinforced. Even the way our audience reacts, they react better to when we go out to tell a story. And anyway, that's what we love doing. So it's a good fit right now between what the audience wants and what we want to do."

That on the one hand, every financer would tell you that, hey, why don't you scale this thing and you can make a lot of money. And obviously, you do want the platform to be bigger and bigger and keep embracing the values that it does. But at the same time, it gets diluted. The more you scale it, because right now, it's got a particular identity. You know what you get that it's Barkha out in the field doing stories in her distinctive style, and everyone who watches it watches it for you. And if that gets diluted, what might happen is that the numbers might go up, but the engagement might come down because the level of intimacy will therefore be lower. So is this a trade-off that you've thought about that you actually had to confront and say that I actually have a choice between taking a route that helps me to stay true to myself without any compromises. But on the other hand, I could make a lot of money, you know?"

The Americans never apologize for being individual centric organizations, right? So like Tina Oprah, Tina Brown, even if they're television anchors, there's no apology for the cult of personality. Whereas in India, thinking is not like that, right? We are also groomed to be somewhat squeamish about, oh, no, it's not just my channel. So there's one that I think our culture, our communication culture does allow for these solo centric entities. The other thing is, I genuinely, even if it did, I genuinely do want to have something that I create that, I mean, it's too grand to say that outclassed me. So I want to say that is more, that is me, but more than me. So I want it to be me, but it has to be more than me. So just like I think my COVID work or my Cargill work is more than me, it's me, but it's more than me. There has to be, you know, it, I would love if I could curate something effectively or mentor something or intubate something effectively that it has these values, but it has a few other people too. Now I have, I've been very, I'm not a conservative status quo person at all, but I have been extremely incremental with Mojo. I've been extremely, almost frugal with how I have approached it. And sometimes I wonder if I've done the right thing. I look at all these, you know, massive media startups in the digital space, well-funded, they have 50, 60 reporters and, you know, here it's me. And I keep wondering sometimes, there are days when you think, you know, was the approach right? But I, I still think that the baby steps are okay. I don't know. I think you have a point that you dilute your authenticity by becoming something all purpose. So I think we're still looking for that formula where we're still very much the imprint of the values that I think define me, but are able to distribute them a little bit more. I don't know if that makes any sense. Also, I have to recognize with, with modesty that there are audiences that my grammar doesn't speak to, you know? So for example, our YouTube analytics tells us that our maximum audience is between the ages of 25 to 45, right? Now they're used to a different grammar. I don't, I don't have, and that's why I find that in peacetime they don't watch. So if there's a crisis, they want to see what I'm, they want to see me go and tell that story. But in between the crisis, what do we tell them? What do we do? And we haven't, you know, we, we, we're searching for the answer to that question. And I think your point is great. I don't have a perfect answer to it."

And, you know, obviously I'm guessing a young startup, a lot of young people work with you. What is the difference that you find in the young people who are starting out in journalism today, as opposed to say, 20 years ago, you know, because one, they are much more exposed to different sets of values from the West and are, have received much more exposure to other kinds of journalism, including best practices elsewhere. And two, they would be much more hip with the technology. The technology would be like an extension of what they are doing and not something that they have to spend effort learning, you know, so to say.

So one is that kind of hungry youngster who knows the technology, but they don't necessarily know the content. So the struggle then is that they know the technologies, they know how to do an Insta reel and they know how to do a story and they know how to shoot with their phones and they like, they have a visual grammar, but they don't follow news. They're not journalists. And you're not sure why they're in journalism because journalism is not what excites. The challenge I think is that journalism is a gentrified profession. So you're not always getting, sometimes you do, and it's a hit and miss and you got to go through the attrition of people coming, going, your misjudging, misjudging you until you slowly build a team that you love and that loves you back. But I will say that people are entering this profession for the wrong reasons. In my opinion, the wrong reasons. I'm not an Oracle, but in my opinion, the wrong reasons. And it goes back to where our conversation started. They're not necessarily passionate. They're not necessarily, this is not what they live and breathe. This is not what excites them. This is almost glamorous or it's interesting for a bit, or it's what they want to do before they study a little more. It's a rites of passage. So it's, it's not always easy. I had thought that the younger a team I have, the more they're going to teach me the technology and I, you know, but I was surprised to find, and this is where I find this sort of the Instagramification of our lives so frightening that while we know how to put on a camera and dance before it or wear a sari before it or do whatever performance art before it, it doesn't automatically translate into using it to tell a story. So it's, it's, there's no one truth. So there's some very hungry, very bright, very brilliant people. And many of them are from the smaller towns of India. There's this real hunger in them. There's an aspirational sort of this thing, but there's also a whole bunch of them who are just exploring. It's a kind of, let's see what this is about because it's no longer an alternative profession, right? There was a time when this was an alternative profession.

        "message": "No, no, but it's a great question. No, it's a great question. Because one of the things that I feel about COVID is that it taught me not just about, see, I always understood India's inequities as an academic understanding and not as a lived one, right? The other thing is that I never did reporting on those inequities because it was considered in the hierarchy of news feature reporting, right? So very coarsely put, I was a conflict reporter, I covered war and conflict, insurgency and foreign policy, sometimes politics. And I didn't see myself as someone who covered poverty or education or health. And unfortunately, because we in the hierarchy of newsrooms placed those as sort of social justice featurey reports, people like me had no experience, maybe on the odd We The People episode, but just no lived experience telling these stories. And I remember in the early days, I went to this, there were two things that happened right near Delhi, and I didn't even know those places existed. And one was this village in Delhi, or I forget now if it's Delhi or it's UP, but I think it's Delhi. No, it's Delhi. And you can get to it only by boat. And it's in Delhi. It's in Delhi. And I was like, and you go on some swanky flyover, and you go under the flyover, and you hit some, you know, you go left inside some neighborhood. And then there is literally a village where till this date, the only way to get to it is by boat, right? And I was like, what? Okay, so that was an example. And then there was another village, I think that was in Haryana, it's about an hour from the capital, where of course, there was no civic water supply, right? Now you have this yellow water. So it was like, I remember I did this story called the village with the yellow water. And everybody at that time was like water, wash your hands, wash your hands. But when these, firstly, it was wrong science, but we didn't know it then. And we thought at that time that COVID could be transmitted by surfaces. But when these villagers would go and wash their hands with this contaminant water, because there were some factories that had come up in the neighborhood, their skin would break into rashes. So they were able to wash their hands with this yellow water. So they would either have to, whatever, boil that water, get rid of its yellow or buy mineral water and so on. And they didn't have the money to buy mineral water, right? Now, I know I sound like one of those sort of Orientalist, sort of white people coming to India for the first time. I'm just saying, I had never told these stories. I personally had never reported these stories. I had never been exposed to the scale of poverty, despair, inequity on a daily basis. And I've been beaten and thrashed more times than I can count, had near life and death experiences. But I remember once, I saw this viral video of these migrant workers who were appealing, someone please get us home, someone please get us home. And I don't forget now how I traced them, but I traced them down. And it turned out, again, that they were working for a factory based in Delhi. So I went to the factory and I found that there were these sort of ceiling high corrugated till sheets and a lock, a kind of lock on the compound. I somehow managed to make my way into this compound. And I started talking to the people there and I discovered that they were basically locked inside this compound. So in this some sort of largesse of the owner way, the owner decided, the owner of this factory decided that the best way to keep these workers safe was to keep them under lock and key for their own good, for their own good in courts. And so there was this board with this timings when they were allowed to step out of this compound and otherwise they were kept under lock and key. And when we started filming the story, the security guards came, they snatched our cameras, they took away our equipment and they were like, get the hell out of there. And I obviously created such a noise and I still had my phone and I started tweeting Kejriwal and all of that. It was 45 minutes before we were able to get out of there. And of course, after that, you know, they were allowed to go out and they were given money and they were put on, there were no trains. So I don't know what happened and what happened eventually. I forget now because there were so many stories I did, but I'm saying these were the kind of experiences that, you know, I was like, how was all this happening under my nose? And I never thought it important enough to report because obviously all of this was happening under my nose, right? All of our noses. So one was the inequity, living and observing, witnessing it every day. But the second was the invisibilization of the inequity, right? The invisibilization, the lack of interest in these stories. And yet, because I essentially see myself as a storyteller and not as an activist and this is something important to me, I knew that I can't stand at some pulpit and tell everybody, oh, how wrong it is for you to not care about the poor of this country, right? I had to tell the stories in such a way that people would care. And that's why I really do believe that it all comes back to effective storytelling. So yeah, you've already summarized that it started with me going, I would spend 16 hours in the car and I would come back to Delhi, just stop sleeping. I think the damage is a very slow growing damage. It doesn't hit you instantly, especially if you've had reasonable exposure to violence and tragedy and despair. But to see tragedy day after day, to see death day after day, to see people shut out of hospitals, the doors shut in their face. I saw a new mother whose baby was one day old, outside a hospital that couldn't take her in. I reported the story of a painter, when I say a painter, I mean a house painter who took his own life after selling his phone for 2,500 rupees to buy a table fan in Roshan. One year later, I went to see what happened to his family. They lived in the same slum, completely invisible, completely forgotten. You know, Jyoti, the girl who cycled with her father back home to Bihar. I went back to her village a year later. I found myself, I don't know what the word is, but I found that it was like a slow growing depression. A slow growing depression and a slow growing mental damage. That is how I do react. I react in the first flush by simply getting the story out there. And it's only when I step back and I allow that internalization to take place of the enormity of what one has just witnessed, I just stop sleeping. I think I haven't slept. Like if you ask me what's been the singular change in me, I think I can't sleep anymore. I just cannot sleep anymore. And I'm old enough to recognize that it's the damage of everything that I have witnessed. You also come back with guilt. You can't help it. You know it's not rational, but there is guilt for your privilege. You know that you can, you know, I think I was talking to Rekha Jha and I said to her that I come back to defense colony and I go and buy Cadbury's nutties and I see the dissonance and I put them in my car and I say, okay, I'm going to be on the road for 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours. I eat these nutties and you see the dissonance because you're meeting that child, the nine-year-old who will tell you COVID means I don't have food to eat. When I asked the worker, what is it that you carry when you leave? He had a white plastic bucket. And I said, is it okay if with you, if I take the lid off and I took the lid off and in his bucket, and I found this so moving that I, I think I cried all night that day, were his ozans. They were just his workman's tools. So this migrant worker getting on, by that time there were trucks getting, paying 5,000 rupees to get a spot on that crowded truck to some town, is leaving only with one thing, a plastic bucket, which has his tools, which means he wants to work, right? He wants to work. He's willing, he's not asking for charity. He wants to work and that's what he's leaving with. I had a very, very strange experience with the PPE, which I should talk a little bit about. It was actually extraordinary. So, you know, when we went into these hospitals, we had to wear the same PPE. We would carry it from Delhi so that we didn't cut into doctor's stocks. And literally every time I wore one, I would rush out of the hospital, stripped to the skin and feel nauseous. And that evening, invariably feel depressed and cry in whatever room I was staying in and call up a friend and say, oh, it was a PPE day. And it made no scientific sense to me. Till I interviewed a nurse in Mumbai at Kama Hospital and she had an extraordinary story. And she said that she was there the night Kasab broke into the hospital and she'd saved, you know, a lot of lives that day. And she told me that she feels sick every time she wears the PPE. And in particular, if she is menstruating and she has to wear her PPE, she says something about the plastic and the smell and it just, and maybe it's the thing, absence of oxygen to your brain. And, you know, and, and, and that she would just, that it would have this kind of psychosomatic impact on her. And I said, you know, I, I mean, I wear it for half an hour and I come out tonight. I said, I can't even imagine what you'll go through. But I began to realize that there was so much here that we didn't, you know, we didn't understand. So, or I used to think maybe I think it's the PPE, it's just my depression transferring. So the things I don't know, but I think I became a somewhat solitary and sad person in these 16 months. And I continue to be that in some ways, like in, except when I'm reporting a story, I just suddenly feel energized. But otherwise there's a, there's a sense of feeling deflated by so much despair, you know, so much and so much happening around you that gives you no hope. So I think that's, that's how one feels. And, and yet through it all, because it's all contradictory, just the opportunity to report the biggest news assignment that the world will, we will ever see as journalists in our lifetime. And that's what I told everybody in my team. I said, it is actually a privilege to be able to report the story, to be an exempt essential services media in this country. This in my lifetime is the biggest story I will ever report. I recognize."

        "message": "Yeah. Sometimes, sometimes it feels grandiose when people come up with that old cliche about journalism being the first draft of history, but I think the import of that is something that really comes out here. And you mentioned the, you know, the workman carrying his azaar in a bucket. And it reminded me of one of my favorite episodes of the scene in the unseen that I did with Anshul Malhotra, who wrote that beautiful book on, you know, what people carry with them through partition. And, you know, specifically, I remember this, you know, there's one family which didn't carry their, what you would think their valuables and their ornaments and this and that, but they carried vessels for the practical reason that they might have to cook food somewhere along the way if they are given food. So poignant. And you mentioned the house painter Mukesh, right? And, and the story you did from a Haryana village in this also stayed with me is a migrant worker from Bihar. He sells his mobile phone for 2000 bucks, but you know, buys a fan for 500 bucks, because it's really hot. Yeah, gives 1500 to his wife and kills himself. And at this moment, everything changes, right? That 2000 from being such a, you know, you get 2000 bucks for a, like, that's one Zomato order for us. And 2000 bucks, and there's a whole world in that. And the act of giving it to his wife and then going and whatever, it's, it's like unbelievable. And, you know, these stories contain so much that need to be told. And, you know, more credit to you for that. We're coming to the end of our time. So like a couple of final questions. And for one, I'm again, going to read out a poem that you posted on Instagram. And I especially love like the first couple of lines of it. And this is called Little Crazy Love Song by Mary Oliver. I don't want eventual I want soon. It's 5am it's noon. It's dusk falling to dark I listen to music I eat up a few wild poems while time creeps along as though it's got all day. This is what I have the dull hangover of waiting the blush of my heart on the damp grass, the flower face moon, a gull broods on the shore where a moment ago they were to softly my right hand fondles my left hand as though it were you stop good and I just love this poem. And those first two lines I don't want eventual I want soon. And that has a resonance to me also beyond the notion of romantic love, which this poem seems to allude to, you know, because as I think as I have grown older, I have come to realize that the only way to be happy is to redefine my conception of happiness to taking joy in what is current in what is present in the present moment rather than, you know, look ahead to other things. So you've mentioned how everything about this pandemic kind of drove you to despair during your reporting that the world can be such a harsh place sometimes. So have your conceptions of what you need to do to be happy or what you look forward to each day? Has that evolved over a period of time? Like where is it now? I could easily ask you or career wise tell me where will Barkha be in 10 years and whatever. But I think what makes me more interested is what makes you happy? You know, are there are there small pleasures? What do you look forward to?"

        "message": "I mean, I think that poem really spoke to me because I don't think there's a lot of time. I don't actually understand people who say there's time for this. There's time for that. Be patient. I don't think there's a lot of time. And if ever we needed any instruction in how little time there is, I think this pandemic taught us that, right? I am haunted by the fact that my father's last text message to me, which I didn't even respond to because I mean, after that, our exchange was only about hospitals and medicines, was about some music system in my house that he wanted to fix and set up to some speakers. And I thought he was irritating me about it. And I'll, you know, discuss it with him later. And why has he got so obsessed with his music system? And he used to love tinkering with equipment and a bit of an engineer and mechanical sort of hobbyist. And I kept saying, oh, yeah, this time when I come back from this set of travels, I'll go and meet him and I'll do this and I'll do that. There's never time. There's never time. It's the here. It's the now. But at the same time, that doesn't mean I believe only in the ephemeral moment. I simply believe that if you want something, you know, a new story, an ambition, a person, you've got to go for it with everything you have, because you may not get that opportunity ever again. I really do believe that and I believe that even more today than I ever did. What makes you be happy? Very small things, very, very small things. I don't have any meta. I mean, the meta things are the same that they would be for everybody, right? Like, you know, I obviously care very much about my work. I care very much what happens to Mojo. If Mojo does well, it would make me very happy. My work matters a lot to me. But otherwise, small things that make me happy, you know, I mean, I don't know, I watch Murder Mystery and it makes me happy. I'm obsessed with watching Murder Mysteries or espionage or thrillers. I'm obsessed with eating off the street. I'm obsessed with eating chaat. I eat chaat from every vedi, every vendor. Like the smallest town I've been to, I have had a plate of golgappas from there. These silly things and travel makes me happy. And I have survived these 16 months because despite the despair and the tragedy and the horror, I did not experience a lockdown. I am one of those lucky people that I did not experience a lockdown. And that is why I say that, you know, to be able to experience a reality outside of the reality I was born into is the ultimate privilege of journalism. And even in all its sadness, it makes me happy, if that makes any sense. It makes me happy that I'm able to unlearn, learn, sometimes make a difference, sometimes get somebody to contribute financially to their bank accounts, sometimes just the adventure of it. There are many different, you know, buttons it taps. But journalism for everything makes me happy. It makes me really happy."

        "message": "Wow. So a final question. And I think you've kind of answered some of the next question in the answer that you just gave. But if there are young people listening to this, say young people of any gender who want to get into journalism or want to be journalists, or if there are specifically young women who don't necessarily want to be journalists, but are just trying to navigate life as it is in this performative age, where, you know, voices can be so shrill and expectations can be so harsh, what would be your advice to them? And one of them you've just given is embrace the present moment, just, you know, have a bias towards action, as it were. But, you know, what else would you like to share with them?"

        "message": "You know, I was once doing a talk for a group of women. And I said, no, there were men too actually in that meeting. And I said that I want to do a kind of straw poll here. And I said, it's my sense that if I asked the women here, how many of you have had to suppress your dreams, you know, that how I think that more than 90% would say yes. And we just did this experiment. And it was 95% of the women in the audience said that they'd had to set aside their dream for something or the other. And I would like to say, in particular to young women, please be selfish. And I know that this is not a politically correct thing to say, but the romance around selflessness and sacrifice when it comes to women, in particular Indian women, this romance around being superwomen, who are all things to all people, the self-created romance that women will, these compliments that we will give ourselves, although we're great multitaskers, these are chains of gold, right? They sound like compliments. All they do is to crush your original passion. This life is not worth living if you have not lived your original, at least if you have not tried to pursue whatever that thing is that keeps you up at night, right? It doesn't have to be journalistic. It can be whatever. But please, in this fragile time, if anything we have learned, it is that, you know, that old cliche, you live just once and there isn't a lot of time. If you want to be a journalist, I will still say, yes, I know the TV channels present a different template, but I will still say you will be remembered only if you're authentic and you will be authentic only if you love this. If you do not love it, no judgment, but don't do it."
