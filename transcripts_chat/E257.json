Looking at a teacup, they might see all the forces of history that shape it, the habits of society in a moment in time, all the different cultural influences around that give it the shape and weight and texture that we take for granted. A teacup contains so much information that it might even be talking to you. And all you have to do is listen. Now, at one level, I think this might be overthinking it, chai piyo aash karo. But at another level, it is true that all the inanimate things around us have rich histories and are full of meaning, if only we choose to look for them. I often say we should never take people for granted. Well, maybe we shouldn't take things for granted as well."

        "message": "Welcome to the seen and the unseen. My guest today is Annapurna Garimela, a designer, curator and art historian. She was one of my fellow judges for the JCB prize for literature earlier this year, just like the author Sarah Rai, who features in episode 255 of the show. Annapurna comes from a different imaginative world and sensibility than mine. And I loved our brief conversation so much that I figured I had to get her on this show and have a longer chat. We finally made it happen. She shared her rich memories of growing up in a world that was partly rural and partly urban. I was struck by the richness and detail in her memories and felt that a world had opened up to me. We spoke about remembering and reflecting, academia and scholarship, art and access, the different ways in which we see the world. We also argued a bit. She's wary of markets, while I love markets and technology because they've empowered and liberated individual creators like me and freed me from the whims of elite gatekeepers. Some of our conversation was transcendental, and some was combative. I'm sure you'll find lots to think about. You'll also never look at teacups in quite the same way. Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade. This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month. They also have a great program called Future Stack, which helps you stay up to date with ideas, skills and mental models that will help you stay relevant in the future. Future Stack batches start every Saturday. What's more, you get a discount of a whopping 2,500 rupees, 2,500 if you use the discount code UNSEEN. So head on over to CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com and use the code UNSEEN. Up level yourself. Anupona, welcome to the scene and the unseen."

        "message": "So I'm really looking forward to our conversation in an odd way because I feel like I know very little about you. Most of my guests are people whose books I might have read or whose work I have followed and all of that. And we've of course, you and I have interacted during the Zoom jury meetings of the JCB Prize and all of that. So in a sense, I feel like I know you, but I also feel like I don't know more about you. I have a sense of who you are, but not really knowledge of what makes you who you are or what makes you what you are and so on and so forth, which is a sort of an interesting place to be in. So I want to really start right at the beginning. Tell me about, you know, where you were born, where you grew up, the texture of your life, of the young Anupona's life when you were a kid. Because I think, you know, another interesting facet that I often explore during the show is talking to guests who are my age or older or from decades past, as it were, and talking about their lives because the texture of life was so different then. You know, one of my friends once said that kids growing up today will never know what it is to be lost, like physically lost because you have maps. They might even never know what it is to be bored in that sense of having nothing to do. They can be bored in different ways. But you know, they can be immersed in a smartphone. Well, I think back in the day, I could just be immersed in a book or, you know, Sarah, our mutual friend once, you know, when I recorded with her a few days back, she said this very interesting thing where she said that she was a deep reader from a very early age because of the dullness of life. There was nothing else. And I asked her about observation skills, which, as you would have realized, are incredibly acute. And she said that I noticed things so well, because there was nothing else to do. You had to look at things. And I don't buy that explanation because many other people lived in those times and her powers of observation are extraordinary. So give me a sense of what the texture of your young years were wherever you born. What was that like?"

        "message": "So I was born in 1966 in June in my grandparents' house in rural Andhra Pradesh in East Godavari District. So this area is called Kona Seema. People who are aware of Indian languages will understand that this is a delta. Kona is for tri, for delta and Seema is the boundary area. So this is an agrarian landscape that's today one of the richest agrarian regions in India. And it really became that rich because of the construction of the Buckingham Canal, which comes from Orissa all the way down to Pondicherry. And Mr. Cotton, who has a museum dedicated to him in Rajahmundry, created innumerable canals that flow through this delta village to village and inundated the landscape, the rivers that were flowing out of the Godavari Nakrishna into the Bay of Bengal were directed before they flowed out into the landscape. So the time I came to this landscape, it was, it looked like it had been rich and fertile forever, but in fact was probably only that fertile for about 100, 150 years. So I'm named Annapurna because on my paternal side, somebody went to Varanasi where she's the goddess of the city. And she is a very important goddess for Telugu speaking people. Telugu speaking priests are the priests at the temple of Annapurna. And he came back, he did a padiyatra and he came back and he came back safe and sound. So he took a vow that the first child of every family in his lineage would be named after her. So I am named Annapurna after this. So these kinds of things completely shape you. So my grandfather, my, both my grandmothers are Annapurna and my grandfather adored me. I am one of 30 children of his surviving 10 children. There were many pregnancies. He adored my grandmother, I think. And therefore there are a lot of children. They produce children and we are 30 and I'm this, and they're primarily all boys. We're only nine girls out of this. And I'm the second oldest girl and the girl that spent the most time with everyone else for various reasons, which I can explain if you'd like. And because I spent so much of my time between my grandparents' village and also Bhopal where my father worked as a junior engineer at BHEL, I had these two things of India, which I think are the things of India that people think of post-independence as a dynamic that had to be negotiated. Rurality and industrial development, rural development and industrial development. So my grandfather was very interesting. I come from an upper caste Brahmin family. And of course there are things that are mythologized by me and by all of us, but he was a very kind man. And the atmosphere that he permeated everywhere was of a person who was an only child and had many children, many sisters. The father was not alive, so he had to take care of all those sisters. So in my grandparents' house, his six daughters, his wife, and his four or five sisters, they're all having babies at the same time. So I had that world and the world of being in Bhopal, living in the quarters, the ground level quarters. So there was a garden and I was there by myself. And I was an only child for 10 years. So it was this really interesting dichotomy between being surrounded in the village with lots of people and being in Bhopal with very few people in the household except my parents. And I think that because it was so dichotomous, it prompted me to constantly adjust. And if you're constantly adjusting, you start reflecting on what you're adjusting. And then the reflection on what you're adjusting begins to make you think about adjusting itself. Or it did to me. This is over time. It's not like it popped into my head at age four or something. But also what it does is, growing up that way for me anyway, my grandfather made it perfectly okay. He was a very modern man in his own way. So he wanted a Chevrolet. He practiced the rituals of Brahmanical masculinity to satisfy my grandmother to some extent, like doing things like Sandhyavadana. But outside of the house, he didn't really practice caste untouchability at all. So I went with him to the fields whenever I was there, and we would sit all day in the field, which he would do, I think, basically to enjoy that time. And our best friends were the people who worked in the fields, I think. And of course, there was total complex hierarchy, but he also felt an enormous responsibility. So funding their children's marriages and education, none of them are field hands anymore. They're all moved on, and my family doesn't have that house anymore. So they still have the roots there. So these are all interesting things. But my grandfather swam, and he believed, I think, caste doesn't matter because water is flowing, and water is washing everyone. So he had these ideas, I think. I don't know if we ever talked about it. We never talked about it. But sometimes, if you're observing people and you see the way they carry themselves, he was a big man. The way he carried himself, you understood that his shoulders were not scared of the touch. He wasn't scrunching himself. He was wide open to bounce, for his shoulders to rub against other kinds of shoulders, those kinds of things. At home, in our house, we were a very wealthy family. So Burma teak granaries, seven of them, were filled with rice. And they were the size of the height of this building that we're in right now, 1-1 Granary. And that kind of wealth was there. And so my childhood was spent playing in the granaries, playing with tamarind seeds, making palm leaf dolls. Because I spent so much time with them, there was this ritual of the door being opened in the morning, and then it would stay open all day long till night when we went to sleep. And this was a huge ceremonial teak door. And it was a house that was built about more than, now it still exists, it's more than 150 years old. So architecture, which is one of the things I study very deeply, formed in my head. And relationships, like the side passages in which lower caste or women who had their periods or people who had to perform some kind of service, they came, or foods that were not allowed to be cooked inside the main kitchen, all these things were designated, there were spaces for them. His mother lived there, my great-grandmother lived there, she decided to have her own kitchen to have a different relationship with her daughter-in-law. And these granaries were, there was a big teak box, I would say it's about, it was about three feet or four feet deep and about five to six feet wide, which was filled with grain. And in the morning in this door, which was never closed, people would come and they'd say, Dehi bhikshan dehi mata annapurneshwari. And my grandfather and my grandmother, not my grandfather, but my grandmother and my aunts and uncles, they would tell me to go give it. And later on, my partner gave me the insight that perhaps it was an interesting way for a small hand to give small quantity in ritual, that you're giving something, but that you didn't get into the discourse with the child about, is this enough, is this not enough, all these sort of things. But that kind of programs you, like what is your identity is programmed when you're named after the food goddess, when your task in your grandparents' house is to give the food. There's so much cooking in our household and preparations of vadis and pickles, and you know, aunt has very rich in mangoes of various kinds, very famous for its pickles, so lots of pickles and poppards were made on lungis in the summers. And going to the film theater, as you may know, many film theaters in Andhra, the architecture of them is based on rice mills, the person who talks about them is SV Srinivas. And we would go to theaters, this was a big thing, my aunt and I would go in a horse and horse cart. I can't believe I have this life. We would go in a horse cart at night and we would sit in the theater and watch movies. They called this the Gandhi class and then there was other classes in this theater. You start, it's very odd because there are many places I understood about caste and class and gender, but I also understood that there were always people who were transgressing those boundaries. And that's very important to me to know, hold those two things in my head because I focus on this, I forget this. And if I focus on this, I forget this. So I keep that in practice, whether it's in my work or in the way that I understand the politics of the spaces I live in, the country that I live in, or the places I've lived in. So that was my childhood in my village. In Bhopal, it was very different. In any case, my grandfather was very interested in me being very independent. So from the beginning, and he was very tender with me. So getting my nose pierced is his thing, getting my ears pierced is his thing. And he did all sorts of wrong things. Like he told the jeweler who would be sitting opposite me, pierce her ears and pierce her nose. That was at a later point. In Andhra, women get their nose pierced on the right side, but he told him to do it on the right. He didn't specify to the jeweler from his right, so my right, not his. So he pierced me on the wrong side. And of course, my grandmother and my mother, everybody scolded my grandfather intensely for doing the ritually wrong thing. And these things, so in a way, I feel like he made it okay to be not fitting in or something like that. And then when we lived in Bhopal, I was very much an independent person. So Bhopal, that colony, BHL colony, was relatively far out of the city. At three and four, I would just walk out and walk onto the national highway, and then my father's friend would pick me up and bring me back home. And this was like a real problem for my parents, my sense of sovereignty, maybe, or autonomy, or a sense that maybe it's not even sovereign. Maybe it's a sense that the universe is good with me, and I can live in it with some fearlessness. And I think I was a very hard child for my parents. I think that's also very important for me to state, since you asked this question. I loved my mother very much. I have some memories of my father taking me every Sunday when he went vegetable shopping to the old city of Bhopal, and me standing in front of his Vespa scooter. And my hands would be on the handlebar, and I would see that I had two, three glass bangles, and I'd come back, and I'd see my hands, and they'd be full of glass bangles. So this was a weekly ritual. These are very nice memories. My father was a very deep listener of classical music, Carnatic music. And as a junior engineer, he already purchased a reel-to-reel tape machine in the 1960s in Bhopal. It's a very expensive thing to purchase, have. So from a very young age, I have a practice of sitting and listening to music continuously for two to three hours. Doesn't mean that I wasn't irritated sometimes, but nobody asked me to do it, but it's just something that entered me. At that time, BHEL employees, engineers would go to England because the connection to England was still very strong, industrial England. So my uncle, who happened to be an engineer at BHEL also, so this is also, we must remember that the reason why so many South Indian Brahmins have advanced is because the family connections allowed them to develop these kinds of economic ladders between families and for each other. So he asked my father to come and work there. And I had a very severe illness when I was young, and they thought I would die. So my uncle had gone to Liverpool for training, and he brought back for me cod liver oil tablets and those tiny little record players for short, small records, right? And what did he bring back for me? They were the Beatles records and they were rainbow colored. So there was a guava tree in my parents' garden, and my grandmother had given me a small, tiny bell metal pot for play cooking. And there was this little record player, and I would make these little bridges between the trees for water and I'd put this thing on, and I would listen to, I think it was Strawberry Fields and a couple of other records over and over again and cook. I think when I say I love places, when I think of myself and I say I love places, I think it's the idea of making a place began there and making a place and knowing places like the garden or my grandparents' house. They're very profound experiences. So Bhopal was really, really also a beautiful place to know people from all over India because these quarters, these early days of these mega industries had people, there's a Maharashtrian auntie and uncle upstairs. There were other caste Andhra people working, Telugu speaking people, Punjabi people. And the great thing that marked my life as a child was that these industries gave leave travel allowance to their employees. So what many engineers and families did, they rented a bus and then they would drive from Bhopal to various places. We would stay in gurudwaras. We would have langar because obviously there wasn't that much money. In this process, I saw so much of the Gangetic belt of Rajasthan, Gujarat, all the way to Varanasi. And I think my first sense that architecture and archeology were going to be deeply profound things for me. Well I remember, there are like three, four moments that are so crystal clear in my head. One is like when we went to Abu and Girnar and Shatrunjaya, the sense of spaciousness and being on top of mountains and these white temples, very, very powerful. And then another really big moment was, as I mentioned to you in our conversation, Jaipur and being in Jaipur and the Jori Bazaar and like the way that the textures of beads and stuff were really important to me. But I think the two places that really impacted me were Khajuraho and Varanasi. Khajuraho, my parents were not the most, I don't think anybody was in those days, but my parents did not hover too much over me. And I'm probably not the kind of person that people can hover over. And they left me on the plinth of one of the big temples. I think it was Khandariya Mahadeva or the Lakshmana temple. And you know, even then, this was the early days when the flights from Delhi to Varanasi had to stop over in Khajuraho. So the triangle that they call, like it was beginning to happen. And I watched lots of people looking at the erotic sculpture and looking at all of this. And I just had this feeling of mere saare room kade ho gaye. I can even remember that moment now, of my hairs on my arms, just standing up with the energy of this place, this structure. And it's, I don't know if I had the sense to say, oh, this is beautiful or not beautiful. I knew it was powerful. And not in a scary way, that it was powerful because somebody had designed it to be intricate and full of stories and put lots of challenging things on it, like erotic sculpture. Even then, we all know by that age, this is the thing that you're supposed to know and not know about. And then the other place that's really important to me is Varanasi because my mother went into, I think it was the Sankatmochan temple. And the mahant there gave her a genda phool mala. And he put it over, he put it on my neck. And my mother took me out onto the ghats, maybe it was busy or something. And she said, you stand here. As I mentioned, they weren't really hovery kind of parents. And this cow came there and started eating the genda phool on my mala. And I might have been four or five at the most at this. And there was no fear inside of me. And then I thought like it's this, if I look back, and of course, memory is very funny, and I'm not interested in analyzing the truth of memory or not. You get what you get, and you live with that, right? So what the memory tells me, and even at that moment, the memory that I have of my feeling is that this place is so old and expansive, that nothing can hurt me. Not even this cow who's chewing these flowers. And then of course, people started shouting, and then my mother heard or something happened. And then she came and something happened. I don't remember the rest. But I remember this moment very deeply. So this is my childhood in India. When I was eight, I went to eight and a half, we moved to the United States. I was also a brief period in Sikandrabad, where I went to the Kendriya Vidyalaya. I went to school in my grandparents' village for a little while, because my father was already itching to go somewhere else where he could fund his music obsession. He was interested in Carnatic music primarily. And the school in my grandparents' village had cow dung on the floor. So every morning we had to put cow dung on the floors and do a rangoli, mugu as we call it. And then Kendriya Vidyalaya was really nice because it was in Pickett or someplace near there. There's many Kendriya Vidyalayas now. Now I'm a little hazy. I was little at that moment. But it was Sikandrabad and there were still fields in the middle of the city because it hadn't grown so much. So you could see rice growing and that really deep green of rice. And it was very nice. My entire childhood was filled with Hindi. Hindi, Telugu, of course, very beautiful Telugu, but lots of Hindi because my mother and my father watched a hell of a lot of Hindi movies. And my father would play people like Talat Mahmood and Soraya. Begum Soraya? I forget her name. It'll come back to me. All these records. Talat Mahmood's very vivid. KL Saigal. I love KL Saigal. And lots of music from there. So I don't remember not having Carnatic music, The Beatles and Hindi film songs very close to me all my life when I was growing up. And when I was eight and a half, I moved to the US."

One of the themes that I sort of love to explore and which I sort of will ask you about is the nature of memory, not in the sense you said you don't want to talk about, you know, truth and memory and all, but just the nature of memory itself, because a couple of thoughts. One is that when you're actually living and I'm really talking about, in a sense, looking back on how I have sort of lived and how I remember things that while living, sometimes you're not mindful. Things happen and you're not mindful of them in that moment. But later you remember them and in your memory, you fill those things out. And I did this episode I really loved with Anshul Malhotra, who wrote that fabulous book on, you know, partition survivors, their memories through the things that they got with them. And one of the things we discussed there was how we now know that how memory functions is when you remember something for the first time, you remember it, what actually happened. But the next time you remember it, you remember the remembering and so on down the line. It's almost like Chinese whispers inside your head, which is why, you know, something could happen to say you and your sister at exactly the same time, but you could have a completely different memories of it. And that leads me to the sort of thought that at one level, it's completely true that we are shaped by what happens to us. But it is also true in the other direction, that what we remember of what happens to us is shaped by who we are. And therefore, the question like all these beautiful details you came up with, the teak door, playing in the granaries, the tiny bell metal pot, all of these details, you know, and these are the things you remember, any of your siblings or cousins growing up with you would perhaps remember different things. And they are different people. And you've kind of hinted at being like a rebellious kid who would, you know, you can't hover over Annapurna is the kind of sense that I already get from that. And it's not just that you are shaped by everything happening to you, because it's also happening to others. So where do you begin to get a sense of the person you become? If that is something you can possibly nail down, like, you know, where do you begin to get the sense of I like these things? I like this kind of art. Oh, I like architecture and no one else does. And by the way, anyone listening to the episode so far would find you wonderfully sanskari because your two seminal moments as you describe them involve a temple and"

        "message": "a cow. So well done with that. That's why I always think about, as I mentioned to you earlier, like, how does it feel to be on the other side of this and this side of this? It's always there. I'll tell you a story and I'll answer that question. So I love my grandmother. She's dead now. Of course, I'm 55. So she has to be dead. She's not going to be alive. So they make pickles in Andhra and pickles get old. And every year you make pickles. And then they cook lots of rice because in a household full of this many people, you have to cook a large quantity of rice. So leftover rice is kept in a terracotta pot outside the door because you can't touch it after you have, when you are cooking because you have to be madi. Madi is this idea that you're ritually pure for cooking and for puja. But people would come and she was in her own way attentive to their hunger. But in a way that I find taught me so many things about cruelty. So they would take the rice out of that pot. These are people who worked in the fields or around the house. And there would be that old pickle. And she would have a jar of that old pickle. She would pull out the old pickle. They would stand outside of the kitchen in the open area. And I happened to be standing somewhere between my grandmother and this person I loved very much. I don't remember who that person is. It was a man. And she pulled out the old pickle, not this year's pickle, but the previous year. And she flicked it into his plate because she can't touch his plate, that rice him. And at that moment, I remember very, very deeply thinking about, am I him? Am I her? Who am I? Or am I that pickle? I don't think I invented that way of looking. I think this comes back to what your question or your comment. I think some things are given to you and you don't have choices. So I am a person who was given this facility to notice things from a very early age. I don't remember never being a person who didn't notice. And I notice people's emotions and feelings, things they're doing. Not everything. I just notice, notice, notice. So if you're noticing all the time, even if you don't notice everything, it's too much. There's no respite from noticing. So I've always been the person that's taken breaks. And when I take a break, what do I do? I think about what I noticed. So there is this capacity that developed in, I think, people who are like us. That first time is the remembering, but the reflection on that process becomes that. Now, this is not the experience of many people who've not grown up in large families like I have, but I grew up in a very large family and we're a family that likes to remember for each other. So if you have a memory and you share it with them and they not only remember, so your memory's confirmed when you have that many people who are with you because you're not the individual that's the capitalist individual or whatever you want to call it, like neoliberal individual or whatever, but you are this individual of a certain moment of joint family modernity. And they remember. So for example, my Masi, who I adore and is now 70, told me the other day that one day she saw this blue thing in the doorway in my grandparents' house, and it was coming from the well where clothes were washed and baths were taken. And what was it? I was maybe three. I had taken all of that robin blue and applied it all over myself, every part that I could reach. Another time, we have this tradition of painting yellow and turmeric. It should be turmeric and kumkum, but it's yellow and red paint. I was so fascinated by the yellow paint that I applied it all over myself as a little person. I am to this day deeply, deeply, deeply interested in color. So when somebody criticizes me or challenges me about something, I have to say, okay, I was formed this way because of this background, but I also know that some things just were there. Like for example, there's color exoticism about India, constant fetishization of India through its colors. But as a child, I don't remember a moment not being particularly interested in the density of looking at a color, the blackness of kajal, which we made at home, or the depth of the blue in that packet, or the yellow color that it's being painted. My grandmother also pounded haldi sticks with lime to make it into kumkum in my grandparents' house, mortar and pestle. So the transformation of the yellow haldi and the white of the lime into this kumkum, there's this constant sort of thing. So memory, I think, works differently for people who come from different time periods and different social experiences. So in my understanding, memory for me is inseparable from having a huge number of people reiterate a memory, an event, a set of emotions, not the same emotions as mine, but some emotions. And in a way, sometimes I think about this, I know I'm an individual and I'm such a very much a person in myself, but there are moments where you feel like, where do I begin in this story? And where do they begin? Where do they end? And I don't have any anxiety about that. I think that subjectivity doesn't always need to be in a subject solely. It can be dispersed and crystallized at a certain moment when a story is told, when an event is recounted. Oh, Poorna is always like this. I'm called Poorna Bhavani at home. So she's always like this. She loves color and whatever. So these are things I think could also work where you could have the remembering the first time you remember, then the remembering the remembering, but then the other people around you. And this is the beauty of having some sort of continuity in social structures. And it could also be the terror of them. Maybe people need to forget many things in order to evolve better. And I have chosen to forget things too. I have chosen to rebel. So in a society, in a world in which forgetting was instrumental and remembering was both instrumental and affectionate or a sense of insult, this is all there. But this is the world I was given. So I have to learn to be fond of it and to have some distance from it and all those sort of things, right? So I think that it can also be the first time it happens, then the remembering of that remembering, and then also this understanding that there's a lot of people around you at certain moments who was around you to remember. I had a very similar experience at grad school in Columbia. When my beloved friends from grad school, we all sit together, there's some crystal clear memories for us. And we keep ourselves attached to the freshness of that moment of coming to Columbia University as graduate students by recounting certain stories like my best friend, Deborah Diamond, and I were in Sanskrit class together. And we happened to be joking about Sanskrit, making Sanskrit jokes. It's part of being a geek. And she would say things like, bhoga, bhoga, bhoga, like when you were really into eating whatever you're eating or whatever. Or we would have these funny ideas of, we were reading some Puranic stuff and of having swimming toys where you would have Ananta as the floating swimming toy. And then you would be, Lakshmi or Vishnu floating on it and he would be in the middle of a swimming pool. All these like weird jokes, which probably aren't funny to anybody else. But the memory of us making these jokes in front of, I think it was near the Frick Library and Museum in Manhattan. It's so, hmm. I think, I think things work like that sometimes."

        "message": "Yeah. And one of the memories from what you're recounting, you know, you speak about forgetting is being instrumental sometimes and important sometimes and you need to do it and you speak about remembering being instrumental and also, you know, affectionate, like, you know, your college memories, for example. And it's, and this interesting memory of the pickle being flicked across, right? Seems to me to be in the category of the sort of memory you maybe want to forget, but you remember it is clearly vivid for you. I mean, you notice stuff, right? But the next step after noticing is at some point in time, you look back and you begin to make sense of it. Like initially, I get that instinctive revulsion that someone you love is being treated like this by someone you love. And you may not at that point, if you're a little child understand any more of it than that. But later on, you kind of, I suppose, begin to sort it out. I mean, your grandfather having broad shoulders in the way that he did is a formulation that would have come upon you later. So tell me a little bit about how beyond this whole visceral taking in of everything that is happening and the instinctive responses to that, you know, how do you start thinking about this stuff? How do you start making sense of the world? Like, one of the dangers for many young people is that they find a particular way to look at the world, whether it's an ideology or points of views or whatever. And all of these simple narratives or ways of looking at the world can be so seductive that you just give in to them. And because, you know, it just works. They're also instrumental in a sense. Give me a sense of, you know, what was your journey like in that sense? Like, what were your years in America like? You know, is there a moment where the stark difference between where you are and where you came from kind of makes you think and starts, you know, starts shaping your memories even?"

        "message": "Well, you know, I actually think that children have a deep sense of justice. Deep, deep sense of justice. And if you're growing up in a family like I did, other children will develop it in a different way. You're constantly thinking about, for example, I'm fair-skinned. There are many fair-skinned people in my family. I'm sure there was some deep cross-pollination that they have conveniently forgotten, instrumentally forgotten. Much fairer people than I. And my grandmother favored me for that. Also, I was the second oldest girl. I was always like smiling and happy kind of child, with them at least. And so, in her kitchen, she would set out all the plates. Like, we were before, by 1975, there were 15 of us already born. So, any meal would have a minimum of 15 people that she would have to cook for and serve. So, you don't have to go elsewhere to understand justice, inequality, the dynamics of human preference, and uncivility, unkindness. So, these 15 plates would be here. There are many boys. She also had some favorites in her boys. There's no way you can love 15 people all the same. That's not possible. So, she made this unbelievably delicious coconut chutney, freshly ground in the mortar and pestle. Those coconuts, because there's so many people, the coconuts were cracked by somebody else. They were chipped into smaller pieces. They were put into the mortar and pestle, and then she would grind it with tamarind and all the delicious spices. We all loved it. So, she would come by bent. She wouldn't haunch it. She would bend, and she would serve each of us in the plate. Definitely, I got more. Definitely, some of the boys that she liked got more. Then there were the girls, the other girls, who were not as fair-skinned, also not as interested in her, didn't get. Now, whether they were uninterested because she didn't extend herself to them, or that in 15 people it's not possible for everybody to be, I began to understand that I got a lot of favor because of, at a very young age, you don't need to articulate it. I feel like you don't need to articulate it. There's some sense of justice that comes around from the fight. Why did you give so much to someone else? That fight is there. Or I would tell my male cousins, so they would drag me. They wouldn't even put their damn coffee cup back in the sink. I would say, I would feel that resentment, boiling resentment, like why do they get to leave their cups there? This is at their house, not at my grandparents' house. You couldn't do that there, but you would, this sort of thing. In my case, I violated a lot of the boundaries they set. And I think children do this all the time. I would touch my grandmother when she was muddy. I would go hug all the people that I loved and loved and loved and hugged them. I would use really the worst curse words against my grandfather when he took me around on his shoulders in the village, and he never stopped me. So if I look back, I also understand this, this way, that yes, it's a deeply unfair world, but challenging it doesn't mean that the people that are being challenged will necessarily react violently to a child. Now, they might have reacted differently to another kind of person, but to a child, I feel like children have an enormous capacity to challenge systems because they're just so unmade still. There's so much in the process. So gradually, my grandmother shed most of these things over her own lifetime. My grandfather, of course, operated in a different way. Many things took decades to change. But you know, it's not like I didn't suffer. These families are really hard because there's also sexual abuse. There's also having you sit outside every time you have period. Your first four days, you have your periods. There's enormous labor extracted both from the boys and the girls in different shades because these are huge families. But it depends also a lot. In my case, I've thought about all these things. I never feel victimized by any of these experiences. Now I think of it in one way, but over my lifetime, they've just felt like things that make me cry sometimes, but things that also teach me much more than they make me cry. So I'll tell you about America in a second. I didn't see the system in America being vastly fair. But today, I think about all that has happened as material, like clay material. You have material to work with. Every day, it's an aesthetic commitment to work with that material. It is an ethical commitment to work with that material, and that material accrues more material. This is more material. I'm going to reflect on this a lot when I leave this studio. We have some sort of responsibility to make ourselves agentive in relationship to the material that life gives you. We become agentive in one way or another, no matter where we come from. Now, there are always socially, politically made ways to rob you of that sense of agency, and that's a responsibility, collective responsibility, that we have to each other to foster a sense of... Agency doesn't mean rights, rights, it doesn't mean responsibilities. It's a sense of consciousness. It's a sense of capacity. When I moved to the United States, it was in 1975. The civil rights movement had ended. The hippie movement, the 1968 struggle at Berkeley had also finished. The Vietnam War had come to an end. Richard Nixon had resigned. Gerald Ford had become the interim prime president of the United States. I arrived there on, I think somewhere close to January 26th, maybe January 26th, which is odd, 1975. I remember coming from the airport, JFK, to New Jersey, to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where my parents were living at that time. Elizabeth, New Jersey is an industrial town. The Anheuser-Busch factory is there, and many other, it's a port, so it's stinky. So, on the way, you see a lot of lights on the highway, and I would see these signs like, Washa Rama, something Rama. And I thought, oh, this place won't be so bad, they like our god. And this is, the Rama of my childhood is a storybook Rama. He's not so much a god Rama, he's a storybook Rama. He's the stories that we read in Amar Chitra Katha, or Chandamama, or my parents. My parents weren't very into storytelling, but somebody would be telling some story. Or there would be in films, that was primarily where I, N. T. Ramana acting as Rama. So, I thought, this place won't be so bad. I did not want to leave my grandparents. I adored my life in India, loved it. And we go there, and I said, okay, this won't be so bad. Later on, like 30 years later, my friend in graduate school told me, that's because Panorama was so interesting and new then, that's why people started naming, oh, Rama, to all these non-cinematic things. Like the way that.com became the name after a point for so many. And I really think that, and then we went to school, the next day, my father put me in school, and they changed my name from Annapurna to Anna, because those were the years of assimilation. And they were not being unkind. This was the way they thought they were being gracious. My father, we would go to the city regularly, because you have to remember, these were the years when the great concerts were happening at Carnegie Hall with M. S. Subbalakshmi, or whoever, all these great people are coming. So we would drive from New Jersey and go. And if you park, you have to park on the street there. And this was the deep, bad years of New York City, when it was crime-ridden and people were scared of the city and lots of drugs and whatnot. And he would see an African-American man walking, and he would park the car somewhere else. And I'm sitting in the backseat looking at all this happening, I'm nine years old, and I'm thinking, he doesn't look that different from us in terms of skin color. And why is Nana doing this? Like, Dad was fair-skinned, but not in any way that was so hugely different from many African-American people, who are actually at least 33%, according to statistics, the last time I read them, were of European origin descent. So also, if you grow up, because anyway, I was an only child when I went there, my company was the radio. And I'm very grateful to be on a podcast, because I love, I think my love of listening comes from being such a radio person. I listened to the great music of American soul, right? Like soul music, like people like Aretha Franklin and the guy who sang Sitting in the Morning Sun, Marvin Gaye, sitting in the... Yeah, anyway, all these beautiful, beautiful music, Donna Summer, the disco period, and all these people. And I didn't really identify so much with white culture. Now, I'm not saying anything against it or for it, I just didn't identify with it. Because you have to remember, in my school in New Jersey, no kid had more than, nobody wore anything but jeans and a t-shirt to school. We might have had three t-shirts and two pairs of jeans, one running shoe and one regular shoe. Everybody wore sneakers. My best friend was Gina Conti, whose father was a pizza maker, Italian descent pizza maker. I really think that the class divisions that exacerbated the differences across race that we experienced more fully, and it's not that they didn't exist then, but there was this little bit of flatness of social stratification. The stratification wasn't so big in my school because it was largely poor and working class. And not poor, I wouldn't say working class. I wouldn't call that poor. I would call it working class. And then when we moved from there to Edison, New Jersey, which is now a little bit climbing up the NRI ladder, then things changed again. There, my close friends were a girl from a Korean migrant family and a Jewish girl, who was very, very Sherry Cantor in Yeonhae Park. Very nice people. I didn't have any friends in school who were South Asian, so I had to make friends. Not that I would have necessarily not made friends with these people, because I'm generally a person who flows towards what I like. It doesn't matter what it is. I think these things really taught me a lot. So if I imagine, like I have one grandfather who's a Gandhian and he wove kadhi all his life. My grandfather of a certain kind of social praxis of doing something at home to satisfy certain ancestral responsibilities and familial responsibilities, and then the way that he was outside. I also have another very rich, rich, rich family who was Brahmo partly near Rajahmundry. And then you come to the United States and my father funded our arrival in the United States. He's a Brahmin, working as a butcher at the nighttime as an engineer during the daytime and as a butcher in Pathmark or some large grocery chain at supermarket, A&P, I don't remember which one. And I was very aware of all these things, not in any ideological way, but just aware that this is the material of my life. And my father didn't have, wasn't anti-beef. He took me to Burger King and had me eat a burger and I couldn't eat it because it was too rich for me and I couldn't stomach it. I'm not used, I wasn't used to it. But I had Subways sometimes which were heroes, like they're called Sub, Submarine Sandwiches are heroes and they had meat in it. All these things are like, what I find I think is the deepest problem is there's a kind of dogma to how you're something now. Like if you are vegetarian, you must be dogmatic about your vegetarianism. A friend of mine's grandmother, another Brahmin family said, by the time you're dead, said to her, by the time you're dead, you'll have eaten at least the elephant head size of non-vegetarian because every grain in India will have some bug in it."

        "message": "It's a great way of putting it because if you look at a rice grain, we all are consuming this. But it's an orientation of how you structure your cooking and your eating and then it can be just that. It can be, for example, sometimes I'm really troubled by industrialized chicken farming. I just can't handle it. So I stop buying those eggs. I eat eggs from another source. So this is, I think, answering the question in some way that you've asked, which is I think what I learned from that time in America, and it was also you have to remember the hippie culture had its, America lost the Vietnam War and it had a terrible moral, terribly beautiful moral self-examination over the Vietnam War. I was witness to that. I understood that a society could collectively do something really wrong and also could collectively negotiate the wrongdoing to understand something about it. I still don't agree with the way the major American media and pop culture and whatnot portray its relationships either to internal communities or to other countries, but I did see this. I did see the end of the Watergate and I did see this. And I wrote to Gerald Ford when I was nine saying I'd like to thank you from school. I wrote to it, but actually I wrote to Jimmy Carter saying, may I come and work for your campaign? Because he was a peanut farmer and I was quite charmed by it. Farming felt familiar, of course. And so there was these, I think there are things like that. I think there, I feel like one of the big rich things of my life is my parents were so neglectful that no one ever told me, think this, think that, do this, do that. And if my grandmother said, don't touch me, I'm muddy now. And I touched her, she'd just go take another bath. There was no severe retribution from them. I faced a lot of, I don't want to talk about it too much because it's boring, but abuse from my parents. So I understood that you just have to be aware to your own life and have it available to you. I think that's really important. It's your life, not yours only. It's the life that the universe has given you and you have to be aware and present to it. It's giving you that same thing. You don't need to go have 20 million new experiences to learn. Every time I reflect on somebody talking to me, making that eye to me, oh, you're not ordering anything non-vegetarian. You're ticking off the choice vegetarian when you have to select. Sometimes I get that reaction and I'm sure I'm not the only one. And I think to myself, well, you'll find out more about me. I won't give them, I won't give the situation the power to limit the horizons of how I'm to be known by someone. But that's something that I think if you've lived in a very diverse way that I feel like I have, you understand something like that. Maybe that's what I've understood."

And the first one is a disagreement and the possible reason for this disagreement might be that you're a good person and I'm not such a good person. But I disagreed with what you said about kids having an inherent sense of fairness. Like I think of kids much more in a lot of the fly's way. And you know, you look at the child armies of East Timor or Sierra Leone and whatever, what's going on and what has happened in West Africa. You look at how kids can often act in incredibly brutal ways that are inexplicable. Like even in the Nirbhaya rape case, for example, the most brutal of them was really a kid. And Robert Sapolsky, the biologist has written eloquently about how especially with boys, the brain stops, completes its development, not stops, completes its development when men reach 25. Because that's when they get fully socialized, which is why there is so much violence among, you know, teenagers and young men and all of that. But anyway, that aside, I'd like to say something to that."

        "message": "Please do. Yeah. I do believe children have an inherent sense of justice. They also are deeply unjust. They are deeply unjust. So they understand what is, it's unjust, but they do it anyway. So they're sociopaths. No, I don't know about that. My thinking isn't so far along. But I do know that in my own life and what I've observed, children can be very unjust and that puts an enormous collective responsibility on having life, not telling how to be just, but showing how to be just. So may I give you some examples? Please, please. So my uncle who brought me the record player and the cod liver oil tablets, he also bought me a doll from England and it was white. And I took it with me and it was a tall doll. And I took it with me to my village. My grandfather saw this doll. Now, if you say, is my grandfather like a deep anti-colonial person or something? No. But he looked at that doll and he said to me, understand that I'm maybe four at this point, maybe three or four. He said to me, looking at this doll every day will make you think poorly of yourself. Something like that will make you self-conscious because it was a white doll. And he threw it into the attic. I'm sure it's still there in that building. The way that he thought about money, he earned a lot of money, but he gave away vast amounts of money to the point that it was penury at the end of his life. Though two districts shut down when he died for two days, there was no money left. So everything had to be sold because he gave away money to so many people. And he wanted to, he was fascinated by modernity. So he gave his daughter's education, he bought a Chevrolet, he swam, he had these kinds of things. He also finally decided to fight in elections. And this was not a smart thing for him to do. There was no way to win elections because the tides were turning of the demographics of who could win elections in that area. And I think back and I think like, I watched people like this. When my mother was deeply abusive towards me, my mother and my father, my aunt stepped in and took over the role of being a mother. At school, you would observe, like I went to a Carmelite convent in Bhopal, and Carmelites can be very stern and they have a lot of physical punishment, like scales on the knuckles and all these kinds of things. I think children in that space were deeply aware. They were mean, but they were also aware that this was unfair. Now how does this all get settled into something like being a good person and something like being a sociopath? I think it takes a lot more than that. But I do think children have both a sense of justice as well, a fairness, and a sense of cruelty. Both exist. They're fully human people. They have all their emotions. I think that it does take a lot, like when I was in New Jersey, my school, Mrs. Mayofsky, who was just the most delightful, wonderful teacher in third grade, we had cooking class. We made cook two days a week in class, and we fed each other. This was just simple things. Made popcorn and boiled something, I don't know, something. I was always good at school, so I finished school, finished my work in class, and I would help others. So she told me a couple of times to sit back, but then she put it in my report card that Annapurna is very smart, and she works hard, but she should learn to not help other people and sit in her chair when her work is done. And I feel like these are really beautiful things, what she taught about me, that don't make people dependent on you. It took me decades to learn that fully. Decades. I don't talk nearly the way I used to talk before. I've found real plenitude in silence. But in those years, I was like an electrical plug that could plug into many different sockets. And I think these things, there's a responsibility. People like those children, child soldiers, don't become cruel just like that. And it's just because they're children doesn't mean that they don't have that cup. That's why we have to be so good to children. We have an enormous responsibility to be good to them. Not good like pampering them with silly chocolates and games and stuff, but take their moral, emotional, sensual, aesthetic, intellectual needs seriously. Commit to them. Otherwise, you have delinquents. You have sad, depressed people. And again, these things can also be biological. Some things just come. My father is like a totally bad person. I know that. I'm not sure I'm supposed to say stuff like that in a podcast, but everything that we know about him from all our families is that he was very, very, he had tremendous capacity for cruelty in a family that doesn't have that kind of thing. But he also had some really beautiful qualities. Once I asked a friend of mine who loves to listen to music, classical music, someone I knew, not a friend, someone I knew well at one point, how is it that people who listen to such beautiful music can be so cruel? And this was a reflection on my thinking about him, both him and my father. I think I've read enough of meditations in novels and things about cruelty that sometimes children are so beautiful. And for men, sometimes women are so, I don't know. People choose to allow themselves to be provoked by certain things for good and for worse. Sometimes they also have no choice about what provokes them. But then once you're provoked, you have a responsibility to reflect on that provocation. How are you going to be managed? Are you going to go and like, you feel really, really vulnerable. You feel disempowered. How are you going to handle this situation? I remember when I was 10, my mother hadn't had my sister yet. And there was a girl in my apartment complex in Edison, New Jersey. And I had gossiped about her to other children. And her mother called me to their house, working class woman, I think a single mother. And she said, you shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't have spoken about her like that to other people. You made her sad. You hurt her. I cannot believe what a beautiful thing she did for me. There was another girl and her mother was also a single mother. This is another experience I really thank America for, is the diversity of people that I encountered there. Same thing I thank India for, just a different way. And my mother was very hard on me. But Andrea, this woman, she was a single mother young. She was a very nice mother to her daughter who was younger than me. And she happened to be reading Khalil Gibran, a passage about children and them being arrows you shoot into the air. And she gave me that. I borrowed the book from her and I read it to my mother. My mother was so angry with me. I don't remember my mother being angry with nearly the same weight as I remember Andrea giving me this book, Khalil Gibran, and introducing me to a person who reflects on such things. Oh, adults do this. Adults have thoughts about what is, they think about having choices about what kind of parent to be. So I think it's very, very important to take children's inner lives, social lives, intellectual lives, very, very seriously."

        "message": "So let's deviate from this so far sort of linear narrative of your life for a moment and I'll digress and just ask a question that comes to mind. One, I agree with you. I think we're all as human beings hardwired for all kinds of different contradictory things. We are wired for empathy. We are also wired in a sense for selfishness and the cruelty that it leads to. And you know, I love Steven Pinker's quote on this, where he says, nature gives you knobs, nurture turns them. And perhaps, you know, someone like you might have a bigger empathy knob, and you know, you just need to turn it a little and some people have a much smaller knob and so on. And Pinker in his book, The Better Angels of Our Nature also makes a point about the importance of literature. Like you spoke about, you used an interesting phrase where you said, it is our responsibility to reflect. And now I'm thinking how do most people even get the tools to be reflective? And one way of doing so, which is Pinker's point, is that every time you read a novel, you enter someone else's head. You know, you are given one life to live, which is the one you're born into. But you live many lives when you read books, when you enter the lives of others, as it were. And that can kind of build empathy that can build a sort of both a terror and an ability to sort of step back and, you know, look at the world. Now, on the one hand, you just spoke about how, how can someone who listens to such grand music be such a monster? And I'm sure many monsters listen to grand music. But is do you feel that there is something to that, that the appreciation for art, like especially in India, I think anyone who appreciates in a mindful way, our art or our cuisine or anything, even the way we dress is less likely to be bigoted because you would obviously understand that it comes from everywhere."

        "message": "So I would like to say that this is what I mean when I say spaces to construct spaces to reflect for children. But I think we need to continuously do this all our lives, right? So for me, art, all of life is a space to reflect. One facet of like post-Renaissance, post-Enlightenment ideological formation of human beings is to say that literature is the highest art, because as I mentioned the other day that Norman Rush had said that, you know, after the Bible, it's the novel, that literature is the highest art. But I think all different ways, spaces, all different moments, all different things that cause you to stop and reflect and are designed to make people stop and reflect are important. So when I was younger, I don't feel I'm being linear. For me, all time is always unfolding on each other, right? So this movie called Mamta came out, and it has two or three beautiful songs in it. And one of them is Rahe Na Rahe Hum, or Rehte Te Kabhi, I think Rehte Te Kabhi, Is Kooje Mein Angaaron Ki Tarha. It's a beautiful, beautiful song. I knew what it meant, that song, for a small child to see that movie, I knew, I saw it not when it was released, but just a few years later, maybe I was eight, nine, one of my Friday nights with my mother watching movies things. I knew that what he was communicating is what is the responsibility of a man to a woman that has been wronged by society that he loves, and how does one come, and then there's another beautiful song in there, Chhoopalo Yoon Dil Lo Diye Ki Tarha Kandir Mein, something like that. It'll come to me, I'm a little nervous. Usually I remember all the lyrics. So what is the responsibility? The same question I had when I watched Amar Prem with Rajesh Khanna and Sharmila Tagore. These are popular cinema, but when he goes into Kuch Toh Log Kahenge Logon Ka Kaam Hai Kahna, why can't that be a moment for anyone to sit back and reflect? He says this, and I'm speaking this because I'm a woman. These were the first understandings of myself as a feminist. I am a feminist, and I think it's one of the most sensuous and intellectually interesting things to be, is how do you look at the world from this, calling yourself a feminist, what does it mean to make the world in front of you, inside of you, day in and day out? So these are the beginnings of speculating on what is the responsibility for a man who understands, not reviles a woman, but understands a woman. We know about men who revile, but there are also men, I know there are men, I know many of them personally, who understand women. All these novels, one of the biggest things that formed me were biographies. So when I was very little, I was always a very devout reader, so the new books would come to the school library in New Jersey, wherever I went to school. The librarians were my best friends. They would keep the new books before they were catalogued for me on Friday. I would take them home, devour them, and bring them back. So the things that I took a lot were, among the witchcraft and sorcery books, were biographies of people. So biographies of Clara Barton, Florence Nightingale, Margaret Mead, so many different people. And I really, really think that today, if I say to my daughter, you must learn everything you need to know from a book to reflect, it won't work. That was possible at a moment, like when I was 15 and I was staying in my grandparents' house for six months, I discovered in a cabinet small bound copies of so many Shakespeare plays. I read them continuously, like reading Cornelius Rex continuously. Who does that? But it changes you to do these sort of things. I feel like literature isn't the only thing. I feel like art and literature are very important, formalized spaces for such things. But so many people who make really beautiful art are so fucking corrupt, you know, and so disdainful of the internal complexities and unfairnesses in their own work. So I feel very strongly that everything in life has to be seen, not in a pressuresome way, but as you have to be so open that you are receiving whatever it has to give you. A friend of mine who's from Kerala, and he is my friend, once told me not so long ago, we were talking, and this was my first understanding of the reading culture in Kerala and the way that the government press publishes, you know, the Sahitya Akademi or whatever, the Kerala Academy, Sahitya Akademi publishes so many books and then there's a contract to send them to school libraries and there's a ready-made population to buy books there, institutional purchasing. So I said, oh, that's really interesting. And I hadn't arrived at good yet because I was still absorbing that this thing could happen that way. And he said to me, and then I asked him, do you like to read? And he said, I read, but I don't read so much. And I said, ah. And then he felt like he had to explain himself. He said, because reading can be corrupting too. And I totally agree with that because I think people think that they're becoming something by being well-read, but that's not true. I have a friend, another friend, Jeebesh Bhakchi, who I sit sometimes and talk things over with. He's part of an artist collective. And one day he said that when he sometimes when he works with young people, he gives them one book and he asked them to read it for like three months or something. Really, really well. That's enough. And if we understand book production and marketing itself to be such a corrupt process, which it is, then how can we expect the books to deliver on goodness all the time? I think that a moral, no, an ethical engagement with life means that you have to keep sifting. That's your labor. There's no fixed place you can moor yourself to because the world is so dynamic. You are dynamic. The world, you are part of the world. So it's nice to think that literature will deliver us. It's nice to think that listening to good music will deliver us. It can teach us many, many things. But as far as I can see, most people seem to be satisfied with getting a little bit new, but mostly what"

I was struck by your phrase earlier, by the way, which you used to describe your father, but it's also useful in a metaphorical way where you said he was an in America, he was an engineer by day, a butcher by night. And I wonder if that applies to other things. Tell me now, you know, sort of going back to your life story. And I also agree with you that, you know, looking at it in a linear way is sometimes a problem because there is just the present moment and all our memories are also in the now and all of that. Tell me about how your sort of sense of self began to form in the sense that like I just look back on my own life and many of my guests have also shared this that I look back on my own life and my sense of self was very flawed. I am a completely different person from what I was at 25, completely different. And it just changed, right? And over time, you kind of reflect and maybe you're lucky enough to have the opportunity to be able to take a step back and reflect on that stuff and change. How did your sense of self evolve? You know, a lot of this is impressionistic stuff that you are doing a lot of noticing, you notice the flicking of the pickle, you notice, you know, the doll being thrown away into the attic where it still lies, as you pointed out, and such an interesting image of dolls still lying in an attic, still pale after all these years."

        "message": "Now, I want to say something to you. I know me and I know many people who have a pretty solid sense of self from the time they're born. I figured that. Yes. And I think the whole task of life is getting people out of the way. And that's how I've lived my life. I put people in my way, for example, I worried about my mother incessantly. I worried about people in my life incessantly, worried about their well-being. And I thought myself as to be the person that worries for other people and takes care of them. So I could watch a movie and there would be Ma, and I would say, oh, I'm also like that Ma, because I know that feeling inside of me. But that's not all that I am. I'm much more. So, you know, the person that wants to walk on the National Highway at age three and doesn't feel any fear, the person, all these things are there. The person that loves to read is very comfortable being in a room full of people and very comfortable being solitary. This is all the self, no? So then there are people and situations that are going to come and tell along, like, you're a woman, you shouldn't do this. Why? So when I was 25, 27, 25, at various stages in my life, I did something that I'm not supposed to do because not to rebel. I don't think I was rebellious. Just to say, oh, this feels correct. I need to acknowledge this. So, you know, in my family, they're overly protective of girls in the wrong way. And then, of course, also sexually abusing of girls. They're always those relatives, too, in a large family. When I was 27, I bought an Indrail Pass. This is in 1993. And I traveled all across India in a train by myself wearing a sari. Because the other thing that people would say is that, how can you wear a sari and do things? I said, well, women are having babies, working in the fields. There's this beautiful photograph of the Sri Lankan architect Manetta Silva climbing up a ladder to inspect a construction site in a sari. I said, nope, I'm going to wear a sari and I'm going to travel. Of course, I wore some shalwar kameez as well. When I wore a sari at a suitcase, I would bathe with the Bisleri bottle or whatever it was, that yes, or some bottle in the bathrooms in the train. I'd fill it up and I would take a bath every six, seven places. I would spend the night at a good place, get laundry done. I would sleep at train stations. This is 1993, just two years after liberalization of the economy. I understood that maybe my family was much more space, was much more dangerous for me than India was, the rest of India was. That's what I understood as a woman. People were, except for one tiny incident in my life in those years of traveling to Patna and facing something there from men on Diwali night. A very nice Muslim family group of women just kind of surrounded me and they were wearing burqas. So they surrounded me and kind of just kept those men away. I never faced any issues. I'm not saying people don't face issues. I'm just saying that things, you have to keep working to get to yourself. Again, it's work. You have to do the work. I think I was given something at birth, whatever you want to call it, genes, karma, all these things. And then I have a responsibility and I felt it very sincerely because there was joy in it. Like I'm listening to the Beatles and I said, this feels good to hear. Why? Let me hear it some more because it's making me feel good. These are just simple things, but they're actually really profound things. Like why do so many people, including me at moments, gravitate to things which are bad, which make us feel so bad? I'm not talking about the hard work of like, let's say lifting a suitcase up the staircase or something like that. I'm talking about things that really make you feel bad. Like, you know, you hate sucking up to people at a party. Why are you sucking up to people then? Why are you doing it? Because you, what is it that's supposed to, this is something we have to work at. It is our task. It is"

        "message": "see yourself doing for the rest of your life? I was good at school. And I wasn't a science child or a literature child or a social studies child or whatever. I just was good at school and loved to read. And I love to read all kinds of things. Gravitated towards things which were about people, like novels or biographies for my personal reading. I think somewhere in there, as I mentioned earlier, I read some sort of book about Margaret Mead. I might have seen Coming of Age in Samoa. And there was a radio show for the South Asian community in America. And I was called as a group of young people. And they asked me, what did you want to be? And I think I said fairly clearly. I'm pretty sure I said fairly clearly I wanted to be an anthropologist. So by the time I had, I'm not that far from that now. I'm an art historian. I work on architecture. I work on craft. I work on teaching, pedagogy. These are the areas of research interest. So by the time I was 12, I have a scholarly orientation. I know that. Now I'm very comfortable calling myself that. I always had this like deeply sit down and delve into something mentality. That's the noticing comes from that. Sitting down and do the work comes from that, that idea. I know there are many good people who don't think like this and I love to listen to their ways of doing things. But this is me. I sit down and I do this or I could stand up and do it. It doesn't have to be sitting down. And there was a moment in my life where my parents wanted to get me married when I was like 16 or 15, arranged marriage. And they tried all kinds of shenanigans and it didn't work. And this, I went to high school in India. I did my 10th, 11th and 12th here. PUC as they called it then. And in Hyderabad and Vishakhapatnam. And then I went back to the US and my parents really wanted me to study business administration or something like that then. It was so boring, man. It was so boring. And I went to this large commuter university in Los Angeles and I went to art school partly because I think it was nearby and partly because I liked it. And I was always a little maker. My mother taught me how to sew falls and make samosas and kajas and these things and those things. From a generation of women in India, you learn to make stuff. So I went there and I liked it. So I started studying design. And I like design because it is something, you want something and you have to sit down and work for it. You have to think about how to make it work. But you have to remember this was the era, or you may or may not remember, but I think something similar was happening here too. Just a little bit later where certain things like, you know, that sun that came over Birla Sun Life or Bank of Baroda. These are motifs about an economy rising. So when I went to undergraduate, Reagan had just been elected and there was this idea of an economy in motion. So the swoop was very important. So every goddamn thing from Vons to supermarket to this thing or that thing had the swoop. And I think there was the moment where I thought, this is stupid. I mean, I can say those kinds of things, like this is really inane and stupid. And I think we had some tasks to design a magazine cover. I like that. I was the last batch of students that was not mandatorily learning computer-aided design. I still hand cut all my letters and pasted them and used benzene to clean up the thing and the chemicals really got to me. And the temporality of retail design is horrible. You have to be awake whatever time to meet the deadlines. Part of the education there was you had to take art history classes as part of your art degree. And my first art history class, I was working three jobs and going to school full-time. My art history class was at two in the afternoon after lunch. I would fall asleep and I failed. I didn't even fail, I got a D. But I took more art history classes. And the next one, the next one, I just loved it. I loved literature classes too, which was also there. I liked the philosophy classes. I love philosophy. I mean, I read philosophy for fun in those years. And even now, I love it. I love that somebody says, let's contemplate this thing called friendship. And they spend 350 pages contemplating friendship. I love the idea that somebody says, let's contemplate, what does it mean to print money? Money is a very philosophical thing. So let's sit down and really reflect on this. I loved all this. And what I loved about art history was it still was connected to the idea of anthropology about people, like viscerally connected to people. People make things. But what I liked about it was that unlike literature, it doesn't privilege an already privileged object, which is the printed text. So I was aware that people who could read and write had more status in society and things which were about reading and writing had more status. And I really wanted to spend time listening to the things that objects said about people and about themselves. And gradually, I came to understand that objects don't even say things about people. They say things about material. And objects might say things about, might be designed to speak for themselves too. And we can talk about that. And I was fascinated by that. So the turning moment was I had a Japanese art history professor. It was a wonderful place because Los Angeles has many museums and museum curators who are not in the topmost positions often teach as adjunct faculty. So I had pre-Columbian. I had Korean. I had Chinese. I had Japanese. I had, not Korean was part of this, Chinese and Japanese. I had the history of modern design. I had Greek. I had Roman. I had modern art history. I had so much art history that when I went to grad school, I realized that students who went to much more elite schools didn't have this range. So the turning point for me was when I had a Japanese art history teacher and Japanese people believe objects speak. They have this idea of mono no aware, which is that there's a beauty of things. You have this sense that things are impermanent and passing. And Japanese people have a sense of, and this is the irony that they became such a great industrial giant later, but until modernity, they made objects in multiples, like for example, massive numbers of teacups or whatever. But there was a sense that these objects had to respond to the touch. They had to have a conversation. They had to respond to the eye. And he allowed us, Joseph Newland, allowed us access to that world. He didn't drum it into us, but he showed us objects in such a disciplined way. He taught us in such a disciplined way to come to this. So he told us the story. I don't know if you're aware of this. The Six Persimmons is a very famous painting. It's a very, very famous painting. And he told us the story about this painting. And then he told me about his teacher who was a Zen teacher and who had a Zen master as his teacher. So apparently he wanted to see this very beautiful scroll or painting that was in this monastery. And the teacher kept refusing to show it or kept putting it off, not refusing, putting it off. And then one day, I think he went to the toilet and when he pulled out the toilet paper, there was the painting on the roll. And I don't know in America of the 1980s anything else that could have given me access to the weirdness of human existence, the weirdness and interesting. This is other people that have had other experiences. This was my experience of how to understand that there's just so many interesting ways of being in this world, living in this world and teaching and all these kinds of things. And then I had another teacher for modern art and she was very interesting because I was not a very good writer. I mean, she said, I'm going to give you a D if you want to keep your paper this way. But if you want to improve your writing, I will work with you till you get the grade you're satisfied with. So I decided I would be satisfied with an A. So she worked with me and that was like a quantum moment for me, transformation movement, to be really, really understand that if I spent my time really delving into something and laboring, I would be able to do the things I like doing, which is thinking and writing and making something. So that's it. So then for me, art history continued to be very beautiful experience. And then I did well in my studies in my undergraduate in spite of the Ds, they eventually put me, there were just moments like it was like a, I don't know, whatever, building's Roman or whatever, you know, you pass these things. And then I decided I wanted to go to grad school at Columbia and I was accepted. I thought about going to baking school, Pillsbury baking school, because I love to cook. And then I thought about studying folklore because that's also close to anthropology. So Indiana University at Bloomington was very important school of folklore. I thought about studying Japanese art history, but I did not want to, and I'd neither had the funds nor had the ability to study Kanji for five years in order to master that. I thought about studying African art, which I loved, loved, loved, loved. But I think I was still enamored with the idea of having recorded voices, recorded documents about objects. And I didn't have a very good deeper sense that records come in different forms and you can listen to objects in different ways. So then South Asian art became the thing that I did, even though I never studied it in my undergraduate. I fell in love with my teacher. The first time I went to see her at Columbia before I started teaching, being a student there, and she was one of the few South Asian women in the field. And she was outlined, there were this narrow room, her office, and both sides were covered with books. She was sitting near the window. It was July 29th or something like that in 1989. And I saw her and I said, it was love at first sight. And I said, okay, I'm going to come and study here. And never did I imagine myself becoming a professor, an academic. I'm very clear that being a scholar and being an academic are different things. It's very important for me. Being a scholar, being an intellectual, being an academic, they're different, different things. And they can all merge in one person. They don't have to. I had choices. So my PhD from there became a beginning point to a life, I think, which is so rewarding of work and thinking and doing. Yeah, that's what I do. And I'm very grateful to my teachers who never said that your destiny is to be this or that. I'm grooming you for this or that. My teacher Vidya Deheja was so generous about letting me go. In between, I thought about becoming a doctor because I love medicine. And I started doing some pre-med courses at Columbia. It was just too much. I couldn't take the load of PhD core classes as well as pre-med classes. But yeah, so it's things like that."

And if I am who I am, it is for many reasons for my teachers. They're very close. So I love teaching. So teaching is also not necessarily collapsible to being an academic. I think that academia is a model that developed at a certain moment in time, certainly in post-independence India. And as a model, it is changing rapidly. And there's a struggle over what its future is going to be, whether it's in India or in the U.S., it's happening. And that's a good struggle. Academia is the first place many people grate their teeth against politics, how to be political in this world, how to be adult and how to be political. All these are very important. But whether that actually, the structure of academia, whether it's in America where there's constant pressure to produce research or writing or texts or something, the constant pressure to be original, innovative, the new, or in India to be critical all the time. All of these have now been completely absorbed into the educational industrial complex. Let's be really clear about this. So in the educational industrial complex, where is the time to reflect? And what is a scholar if not someone who labors and reflects? Labors in the archive, labors with what they arrive at, discover, labors with the battling interpretations in their own head, labors with acknowledging their debts to the past, their breaks with the past, crafting ways of doing things which reflect this experience of engagement, which are imaginative. If you read people like David Shulman or Velcher Narendra or this wonderful new scholar, new for me, Arik Moran, who has been working on Himachal and the queens of Himachal, the Pahari queens during the British era. These things take time. They take time and they take time not because you spent hours looking at the computer screen, but they take time to... Sometimes I read, read, read, research, research, research, visit temples, temples, temples, and suddenly this essay of 5,000 words comes out over two, three weeks very cogently and lucidly. Now, are you saying that it only took me two or three weeks to write something or did it actually take years of preparing and doing and preparing and doing? Where is that time? And then if you're funded in a certain way, as far as I know, many of the people who are at a certain stage in their career, they are constantly battling for grants. They're constantly applying for job talks or conference papers or this. And some of it's very productive and very generative, but a lot of it is just getting in the way of being scholarly. And why is being scholarly important? That's the next question we have to ask. Because being a scholar respects learning, the process of learning. It really respects the process of learning. Now, how you represent that process is very much in your hands to some extent. Is it a book? Is it a podcast? Is it the way you teach? Is it the way you treat buildings in a policy discussion? And being a scholar means that you're willing to go back to beginner's mind on a regular basis. And to me, that's very different from the intense pressure to have certitude that academia puts on people. I am not interested in so much in certitudes because the fun is over. And then teaching is very different. Teaching is a real commitment. Like I have students who have been my students for 20 years. I spend a lot of time with students and the fruit of that labor of teaching for them and for you happens over a long time. And there's nothing as rewarding in work as watching a book you've written make someone really happy or deep. Deep is more better than happy. Or a student feel like they've arrived at something very profound for themselves. It's really important. Yeah, I think that's the distinction. The distinction between industrialized academic work is the production of certitude and scholarly work is the claiming of a beginner's mind as a wonderful existential space."

There might also be incentives that force them to conform to a certain way of thinking that might be fashionable within academia. Whereas if you're a scholar, those incentives don't exist.

So for example, I read a lot of things that come out of university presses. Thank you, university presses. Right? I also think that university presses will not be the only place I publish. So I don't publish only in university presses. I write in different avenues because I want different kinds of audiences. Even my engagement with the JCB prize was for me to come out of one space and enter another space. Right? All these things are really, really important. Yeah. I think being a scholar is a deeply romantic space that you must allow yourself to have. It's deeply romantic. The romance of reading something late into the night or getting up very early and writing, of being very thrilled to connect to. So I work on medieval material, or I work on like that essay I sent to you, one of the founders of the Indian studio pottery movement. These are people that existed before my time. But if I give myself the time and the space and I'm observing myself, I'm observing what I'm reading, I'm observing the things they've made.

One of the things I've learned most over the last year and a half is sharing my insights on my two greatest passions, writing and podcasting. And I'd love to invite you to be a part of this journey. Registration is now open for the January cohort of the art of clear writing, where over four webinars on four Saturdays, I teach all I know about the art and craft of writing compelling prose, much interaction, many exercises. And at the end of it, you get to join the clear writing community and online community formed by the 18 previous cohorts of this course. In that community, we have book clubs, workshops, writing prompts with feedback and much else. I am also doing a special cohort of my podcasting course, the art of podcasting, which I had conducted for three cohorts last year before I took a break. All my learnings from five years of the seen and the unseen in three webinars over three Sundays. For more details and to sign up for my writing course, head on over to indiancut.com slash clear writing. To sign up for my podcasting course, go to seen unseen.in slash learn. These links will also be at the bottom of the show notes. These are exciting times for the creator economy, and I'd love to help you be a part of it. Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Anna Poona Garimella about whom, you know, I was telling one of our fellow fellow jurors the other day that if you speak for more than 30 seconds, I feel like I learned something new, which is a combination of how insightful you are. And also your world is so different from mine. So I just feel like I'm learning so much, even even during this conversation. And what have you learned? You've given me a lot to reflect on. So I don't want to put my finger on things that I have necessarily learned. But this is a conversation I will revisit. I know it. And I'm sure many of my listeners will feel the same way. And for a moment, I'll move from the subject of you speaking to object speaking, which is you know, that point you brought up earlier, which is so fascinating to me, because we take everything around us in a sense, for granted. In fact, I, you know, I was I was feeling very jealous earlier, when you were talking about your innate tendency to notice things deeply. And if there's one thing that I consciously try to make myself do more, it's notice because I don't notice, I can go through an entire meal and somebody will ask me what did that taste like? And to my shame, very often I won't know. Because it's just you're just going through the motions. And one wonders if, you know, just the world around us, like I remember when I travel, I had once traveled through Pakistan in 2006, when I was covering the cricket tour there. And I was just looking at everything with such intense eyes, like walking through Lahore, or when we went to Peshawar, and we went to bid on the Khyber Pass. And everything I saw just had so much meaning and value for me, or I was putting meaning into it, because I was desperate to find things interesting and find things beautiful. And then I come back to Delhi and I'm and I realized that it's everything is invisible. It's a scene in the unseen. And I guess to some extent, I think that is what you were alluding to earlier. In the context of object speaking, I'd really like you to elaborate on that so they can speak to me as well."

But I think that to be noticing, to have noticing as a form of the ethos of life, you have to be intentional. So you told me when you went to Pakistan, you were very intentional in your looking. You didn't take anything for granted. So you saw everything. I think that intention to be present and to look, to notice, notice isn't just passive looking. Noticing, if you ask me, it isn't necessarily detached either. Like there's this notion of a writer being detached and observing life and then recording it. No. Noticing is intentional. It is aware. And it is aware of both thing you're noticing and yourself as you're noticing. So there is a kind of flowing dialogue between this. And then, of course, there can be many things that are happening in that situation and you will be connected. What that does, if you ask me, is begin to populate your world in a very different way. It isn't linear then. And that's how objects start speaking to you. Because you start understanding, noticing things. So my Japanese art history professor introduced me to Ogata Kenzan, who is one of the great ceramists of early modern Japan. Late. So he made many things, but he made this very beautiful teacup, which is considered a national treasure. And one day I will go to Japan and maybe I'll get to see it. But it's just one cup and it has all the kind of... it touches all the criteria that the Japanese people feel is a great coalescence of beauty. Great coalescence that allows for beauty to be there. So there is a teacup. So this teacup is no handles. It can fit in the palm of your hand. It is for a tea ceremony. There would have been, as you're studying this, you would learn that there would be a tea house. You would learn that by this point, an aesthetic of very noble, elite people exploring humble things had developed in Japan. So this world of the great, luxurious world of samurais and the shogunate worlds and all this thing would also have this other component not... it's not anti to that world, but it's another component. So you would court humble experiences like sitting on the floor and a bunch of people gathering, but also friendship. You might learn with your Zen master a tea ceremony, all these sort of things. So here's this teacup that Ogata Kenzan made. No, I'm not a scholar of Ogata Kenzan. I am very knowledgeable about my... what I took away from being confronted by Ogata Kenzan's teacup, which is that that lesson has traveled with me. I was 23 when I first encountered him and his teacup. And I traveled... that traveled with me and it reconciles and it brings into confrontation all the things which are considered polarities. Luxury and humility, worldliness, and somebody who retracts themselves from the world. So all of this is there in this one teacup. And also the teacup itself, it's the world that produces teacup, all of this is there. And that teacup itself is designed in such a way that the way that the glaze has emerged is so accidentally beautiful that it fits into this quality that Japanese... the qualities that Japanese aesthetics loves, mono no ware, the idea of accidental beauty and the idea of things which are broken, which can be repaired very beautifully, like with gold, like when a teacup breaks, you can repair it with a technique called kintsugi, where you use gold to emphasize the crack, not hide it, but to emphasize the crack. And of course, I'm not the first person to talk about this. There are people who have fallen in love with Japanese ideas and objects because they're confronted with these ideas. But for a 23-year-old to confront this was really important. So this object, I wrote about it, my semester paper was on this object. And then I kept myself, I've always been very close to this idea of thinking, because you see art history as a field is deeply complex and contradictory. You're working with objects often made by people who are not a very economically well-off standing, they're often deeply vulnerable to power, beheaded, they could be beheaded, they could be exiled, they could be kidnapped and brought, like some of the most beautiful carpets that we know are made by populations of weavers who were essentially kidnapped and brought to a new city because the ruler of that city said, I want this technology, this talent, this art to be in my city for a new economic product, or because it's prestigious or whatever. At the same time, art history is full of institutions and people who come from unbelievably elite backgrounds. So now in the last, the struggle has been ever since the civil rights movement and to some extent the post-colonial movement and nationalist movement to question this. So Rabindranath Tagore did it in his own way. Other people did it in their own way. But at my point, the way I get it is through the civil rights movement and the feminist movement and the post-colonial movement. But I never really put everything together in a neat ideological package, in a shelf on which to put this teacup. So what I get out of this is, I have a small organization that I founded and I run with my colleague Sindhuja, and we get asked to curate an exhibition for a museum, which no longer exists in some sense. And we decided, let's do a history of a material. So this is unusual in and of itself. A history of clay in India after 1947. So how are you going to tell this story? Clay is a ubiquitous material. Indus Valley is built on clay, right? Indus Valley, Harappan civilization, whatever you want to call it, it's built on clay. But clay is completely transformed in value and meaning and purpose at the temperatures that you fire it, what you use to fire it, how you choose to work with its ephemerality and how you choose to work with its capacity to be permanent, right? We all know this in some sort of tacit way when we immerse our Ganeshas, when we break the kulad, when we decide to buy better quality brick, all these things. But if you decide to sit and meditate on this quality of clay and write a history of how the qualities of clay are inborn or given to it or over time, then it's very fascinating to me. So it was my colleague who curated this show primarily, but there were things that I also worked on because we curated it together. But the book that she wrote that came out of the exhibition is hers. So we decided to organize it into some sections. And one of the sections was about studio pottery. And in studio pottery, there was a table for the people that would be considered the founders of Indian studio pottery. Among them were people like Devi Prasad Gandhi and Nirmala Patwardhan from Pune, Ira Chaudhary here from Delhi, and Gurusharan Singhji, who is the late Gurusharan. All these people are dead except for Ira Chaudhary. So Gurusharan Singhji was here in Delhi for a long time. In fact, there's a Delhi Blue Apartments, it's still there next to Ames. So he was a man who came from Jammu to Delhi and started working in Delhi. He studied geology and his father's friend ran a brick factory here and he said, I'm making tons of bricks. Why was he making tons of bricks? Because New Delhi was being built. Delhi that's being broken down and torn apart in some sense was being made by a group of contractors, including Krishnan Singh's grandfather and several other people. And this man, Ram Singh Kavli, was a subcontractor to these Indian, five major Indian contractors who were producing the buildings that Baker and Lutyens had designed, among other people. So he's here, a 19-year-old man, walking around, working in the brick factory. They're also observing, and he's also observing the city and he sees this blue everywhere in the monuments because the British, as they redesigned Delhi, are keeping things which have a slight masala to them. One of the things that's luscious and delicious is this blue color that you see in the tombs in Lodhi Gardens and stuff like that. So he's enamored with it and he also falls in love with this Kavli's daughter and he asks for her hand in marriage. And he says, well, you can marry her, but you have to go to Japan because Japan was the big center for ceramic production then, one of the big centers. Germany was another one. Go and learn how to do commercial ceramic production. So he went to Japan and the principal there said, you have to learn Japanese. So he started learning Japanese and he fell, while learning at this institute, while learning commercial production, he fell in with the group of people who were at the foundational moment of Minge, which is the Japanese arts and crafts movement, which was responding to Japanese own history of industrialization. So the arts and crafts movement in England was responding to the rampant industrialization of England and the degradation of English craft. So people like William Morris were protesting against it. And also, of course, the entry of products made in India, raw material that was taken from India, sent to England, made there and then sent back to India. What was this doing to Indian English production, whatever? So an arts and crafts movement started where you would labor and make beautiful objects and really make crafts. Of course, the irony of it is that you can never go back. So these products were exorbitantly expensive because that's the nature of industrialization. That's one of the characteristics of industrialization that it uses craft to make craft almost impossible for ordinary people to own. So similarly, Japan had gone through industrialization. So this Minge movement has started and this Minge movement had people who were Japanese, like Shoji Hamada, and ideologues and an Englishman who had been living in and a very famous person for his own leadership in the global studio pottery movement, Bernard Leach, and Guru Sharan Singh happened to fall into that group. And this group really praised the handmade, the local. They wanted to de-emphasize authorship. They wanted to think of the artisan craftsman, the artist craftsman, all these very romantic, very complex and internally contradictory ideas. And Guru Sharan Singh is absorbing all of this and he's very, very intelligent man, deeply intelligent man, even at that age. He comes back to India and he starts work. He marries Chattarkar, Ram Singh Kabli's daughter. He works in the factory. The factory was situated where Willingdon Airport is there and now it's Saptarjung Airport. And all these kilns were there and he would have been seeing lots of things. And then of course, this whole world changes when New Delhi is constructed and India gains its independence. The big factories close and Guru Sharan Singh, before independence had already left and was working in various places, Kota, Ambala, setting up ceramic institutes, working as a geologist in Bundi, actually, for the King of Bundi, in Bundi State, different, different places. And then he comes back in 1946 to Delhi or slightly later. He comes back to Delhi and then he starts Delhi Blue Pottery. He's retired from government service and he starts Delhi Blue Pottery. Now this is a studio pottery place. And here's where objects have been speaking to him all the time, the blue tiles in the monuments, the bricks he's making. We don't know what they were saying to him till this moment. He is listening to, he invites Sharada Ukil, who was a Shantiniketan actor and who came an artist and also theater person. He came and he designs the tiles for his new house in Delhi. So when he starts Delhi Blue Pottery in the new way, after independence, he's confronted that India made this rule that you couldn't import ceramics anymore, that in fact, domestic ceramics had to take the place because we didn't have any foreign exchange. So only crafts, the crafts we sold gave us foreign exchange. And not very different from the British, by the way. So he starts designing products and he's very smart. So what does Delhi have that needs a lot of products? Already when the railroads had come and Delhi became major terminus, scholars have, various scholars have pointed out the culture of having a hotel started, the culture of having China in for dining had started. Gradually as Delhi's elites, the lalas and the rich elite of Delhi were transformed, they started having tiles, tiled images of gods and tiles and ceramic plates. All these things started coming into their household. So that culture had already started. But after independence, the big thing was there were all these embassies that were being built and all these people who had dinner parties here and they needed dinnerware because you didn't serve dinner to people in talis, you served it in crockery. So he started making things that people like to buy and vases and things, but they were on his terms. And he worked deeply with a potter named Abdullah who had the secret, the formula for Delhi blue. So it became a signature style for him. So then for that show that I was curating, we saw a tea set he had made. He made it for a Chinese restaurant in Kannat Place, lots of things. So this Chinese set is made in a clay body called stoneware, which is not a native clay body. It's a clay body that comes from Japan. So he had introduced it because he had this training. So he bought it from Japan. Now it's a high temperature fired clay, so it's not porous. So it's unlike a kulad which starts absorbing the chai. This does not absorb the chai. It sits, you glaze it and then it's sealed in some sense. So he decides, remember how old is tea? Tea itself is not more than 60, 70 years old as a beverage to drink in India. As a widespread drinking thing, it's in the 1920s I think that CTC becomes a technology that allows for the finer, whatever cheaper kind of tea to be made. So tea is growing everywhere. So the kulad itself is a new invention. So there's been a culture of tea sets in India. Indian people are making tea sets in silver. They're making them also in bone china, a problem because it has bone in it and we're a vegetarian country by and large. So in South India, stainless steel tea sets start emerging as a response to this. So all these objects are telling you about the society, what the concerns of the society are. And the kind of tea sets that are emerging here are the version of the tea set. Remember tea came from China to Europe to England and then of course from India. They all emerge from the British idea of drinking tea or the European in which you have a cup which holds the beverage and you have a handle and it's an aristocratic drink in its origins. You hold it and you have a silhouette that your hand makes with this teacup. So all of this is possible because of the size of the ring on the teacup. If you have a beer mug or a tankard, it has big rings so that your knuckles fully enter it and fold over it. So that tells you the nature of the hand that is carrying that mug to the mouth. The way that the silhouette is, like your muscle would bulge when you hold that tankard full of beer. When you hold a teacup, you don't need to have any muscle barely exertion, bare exertion. The Japanese way of thinking about tea is very different. You hold it in your hand. It is something precious. It warms your hands in a very cold climate. So the contact between the hand and the hot beverage and the cup is less mediated by the handle. You have it entirely in your hand. Gurshanji has seen both the Kular, he would have seen the English teacup and he would have seen the Japanese teacup. So when he decides to make teacups and he's been part of Minge, which emphasizes the local, he's also been part of the Swadeshi world because the Swadeshi movement was big the years he came to Delhi. So local is a big thing. So what does he do? In Ambala, he designs a tea set. The teapot is designed based on a Kamandalu. A Kamandalu is a water carrying pot that ascetics, mendicants use to carry holy water. So it privileges the liquid inside that vessel. Kamandalu is, in some way, elevates the liquid inside the vessel. The liquid itself might be sacred like the Ganga or the Narmada or, and because it's in this beautiful pot shaped like a cow, shaped like something made out of precious materials, is further elevated. And the person who's carrying it, it has a handle on it. You would put it on your forearm. You will see hundreds of rishis and mendicants carrying these around. And he takes that as the inspiration for his teapot. So local is covered. It's made in India, Swadeshi. Then he has to decide, but it's made not out of bone china, not out of terracruda, which is unfired clay. It is not low fired clay like okul, but it is stoneware. So from Japan. Now he cannot import all the materials to make Japanese stoneware. So if you do an analysis of that teacup, that tea set, you will understand that he digested all of this knowledge and experience, found local clay bodies, local minerals, synthesized all of this to produce a local clay body that had Japan in it, that had England in it, and that had the Indic world in it. And then this clay body, he has to decide the shape of the teacup. So I remember my Ogata Kenzan again very deeply. And I see that his teacup has a handle, but the shape of the teacup is somewhere between the English teacup, the Kuladish kind of shape, because to produce vast quantities, he'll have people helping him to throw this, and the Japanese teacup. So somehow he's mediated all these anxieties. We're a new Indian nation. We have dinner parties, and we're English in the way we present ourselves. He's producing something that doesn't look English. It has no floral designs. It's not white bone china. It doesn't have any meat in it, any bone in it, nothing. He's done all these things. And when you hold that teacup, all you have to do is listen to what it's telling you. And then you can start doing this research, or you can do all this research and come to the teacup and say, how do you hold the whole story, all the stories of the clay, and Gursharanji, and the histories of tea in yourself as you're in my hand? And that's how objects speak. And when you see that tea, that warm tea in that cup with milk in it, because Japanese don't drink it with milk, and the English don't necessarily drink it with milk, but the way the tea was marketed in India by Lipton, door to door they went and told people, because people drank milk in northern India, they told them how to mix it with sugar and milk to make it more marketable. So here we are, people drinking milky tea, which has a particular color in this cup that could be anywhere from a mossy green to brown to a deep deli blue. And it looks really nothing like Japanese, nothing like English, nothing like a kulad. It is its own thing. And we, as I, as an art historian, as a person engaging with this deeply, have to be able to listen to those things, what it's telling me, and respond to it and articulate it."

        "message": "I can look at my coffee cup. No, no, it's so kind of fascinating. Now, okay, I'm going to ask you a sort of provocative general question that can also dive back to this. You know, I just remembered this joke that I heard in school, which is, you know, in the 1980s, or maybe early 90s, when I was just in college. And it's a joke about MF Hussain. And the joke is that this rich industrialist goes to Hussain and tells him that I want to, you know, commission a painting from you, will you paint something for me? And Hussain isn't feeling particularly creative at that moment, but he says, okay. And after the guy is gone, he just spreads out a lot of red paint on the floor. He takes off his clothes, gets naked, sits down on it, then he goes and sits on a canvas. He calls it Apple that sells for a crore. Okay, that's a joke, right? And my question here is this, that when I think of art, and by art, I mean, you know, paintings, fine art, that kind of stuff with any other art form, like literature and music and cinema, I just feel that beyond the point, what I think of them is not mediated by elites, what artists like what what seems to happen with fine art is that you become a painter, but then whether you're considered a great artist or not a great artist, doesn't depend so much on what, you know, reaction you might necessarily have on the general public out there, the aam aadmi like me, but on a group of narrow elites, who might be driven by a certain kind of ideology or politics, who will then pass judgment on the art, and someone becomes a great artist, and someone becomes just a craftsman and is forgotten by time. And it's a very small group of people kind of deciding this is not a larger process. And you know, if you don't fit the flavor of the moment, you could just be lost. Like I have actually spoken to artists who've pointed out to what critics have written about them in praise, and said, Ki mujhe kuch samajh bhi nahi aaya wo kya bol raha hai. Because these are just artists who are just doing work they love for whatever reasons they love doing. And then, you know, you'll have critics and the gatekeepers apply their own kind of lenses to it. And in that sense, I think that world of fine art seems to me to be very different from all these other artistic worlds, where someone in a far corner somewhere can write a book, and me random person can read it, and, you know, react to it, and it's not dependent on someone else's judgment. I mean, this sounds really negative, I'm not being entirely critical, you know, like, even when it comes to poetry, for example, you know, before I really got into poetry, I would think that some poetry is like this, that I just don't get it, what the hell is going on. And I remember reading Mary Oliver's great book, Poetry Handbook, and rereading the poem Red Wheelbarrow, she deepened my appreciation of it, to the extent that I tear up when I read that poem, that there's no reason for me to, it's not about any concrete thing, but it just has such a powerful impact on me. And I understand that a lot of art, which, you know, is not accessible, can be approached in that way. But, and this question struck me, because earlier, you spoke about how that art wasn't something just restricted to the privileged or whatever, and books were because of printing press, and, you know, not everybody could, you know, necessarily read and write. So what would be your response to this rambling question, which I did not intend to be offensive, but I am now worried that..."

        "message": "Let me add to it in another context, which is the context of music. I read this very interesting thread recently about Billy Joel and his first album, Piano Man, right? Now, what happened when that album came out, and the album was brought out by a record label, it came out, but the record label itself wasn't enthusiastic. Radio stations were simply not playing it. So they were going to give up on the album and not give Joel any more work. And he was basically finished at that point. Till one random enthusiast fell in love with it so much that he got in touch with the record label and said, why the hell aren't you promoting this? And they just weren't interested. So this guy, and I'll, you know, post that thread from my show notes, went around to different radio stations. And at one point with a big radio station, he did a quid pro quo deal of some sort with somebody so that they would play the record for a day. And they started playing Piano Man for a day. And then listeners started phoning in and saying, we want more of this. What is this? This is amazing. And then it blew up and Billy Joel's had the career that he's had. Now, the truth of the matter is that that this is art. This is not something that is appealing to crass popular sentiment. It is it is great art. And I mean, that's what I would say what Billy Joel's work and certainly Piano Man, and it would have been completely lost if it hadn't had a chance to get democratized in this way and to reach a larger audience in this way. Similarly, to continue with music, I think of Johann Sebastian Bach, who was not a big figure in his own lifetime. And after he died in the decades after he died, there was this kind of Bach Renaissance or whatever, I forget the exact term that people give to it, where he became elevated in our consciousness to become the legend he is. And you would imagine he was always a legend. No, in his lifetime, he was nothing. The elites of the day, who were the arbiters of taste, did not care for Bach. And it it took these centuries for him to come. And with all of those with books, with music, you can talk about what about the unseen talents who never quite managed to emerge, but at least in those fields, you had a better chance. In art, it seems to me that if you don't fit a particular conception of art that elites may have, you're not going to make it in the fine art world. And a lot of talented people might today say that that's irrelevant anyway, we'll do art in a different way. So yeah, so that's kind of my elaboration."

        "message": "Sheiltan Pethi That's a good one. So I can answer this in so many different ways. So I don't even know where to start, but let's try all of them. So first of all, I was never interested in the distinction between fine art and art. This distinction was produced and a certain moment in time, let's say in India, when the colonial art schools were set up, JJ, Calcutta, Madras, Lahore. So because you had to produce a population that was trained in a certain way to produce craft, or you had to produce a population that need to be saved in or by middle class and elite people in order to preserve inheritances and heritages. And then there were going to be a group of people who would be fine artists who would help it become more civilized or modern or whatever, depending on which language or which kind of things. So I wasn't interested in it except as a historical artifact. So if we set that aside, what do we have then? What we have is a field of production, a field of thought, a field of sensuous experiences, a field of aesthetic proclivities. If that's the case, then I'm interested in everything. And I've been this way from the time I, because I come from that generation, I think partly, but also because I'm listening to Hindi film music and I'm listening to T.K. Pattamal, but I'm also coming from a world which was where art making wasn't as thoroughly industrialized as it has become through certain kinds of technological forms over the last century, right? Those things were still available to us in India in the 1950s and 60s and 70s when we were born. When I was born in 1966, I was born in. So I think that something about your perspective is also the experience of living in a certain kind of world. Now, then there is this whole question of taste. So here you have Pierre Bourdieu, the French sociologist who talks about constructing social distinction and taste and all these sort of things. So knowing what is good art didn't constitute a form of social distinction in the world that I lived in. For most people in India, it's cast or much cruder forms of capital demonstration, much more obvious forms of capital, not cruder, but art can be pretty damn crude. Forms of distinction are there. So that's one set of answers. Another set of answers are, one set of statements."

        "message": "Yeah. So I'll come to the art world. So I come to the art world. I'm coming there, but we have to map this ground out first. So who goes to art school? So I told you that early on art schools were set up. There was a population of people who were hereditary craftspeople who were brought to teach. They were potters, let's say from Multan, who were brought to JJ to teach people how to make art pottery. They were people who were weavers, came from weavers families, and they learned weaving in their own households and their own communities, but had to go to school for weaving in order to produce the way the British wanted them to produce. So there is a set of systems that started developing in our country, in the world over in the modern world, which created certain groups as elite producers and certain people as less than elite producers. Simultaneously, it produced elite consumers, elite patrons, whatever. Patronage was of course, elite patronage is a much older phenomenon, but elite consumers. And then there are people who want to affiliate with certain kinds of eliteness because they would like to be an elite art critic or whatever, right? So there's a production and a proliferation of class classifications, distinctions. So words like kitsch have been thought about very deeply. Words like popular categories, like popular culture. I work with the category called vernacular art. All these things are deeply, deeply problematic and deeply important because they've shaped entire art worlds. So after independence, any, the who goes to art school, very often they're people who come from well-off families. They also might come up, it's a great melting pot also from other kinds of families, people who have some modicum of education, at least let's put the common denominator is there. It's primarily men also, because women have always have practiced some form of art or the other in India, either embroidery if they're middle-class women or cooking or painting of some kind like alpana or these are certain. So certain art forms like Tagore's great intervention was to say all of these forms could become part of the curriculum of Shantiniketan. And we could have an institution called Sriniketan that would also cultivate these forms. So art is being defined by that institution to be in a much broader way. It's when MS University, this is our art world. I'm going to talk about our art world because our meaning, the art world we have here in India. So when we have MS University Fine Arts Department set up, it is set up with a great nobility of intention. Hansa Mehta was a great woman and she was deeply involved in setting up the program. The early people who were behind it, like Markand Bhatt, who had come from the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia back, had spent a lot of time with great modern, the modernist collection there. So there was an idea of what would constitute not the Bombay progressives, not the Shantiniketan way of being progressive, not the colonial art school way of being. What would be this new language that would be taught here? So of course, there were all sorts of things that happened there. K. G. Subramaniam insisted on bringing lots of craft and Gulam Ahmed Sheikh, who also taught there later on, was very interested in promoting an engagement with Indian manuscript painting. But in the process, and there were people like Bhupen Kakkar who were not formally trained but were deeply interested in using the medium of painting to talk about unbelievably complex things like being a gay man in middle-class Baroda. And he wrote lovely short stories as well. And he wrote lovely short stories. And when I think of his painting, You Can't Please All, I just cry. I cry. It's this man looking out, his naked body on a balcony looking out into the square. And it's based on that parable of the donkey and people wanting to be in conformity so much that they want to please all. And he's standing there reflecting on all of this and realizing at that moment in life, it's a gray man. It's not a young body that's in that painting. You can't please all. And I saw this for the first time in person at the Tate when they had the exhibition there. And I really think that all these possibilities were there and they continue to be there. But we did not have an art market like this. We had ideology. Ideology and we had teaching lineages. We had cross affiliations. So if you went to Shantiniketan, you might come to teach at Baroda and then go back to teach at Shantiniketan. You might go and teach in Rajahmundry or in Vishakhapatnam or start a school in Hyderabad or wherever. But the art market really starts growing. So if we look at an institution like Kemold in Bombay, it created a place for people to sell paintings, but it didn't see itself as constructing an investor's market. There was no possibility. The TIFR, Homi Bhabha and the Tatas, they were the big patrons of art in Bombay and they made institutional collections which are now unbelievably valuable in terms of monetary ideas. But when the art market comes, and this is where we must go back to our dear Karl Marx, capital changes social relationships. So social relationships, what is an art world but a set of social relationships that are founded on capital. And here, it's very important to keep marking out distinction. And in this way, it's no different from books, it's no different from music. It's just that the realm, the geographic expanse of art making that comes out of formal art academic teaching. Do you know only 2% of students who graduate from art schools actually become professional artists in the sense of showing work in galleries? The rest of them become set designers, they might do puja pandas, they might become graphic designers, they might do animation, they might do so many other things. So this 2% is, but so the largest population of artists are not these artists. They're the artists who do temple sculptures and who do this and this and this and this. Remember, the largest population after farmers in India is weavers and textile workers. So if we look at the idea of culture work as one idea and art production in the gallery sense of it is just one facet of it. First it changes our framework. Now you're talking about people feeling like why am I left out of the game? And it is a game in some sense, an economic game. Because it's a market and so many people, and I'm not the person who can speak the most interestingly, but you'll get yourself an art gallerist who is willing to talk honestly. Their words are worth are like pure bouillon compared to mine, because they really know the inside information"

What I feel is that the way that the art world developed in India in the last, let's say, 20-30 years is not the way Camel started. It's not the way a Mary Boone in New York or Alfred Stiegler or any of these great supporters. What you have is a bunch of people who are kind of interested in something. So a lot of culture work in India is supported by industrial families through their women in their family. It's a gendered project culture. And this is not going to make anyone happy, but I must say this. I'm not the only one to say it, but I will say it. Till very recently, much of this fine art world that you're talking about was supported by black money. Now, this is black money coming from buyers. It's black money that artists are being paid, and it's black money that's being laundered through this business called art, sale and resale. So when you have this, it constructs very little space for intellection. So how do economics impact the space for intellection in art? So there's very little room for investing in something that's risky. A lot of it is based on nepotism. You scratch my back, I'll scratch your back. A lot of it is also the situation you're talking about is based on obfuscating this rather mundane world. What part of India is not based on black money? Let's be really clear about this. Obfuscating this through opaque discourse, which is unbelievably unreadable. It's hard to understand. Then art education itself does not prepare artists to intellect about their own work. And that's the saddest thing. When we think about early artists, they wrote their manifestos. A manifesto is a deep act of intellection. You are proposing something. It's a propositional thing, a proposal for an art world, for a kind of art community, for a kind of economics, for whatever it is, a language. Many artists were also pedagogues. So again, you have to think this through. They also wrote books about it. Paul Klee, KG Subramaniam, Rabindranath Tagore, all these people wrote books about what does it mean to teach, to make, to live, to think about art. So you have a group of people who are today not taught very well to intellect about their own work. So it very quickly moves to how do you represent yourself? Once you jump into that act of representing yourself, it's like you're already in a selfie place without self-knowledge. So then the people that have really deep self-knowledge are really spending the time thinking. Sometimes they are able to take up a lot of space because there's also a market for the thinking artist, the intellecting artist. Now, whether they're thinking something deeply original all the time, that's a different question, but they're thinking. And I'm not sure how much originality is possible sometimes either. I think there's work that is so interesting that it makes you think about thinking. There's work that's so interesting that makes you think about the idea of originality. But whether complete originality in some sense of having nothing, no connection, sui generis emerging, I think that's almost impossible."

You've been sort of decrying and lamenting what you called industrialization and commercialization and the market and all of those things. I would go the other way. And I would say that for artists, I would in fact celebrate that. And the reason I would celebrate that is that I don't think they lead as some people imply to homogenization of culture and the death of creativity or any of those things. I think what they instead do is that individuals get empowered in various ways through technology and otherwise, to actually be able to express themselves in unusual ways that otherwise would not have been open to them. In fact, I think, you know, a lot of people today with maybe a visual imagination or someone who wants to story tell through images may not need to go in for the fine arts. They can be filmmakers, they can do other things, which are not necessarily lower forms of art. I mean, God knows what kind of manner Bhupen Khakkar would have expressed himself in and he did it brilliantly in two mediums as we spoke about, but maybe he could have been a filmmaker, maybe he could have been a YouTube creator, for example, and I would not, you know, look down on any of those like just speaking of my own podcast, for example, I think commercialization, the markets, what they have done is they have put the technology in my hands to make exactly the kind of show I want, which conventional wisdom would tell you will not work long for our conversations with obscure scholars like me. And the conventional wisdom would not have allowed me to do this. I have been empowered by all these things you mentioned industrialization, commercialization, which I don't think are necessarily bad words. I think they are good for artists because more and more people have gotten the means of production in their own hands. They are not dependent on gatekeepers. They're not dependent on like you spoke about how the cultural project today is almost like a vanity project of the wives of industrialists. Most artists are not dependent on that. That is not even a project that I take seriously. You know, most artists can do what they want today. And they are empowered to do that by the fact that you know, the technology is there, the markets are there, I can produce a show which you know, 30 years ago, I would have been laughed out of any room of any radio station if I, you know, propose something like this. And I can reach my viewers. And you know, they can express their appreciation for it in monetary and non monetary ways. So that kind of would be my counterpoint that I, I feel that this invocation of industrialization, commercialization is a bad thing. And I understand that in many domains, it leads to homogenization, we are losing languages, we are losing different types of bananas, the freaking bland Cavendish banana is everywhere, because of these forces. So I get the negative aspect of it. But I don't think that it's a death knell of art. On the contrary, I think it is what has empowered so many individual artists to do their thing without needing to please gatekeepers or elites."

So when we add the word ization to industry, or commercial, we are talking about something else than mere industry. We're talking about a logic and ethos that pervades every aspect. So that's something we have to keep in mind. So it's one thing to set up a factory. So for example, a cottage industry is a scale. It's an ethos of making, but it's still an industry in the way that the Indian government thought about it till very recently. So you might be making thousands of dias, and it's mass production. And it might be a cottage industry. So then an industry that produces porcelain dias on molds in a factory is also making dias, but they're doing it in a different way. And then if you think that the way of making dias in a cottage industry is a problem, and the only way to make dias is the one that this is making, then we know that there's a problem there. That's what's happened. And then there's another thing that says, this is even too expensive. You have to pay workers their salaries and blah, blah, blah. Let's just get LED lights from China and string them all over, which is what's also happening. And this takes care of the whole dia business. There's no mess of oil. We don't have to pay workers. It's cheap. It's throwaway. So it's very important to think about what something does. So let's go back to rap music. Let's go back to music and let's talk about rap music. Rap music is a deeply crafted form of music that comes out of industrialized music production. So the idea of taking records and capturing snippets from previous records, adjusting, crafting them, recrafting them, retooling them, retooling the record player to become an instrument. All this is recrafting. It's a second order of craft. It's not a primary order of craft. So craft and industrialization are not opposed. There's a very great scholar whose name I've forgotten who talks about the fact that in the Soviet Union, when people had factories, these machines that they ran were industrially produced. But because the Soviet Union's economy was so bad, all repairs had to be done by the person that ran that particular machine. In the end, that machine was thoroughly handcrafted, all parts had to be remade, and only that person could run it because they had made it. So there isn't a linear journey here. So what you're saying about technology being put into the hands of many people, like for example rappers or you or even me, maybe I wouldn't be able to do the kind of work I like doing if certain things had not happened. But they also have really profound effects. And I'm interested in understanding the effects."

And yet at the same time, society could reflect upon the massive mistake of the Vietnam War. And I had a slight disagreement with that phrasing or I found it a little simplistic because I am wary of terms like society subsuming individuals. I think the individuals who took America into the Vietnam War are a very different set who may not necessarily have reflected. And the individuals who reflected are reflecting not on their own actions, but the actions of others. I'd rather think in terms of individuals. And I think that using group terms like society or in a later sense, industrialization, you know, can hide some of the nuances that lie"

There's a wonderful Vietnamese American writer who writes it about this beautifully. I forgot his name. His book got nominated for some major award. It was very narcissistic. You know, I was, let's say, let me put it this way. I was in 1971. I was five years old. I was in Bhopal and the bombs and we had to black out our windows in Bhopal because of the fear of bombing. And I never grew up in a world that was very lengthy. I'm, and I know now because I've seen much more of the archive that was virulently anti-Chinese or anti-Muslim. It wasn't, there wasn't that kind of virulent anti-Muslim rhetoric in my world about this war. I go to America and I see remorse or regret about Vietnam, not so much about Vietnamese people, but about a president who promoted the Vietnam War, Lyndon B. Johnson, and then less about Johnson, but particularly Nixon. Now we know the story is even more complex than I'm saying it now because he did Watergate and he was like this megalomaniac. It challenged America's ideas about its own democratic commitments. So the Vietnamese people were maybe a picture on Life Magazine, that young girl with her back burning from napalm running. Those kinds of things, but in general, and I think there's a lot of people, Vietnam veterans, they were vastly, how do you experience remorse?

So Golconda diamonds were so precious, they could become a God's eyes. Kings had the first dibs on the largest stone recovered. You didn't emphasize faceting, you emphasized weightage. So that's why most diamonds were often limitedly faceted when they were put in Mughal jewelry. When the idea of faceting comes very big and new ways of cutting diamonds becomes important, the speed of excavation increases. And of course the diamond mines are now more or less dry. And then the South African horde emerges and diamond mining happens there in a crazy way.

And the thing is that what we need to understand is that when the technology of the earth mover came, it allowed for a set of factors, the desacralization of the earth, the creation of large markets that were globally networked, the intense real estatization of land. All these things came together. The de-emphasis on investing in human beings and thinking more upon privileging extraction. All these things were possible, not at one instant, but through a cascade of things that come together. So I like that. Just like I talked about Gurshan Singh's teacup as being a cascade of things at that very moment. And then everything kind of just pulls back when you look at something else. So if I look at a podcast and I understand, say, recording technology and the impact it had for, let's say, the wives to record their voice and sing and have it recorded, I am Gauhar Jaan. Right? So it's so beautiful to think that when the Kerala Saint, Narayan Guru. So he wrote, for example, that, and this is also why I am not anti-industrializing. He says he's proselytizing to people who are deeply underprivileged. So the metaphor he has for the soul is that your soul will be, in his writing, he says that your soul will be like a steamship that goes up the river. Or when the rifle comes into Southern India, Kama no longer holds bows and arrows, he holds a rifle of love. The bullets of love are shot, right? Or pellets of love are shot. I think this is really important. They're just such key moments, but we cannot take the whole package for granted. We must break it down and remake it, break it down and remake it because that's how it works. But if the process of continuing something extends over long periods of time and people have very little agency in breaking it down, then it's a real, it starts becoming more often than not oppressive. So we're able to still love the family because it keeps breaking down. And then we put it back together in some new formation."

        "message": "So, you know, you spoke exactly to my concerns when you spoke about people not having agency, the oppression it leads to, power, and that's a long discussion and we will do another six hour conversation someday in this because this cannot be a last conversation. So, you know, I'm now feeling that just in the same way that my show went from being a half an hour show to a three hour show, it should now go to a six hour show or an eight hour show. So you and I can do justice to the many things we want to talk about, but you have a flight to catch. So all hail industrial flights. And I'll end with a couple of questions which really intrigued me, things that you said earlier, while we were talking, which I found super interesting, and I want to double click on them. And one of them, like I asked you, what are the things you feel deep love for? And what are the things you have deep knowledge of? And you named a bunch of things and I'll go through them. But I'll ask you about one thing each. Like when you spoke of deep love, you spoke about places, children, partner, family, grandfather, work, India, yoga, the way the body lives in the world, which is so fascinating, friendship. And I think through the conversation, people would have got a pretty good sense of, you know, what all these things mean to you. But what I was most intrigued by in this deep love section was when you said, quote, love is my ethic, stop quote, which fascinates me. Tell me a bit about what you meant by that."

        "message": "What a great question. I didn't expect that, actually. First of all, I want to say, because the time will go and the time is going and I hope we will talk more and I will get to talk to you as much as you have talked to me. So there are many ways to be in the world. You can be deeply ambitious and then goal setting and those kinds of things. You can be focused on, let's say, morality. There's some cord you can pick up and say, this is going to become the ethic of my life. I think that love is a profound ethics because it's not easily holdable. So it kind of, you can't control it. I mean, let's think about the time when Sufi ideas of love enter into popular culture in India sometime around Amir Khusrow's time. That's the 12th century. So he writes a song called Chaap Dilak, which is a song in praise of his beer, his ustad, a beloved. And that song is still being sung today. And it's the song that people use to talk about the radical nature of music or love or anything. It's so deeply, deeply powerful. So if I say that love is very, it's an ethic, it means that you do things, you find the love inside of you. You find a loving position in which, with which to do mundane things, to which to do hard things, which things which you don't like, things which have to be done, things to let things go. You must. It's a way of engaging with life because you can make life about many things. But if you choose to make a life, the ethics, the ethics of life, love, it changes many things. The woman who started the Me Too movement, Tarana Burke, she was sexually molested when she was young. Or maybe it was Tarana Burke and some other people involved in that movement. One of these people said that she met the boy who sexually molested her much later in life. And what she realized was, or maybe it was an older person, I forget, because there were several instances, it's after all the Me Too movement, so it's going to come from somewhere. She said that she didn't have any idea of punishing them. Because what was it that they could be punished with that could possibly give back to her what was taken away from her? I thought that was such a loving way of understanding yourself and your loss. So this is what I mean about love, being in ethics. I think that a lot of times I practice silence because that's the most loving thing I can do. Because if I talk, speech, words, there's not enough love in any word to actually bring about the love that is required. So there are choices you make. You talk about agency and it's so important to you. And I'm totally with you. You have to give yourself the intention. What is being intentional? It is to be agentive. I am intending to cook a nice meal today. I would like my child to have a nice tiffin box. So that's an intention that's coming from love and care. So that means you don't wait till 7.45 when the school bus is coming to cook that nice meal. You buy the groceries. You get the gas in place. You make sure that you have the time, that you have the knowledge, that you understand your child's environment at school. What is it possible for them to eat? All these things are part of being loving. So it's a profound ethos."

A lot of people force themselves to swallow shit that is completely not worth the swallowing and also very unloving to the self and to the other person. I believe civil disobedience is a profound act of love. I really believe in that. And I practice satyagraha in many parts, including as a parent. Sometimes my kid does stuff I don't like. I practice civil disobedience with her. So there's no reason why I have to do this, even engage in a conflict with you just because you're my child. I told my students when I would turn up, fly from Delhi to Hyderabad to teach them once a week for three days and fly back and they couldn't be bothered to come on time. I said, I am here today. They came maybe two hours into the class or one hour into the class. I would come from the airport, land in Hyderabad, drive directly to class with my suitcase, be ready to teach. They wouldn't turn up. This happened enough times. Then I said, I've met my contractual obligations. I have been here. There is no where in my contract that says I have to teach when you are not here. So I'm going to practice civil disobedience. And somehow that sort of started touching them a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit. I practiced it in several ways. But yes, I think love is a deeply ethical. It's an ethics. Love is"

        "message": "an ethics. So I'm reminded of a couple of things and one is from what you just said, civil disobedience. The very dear friend whose house I'm staying at in Delhi, Mohit Satyanand, he told me the story of once how next door to him, there was this sort of office or a working environment and people would go out and I forget exactly what it was, either leave cigarette butts in the road or leave teacups, one of those two, and they would just leave it there. And he asked them politely once, can they please not litter? And they didn't do it. So the next day he went out and he collected everything that they had littered and he put it away himself. And he did it a couple of times and it completely stopped. And the other example is from this great book I'm reading called Think Again by Adam Grant, where he talks about this African American piano player called Darryl Davis, who goes to a gig in Maryland in 1983. And over there, he just does a great gig. And after that, a white gentleman comes up to him and says, wow, that was amazing. And he realizes that the white gentleman is a member of the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan, but they have a drink together. And then he starts talking to the guy, asking him questions and so on. And the guy eventually reforms, not just reforms, gets his other white supremacist friends. And, you know, and over a period of time, there is this change that is happening just because you're talking to this person and he's talking to them. And this leads me in a bit of a digression, but this leads me to something I've come to realize more and more, that the hate that we have within us is for abstract things, that when we encounter them in the concrete, we don't hate them. You know, you will, for example, Achal in her episode, Achal Malhotra told me about how when she was in Pakistan, people would rant and rave against Hindus, but then they would notice she's there and she said, tum nahi beti, tum theek ho, tum nahi. So in the concrete, I know a lot of people who are bigots on Twitter, in the concrete, they'll be nice to their Muslim friends, but treat them like exceptions. And the problem is when abstract concepts like nationalism and race and all this nonsense gets into it, that there is hatred. And when I read this, you know, incident about Darrell Davis, which is in the sixth chapter of Grant's book, I just thought that this is such a great example of these bigots who hate a particular kind of person. But when they meet a person like that in the concrete,"

        "message": "they can be changed, you know? So I often feel that it's a good idea. I don't know if love is transactional or not transactional, ethics are relational or not relational. I know that, I know the ideas behind those kinds of ideas. I'm not interested in them at a point as a way of living. I'm interested in them maybe in a mild way to read about them. But actually, love as ethics means that you are both deeply aware of the dynamism of life and also deeply non-transactional. Otherwise, transaction itself can be a deeply loving thing. So the first time I often go to a new place, I go shopping. Nothing spectacular. I love the love that you exchange at a very simple level. Koi bhi threatening cheez nahi hai. Aapne ek dal muri kharid liya. You bought a nariyal paani or you bought a set of bangles or maybe a pot or something. And you find out so many things about yourself and the other person in that transaction. But there is a way to do that transaction in a non-transactional way. That's the loving part. You're attentive to the attention he's giving you. You're attentive to how he positions that project. I mean, I can go on and on. It's unnecessary. But I really feel like that's a good way to live for me. It works."

My sister was born there. She's an American citizen. I have this extremely thick middle Atlantic accent because along with changing my name, they put me into speech therapy because I did not have. I have no problem. I just kind of reflect on this thing happened to me. I have no problem with it, but it's not something I can shed very easily because it came and was so ingrained in me. So even now I have this accent when I talk. The white doll your grandfather could not throw away. The white doll grandfather could not throw away, which has become me in some way. My grandfather wasn't around then. So I love this country and I have to love it like this with the American accent. And I get into so many unpleasant situations because people judge me a lot because I wear saris or I have this accent or I have white hair. If you want to start judging people, there are hundreds of ways to do it, right? And when I step out into this country, this is a moment like another sanskari moment for you. So we get everything connected. So I went to the 2012 Kumbh Mela. I was asked by my friend Ranveer Shah to come and talk to some students that had come from an American university there. And of course there's lots of free time and then you walk around and you watch all the sadhu babas and sadhvis and everything. And I noticed that at one particular place, grouping of sadhus, there was a guy from Japan with all his jeta jhuta and everything and there and then there was another place that was a guy from California. And as I kept walking, I was there for three days and I walked and walked and walked through the Kumbh Mela and I realized that India is still a place where you could be on the far horizon of consciousness or desire or want that people believe India is a place you can come to and you can be that and you can maybe make a community out of it. So I love that. So I know this about this country because I have, I'm a person from Andhra Pradesh but I grew up in Bhopal and Hyderabad and I lived in Bangalore for many years and I also lived in Delhi and I lived in Punjab, many places. What I love about what I love about this country is I feel like there's a possibility of making a community and because we are 1.3 billion people, your community can be pretty big. And I think that's important. For me, that's important that people have an opportunity to do that if they want. So better or worse, it's there."
