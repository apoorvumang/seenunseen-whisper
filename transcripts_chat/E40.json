Modiji was at his hospitable best, starting me off with some cheese and white wine. He told me, We don't serve red wine. Ha ha ha ha ha. Anyway, once I was suitably lubricated, Modiji leaned forward and said, Amit, you are the economic commentator I respect most in this country. From day one of demonetization, you got it right. You wrote about what a disaster it was. For many years, you have been the wisest one. So now tell me, O great soul, O fountain of knowledge, what is the state of the economy like in India? I replied, Namo, bro, I gotta be honest with you. Things are a mess. Demon screwed the informal sector and small businesses. GST with all these slabs and exemptions, even worse. Red tape has gone up. Compliance is hard. A new Inspector Raj is being unleashed. Exporters are suffering. Small businesses are suffering. It's a mess. Then he said, This bloody economy. I have such great speech writers and social media trolls. And still the economy is not doing well. It baffles me. I need food. Jaitleyji rang a bell and an eminent economist wearing a waiter's uniform walked in. He said to Modiji, Kya lau sir? Whatever you want, I will bring it for you. Modiji whispered something in his ear. I couldn't quite make out what he said. And then he elaborated, And make sure it's medium rare. Hare Modiji, I said. What is it that you're eating? Modiji said, Amit, my boy. Why so serious? Don't be shocked. We all worship in our own way."

And many of the things wrong with it are the Unseen effects. Of demonetization and GST. Before I bring in my guest for today, I want to spend a little while talking about each of these. As Modiji mentioned in my dream, I have been writing against demon from day one in publications like The Times of India and The Hindu Business Line. The second episode of The Seen and The Unseen was on demonetization. My guest in that was Suyash Rai. You can check out the archives at seenunseen.in. Some people say that demon was a good idea that was implemented badly. This is nonsense. It was a terrible idea from the start. This is mainly because it was not an attack on high denomination notes to begin with. In 1978, when the last demonetization happened, the notes that were demonetized were only 0.6% of the notes in circulation. They were basically used to store money and not to actually spend it. By contrast, this time, 1000 rupee and 500 rupee notes constituted 86% of the money supply and are used by the common man and the rich. Used by the common man for daily transactions. Modiji may not have bought something from a store for a couple of decades and probably didn't know this sitting in his ivory tower. And from the insider accounts I have heard, he also didn't consult any of the eminent economists who worked with him. Anyway, so overnight there was a shortage of cash and hundreds of millions of people had to queue up for hours to get a hand on their own money. This was easily the largest assault on property rights in human history. The informal sector depends on cash and was crippled by this. Small businesses everywhere were hurt. And as expected, our GDP growth rate suffered as well. Demon was supposed to attack black money, but it was estimated at the time that only 6% of the black money was stored in the form of cash. And even that got neatly laundered. Basically, demonetization crippled our economy and achieved absolutely nothing. For more details on this too, listen to my February episode on this with Suresh Rai at cnunseen.in. I've done two episodes on GST, first with Devangshu Dutta and then with Vivek Kaul. My episode with Devangshu happened before GST was implemented. And Devangshu warned that if there were too many slabs and exemptions, it might defeat the whole purpose. Vivek did an episode with me after GST was implemented and the problems with it were exactly as Devangshu had feared. Too many slabs and exemptions that made it the opposite of a good and simple tax. Indeed, there were now so many regulations that compliance was hard and time-consuming and observers feared that a new Inspector Raj may well be on the way. Anyway, my guest on the show today is Vivek Kaul himself, a prolific author and columnist for Equity Master and, much to my good fortune, a frequent guest on The Seen and The Unseen. Vivek, welcome back to the show."

So, the first thing I would like to say is, you know, if you look at the crash in food prices, the major reason for that is demonetization. Because most of the agriculture trade in India worked on cash. And the moment that cash was taken out of the system, the buying and selling simply stopped. And farmers had to sort of sell their produce at very, very low prices. So, one of the stories that minted was about this farmer who had to sell his, you know, he had grown potatoes this year and this was sometime in March. And he had to sell his potatoes for as low as 9 paisa a kg. Whereas it takes around 3 rupees to produce 1 kg of potato. That's one part. The second part is if you look at the crash in, you know, the price of pulses. So, you know, what has been, so, you know, we need to understand as to how does a farmer actually decide what to produce in a given year. You know, he basically looks at the prices, you know, last year and then he decides. So, you know, the price of pulses have been going up for a while. So, this season there was a huge increase in production of pulses."

That happened because, you know, there was a bumper crop of tomatoes in November, December. And because there was no cash in the system, the prices crashed. So, once the prices crashed, for the next cycle, the farmers simply decided not to, you know, grow any tomatoes. So, because of that, the prices went up. So, if, you know, if you were to sort of extend the tomato example into pulses, my guess is next year, you know, the price of pulses will go up again because farmers this year will not plot as much as, you know, they did last year."

So, now, you know, just to sort of, for the listeners who may not be following monetary economics, a friend once asked me recently that, hey, you know, if the government needs to spend more money, why don't they just print more money? But what typically happens if they print more money is that the number of goods and services are what they are, but you have more money chasing it, so its demand and supply, the price of everything, just goes up and the result is inflation. And when the government prints money, it's basically creating inflation, which is a tax on the poor. And here this has the opposite effect where you take a lot of money out of the system and you have much less money chasing certain goods and services and therefore they become much cheaper and in this case hurting the farmers more."

So, typically what used to happen was that when the Red Cross rations came, suddenly everybody had cigarettes and they used to start using those cigarettes to exchange, you know, for a cup of coffee or tea and so on and so forth. Now, because there was a sudden increase in the inflow of cigarettes, the prices of, you know, coffee and tea used to go up in the sense that, you know, earlier maybe two cigarettes for a coffee and, you know, after the inflow of cigarettes, it used to become three cigarettes for a coffee."

Now, so that's that, I mean, that's very well known. Now, what has happened is, you know, I just noticed this particular data point that I'll talk about around a month back. So, obviously, you know, the country imports a lot of stuff. India does and our biggest imports are oil and gold. Now, oil we import because, you know, we sort of produce only 20% of the oil that we consume and gold we import because we produce almost, you know, nothing. I mean, so we have to import all the gold that we consume. Now, if you strip out gold, oil and silver from the total import numbers, what remains with you is, you know, the technical term for it is non-oil, non-gold, non-silver imports. Now, these imports are a very good indicator of consumer demand in the country. Now, if you look at the growth in non-gold, non-oil, non-silver imports since November, there has been a huge jump. Before November, these imports were actually in the negative territory. But after November, they have like really perked up. Now, what is happening here? It's a very interesting question as to why, you know, how does the scenario change so quickly. So, what is happening here is because of demonetization, the informal sector has sort of been destroyed, the supply chains have been destroyed and those, you know, the products that these informal firms were selling are now coming into the import route. So, basically, you know, we have ended up importing stuff that we were essentially buying from within the country."

So, anyway, so what has happened is that now because the economy is not doing well, you know, when the economy doesn't do well, economists and politicians go back to that, you know, one economist, John Maynard Keynes. Now, John Maynard Keynes, you know, in 1936, in his magnum opus, The General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment, essentially suggested that when the economy is not doing well, when the private sector is not spending enough money, the government should cut tax rates. He also suggested that the governments should spend more money during that period than they, you know, than they spend in other periods. So, this is something that politicians and economists have latched on to since 1936 and every time an economy is in trouble anywhere in the world, this is the first suggestion that is given. Now, it needs to be explained here that, you know, when Keynes was making these suggestions, the governments did not run fiscal deficits. That is what used to happen back then was that their income was equal to their expenditure. So, Keynes' argument was that you essentially accumulate money when the going is good and then you spend it when the going is not so good. But what happened was people just ran with one part of the argument and, you know, the government should spend money when the going is not good. Anyway, so to get back to the point, now with the economy not doing well, obviously all these economists and, you know, some politicians also have been suggesting that the government should spend more money than it is actually spending. Even though the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister, which was recently set up, has advised against it. So, as far as government spending is concerned, if you look at data for the first five months of the year, the government is already spending much more than it usually spends. So, you get, you know, fiscal deficit data every month. So, if you look at the period between April to August, we have already, you know, we are already at 96% of the fiscal deficit which was targeted for the entire year. So, which basically means that the government is spending much more than it actually spends."

So, if it continues to spend money at this rate, then, you know, the targeted fiscal deficit for the year is around 3.2% of the GDP and it will end up at around 4% of the GDP. Now, that's a call that the government needs to make whether they want to increase the fiscal deficit or they want to meet the fiscal deficit target. Now, so typically, you know, the way this works is that when the government spends money, you know, somebody's income goes up and then that income translates into consumer demand and when, you know, consumer demand goes up, the private sector starts to do well and so the economic growth sort of comes back."

Now, let's say if the government were to continue to spend more money, okay, what would happen is that, obviously, it would translate into some sort of consumer demand. Now, the thing is whether that consumer demand would be met through stuff which is produced within the country or stuff which is not produced within the country, okay. Now, given the trend of non-gold, non-silver and non-oil imports going up, what that tells us is that up until now, the consumer demand, a lot of it is not being met through what is being produced in the country, right. So, if we sort of extend that logic, you know, the government spending more will end up, you know, leading to consumer demand which is fulfilled through imports, okay.

What happens is that on the margins when businesses get wiped out, you can't come back again. You're gone. I think the term economists use for it is a welfare shock. And that's a damage which really in some ways is immeasurable."

I mean, but, you know, the one new thing that I've realized is which is sort of causing a lot of problems is the fact that the GST essentially has led to a situation where one too many returns need to be filed. You know, there are people who are perpetually filing returns all through the month. I mean, like, I need to file three returns. And even that at sometimes, you know, becomes a pain. Like, you know, one of the returns is an expense statement that needs to be filed. Now I need to file my expense statements 12 times a year. So obviously, you know, one can understand what the government is trying to do. I mean, they're obviously trying to sort of build a database and then figure out, you know, who are the people who are not paying their fair share of taxes. But then again, you have to be, you know, you have to realize the fact that it takes a lot of time and energy from what is actually not a core activity.

I mean, nothing's been done other than getting the companies to sort of... Sorry, getting the banks to recognize their bad loans as bad loans. And even that number keeps going up every quarter. So, either, you know, if you look at some of these banks... So, there are these five associate banks of State Bank of India and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, which were merged with State Bank of India. And State Bank of India, as of March 31st, was the second best, you know, performing bank among the public sector banks when it came to their bad loans. So, the bad loans were at some 7.15% and after the merger, they've increased to 10%. So, you know, what is the point in merging, you know, five weak banks with a strong bank and making that strong bank a weak bank? Now, this is a solution which is now being offered, you know, wherein the principal economic advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Sanjeev Sanyal, recently said that the number of banks will come down to 10 to 15. But some of these banks, you know, Indian Overseas Bank is one, IDBI Bank, they have bad loan rates of 23-24%. I mean, the question is, why are these banks still in the business of banking? I mean, if you're losing, you know, one-fourth of all that you're lending, I mean, clearly you're not good at what you're doing. I mean, and if you continue, I mean, you'll continue to lose money and the government will have to continue to recapitalize you.
