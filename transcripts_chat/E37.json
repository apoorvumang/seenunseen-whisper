And on paper, it sounds really great. Its intended effects include, you know, expanding coverage, lowering costs, and so on and so forth. But you hold the view that Trump won the last election primarily because of Obamacare. Can you tell me about the unseen effects of Obamacare?"

        "message": "So, basically, what happened with Obamacare, the intentions were very good. The government wanted to give insurance to everyone. They wanted to provide coverage to people who have pre-existing conditions, like they had a heart disease or they had some other kind of, you know, ailment, which exists without. So, when you go to get insurance, the insurance company doesn't give you insurance because you have this condition and it would be costly for them to cover you. And then there were other intentions behind Obamacare that it wanted to reduce the cost to the average American. It wanted to cover services and ban insurance from not paying for emergency services, such as if you take ambulance, you fall sick, it's an emergency, you run to the emergency room, the hospital cannot deny that, you know, your service. And it had many such policies designed. However, what happened in reality was completely different because of Obamacare, the cost of health care, instead of going down, it increased. And it increased not because of the intention of the government. It increased because the way it was designed, right. So, with the intention of banning insurance, discriminating between people, Obamacare banned discrimination on the grounds of sex. Now, you can see women live longer than men. So, previously, they could obtain insurance for cheaper. Now, since Obamacare bans discrimination on the grounds of sex, they would have to, men would pay cheaper rates for insurance and women pay higher rates for insurance because its disparity has to be maintained. That's one of the key problems. Secondly, it banned discrimination on the grounds of pre-existing conditions. Now, what happens is, let's say there are two people, one is 30, another is 30. They both go to insurance. One is a very healthy individual who is going to gym every day, hitting it hard for one hour every day. There's another individual who eats chips, watches TV, plays video games, and has a heart disease. If they both go to insurance, they're living in the same area. Under Obamacare, they would have to pay the same premium. Now, you see the problem here. What the policy was, the intention was really good because everyone should be able to get insurance. But for the insurance company, it turned out really bad because now they would have to design a program in which their finances work in such a manner that they can provide insurance to both of them at the same cost. So, the cost for the healthy people went up."

And because I'm so much likelier to fall ill than you, the premium I would have to pay is 30 bucks. But the premium you as a healthy person would pay is 10 bucks a month. And because both of us have to be kept at parity, the new premium both of us end up paying is 20 bucks."

        "message": "Yeah, that is ideally what would happen. But instead of that premium being 20 bucks, it went actually above 30. And that happened not because of the problem I explained. That happened because of the excessive regulations under Obamacare. So, under Obamacare, first the law itself is 2,000 pages, then there are 20,000 pages of regulation under that. And so, it created so much bureaucracy that the cost has increased for insurance company. That's one aspect of it. Secondly, what has started happening is most of the healthy people realize, why should I pay twice the cost for insurance? So, they don't buy insurance at all. They prefer instead to choose to pay a penalty. So, under Obamacare, there is something called an individual mandate. So, individuals are forced to buy insurance or pay a penalty. What has happened, the government thought that every individual, even the healthy people under the age of 30 who have no disease or exercise heavily, they will also buy insurance, but they are refusing to buy insurance. They just choose to pay a penalty."

And yet, they will reflexively support Obamacare. Well, one of the key issues with Obamacare to me seems consent itself. The individual mandate whereby people are forced to buy insurance or else pay a penalty, which could be up to 2% of their annual income. Just to break it down, if you're making an annual salary of 10 lakhs a year, 20,000 would be your penalty for not buying insurance as the government is forcing you to buy. So, in a sense, it's a tax on healthy people."

There are other problems, like, for example, under Obamacare, insurance are forced to cover certain services. Now, the services, the list has expanded to 300 to 400 services. Now, I can understand some services are very necessary. Emergency, for example, your car accident has to be covered. For example, you have a heart attack. You go to hospital, obviously, you're not going to find out if your insurance is covered, because you're incapacitated to make that decision. But once you have four or five hundred diseases covered under emergency services, and insurance has to pay, then it becomes a problem. And now, how would the insurance pay for this? It's by raising premiums. So, since Obamacare has come into effect on January 1st, 2014, at least most of it, it's actually going to come into full effect in 2020, because of all its provisions are so complicated to put into effect. But let's say 80% of it is in effect from January 1st, 2014. Now, if you have this many diseases, the insurance has to get money from somewhere, and they do it by raising premiums. So, now premiums have gone up for some group of people, 25%, some group of people it has actually doubled. For some, it has, well, gone up by 10%, but it has gone up overall."

And this kind of diseases, they should ideally be covered by market forces. And so, let's go to the basic issue under Obamacare and basic issue with the American healthcare system. Their main problem is that the healthcare is really costly. And why it is so costly? The reason being insurance. Now, under American laws, insurance has to cover each and everything. Now, let me ask you, let's say you have a home, you buy a home insurance. Obviously, if your home, your house burns down, you need insurance. If it floods, you need insurance. You want to change the paint on Diwali, why do you need insurance? This is, you know, you go hire a painter to do it. Now, if insurance is forced to cover each and everything you change in your house, how would it cover it? By charging you only, the government is not giving them the money. So, the premiums have gone up at a certain level. Now, that is one of the major problem. And then healthcare has a second big problem, which is scarcity of resources. So, to simplify the problem, I'll say, let's say there are 90 beds and 100 patients. Now, you can provide services only to 90 people. Now, then it becomes a question of which 90 people get it. Under a free market system, people who need it the most, they are willing to pay for the services. They need and then those people get it. Under a controlled market or insured market, these prices are completely distorted. So, it becomes roughly first come first serve. So, that is the main problem with the American system as such.

The cost of administration has gone up under Obamacare because of 20,000 pages of regulation. And now doctors have to comply with all those regulations. Most of the doctors, especially in rural areas, they have to hire another person to take care of this problem. Now, if you're in a rural area, and US has very sparsely populated rural areas. To give you an example, the state of North Dakota has population of 800,000. And that too is scattered across the state, not just concentrated in one or two major cities. So, if you're a doctor in a rural area, you have 50 customers. You cannot afford to hire another person because you won't be able to recover the cost. So, the number of doctors has drastically gone down in rural areas. Most of them have chosen to either move to another professions which pay or move to cities where they have more customers and bigger markets. So, they can compensate to hire another person."

So, what most companies do, they go up to 49 employees, then they don't hire.

Now, if you try to find a neurologist in this area, obviously, for three patients in one particular area, one doctor is not going to open his practice. So, you would actually have to go and travel to another state maybe or a major city nearby to find a neurologist. And then insurance in US, they have networks. So, they will tell you that this guy is not in our network or this guy is in our network.

Number one, because doctors and hospitals are forced to cover many more diseases and conditions than they otherwise would, the premium has to go up. Number two, because they're not allowed to discriminate for pre-existing conditions and all of that. So, the average premium also rises because of that. Number three, there's massive amounts of paperwork and the cost of that also factors in. And because in addition to the cost rising so drastically, what further makes it worse is the individual mandate, which is essentially a tax on the healthy and by which people are forced to buy insurance whether they want it or not. It's like a disincentive for healthy living in a sense."

That, you know, if I get a heart attack, sure I need insurance. The same, I gave you a previous example that if your house burns down, you need insurance.

Number three is that the current supply of doctors, especially in rural areas, goes down because the paperwork with the 20,000 pages of regulations just make it unfeasible for them to stay in the business. Number four, it affects future supply of doctors because people who might otherwise choose a medical profession just look at all the daunting paperwork and the mess they have to deal with and say, hey, I don't want to do that.

So now they're dependent in the American government runs a Medicare and Medicaid program, which are designed for older generations, people 65 or older or for people with disabilities or people who have just lost their jobs. So now the number of people dependent on these programs have drastically expanded because they can't find a job. They don't have insurance. And this individual mandate applies only if your income is above a certain level. So if your income is below that level, you can enroll in Medicare or Medicaid. So now the enrollments have gone up drastically. Of course, it has provided coverage. But then look at the cost. You would have taxpayers fund this bill. And again, healthy individuals working hard, they will be the ones paying the extra cost for all this. Now you are bringing productivity down and you are actually promoting getting jobs overseas.

But don't you worry, food and drinks will be served shortly, and I would recommend checking out IVM Podcasts to get some of your favorite Indian podcasts. We'll keep you going till this whole thing blows over. Thank you."
