        "message": "of sholay to the budget so when when i had to sort of write this piece uh you know i had sort of figured out what i wanted to write and but i needed an opening which sort of uh curated some you know reader interest and also made me sort of a little more excited about writing the piece so the basic idea was to sort of you know whenever i'm in doubt i sort of go back to 70s 80s hindi cinema so the basic idea was that you know you have the hero and the heroine's family which has been captured by the villain and uh you know they are at his den and then uh after some point you know you have this you know you have a hero breaking in uh through a wall on a motorcycle you know when he comes to rescue all of them so this is the basic idea this is what i originally wanted to write and then it sort of occurred to me that you know why sort of use a general example when you can use a specific one so the specific example was sholay where basanti uh you know basanti and viru are at gabbar's den and basanti is essentially being told very clearly by a khani chewing gabbar that you know as long as you dance your boyfriend shall live and and uh viru cannot do anything because his hands are tied right so when you when you're watching this as an audience you obviously uh are a little worried right but at the back of because you have seen as many hindi films as you have i mean you know that someone will come to the rescue and in this case you know that viru's friend jay who's not there will come and sort of rescue them so this was the basic idea of what i wanted to write now obviously what was the connection with the with the economy and with the budget and now so if you look at the budget there is obviously the revenue side with what the government hopes to earn and the expenditure side on what it wants to spend its money on if you look at the uh revenue side the five biggest taxes uh you know this time i mean that the government earns money through are basically corporation tax which is income tax paid by companies then there is income tax which you and i pay uh then there is uh gst goods and services tax which we pay on a whole host of things we consume i mean starting from the food that we eat at restaurants so on and so forth then there is union excise duty and then there is customs duty okay now these are the five main taxes if you look at the targets for this financial year the government hopes to earn 20 percent more than what they had earned during the last financial year okay this is the overall taxes if you adjust the overall taxes for uh what the central government shares with the state governments what remains you know are referred to as revenue receipts and those revenue receipts are expected to grow 25 percent this year now 20 percent growth and 25 percent growth in government revenues is uh if i wouldn't call it impossible is very very difficult okay now why do i say that you have an economy which the government expects to grow by around 12 percent this is in nominal terms without adjusting for inflation now when the economy is growing by 12 percent you know expecting taxes to grow by 20 or 25 percent is a calculation which does not work okay but you know again so how how how does the government balance this out okay they balance this out by expecting the reserve bank of india to give them a huge dividend okay now how is all this sort of linked with you know gabbar basanti and sholay and whatnot so obviously you know in in this uh situation uh you know you have you have basanti and uh you have viru right so they are basically like the economy and the government okay and uh or you can even call them the budget whatever now they need to be rescued uh and who will rescue them the rbi will rescue them so the rbi becomes jay becomes jay right so you have jay viru and you know you have gabbar and you have uh basanti okay now how will the rbi rescue the government the rbi so basically you know the rbi uh makes a profit every year from its operations how does rbi make a profit now uh what is the liability of the rbi the liability of the rbi is the paper money that it prints and puts out into the market the assets are the international bonds or you know the bonds that it owns now what happens is that the rbi earns interest on its assets but it does not pay any interest on its liabilities so it ends up making a humongous amount of profit every year a lot of so what happens is a significant share of this profit is shared with the government as a dividend every year and whatever remains goes into uh the capital of the rbi okay and so this has been happening for many years and rbi has ended up accumulating a certain amount of capital now this is a fairly technical issue and uh i mean even my understanding of this doesn't go you know beyond the fact that the rbi has ended up accumulating a lot of capital so uh you know a few years back uh arvind subramaniam who happened to be the chief economic advisor of the ministry of finance wrote in the economic survey that you know a significant portion of this accumulated capital that the rbi has can be shared with the government of india since then there has been a lot of back and forth anybody and everybody who has worked for the rbi does not like the idea of handing over this money to the government because what they are saying is that uh all this capital on our books essentially gives us a rock solid balance sheet and it helps us any point of time where there is any international financial crisis which can spread to india the government on the other hand uh wants this uh money and it's desperate for money uh this time around uh so there is a committee which was set up under former rbi governor bimal jalan uh which has uh not arrived at a decision as yet and i think the news going around is that they are likely to sort of submit a report sometime this month and uh what they are essentially saying is that this capital should be shared with the government over a period of time and that sort of makes a lot of sense the government wants it all at once because uh they know that uh you know one is that the tax targets are highly optimistic and there is no way they're going to go around uh you know earning that kind of money so this time around i think the the the total amount of money that the government expects as an rbi dividend is around 90,000 crore so last year the rbi had given them first given them a dividend of 40,000 crore and then it had given an interim dividend of 28,000 crore so this 90,000 crore is what has been budgeted for so in case the revenues don't come through which is uh you know which is a given i mean you you don't revenues don't jump by 25 percent year on year uh so if"

also have a piece in the mint on thursday uh july 11th we are recording this on july july 10th right so basically again you know where does this whole come from there is something uh in in the government budget uh there is something known as uh revenue receipts okay now what are revenue receipts revenue receipts are essentially uh taxes that the government earns uh you subtract the state government's share from that and to that you add the non-tax revenue of the government which is basically you know the dividend that the public sector enterprises give the dividend that uh financial institutions the dividend that rbi gives to the government so basically you start with the taxes you know the five taxes that we the five major taxes and then there are these small taxes also these five major taxes from that you deduct the the money that goes to the state governments and to that you add the non-tax revenue of the government so these are revenue receipts to be very very simple now the if you look at the uh economic survey of of the government it puts the revenue receipts at uh 15.6 lakh crore okay if you look at the budget it puts the revenue receipts at 17.3 lakh crore so the question is where did you know the 1.7 lakh crore difference you know go now where did that money disappear i mean this is how people have been spinning it on twitter i mean the money did not disappear uh it's just that uh the the economic survey and the budget use different estimates of the revenue receipts so basically what happens is when the budget is presented for a year the government makes estimates of the amount of money it expects to earn and the amount of money it expects to spend so these estimates are known as budget estimates okay when the next budget is presented the government again gives a record of the you know amount of money it expects to earn and the amount of money it expects to spend so these are revised estimates okay so like let's say 2000 let's let's take an example of a financial year and do it so 2018-19 in february 2018 arun jaitley presented the budget and he presented the budget for 18-19 which is the period between april 2018 and march 2019 okay so what the so what the numbers there are were referred to as budget estimates in february 2019 piyush goel presented the interim budget okay now the numbers now for 2018-19 that he has are different from the numbers that jaitley presented right uh so these numbers are known as revised estimates okay so the revised estimate uh in the february 2019 interim budget for revenue receipts was 17.3 lakh crore okay these are revised estimates now what happens what is peculiar to this year is that we have an interim budget and then we have a final budget we have an interim budget because the government is completing five years in office and it cannot offer a full year's budget because that is the next government's prerogative july 5th nirmala sita raman presents the final budget now what has happened is that meanwhile there is this agency of the government called the controller general of accounts which puts out a month on month record of you know how much the government earns and how much the government spends so on may 31st 2019 it put out the numbers for 2018-19 and as per that agency the revenue receipts of the government for 2018-19 were 15.6 lakh crore okay the economic survey used this estimate put out by the controller general of accounts this is known as a provisional estimate okay so if you have still not you know if you're not confused by now so the economic survey put out the controller general of accounts number which was 15.6 lakh crore nirmala sita raman's budget stuck to the revised estimate of 17.3 lakh crore so uh now the the the controller general of accounts number given that it was published in may is more accurate than the number which was the revised estimate published in the interim budget sita raman used the revised estimate of 17.3 lakh crore and supermaniam used the provisional estimate which is 15.6 lakh crore and hence the difference of 1.7 lakh now what is happening here now uh if you look at uh the previous uh a few times when an interim budget was presented one uh the last one was in 2014 and the one before that was in 2009 so to rest all conspiracy theories to you know to put all conspiracy theories to rest the typically when a full budget is presented after an interim budget the government uses a revised estimate and not a full estimate not a provisional estimate now what happened was that this time around the difference between the revised estimate and the provisional estimate was huge the difference was 1.7 lakh crore whereas if you look at i mean i looked at the previous two times and the difference between those two estimates was not very big so because the difference was 1.7 lakh crore uh which is why people sort of noticed it okay now what does this do in the overall scheme of things is very interesting interesting the revised revenue estimate is 17.3 lakh crore the next the next year's revenue receipts are expected to be around 19.6 lakh crore or something like that so that is a jump of 13 percent which is doable but then the 17.3 lakh crore is not the real number it's just the number that the government has put into the budget because that's the you know that's convention that we follow so if you put in the real number of 15.63 lakh crore the revenue receipts now need to jump by 25.6 percent or something like that my god so which is where the problem is and which is where if we sort of go back to the rbi point which is why the government expects the rbi to give a huge dividend so because you're not accounting for things properly and and this is not i mean the modi government is not to be blamed for this they are just following what has always been done but this is something that needs to be corrected because you know you can't have you know revenue receipts you want to earn you know 25 percent more but you're reporting only you know 13 percent more so so this is a major hole in the way the budget is sort of crafted it's just that it never mattered before this so probably people didn't bother so this time around"
