And yet there were only 500 spectators in this large ground. There was just one in-house photographer to record the moment. At the toss, when the coin finally hit the ground, you could probably have heard it in that silent, empty stadium. This was a match that was not recognized by the ICC, a match with few spectators. And yet it was the legend Garfield Sobers who was supervising the toss, and the two captains were Ian Chappell and Clive Lloyd. This was a day that cricket changed forever."

And I will be examining this topic through the prism of World Series cricket and the IPL. My guests today are both legends of cricket writing, Gideon Hay and Prem Panicker. Gideon is an Australian cricket writer who has written more than 30 books. Many of them are about cricket, the rest about business and economics, which makes Kerry Packer's World Series an ideal subject for him, as it falls at the intersection of both. His first cricket book, The Cricket War, the inside story of Kerry Packer's World Series cricket, was released in 1993, and it was released in India in a new edition a few days ago. Prem Panicker needs no introduction to cricket lovers in India. He was probably the first blogger in the world, long before blogs even existed, with his cricket updates for Rediff in the mid-1990s. He is also an authority on media and on politics. And like me, he's followed the IPL very closely. I caught up with Gideon and Prem at the Bangalore Literature Festival last weekend, and recorded this episode with them there. Here we go. Gideon, Prem, welcome to the show. Nice to be here. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Gideon, I have in my hands right now your first book, The Cricket War, which is releasing now in India for the first time. A little bit light. It took a while to get here. Yeah, and you wrote it in the early 90s. Yes, it essentially covers World Series cricket and what Kerry Packer, how Kerry Packer transformed the game. And all of that is incredibly relevant even today because all those fundamental questions about the commercialization of the game, what it does to the spirit of the game, the way it is played and so on, are incredibly relevant no matter which side of the fence you fall upon. And you mentioned that, you know, when re-reading this book now, you felt that it was still incredibly relevant for what we"

If you think about where cricket was in 1977, you had the occasion of the Centenary Test, which was the celebration of all good things about Test cricket, honoring the fact that they had been the first Test match in March 1877. It was a great pretext for self-congratulation about the stature that the game had achieved, its place in the national life, its role in the Commonwealth, its upholding of certain values that the people like to believe about the game as embodying. And then even as that Test match was in progress, there was a private entrepreneur with a broadcasting company recruiting the best cricketers in the world for his own roll-your-own television spectacular. There's never been anything quite so audacious since then. And in the course of the next two years, cricket would learn a great deal about the effects of the arrival of private capital. It would receive a timely education in the value of commercial rights, which of course has underpinned the game's growth for the subsequent four years. The players would get a first feeling for their role as something other than mere athletes. They became celebrities, if you like, for the first time. They became commercial properties to be bought and sold. And for the first time, we saw the potential that was latent in one-day cricket, a new variant on an old theme. There'd only really been relatively few one-day internationals before World Series cricket. After World Series cricket, the format goes forth and multiplies,"

        "message": "I do think it was a bit of a perfect storm. It was a very unusual concatenation of circumstances in 1977. A, you had a game that was very, very popular, and there's no doubt about it. Cricket in 1977 was hugely popular. In Australia in particular, because it had this very vital, gregarious, exciting team, Lillian Thompson, the Chapels, Marsh, et cetera, who felt nonetheless alienated and underpaid and exploited by their administrators because they compared their rewards to those that were available in individual sports, such as tennis and golf, which were rapidly professionalizing off the back of television. You had the rights for \u2013 the commercial and broadcasting rights for that cricket were being significantly undersold. They were basically in the hands of a national broadcaster that broadcast the game essentially on a kind of a grace and favor basis, I guess in much the same way as Doordarshan had in India forever and a day. You had a set of players who had a kind of an accumulation of about 10 years' worth of grievances with their administrators and an administrative class that I think had become dangerously separated by a generation and more from the attitudes of their players. And you had certain stars, Dennis Leib notably and the Chapels, who had links in with people in other pursuits. The important figures in World Series cricket are not simply Kerry Packer and the players, but there are people like John Cornell and Austin Robertson and Paul Hogan who played such an important part in bringing the players and Packer as an impresario together. I think that where Packer had a unique advantage was that he was quite a young man. He's only 39 in 1977. He's trying to make his own way in the world out from under the influence or the reputation of his late father who had been a great press baron, Sir Frank, in his own right. He was looking not necessarily to make his name, but to create something of his own. And he'd already revolutionised the magazine market in Australia by setting up the first really significant sort of new wave women's magazine, Clio. And he was fascinated by sport, the potential of sport to create lots of content throughout the year, relatively cheap to produce, embroidered with natural ad breaks, which naturally captured the nation's imagination. I don't think any single individual, with the possible exception of Rupert Murdoch in Australia, could have had quite the same grand conception about the role of sport as a kind of a commercial battering ram. I think the players, too, tended to gravitate towards an individual, a compelling individual such as Packer, rather than necessarily a faceless corporate enterprise, because players naturally deferred to an inspirational authority. And the minute that Packer really had the Chapels on their side, and Libby, who were such important opinion makers in their own generation, it was inevitable, really, that all the players would follow. They were very susceptible to the influence of these strongmen of Australian cricket at that time. Perhaps these days, they might take a slightly more sort of individual and selfish attitude. But then the Australian cricket team moved as a block, and they were kind of arm-in-arm"

The touchstone that I know Ciapelli talks about all the time is the 1970 tour of South Africa, where the Australian players were playing it. They were on a double tour. They'd played against India. They'd come from India. They'd beaten India at home, but it had been a terribly, terribly arduous tour. They went to South Africa. They were smashed by a very great South African team. And the cricket board tried to persuade them to play an extra test. And Ciapelli said, well, basically, you have to get us to sign another contract, and we're not going to sign another contract. And that was the first evidence that the players were capable of defying their administrators. The administrators chose to back off in that confrontation. But it did give the players a bit of a feeling for their power if they acted collectively. We've actually, interestingly, we've seen further events of that during the recent pay dispute in Australia, where the players did stick to one another, both the male and the female players, international and domestic. And it proved that in the end, if you couldn't break them, if you couldn't divide them, then they did have the opportunity to assert their"

        "message": "Well, I can recall my own action. I was an 11-year-old child who was massively excited about cricket, really coming to terms with the game for the first time. And I was shocked. I was shocked, appalled that the players would desert. All these things that I'd been told were vitally important. Tradition, etiquette, the honour of representing your country, the fact that the game was beyond price. To my prim 11-year-old sensibilities, that was a gross affront. At the same time, part of me was absolutely fascinated by this new enterprise. It was so different. It was so exciting. It was so colourful. It was so full of personality. And it was another channel. How exciting to have cricket on two channels all of a sudden. So over the course of the next two years, I probably went on the same kind of journey as the Australian public in the sense that having gotten over my initial shock, I began to see that there was value in this new kind of cricket, that it afforded opportunities for greater remuneration for players, which no doubt they deserved. It was exciting. It was accessible. It was innovative because for the first time we saw players playing in helmets. We saw them playing under lights. We saw them playing in coloured clothes. We saw a vastly enhanced television coverage. The kind of thing that we take these days for granted, but really World Series Cricket is the first iteration of that evolution of the game, which is more than simply being a kind of a silent, distant witness to the game. Cameras for the first time kind of got close up to the action and really dwelt on it and teased out all its possibilities and replayed endlessly from all conceivable angles. We forget that Packer introduced the standard innovation of filming cricket from both ends. Because when I started watching cricket in the mid-1970s, you saw it from one end only. You saw it from behind the bowler's arm in one over and then from behind the batsman in the next. And Packer said, well, I can't stand looking at batsmen's arses half the time. I want to see it from behind the bowler's arm each time. And that's an amazing change"

It's not just that the sport is happening and as a matter of fact, we're showing it to people. But the audience is at the centre of it. So that simple change always seems to epitomise that. So now my next question is sort of a multi-part question. What kind of changes did World Series Cricket kickstart in cricket in three aspects? One, the game itself, the way it was played. Two, the lives of all the stakeholders involved, players, administrators and so on. And three, in terms of cricket's place in the culture, because like you correctly said, it had a place in the culture that went beyond mere mindless entertainment.

        "message": "that set of values. I'll start with the third one first, because I think that is the most interesting. It's a very good quote from an Australian writer called Greg Manning, an academic, who said that Packer didn't spend all that money to buy cricket. He spent that money turning cricket into something that he could buy. For the first time, cricket was turned into a tradable commodity. It was something that could be bought and sold. Players could be bought and sold. In a sense, that liberation of kind of animal spirits is something that we're still coming to terms with. It did instil in players an idea that, you know, they were entities. They were entities in a free market of entertainment who could sell themselves potentially to the highest possible bidder. In some senses, it's almost impossible to conceive of the rebel tours of the 1980s having gone ahead, if not for what had happened in 1977. It made players think, okay, I'm only around for a short period of time. I should take advantage of whatever opportunities come my way, and that pariah-hood can be survived, because for two years those players were kind of non-persons in the eyes of the establishment game, and yet in 1979, everything went back to the way it had been. The players for that short period had been greatly enriched. The first part of your question, what did it do to the game? Well, in some respects, Packer was predominantly a great resurfacer of the game. He didn't sort of fundamentally change the balance between bat and ball. He didn't invent a new kind of bowling. What he did was he popularized a form of cricket that had already been explored by the establishment. We'd already had the World Cup of 1975. We'd seen the pent-up potential of one-day cricket. What we hadn't done was take full commercial advantage of it. Once it had been demonstrated that people would turn up for innovations like night cricket, then the establishment was able to take advantage of that. The interesting thing about the pact that Packer strikes with the game in 1979 is that he gets an even better deal than he initially bargained on, because PBL Marketing, his organization, becomes the official marketing arm of the Australian Cricket Board. So he's basically getting to prepare his own attractions for television. He gets a chance to participate in the creation of the marketing and the advertising that is going to be screened on his own television network. That's an amazing power. In fact, Channel 9 lost that power in the mid-1990s, but they held it for a long time. Packer was really able to reshape cricket according to the priorities of his own television station. That was a remarkable innovation. Broadcasters got a sense that they could influence kind of on-field outcomes. They could influence the way in which the calendar was structured. Because they were bringing such rewards to the game through commercial opportunities, they had a say in the way in which cricket was run."

Players started earning a lot, which is a great thing. And then, you know, 10 years ago, we had the IPL come up. And that seems in many ways like the World Series and steroids.

There was a set of circumstances that came together to create both dissatisfaction and therefore an opportunity. And there was a person who was smart enough to do the math, see the opportunity. And ultimately, as Gideon said, he ended up gaining far more than he would have gained if they had listened to him in the first place. I think the one thing that strikes me about Indian cricket, and that's true from even before the 90s, but certainly true from the 90s on till very recently, and this includes the inception of the IPL, is that there has never been any thought at any stage of development. It is either that you've tripped over something and fallen into something and then realized that you got lucky and fell with your face pointing the right way. Or you have been forced by external circumstances to sort of, so an innovation has been to circumvent somebody else from innovating.

Back in the day when you didn't have much to do with your time, watching a five-day Test match made sense. But today you have so many competing demands on your time, including on your smartphone where there's so much of addictive entertainment happening. Does Test cricket have a future?

It wouldn't have been better as a three-setter or a two-setter, would it? It actually needs that duration. It needs that rise and fall. It needs that push and pull. You can't have everything proceeding in a series of explosive moments because explosive moments, well, they impress themselves on the mind, but in a very disorganized way. I mean, isn't it fascinating that you can still remember test matches that you saw in the 1970s or the 1980s or the 1990s, but it's actually quite difficult to remember that T20 hand that you saw last week. I think you need both. In an ideal world, you would have a perfect balance between both, both the kind of the sugar hit that short form operates and the more wholesome sustenance that I think the long form has. But you're right. I think in the end, economics might be the ultimate determinant. You have to come up with some sort of estimation of what you would lose economically. And I think there is a cost to the fading value of Test Cricket. Test Cricket does anchor us. It does provide us with a sense of continuity, a sense of generation or renewal. It provides the forum for players to be great. T20 provides a forum for players to be spectacular and explosive and eye-catching but it doesn't really allow us to study them at length and up close in all their manifestations and to see the full range of their skills and the full complexities of the game. That doesn't make it a bad form. That makes it a certain kind of cricket that if only that kind of cricket was on offer, then the game would be somehow diminished."

It was all about the ability to reproduce certain core skills consistently to a very high standard. It was a relatively narrow set of skills. To be simple, do it well again and again. Exactly. Glenn McGrath, perhaps the ultimate example, the bowler who could just land the ball on a sixpence over and over again, do a little bit either way. Inherently kind of undramatic cricketer, but with an amazingly robust mechanism and an endless patience. Skill now works on a kind of a horizontal axis. It's a range of skills. Cricketers are more skillful in the sense that they have more skills than perhaps they ever have before. What they perhaps don't have is the robust mechanism that allows for their constant repetition. The accent is now on variety rather than consistency, isn't it? It's the ability to access 360 degrees of the ground. It's the ability to bowl six different balls in and over so as to maximise the disruption to the opponent's rhythm. You actually have two games now operating at right angles to one another. It is amazing when you see the skills migrate from one format to another. I actually thought the World Cup in 2015 was utterly fascinating precisely because you got test match quality bowling because the accent was on the only way to slow down batsmen these days is to get them out. And T20 batting skills on show, and they both kind of meshed to this new model of ODI cricket, which made it for a very heady brew. That's why I found it such a compelling tournament to watch."

He said that towards the end of his career, he had begun sort of fiddling almost compulsively with his tip-net, partly because of his bad back, just to feel more comfortable with the crease. He said the most valuable coaching advice that he ever received was just the reinforcement not to make changes, just to rely on doing things simply to have faith in yourself, that degree of reinforcement. It's interesting that a man as psychologically strong as Mike would have required that degree of reinforcement, but that was something that he did feel that he'd missed out on. Mike loved the batting. Mike loved resistance, since that is quite an old-fashioned quality these days. Players want to lead the game. Players want to take the aggressive role. Mike loved to withstand, and at his best, there was probably no one better.

I think that the love of the game among those who play it is still abiding. And frankly, when I'm out there, I'm just constantly surprised by what a great game it is, how uniquely satisfying, how uniquely skillful, how uniquely fun and full of comradeship it is, how it can blend people from different backgrounds, how it teaches respect for opponents, it teaches respect for officials.
