        "message": "This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Intel. How do we see the world? A glib answer to that is differently. You and I can stand at a crowded intersection and look out into the world and see totally different things. Indeed, we could look at the same rock and see two different rocks. The world is the seen and the unseen, and the scene is such a small part of it. This is why I love reading literature. Books open windows for us into other worlds, even when they are set in the same world as ours. For those who don't read, you have one life to live. For those who do read, there is no end to lives and to seeing. Now, while I do read a lot, my biggest complaint about myself is that I don't see enough. I go places, I do things, but I remain stuck inside my own head. But a writer has to learn to see. How else can you build worlds for others? This is why I enjoy chatting with novelists on the show. Each of them sees the world in a unique way. And when they share some of that with me, I can also see a little better. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Saira Rai, a writer, a novelist who straddles multiple languages and multiple worlds. Saira is a granddaughter of the great Munshi Premchand, the giant of Hindi literature. But she doesn't often like this fact mentioned because, hey, she stands out as a literary figure and as a person in her own right. She's equally at ease with Hindi, Urdu and English. And all her fiction, in fact, is written in Hindi. But she's translated writers like Vinod Kumar Shukla into English, as well as some of her own work. I met Saira when I agreed to be on the jury of the JCB Literature Prize this year, and Saira was ahead of the jury. These are COVID times, so our jury meetings would happen on Zoom. The five of our jury members would gather to discuss a fixed number of books every week, and Saira would lead the discussion by talking about each book in detail. For me, and I think for all the other jury members, it was a jaw-dropping experience. She would talk about each book with such depth that she taught us not just something about the book all of us had read, but also something about reading itself. I figured that whenever we could meet in person, I simply had to record an episode with Saira. So finally, in the second week of November, we made it happen. She was passing through Mumbai, I invited her home for lunch and a recording in my home studio, and we had the conversation you will hear now. I loved having this conversation, and I loved listening to it again later, because I love books and writing, and Saira reminds me why. Listen in, I think you'll like it as well. But before that, a quick commercial break. As I mentioned in commercials in previous episodes, Intel's 11th Gen vPro platform helps companies boost their performance and security. And it does more than this. It also makes it easy to manage a large number of PCs across business locations remotely. Intel's vPro platform enables IT professionals to discover, repair, protect and even turbocharge networked systems. It is an unseen force behind the fact that all this technology around us keeps working smoothly. Intel's vPro platform is built for business, wherever business happens. Saira, welcome to the Scene in the Unseen."

Like I read a couple of great stories by you which we'll talk about, and also this wonderful essay you wrote for Caravan, which was so rich in impressions and ideas. But as you came in, you just mentioned that you've also got other essays in the pipeline, including one that talks about memories and the layers of memories that builds one's life. And you kindly offered to read it out for us. So I'm going to take you up on that offer. Tell me a little bit about this essay and then go ahead."

And it's basically a family memoir kind of thing, but it's not actually a linear thing. Like all the essays are separate. They are usually about a place, a house or a person, various people in my family. So they are all interconnected essays, but they are not necessarily one continuous narrative like that. So this piece that I wrote, which is quite a short piece really, I mean, I intended it as a preface. I'm still not very sure whether I should use it as a preface. But it's basically about living in a house, which is a family house in Allahabad, in Raman Road. In it, the house is also a character. The house is a character in the sense that, I mean, it describes the house, the rooms inside, and how people lived in it, and my memories of those people who are not there anymore. So it sort of starts off like that. So that's the beginning of my... Wonderful. I can't wait to hear it. Let's go. So should I read it out now?"

        "message": "Right. So the piece is called Palimpsest. And well, anyway, I'll just read it out. So I don't have to, I mean, I'm not going to explain what it is about because the listeners will get the sense of it. It's called Palimpsest. There is something melancholy in the act of writing about one's past. This is especially the case if most of that past has taken place in the same house in which you still live. It is your family home, the same house where you have always lived, and yet it is different. There were people who lived here, but many of them are no longer alive. Absent, they are still palpable. The air is saturated with their presence, their invisible script written upon each corner of the house. You pull the door, and with a creaking of springs, it opens. The rooms are all there. You feel the volume of the space. You know the pictures that were on the walls, the exact position of the furniture, the objects in the room. Nothing has changed, but everything feels changed. You remember the way light fell from the skylights, some of which are now blocked up or have disappeared in changes made to the house. There are cobwebs hanging from ceilings too high to be cleaned, not that you want to clean them. There are termites, too, that swarm out of the ground and make mud tubes, reaching the most unlikely of places. You can, if you listen hard, hear the quiet clicking sounds they make as they move and munch away at the woodwork, hidden from sight. You want to disturb nothing. Each space in the house has a history, and it's as if everything in it casts a shadow, has a sort of ghost life. You try to catch the shadows, to pin them down, but it is not easy. The harder you try, the more elusive becomes the business of shadows, and you come away with nothing. You become obsessed with mirrors. Some mirrors are blind and reveal nothing. There are others in which you look and find in your face your mother or your grandmother. You see resemblances and patterns you had not noticed before. You hold up your hand to the mirror and look at the blue veins on your hands that taper into the fingers with their neatly paired nails. The prominent, busy lines intersect and connect with the lesser ones, like so many rivers meeting with their tributaries on the triangular delta of your hand. With a start you realise that it is your mother's hand you are looking at. It is then that you know that you cannot ever be separated from your history. Your past is embedded in your body, but sometimes mirrors are false, distorted, damaged or askew. These are the abstract mirrors, mirrors that you have imagined into being and that can play a trick on you. There is a patch of black chillies in the garden, black leaves, deep mauve flowers and the little chillies like black tongues. They look mysterious with a hint of virulence about them. Watch out for those black tongues, they can put a hex on you. The black tongues curse and the curse comes true. You think of the chillies when you look at a photograph taken on Nowruz in the year 1971. White was the colour for that year, it was the year of peace. Everyone in the photo is dressed in white and all the food on the dastarkhan is also white. You look at the faces in the photo and realise that all of those 12 people except for you and your sister are dead. There is nothing strange about that, everyone dies. This is no narrative of loss. Dying is merely a function of living. But then you see your mother, she is wearing a white saree printed with a paisley pattern in green. Short-sighted, she always wears glasses and these particular ones have an onion pink frame. The family has gathered round the teapot in the front veranda of the house. Uncharacteristically, she does not participate at all in the conversation while a mysterious smile plays on her lips. Quite suddenly, with an absolutely impassive face, she winks. Only then do you see that the lens from that side of her spectacles is missing. It is a comic moment and everyone laughs but it also brings home to you that there is much that you do not see. Your father comes to you when you are not thinking about him. He is laughing, he does not speak but he laughs. His laughter is loud and resonant and the whole room rings with it. It flows down the stairs in a stream of gushing sound and it gathers in a pool at the bottom of the steps. It rests on the laburnum that is in full bloom, startling into flight a flock of roosting sparrows. His body shakes, his eyes fill with tears. It is not clear whether the laughter is happy or despairing. One day you enter a room and you find your brother sitting there. He leans back and closes his eyes, as he does when he does not want to listen to what is being said. His wife is speaking. She is always speaking. A complicated web of lies floats just beneath her skin. For 26 years he has tried to get to the meaning of what she says. But the truth can just be glimpsed in flashes, for it can be found only in what she has not said. None of this happens of course. It cannot, because none of these people are here any longer. It's the mirror again, your personal mirror that keeps reflecting the past moments of which your life is composed. It invents some of those moments too and you can never be sure if something really happened. The strange thing about living in the same house all your life is that you cannot go back to it, because for you are still in it, and yet you keep going back. It is not the house that you are returning to, but a time. The house merely holds the accumulations of the years, evidence to the many layers of living in it that are transposed one upon another. You turn the things of the house over in your hands, curious objects, threadbare fabric, rusty biscuit tins holding loose clattering buttons of all description, old watches that stopped long ago, opaque lamp chimneys, issues of Lilliput magazine yellowed with age, and you don't want to let go of anything. For those things, unbeknownst to you, have become part of who you are. Sitting on the terrace, you look about you. The Algeria nervosa has spread its abundant foliage all over one side of the house. It's the elephant creeper. It grows rapidly, so quickly in fact that you feel it has grown another tendril or two in the moment that you looked away. You wonder if its roots go as deep into the earth as the plant does into the air. It has the house, and you, firmly in its grip. You shake yourself and try to leave. You've been trying to leave for years, fearing that in this stationary town with its two rivers and its narrow roads, you will become a pumpkin or a gourd. You look at other houses in other cities. Other lives flash across your mind. Hypothetical lives lived hypothetically. For you know that you will never go away. The house will never let you go."

Wherever I turn, wherever I look, I see the black ruins of my life here where I've spent so many years, wasted them, destroyed them totally. And now there's a stop quote within the poem and the narrator continues. You won't find a new country, won't find another shore. This city will always pursue you. You'll walk the same streets, grow old in the same neighborhoods, turn grey in these same houses. You'll always end up in this city. Don't hope for things elsewhere.

So, you know, one of the things that I think all our listeners would have noticed while you read that passage out and that I constantly kept noticing when I read all your essays and your stories, and I'll come back to that, you know, as we reach those particular pieces, is your power of observation. Like all these little details that you're coming out with. Like one thing I tell my writing students all the time is avoid the abstract. Go for the concrete. There's a lot of richness there. Now, I'm kind of curious about is this power of observation something that was always part of you or is it something that you felt the need to cultivate as a writer because another sort of journey you've spoken about is of being a young writer. Like, you know, you've spoken of the bungalows of Allahabad and how they were also far away from each other and you were like an island and you had no sense of that larger society around you. So you were like a writer without material. You knew there was a writer inside you, but you had no material, which is how when I look back on my 20s, it was kind of exactly like that, that you want to write, but you haven't lived enough to write. So this acute power of observation, has it always been there even before you had this consciousness of wanting to write?"

        "message": "Amit, I think the power of observation also comes from dullness. I know it sounds like the complete opposite of what we are trying to get at, but it's the dull day on which nothing is happening. You are there quietly by yourself and you're looking around, you're looking at things. So you tend to notice much more because your mind is not distracted and I mean what you said about the bungalows and how I lived, I mean I spent my early years and I still do in fact live in the same bungalow, though the city itself has changed quite a lot. But my early years were very quiet years in the sense that nothing was happening. These bungalows, Allahabad is a city of bungalows that had been built by the Brits long ago and many of those bungalows have now gone. They've been demolished, but ours is one of the few bungalows that remains. So my life in those bungalows was one of solitude. I would say even as a child, I mean there were not many people to be met and neighbours were far away and we were not really particularly interacting with the neighbours. So it was a lot of space around you and you could sort of wander about in that space, climb trees, I even chewed leaves to find out if they're poisonous. Were they? Obviously not. Yeah, so I survived that. But I mean there were all these experiments that could be done and you could just observe nature and observe. I mean it became like examining everything under a microscope really because I mean nothing else was going on to take your attention. There were birds, bird calls, all these things you were noticing. So it was in a sense an idyllic life, but of course it was far away from other people. So while writing stories, one also has to know those people and in India that already comes with a challenge because all the names for instance of people, they come with their background. You know, Mr. Jhunjhunwala or Mr. Gupta or Mr. Srivastava, Mrs. Dhondi or whatever, you know, these people all have different sets of geographical and also cultural sort of features. So you already don't have that, which was what I found difficult in the beginning when I started to write that living in a bungalow like this, basically you don't really, I mean there's the linguistic aspect also of it, which is that in the kind of house that I grew up, there were many books and books in several languages and the languages that I heard around me like we spoke Hindustani at home, in school it was English and we were supposed to be fined if we spoke in Hindi. So that never really happened. I mean we were not fined and people spoke in Hindi all the time, but that was the thing that they did not encourage speaking in Hindi in school and at home we were embarrassed to speak in English because our family had a sort of linguistic pride. I did not sort of, nobody, none of us spoke in English at home and then there was the Avadhi that was spoken around us like people, the servants for instance, they spoke Avadhi and other people around who had a rural background, they were speaking in Avadhi. My grandmother spoke Bhojpuri because I mean she came from, I mean from that side, further east UP, Banaras was mine, I mean Lamahi, actually that's a village called Lamahi which is about three miles away from Banaras and there's Bhojpuri spoken over there. So she would speak Bhojpuri and Bangla, my father was a fluent Bangla speaker and well he spoke Bangla quite obviously. If he found out that you knew Bangla, he would always prefer to speak in Bangla and not in Hindi or Bhojpuri, but he spoke to his mother in Bhojpuri. So there was all these sort of sounds sort of falling, kind of multilingual sort of thing that was constantly and that's not my situation particularly in India because there are many people who would have a similar experience of many languages being spoken around them. So there was this thing of which language to write in. When I started out writing, I mean I wondered because English, I was quite fluent with English, my reading was in English, in school we were taught to write in English. So it seemed that perhaps one should write in English, but then while speaking I was more comfortable with Hindustani. So there was this whole struggle going on, groping for language as it were, which language to write in and this sort of lack of a language and then the lack of material because I didn't really know anyone around. So all these kind of added up to a sort of angst about writing, which I was not able to overcome for a very long time and this flight of writing from writing fiction pursued me for a long time, long long time. And I think finally in my 40s I started writing something like that."

        "message": "Well actually in my family, language was one thing that was constantly spoken about. I mean people, if there was some word for instance that appeared that you did not know, immediately a dictionary would be fished out and the word would be made clear. And also sometimes going to the root of that word, whether it was coming from Arabic or Persian or whatever, you know depends which language the word belonged to. So there was this very heightened consciousness of language in my family and as you said, I mean my mother and my aunt both wrote their stories first in Urdu, which was their primary language. And then because of ease of publication and just wider reach of publication, they switched and they wrote their scripts out again in Hindi. And they were constantly, I mean their early education, they did not go to school. The Maulvi used to come at home to teach them. And of course they had many tales about how they used to give the Maulvi the slip. Like he would come and Maulvi Sahab was very fond of his opium. So he'd come and he'd sit down and he'd set them the work for that day and he'd put on, have his opium and then he'd fall into a deep sleep. So these kids, I mean they were really wicked kids I think. I mean they were sort of, they were pretending to sort of move backward and forward learning their Farsi and learning their poetry and all that. And then they would go to the kitchen and pick up this huge tin thali from there and bang on it with a huge stone. So this sounded like the bell that came from the town hall at 12 o'clock or whatever and they'd sort of, Maulvi Sahab would wake up suddenly and say, oh what was that? Is it time? As the gajar baj gaya, gajar bajta tha. So gajar baj gaya meant that his lesson was over. So haan haan Maulvi Sahab, humlo toh ek ghante se padh rahe hain. And then he'd shuffle off and the lesson would be over and then they'd be free to do all their little pranks all over the place. So I mean, so they never really had a formal education in that sense but even so they were really well versed in their Farsi and they would do and they knew all these couplets and for every occasion they'd come up with a suitable couplet. So all this whole thing of many languages was already there at home. You know, one could hear this and these languages sort of went into a sleeping pool of languages, I would say, inside me which never emerged at that point. But there's this whole mysterious thing about writing that when you sit down to write, it's like one word follows another and somehow what emerges is what you may have felt say 40 years ago and you don't know which bird it was singing in the pine tree on which particular Sunday or which line someone said that is suddenly going to surface when you're writing and you will not be able to think of that when you're actually not writing. So it's a very mysterious and a very magical process. So language too is part of that. You know, the words for these things come when you're actually writing them and they are somewhere in your submerged memory and you don't remember them. If you consciously try to remember them, they will not come out. So that's how languages have worked for me. You know, it's something, it's more a process of absorption. You know, it's just something that is going inside you and is waiting for that time. So, I mean, when you put it down on paper, it's just something just, it's like when you put this lemon juice on, you know, if you write something with lemon juice and you iron it, then the writing appears, otherwise it's invisible. So it's a bit like that, you know. So these things are already within you and when you write, they just, you recognize them rather than remember them."

You know, just looking at the objects people carried with them during partition and the memories that they carried. And like while researching for that, one of the things I realized was that how memory works in the brain is that when you remember something, you're remembering what happened. But every subsequent time you're remembering the last remembering of it. And therefore, over a period of time, your memories can grow richer or can fade or can have other layers painted onto them by whatever, which is why, you know, sometimes if you shared a memory with someone 20 years ago and you both discuss it, you might find that both of you remember it completely differently."

And one of the things that, one of the common phenomena in people whose memory goes in old age and which I saw in my father was that the edges remain very stark. So you remember what happened yesterday and you remember what happened when you were 10 and it's those middle periods which kind of tend to go. And I remember once he asked me that, you know, what were you like growing up? Because I don't remember. I think about that because when I look back on my own process of remembering things, you know, some people that never had meaning suddenly have meaning because of the way I have changed or just the nature of memory changes and one forgets so much. So since you have both been someone who is playing around a lot in that pool of memories, both in your writing and I'm sure in these autobiographical essays as well, which I can't wait to read. And as someone who is deeply self-reflective, what are sort of your thoughts on this? Like, is there a sense in which your life at 10 is being more richly lived now than it was when you were 10?"

The past becomes present for you when you remember it. So in a sense, there is no past. I mean, everything, at the moment of remembering, you are living it, right? I mean, sort of, it's just there for you. So, and also memory is changing. You said that you may remember something and last time it was completely different. I think that's what fiction is all about. Perhaps life is a fiction, you know, because you live things and later you remember them. It's something else you remember and when you're writing about it, some other thing happens. You know, so it's all part of this whole mysterious universe of words and memories and how words recall those memories, which keeps changing. And if two people have, say, been through some incident together, their remembering of it can be completely different. We just don't know. It's also the individual perception of things that comes into play and some person may remember a certain thing about that day, the other person may remember something else. So it just becomes like that, different memories. So it sees various layers and various sort of submersions, I would say, and things that you come up with that just add to the whole persona of the writer, I think. I mean, it's just, people do a lot of detective work. For instance, when you're writing something, you publish a story. So people go, oh, this is about this one. You know, people say, and it's a very irritating question for any writer because when I'm writing, for instance, the story has to be grounded somewhere. You can't base it in some fictional place. It has to be a place that you know and you can write the details of. But the story itself, when it's put into that background, into that ground, rather, is a fictional story. So, I mean, it's not about so-and-so or, you know, people always try to find parallels, especially people who know you try to find parallels in your stories. But I think that is a completely sort of not a good way of looking at sort of writing like that. But I think we live our lives largely as fiction, you know, and the memories that get created are also fiction from that point of view."

        "message": "Yeah, fascinating to think of it like that. Tell me a bit more about your childhood because, you know, got this collection of your grandfather Munshi Premchand's collected stories, which had an introduction by you. And in that introduction, you wrote, and I'll read this bit out. A mention of Babuji would crop up in conversation, the simplicity with which he chose to live his life, his idealism and high moral standards, his loud and infectious laughter, his writing at odd hours of the night, early in the morning, often by light of a hurricane lamp, his commitment to the oppressed and downtrodden, his belief that money corrupts. The notion that being poor is somehow spiritually exalting, a little hypocritically permeated the atmosphere in our well-to-do home, so much so that as a child, when asked once what I'd like to be when I grew up, I answered that I'd like to be poor. His inability to clear a qualifying entrance exam for college because his maths was weak, the particular vegetables he'd been advised not to eat because of his poor digestion, talk about him was frequent and he was never far from us, hovering benignly in our consciousness, a somewhat larger-than-life figure in the family cupboard to be thought of with pride, stop quote. How was it like growing up in Premchand's household, whose outside the household, of course, is a legend and much loved by people in a very visceral way, as you go on to describe later in the essay, but at the same time, like your answer about how I'd like to be poor when I grow up, I guess, did that aura of Premchand, and also your family was very literary, both your parents were artists and they were accomplished, in fact, your grandmother herself was a very formidable person and I'll ask you more about her later, but growing up then, as you did, what was that like? Did it set you apart from everyone else? Did you have this sort of feeling that I have to live up to this? Like earlier you mentioned you were scared to speak English at home because, hey, you know, the greatest Hindi writer is home. So tell me a little bit about how that played out."

        "message": "It was actually a fear of standing apart, you know, I mean, because in school, I mean, in the Hindi book, obviously, I mean, every year we would have a Premchand story in the book that we were taught and I would sort of think of it with dread, the day when that story would be read, because the teacher would point me out at once. Oh, that's her grandfather who wrote this and everyone would turn around to look at me. So it was a moment of pride for me, but it was also a moment of dread. I was a very shy child, I was a pathologically shy child and then to have everyone notice you and, you know, maybe talk about you, think about you. So all that somehow made you stand apart and it was not something that I quite enjoyed. Inside, I was very pleased that, look, my grandfather was so great that everyone knows about him and all that. But it was his very largeness, the very, you know, his greatness outside the home that made him somehow out of reach for me. I mean, of course, I read the stories. Firstly, we all went to an English medium school. So Hindi was not a language that one was reading on a regular basis. Of course, one read the textbook and all that, but I actually came to reading Hindi much later. I've also discussed this in that essay that I wrote, when my father was choosing stories for Kahani and all these whole bunch of stories would come and, you know, there were too many. So he'd asked me also to sift through some of them. So then I started reading Hindi. But Hindi literature as such, as far as Premchand went, I had not really read very much Premchand when I was a child. And also there was this feeling somehow that I'm related to him, you somehow have inhaled his writing without having read it. You know, this very peculiar feeling. So that was there too. And then slowly, of course, one became aware of the writing and I read it much later in my college years and when this Kahani thing happened and one was reading more comfortably in Hindi, I actually tutored myself to read in Hindi and to write in Hindi because, when people used to ask me, even when my collection of Hindi stories had been published, that did you write them in Roman? How did you write them in Hindi? It was always this linguistic kind of migration that was happening all the time in me. I was thinking in Hindi or sometimes in English sometimes and the reading and the writing were crossing and the whole process of translation, for instance, also began as a sort of groping for language and which language is as to find which language was I was the most comfortable in. And that process has never really changed. It's still the same, you know, I still fumble. I still fumble. I think maybe this will be better in English, that this will be better in Hindi. The knowledge of Urdu also complicated it a little bit because then there's Urdu also to be reckoned with, you know. So, I mean, it's all these, but I don't think of them as a disadvantage. Rather, they contributed to a kind of richness of voice. I think if you know other languages, they are always pushing up between, beneath the language that you're writing in. So, you get a sense of a larger sort of linguistic culture when you're writing, say, in Hindi, for instance. I like to write in Hindi because things around me are happening in Hindi, you know. I mean, everything that's taking place is happening in Hindi and Hindi also has the advantage that you can lace it with things from other languages like registers are important. For instance, if there's someone who's swearing or some vendors calling out, you know, jamun, kali hai, dilwali hai, you know, little phrases like that which are impossible to translate in English. And English already has a sort of middle-class feel to it. I mean, it seems to me that middle-class homes, only people in middle-class homes mostly know English. And that is the world that they know. So, when you write about a person walking on the street, you can't do street speak in English because the speech is actually much more colourful in the colloquial language. So, English has that disadvantage. I mean, it has sort of, the reach is not as great as the regional languages, I think. So, I mean, it's a whole world that is closed in a sense to the writer in English, I feel. I mean, of course, people are writing, but somehow, I mean, I feel that the languages can get that much better. Hindi, for instance, which is why I decided. And my father, of course, wanted me to write in Hindi. So, that was also one reason why I started writing, started thinking about writing in Hindi. But there was this whole lot of other reasons too."

And it just strikes me, as someone who's only really good at one of these languages, the other languages I understand, I speak, but English is the only one I've really thought deeply about and written in. And it just strikes me that they're all fundamentally so different from each other that there are things you can express in one that you just cannot express in the other, for example. So, is it then the case that the language that you then choose to use at a particular moment is what is appropriate for that task? Like, I imagine if you were writing, say, a business-like email to your bank, you would, of course, do it in English because you're just putting down a bunch of points. But if you want to capture the ambience around your local paanwala, you cannot capture that in English. You have to do that in Hindi. I just find that, you know, being multilingual myself, at least at a sense of speaking these languages, I feel that I'm more fortunate than people in the West who might only know one language because it's kind of richer this way. So, is that something you feel at all? And has there been like a process where you've come to peace with knowing that you have all these languages with all their different flavours for all their different uses and not have to think about, this is my language?"

And even if I'm, for instance, translating, the language that I choose to translate in will also, even if it's English, it will have different registers from what I have absorbed from my surroundings. So, all these languages compose the environment where I come from. So, I don't really sort of think of it as this one is mine and this one is not, you know. It's just something that you have grown up with and something that has become part of you. So, all these languages are part of me. English is something that I have read a lot in. Most of my reading, in fact, has been in English. This has also been an advantage in the sense that it has shaped my sensibility in a certain way. And when you read something and it also kind of hones a kind of critical register in you. So, when you read something else, for instance, in Hindi and you know the horizons that are there in Western literature, which is, you know, many other languages, which, of course, we get those in translation, but even in translation, I mean, you can get a sense of all these other worlds that exist outside India. And you sort of use that lens to look at what is around you, what you are reading, even in the languages what you are reading. So, you get a kind of critical faculty and your sensibility has got shaped by the reading. So, reading has been very important for me. I mean, reading has been one of the primary things that I have done. I mean, I've been more of a reader rather than a writer, I would say, because, I mean, I've been reading from the age of, what, five or whatever it is. I'm very young age and, you know, you sort of go through all these authors and you sort of pick up something. And, like, when I was eight years old, I think I wrote my first story in English, which was modelled on the Enid Blyton stories that I would read and it was picked up. I mean, Arvind Mehrotra and my cousins Alok and Amit, who died later, they were bringing out this magazine called Damn You. It was on the pattern of the New York little magazine called Fuck You. So, they named it Damn You. And they were all a bunch of teenagers themselves then. They were in University, Allahabad University, and they decided to sort of bring out this cyclostyle magazine. So, they used it in that because they were running out of material. Who's going to give the material to these bunch of teenagers? So, anyways, they were looking for material at that point. Of course, it became very famous later and now it's become part of this world sort of magazine thing, you know. But at that point, so my story, the early story in English was published in that, Damn You. So, my journey, in a sense, started with English. But then, of course, as it went along, there was a huge gap in my writing. It started at that age, but then I wasn't writing very much for many years. And for all these reasons that I was groping for a language and just thinking and agonising about how I was not being able to write and looking at the shape of my hands, for instance, or looking into my eyes in the mirror and thinking, oh, this looks like a writer, but I could not somehow, the writer and I could never meet. You know, it was like having a star-crossed lover. You know, you couldn't meet the writer and I were just, you know, away from each other. So, anyway, so and in that time I came to this, there was this, there's this word Shabd, which in Hindi means sound and it also means word. So, this somehow created this bridge for me. It was, it came to my, I mean, I thought about it in that way that it's a bridge between the heard and the written, you know, because it's a sound also and Shabd is a word also. So, it's the written word. So, that somehow seemed very important to me at that point. It became like, it created a kind of bridge between the heard and the written literature. I mean, there was this language of sound, I thought, which had no meaning behind it. For instance, the whistle of an engine or the sound, the chak-chak sound of the pump. I heard it in the village where I went once, or the sound of the bullock cart wheels grinding away on the road. These are all sounds and it's a kind of language of sound, but it leads to nothing else, but the language of words leads somewhere else. So, I mean, I don't know how, but it created this thing that there's something, the writing can be auditory as well as, you know, something that is written down. So, that was an important moment for me and gradually all these sort of, all this thinking about language finally led to my first story. I think I was, must have been in my early 40s, something like that, when I wrote the first story, which was in Hindi. So, that's how my writing career started and I started quite late. I'm a slow writer also, so, you know."

        "message": "So, I have like three or four questions arising from here and one of them is this, that, you know, you've spoken about how a lot of your early reading was English and it blighted and then by the age of 13 you discover Sartre and all the Russians and Catherine Mansfield and so on and so forth. Now, it strikes me that the different literatures, different world literatures evolved in different ways to be something completely different and to have different sets of values, right? Like, for example, David Rubin in The World of Premchand wrote about Premchand himself. He wrote, quote, To Premchand belongs a distinction of creating the genre of the serious short story and the serious novel as well in both Hindi and Urdu. Virtually single-handed, he lifted fiction in these languages from a quagmire of aimless romantic chronicles to a high level of realistic narrative comparable to European fiction of the time. And in both languages, he has, in addition, remained an unsurpassed master and elsewhere Sheldon Pollock kind of expressed a view that Premchand believed in social realism and he kind of looked down on what he called the feminine quality, the tenderness and emotion of contemporary Bengali literature. And even at the level at which Premchand was writing that he's, you know, and I'm taking Rubin's words for it because I haven't read enough to come to my own judgment, but even at the level at which he is writing where he has lifted it to more serious, it is still very different from the European literature that you read. Like, when I read your stories, for example, you're using details and actions a lot. So it's all show-don't-tell in a sense. Whereas if I look at a story like your translation of Premchand's Idgah, for example, the second last paragraph, when the grandmother realizes what the boy has done, and it's all tell, Premchand is just describing her emotions and the way she feels. Whereas a more modern writer, a more Western writer would show her doing something and, you know, with more economy, just through actions and a detail, bring out the same emotion in the reader. These are different values at play. And again, one doesn't want to make a value judgment on these different values. These are literatures evolving in different kinds of direction. So then the thing is that as someone whose sensibilities are shaped by Western literature, by, you know, the precision, the economy, the sort of all the values of Western literature, would you have to slip into a different mode while reading Hindi and Urdu literature?"

I mean, he has this mission and so very often he's writing at great speed and he died early and he's written so much. I don't think anyone in the world have been thinking about it. I don't think any writer in the world has probably written sort of so much. I mean, he's written short stories, he's written novels, he's written plays, he's written letters, he's written essays, he's done translations. I mean, there's a whole huge range of what he's done, you know. So it's, I mean, I'm constantly foxed by this. I mean, how can a man who is in ill health, he has poor health throughout, he dies at the age of 56, how has he managed to write so much? And he's like fired with some kind of creative instinct and he has to change things. He just believes in change and he just writes and he's seen all these things around him. So he's writing about the reality which is still pretty relevant actually because nothing much has changed in the countryside. So he's writing and he's writing across a whole range of things. You know, he's also not just a social realist, I think. There are many stories that are not socially realist stories. There's one tiny story, I don't know if Arvind and I have translated. In fact, we've been working on that project too, which is, we've done about 8 to 10 stories. We want to do some more and then maybe find a publisher for them. So in that story, it's called Darwaza in Hindi and it's about a door and a little child. This man is sitting with a little child and this child is just looking and he's chasing a bird, he's doing this, that and the door is open all the while and the child is not bothered about the door and then suddenly somebody goes past on the road and he's selling sweetmeats or something he's selling and the child wants that. And this father who he's sitting with refuses to buy him that. So he gets into this temper and he rushes to his mother but the door which has been open all this while has suddenly banged shut and the child who so far had not been bothered with the door is now suddenly very anxious that the door is shut. So he starts crying and he runs towards the door. And it's a very tiny story, it's about, I think, two pages or something like that, a very, very short story. So it's not about social realism at all. I mean, it's a very moving, very lovely story and just a moment, he's caught this moment of this child. So he's written a whole range of things, many other kinds of things also and even if he sometimes uses, he uses all sorts of devices to get his point across. So I don't know whether it would be right to call him primarily, he is primarily a social realist but there are other examples of stories that are not in that mode."

Does one look at them with different lenses? My next question was also, for example, going to be about languages which is a related question that languages also seem to have qualities of their own which lend themselves to a certain kind of expression. So it's always seemed to me that say Urdu and Bengali are very expressionistic languages whereas languages like say Japanese and Korean are much more minimalistic and you see that in the kind of literature that emerges from these languages and English is in a kind of a middle ground. So if you just do a direct translation say like a lot of translations of Tagore for example and I'm half Bengali so I know a bit of Bengali fail completely to me because they are gorgeous and beautiful in Bengali but if you just try a literal translation it simply doesn't work because it just seems too overblown and purple and all of that. So as someone who looks at literature and you know you've presumably then imbibed all the values of the Western literature that you're reading. How does one adjust one's lens? Like of course one adjusts it for context if someone like Premchand is writing in the early 20th century there's only so much you can expect, only so many influences that he was open to but apart from that how does one sort of\u2026"

So to say that these are Western values and we're trying to apply them to Indian reality that also does not work I think because Indian reality comes from a particular milieu. I mean you are sort of\u2026 so you have to look at it from sort of\u2026 you base yourself in that milieu and then look at it. So for instance a writer like Vinod Kumar Shukla, I mean where is he coming from? I mean he's writing about these small towns, very ordinary day some man is walking down the street and some other man is observing him and he thinks oh this man went this way and he again he's going this way without having come back even once you know. So there's this absurd kind of quality to it and it gives a sort of space to very lower middle class lives that are normally one would think are very cramped and living in very sort of poor circumstances whatever but I mean he adds this kind of very sort of almost playful element to the whole thing. So I mean he is one writer. I mean there are so many writers who are writing different things even in Hindi or in Bangla there'd be possibly many more and Bangla is sort of very well-developed literature. Malayalam as we have seen has so many different registers. So it's very hard to say you know that we can train a particular kind of lens you know to look at these things. You just have to adapt to what is being written and where it's set and you know you judge it on its own ground you know it happens like that I think and also this whole thing of languages being expressionist or minimalistic. Okay Japanese one can say yes it is minimalistic but for instance Urdu. I think Urdu is so difficult to translate because I think it's one of the languages in which the form is the content. I mean the way you say a thing is what it is you know it's just there's nothing else. So that form is very difficult to express in another language. It's a very light, it's a very weightless language and it has these very fine sentiments a lot of subtlety. For instance I was telling someone just the other day that there's this person I know the son of my famous I mean the writer I'm very fond of Nair Masood"

What do you sort of feel about that because Milan Kundera of course among so many others has written about how that the moment literature goes towards polemic or goes towards having a particular political purpose it ceases to be literature it ceases to be art. And in your own writing the very little of it that I've read in English though I plan to kind of read all of it soon in your own writing you show no signs of that. Your own writing show an interior life of the characters that they are and they do to me what you know I think great art does is that it awakens something in me. It captures a little bit of the human condition to use that slightly pompous cliche. So what is your conception therefore of literature like people will often ask that like on the one hand I you know tell my writing students for example that be an indiscriminate reader if you enjoy reading something read it. Don't pass value judgment that this is a pulp book and this is serious literature and all of that. But at the same time you know there is literature and there is non-literature. It's very nebulous and I find it hard to kind of define that. So what would your sense of that be like where does your sense grow like as a kid of course you're reading in this indiscriminately as all of us who grew up in India before a certain year did because books were so hard to get hold of we read everything we get. But at what stage does you begin to realize that this is something called literature and I want to do it and this is how it is different and do you feel that Premchand's sort of having this sort of social objective as part of his work do you think it affects that in some way?"

I mean he's writing at a time when firstly there is no literature in Hindi which can be called serious literature and then he's writing at a time of great social unrest he's sort of trying to you know sort of oppose the British and he's trying to you know he has his literature has a purpose he wants to do something with that so he and he wants to write a lot he wants to you know hurry through it when you forward towards his mission. So I think that changes the tone of the whole thing. So it's a different sort of literature I wouldn't say that this is not literature and that is literature because Milan Kundera or somebody in the West I mean they have grown out of the circumstances that they have experienced. So it all depends on that and also depends on what you're trying to do with it. So he has a very definite purpose and I think it's very fine literature. I mean he's uneven Premchand is very uneven some of his things are much finer than others but on the whole I would say that he writes something that for the common man in India I mean you go anywhere everybody has read something of Premchand. So for him to touch some kind of deep core in such a vast you know part of Indian society at any rate so there has to be something in it. It can't just be this is not literature there's something else that is finer. This I mean this is a much later thing when you talk of Kundera or talk of the writers of the West this is a later thing. This whole development in this thing of writing how does it take place? I mean the writing itself becomes much more dense you're spending more time over it you're sort of thinking about things in a different way. So it comes from there I think it's hard to compare the two. I mean there's you know the situation is completely different."

I have no hopes of a top-down interventions working or even the education system necessarily changing this I'm more interested in how things happen in a bottom-up way through the culture and all that and there's an interesting sort of anecdote you mentioned in your essay in the Premchand book where you talk about how you went to the village where he was born for his 125th anniversary in 2006 and while you were waiting for things to happen and all of that you notice that there were so many people sitting around everywhere you know under shelter not under shelter sitting on the ground just waiting for this whole thing to happen and at that point you're musing is that okay I know why I am here but why are these people here and you pointed out how some of them obviously many of them must be Premchand readers and some of them could in fact be characters out of his stories as you said and that struck me is again something interesting to explore because I think there was a time in our culture where individual figures could play that kind of a very profound part in people's lives where people are reading a writer in this case Premchand and finding so much to identify with that you know it becomes something that is important for them and what has happened in modern times I think and tell me what you feel about this is that in my view what has happened is that this kind of thing is becoming less and less possible in the sense that one there is a lot more art and many more artists which is a good thing but also whatever experiences we are having a very fragmented in a sense so it won't just be one writer who moves me with his five books it will be many many writers whose snippets I'll read on Instagram or Facebook or whatever which will have an effect on me and the whole sort of thing kind of gets broken down leading me to wonder whether another Premchand is even possible today or maybe another Premchand is possible in a new medium like vlogs or you know Instagram for example I mean what would an Instagram Premchand look like I can't imagine maybe like the humans of New York blog that took off a few years ago but I'm just thinking aloud so what's your thought on the changing nature of the role that writers play within a culture or I'll say in a general sense I'll say artists or creators whatever term you would like to use the role that they play within a culture and is that diminishing partly because there is less dullness people have so much to do in their lives they don't have to read it's no longer the one entertaining thing that there is for them there is so much else to do what's your sense of this"
