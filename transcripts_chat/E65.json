He said the internet is so amazing, you can just go to this site called Yahoo and search for say Van Morrison, and it will display every single page about Van Morrison. I said, Wow, that's so cool. I love Van Morrison. At that time, if you told me all the ways in which the internet was going to change our lives in the next 25 years, I would have said, No way, that's science fiction. But much of the science fiction of that time is everyday banal reality today. I often think that I'm so lucky to live in these amazing times, all the information in the world at my fingertips. And within a few seconds, I can listen to any song ever recorded, download most of the books that exist and watch any film that I want to. I can connect to my friends around the world and make new ones. This is the most empowering tool in human history. But here's one question."

There are potentially no geographical boundaries on the internet. Something that I create or I write can be read by anyone else in the world and vice versa. And we've many of us have grown up with this space, right? So there is, there's a sense that we belong to the internet. And we feel quite often we feel more at home on the internet and people we meet of the internet. You know, growing up when I first started meeting friends off the internet, my, I had my uncle tell me to be careful, etc. and, and text message SMS at that point in time about where I am and who I'm meeting and all of that stuff. We've sort of outgrown that phase now and, you know, today if you land in any country in the world, you probably have people you want to meet or you already know because you've interacted with them on the internet around things that are common. So in that sense, the internet is this global public commons that unites the world. And what's been happening over the last five or six years is that there is this massive, and this is a political thing, there's a massive shift in the concentration of power on the internet and the web seems to be shrinking. And so, you know, our access points to the broader internet are getting more limited and more controlled. And what's also happening is that for the new people who are coming online, for most of them, the browser is just an app on the device. And so therefore, they don't really necessarily get to, you know, experience that, that, you know, some silly blog somewhere that someone's written, because how will they find out that this exists? They don't know what a URL is, they may not know how to type a URL, the URLs are maybe not in their language. And so there is a shift in the way how we access the internet."

And you know, one of the things that came up recently in India was that the TRAI, which is the Indian telecom regulator, could not launch an SMS spam app on the iPhone, because Apple wouldn't allow certain permissions. So if you think about it, Apple is a regulator that's regulating the Indian telecom regulator. And that's a bizarre situation to be in. So there's, and therefore, the TRAI started pushing back.

Now I get that all the big players are getting much, much bigger, that more people's first exposure to the internet is say through a Facebook, or, you know, through a Google then, instead of just a wild world wide web of sites that we had out there, but at the same time, it's still open, anyone can go out there and start anything, start their own site, start their own app, start their own platform, they might not get much traction, because the way people filter content has changed. And that's kind of been, you know, these large companies are dominating that filtering process where people discover content and so on and so forth."

And how, for example, filter bubbles impacting our discovery of things. If you look at, let's say, Google search versus discovering something on Facebook, Google search is largely intent based, but I'll take you back to almost 10 years ago, when news cops started complaining about Google search, because Google's algorithm, which is a black box, was defining how news cops content was being consumed. And so we're back to that same battle here. But now it's not just a battle on Google search, but it's also around Facebook and the filter bubbles and the access to content there. So I think another discussion that's probably going to be had, and we're not having it yet, is the neutrality of algorithms, and who controls what the algorithms show us from that perspective, because, you know, there was one experiment, which Facebook did in, I think, 2012, where they started changing the newsfeed to make you happy, to make you happy and sad. And so, you know, is it really neutral is the question? And do we have multiple options in terms of algorithms as well? These are discussions that are going to happen because they change the shape, not just the way we consume content, but they shape how we view the world, they can shape democracies. And I'd like to, you know, go back to where this battle actually started. And so I kind of like to imagine Facebook as a country, and the same way Google as a country and Amazon as a country. And there is this turf war and this land grab that's taking place across the board. So whether you look at, let's say, Amazon doing AWS, which is their hosting service, Google doing Google Cloud. So, you know, different companies are now looking at various industries, subsegments to get into, to get more information and more control in that space. Everyone wants to do commerce as well. And everyone wants to do devices as well. A voice is where the real battle is happening right now in terms of Google Home versus, you know, the Amazon Echo. You might have noticed recently, there was this battle around YouTube being removed,"

Like, when you talk about the algorithm that Facebook would have to make people happy and sad, that yes, when I read about it, it makes me angry that damn, I'm being manipulated and that makes me pissed off.

And the power of the platform is always going to be greater than the power of the creator. One of the things you have to remember about all all platforms is that they're in the business of maximizing fragmentation, and monetizing the aggregation, right? So when they maximize fragmentation, and we've seen so I did some research on the YouTube ecosystem. And you know, when YouTube initially started, every creator was really, really happy because they got special attention from YouTube and YouTube guys would come and teach them about how to do better and better. And you know, initially, they made a lot of money. As more and more creators started coming on, they started getting less help. And they started making less money. And so therefore, as fragmentation increases, it's the aggregator that holds all the power. And unfortunately, the way markets work is that there is only space for a few large aggregators. And and the network effects that come in really inhibit competition. And therefore, you've seen that with Facebook, for example, there's literally no competition, the social networking space in case of I mean, in case of Amazon, India still has competition in case of Flipkart. But even the and I don't quite agree with them. But they've also been complaining about capital dumping, because they realize now this is a battle about deeper pockets.

So what I was originally arguing, and I see the nuance that you added to that what I was originally arguing was that as long as there is competition, you can sell your content to Netflix or Amazon or blah, blah, blah. What you're saying, though, is that say you look at Amazon, they are basically the only bookseller in town, there's no other business network effects kick in. So if a publisher fights with them or doesn't agree to their terms, they don't have a choice. You have a similar kind of monopoly in terms of uploading videos. If you want to make your own home videos and monetize them, and so on, you basically don't have a choice. You have to go to YouTube. So Mike, but at the same time, having said this, it seems problematic to go to a private party like an Amazon or YouTube in these instances, and try to regulate them. And especially when that regulation is done by government, it will always the process will always be corrupted, and there will always be unintended consequences that are also harmful plus it's coercion."

I'll tell you where I agree with you and where I disagree with you, where I agree with you is that when we used to speak of net neutrality earlier, and I might have had this discussion with Nikhil and I committed from a property rights perspective, and the question I would ask is who owns the spectrum, the government of India owns the spectrum. And therefore, whether they should own the spectrum or not is a separate argument. But given that they own the spectrum, they have a right to license it out under whatever terms they want. And when the net neutrality issue broke up, I actually went and looked at their existing contract with telecom providers, which allows them to change the terms in between, as Nikhil and gang were arguing for, right, and to impose these conditions. So coming at it from property rights, I get that, right.

        "message": "That's it's tough. Not really, actually, I mean, look, the conversation is now changing around the fact that every single entity that has over a billion users is being treated as something called a behemoth. And those entities now have the power, not just to, you know, impact creators, but also to shape democracy. And this is exactly why governments are now becoming a lot more conscious of the power of these platforms. Like, I go back to the idea of Facebook as a country. You know, when Zuck visits, he has these are all diplomatic visits, effectively, there's a certain minutes, some talking points that are already defined with the Prime Minister with different ministers. So if you just zoom out and think of Facebook as a country in a virtual world, what you will see is that they have a team that looks at the government policy with the government as a stakeholder. If you're running a page on Facebook, you're effectively, that's essentially the Ministry of Commerce. If you think about it, that looks at those relationships. Their task is to encourage usage of the platform, but also because Facebook's, it's a business, is also to ensure that there is enough monetization that comes in. So there are significant controls that it is able to exert by virtue of its scale and and its network effects. And under those circumstances, I think regulation is bound to happen, because there are negative consequences that are also coming out of it, which are impacting physical countries. So let's look at a couple of them that are that are happening, right. So let's look at the impact of fake news, for example. The US election is very clear that, you know, they had very few advertising controls that allowed the marketing and very tiny, like granular segmentation in terms of targeting individuals with content that they felt would impact the way they vote. I mean, there were also, there are also instances where fake sites have been created, and they're saying you don't need to go and vote. You can just go click here and vote on the website, right. Now, these are real consequences for democracies. And you need controls in place. In the same way, when you look at it, let's take Uber as an example, and the rape case in Delhi. Right. Now, Uber treats itself purely as a platform saying that we are helping discovery of cabs. And they claim to not be accountable for the behavior of the drivers because they're a pure marketplace. But the fact is that they are responsible because they're selecting who gets on the platform, and they need to do their own due diligence. There's another debate when it's coming to around rights of drivers as either employees versus, you know, or just being merchants on Uber's platform. And so, you know, there is what's happening right now, is that there's a gap between the responsibility and the accountability of these platforms. And that exists today because of something called intermediary liability protections. That means that an intermediary, like an ISP, like a Facebook, an Amazon or an Uber, is not liable for the actions of the entities on it. And we had our own case in India around that with essentially Bazi.com, where Avneesh Bajaj was arrested because someone put up a porn CD on sale on Bazi.com. It later became eBay, India. But we brought in those protections as well in India to protect the platforms which are merely mean marketplaces for exchange, right? Now, because of the scale of a lot of these platforms and the impact that they're having, and how they impact even merchants and the power that they have over them, and the fact that they can shape consumer behavior now, countries are looking at regulating them, because they are responsible for some of this behavior of not, let's say, clamping down on fake news, but they're not held accountable because they have these protections. So why I'm worried about the open internet going forward is that these intermediary liability protections, which I support, look like they're going to get chipped away at bit by bit by"

So, so let's go back to the concentration of power and what that means, because what's happened since 2012-2013 is that these large platforms have become substantially large. So between Tencent, Baidu, Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, the world's essentially being carved out amongst these players. Now there's competition that's taking place between them, but each of them has a disproportionate amount of ability to influence the future of countries and indeed the future of the internet. So I think, so what I'm worried about is like, I'm someone who started a site almost 10 years ago with very little money, and now we've been around for 10 years, our ability to do, so for example, advertising as a revenue source has been shrinking substantially because all of it is being aggregated by Facebook and Google. Now this is legitimately one market power, the way I see it. But it's also inhibiting competition. And so therefore, antitrust can't quite kick in because, one, there is no indication of clear harm, but also there is no clear indication that these guys are doing something to inhibit"

Because I'm also someone who wants limited government action and all of this, right? Because I don't want us to lose intermediary liability protections. You know, even if you think about it, net neutrality was exactly that battle, that the ISPs should not shape our internet experience, because they have exclusive access, or exclusive ability to control how we access the internet. And there was a great deal of cartelization in India, which now has been affected, or no longer exists because Jio came in. But I think the best analogy that I heard for ISPs, and I think we need to look at other platforms from that perspective as well, is to think of them as stock exchanges. So like, if a stock exchange starts prioritizing a particular trade, it reduces trust in that stock exchange. In the same way, if an ISP starts prioritizing one source of data versus another, makes it cheaper for you to access one particular source of, let's say, videos versus another, they're shaping your experience, and that reduces trust in the ISP itself. Now, in an open free market situation, you would have a million other ISPs to go to. But that doesn't happen because spectrum is limited, right of way access is limited. We don't have unbundling of the last mile in India. And therefore, these are the controllers of our access in a sense. So let's say if you think about from free speech perspective, you and I are talking face to face. But when we're talking over the internet, there are multiple layers that come in. So one is the it starts with the device, then it goes to the network, which is the ISP, then there are submarine cable providers, then there are platforms to which that data goes. Then again, the same exercise towards the person who's receiving it, right. So all of these players in the middle have the potential for changing how we communicate, whether we're able to speak to each other or not."

And I mean, I'm someone who supports anonymity because it gives vulnerable communities a voice. But the same anonymity has also been used, for example, by ISIS handles, right? So there's no right answer to this. We have to find a balance. Because somewhere we have to look at from a harms regulation perspective. So the other part of this entire platform battle that's going on is around data protection and privacy. Because the amount of data that they're collecting, that gives them the ability to, again, create more filter bubbles, target people better, allow advertisers to target people more sharply and yet not control what kind of communication advertising is going there. Because it's going at such a large scale, it's impossible for them to monitor as well. So we've got this beast that we're dealing with right now.

So if you give government the power to regulate Facebook, then assume that if you're a left liberal, assume that Yogi Adityanath will be prime minister and he'll be running, he'll be setting that regulation. And if you are more culturally oriented and not anti-national, then assume that Sonia Gandhi will be somehow in charge and running.

Similarly, you would have small groups of people with absolutely no voice like you and me who would want competition and want markets to prevail. Similarly, you would have different government bodies operating in their own silos, who would want to explore opportunities for rent seeking.

So you decided to make it a mass movement?

So historically what's happened with the TRI is that, you know, the industry guys, the lobbyists for mobile operators, etc, go and visit them twice a week. They visit different people. They are very organized in terms of they know who to talk to, what about, etc, etc. So if you have someone at a regulator who doesn't necessarily have much information but is not very tech savvy, then these people become a source of that knowledge for them. And of course they do want counterpoints because they want to be neutral in this entire process. They want to be fair in this entire process. But there aren't enough players on the other side that come and speak to them. There's also a credibility issue. So for example, who am I to go and speak, even though I have an opportunity? Every single individual in this country, every citizen can go and speak at a TRI event, at a TRI open house and voice their views on a particular issue. What we did was we ensured that there was enough of a collective voice for citizens in that particular situation because we were battling all the mobile operators which have a tremendous amount of power which the TRI had a great deal of affinity for because they instigated this entire consultation process. We had politicians who really did not have a clue about what net utility is in the beginning and I can't really blame them because most people in this country did not understand what it is about. We had businesses who again didn't have too much of a clue but there was a clear benefit for them in terms of at least the larger players for taking ownership of internet access to their own benefit. So you had the operators which would enable this, you had the businesses that would benefit from it and so utility had no voice in this entire debate and I got this feeling on two particular occasions. One was the TRI open discussion, they had a discussion with industry stakeholders invited on creating a revenue share model between online content creators and service providers and the ISPs. So they wanted a revenue share so if you have advertising running on your site the ISPs would get a revenue share of that advertising. So when I saw that TRI seemed to be open to this discussion that was a warning signal and it felt very lonely in that room to be honest even though there were a few other people who spoke up for net utility but I actually at one point in time stood up and pointed towards the free speech argument saying do you realize what you're trying to do over here and how it's going to impact people and their communication and that this is going to get a constitutional challenge. And the TRI backed off a bit, they're like you know we're just discussing stuff here but really there was too much power in that room going against us. So the idea behind the net utility campaign was that votes beat money and so we went out and got the votes and we so we had we had to fight off fairly significant stakeholders. I don't know if I've answered your question really."

But the thing was that together because we kept debating some of these things we learned along the way. If I didn't have an answer someone else came up with an answer. We crowdsourced a lot of our learning from that perspective and the idea was to give people ownership of this movement.

Because our campaign was around asking MPs to file 190 notices for discussions on Aadhaar in Parliament. And there were over 100 questions asked about Aadhaar in that session alone, which is the largest that I've seen so far. So I think that MPs, if citizens reach out to them, they do react, they do respond. It's just that historically no one responds to them. I mean during the Net Neutrality campaign, some of the MPs got 10s and 15,000 emails from citizens. These are MPs who typically would get 5 or 10 maybe in a month or something like that. When you get that kind of volume, they know that people want to be heard. So they are our representatives.
