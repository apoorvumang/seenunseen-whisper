My guests in today's episode are Ruben Abraham and Pritika Hengurani from the IDFC Institute, a think tank that focuses not just on ideas, but also on ways and means to turn their ideas into reality given the state of the political economy. One of the areas in which the IDFC Institute has great expertise is cities and urban planning. And I invited Ruben and Pritika to come on the show when I read an article by them in Bloomberg, linked on the episode page for this show, about why India is more urban than we think and why that distinction matters enormously. It's a fascinating subject, but before I take you over to our conversation, a quick commercial break. Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings by the artists you like hanging on your walls? Well, worry no more. Head on over to IndianColors.com.

And the reason we say think-do tank is because most think tanks and academic institutions tend to restrict itself to asking what questions and why questions without getting into the how of it. And most public policy interventions actually get stuck on the how of it because the how is where political economy gets involved. So, we're actually involved in what we sort of broadly sort of define as ideate, innovate, implement, institutionalize. Those are the four stages of public policy as we see it. So, we obviously have some deep sectoral knowledge as well, but I think you can actually apply this principle no matter what realm of public policy you look at. So, that's broadly speaking the remit of what we do."

And so, unlike other think tanks, you actually want to make a difference. I think most think tanks would like to make a difference. I think the problem is that in general people who are technically trained, therefore have a bias towards thinking that a solution is also technical. Right. Keep in mind, I had exactly the same bias, right? So, when you look at a problem closely enough that you realize that the technical piece is important, obviously you can't do anything without the idea in the first place. But once you have that, and specifically in public policy, you've got to see it through. You can't leave that to someone else."

And I think what ends up happening is you have generations of planners that think of cities as sort of a top down. So not only take a top down approach to cities, but also think of markets as something you can plan and you can't. And so I think that's definitely, you know, something that I took away from the program. The two people I think that influenced me the most is Alain Berto, who's at NYU and Vimal Patel, who's done an incredible job of planning and economics in India. And who's joining you guys in ideas.

Today, more than half the global population is urban and by 2050, the proportion will rise to three quarters. Stop quote. Why has this move towards urbanism happened?

And those two sets of economies basically allow you to sort of build job markets, labor markets specifically. And I think the reason why people generally move to cities, and I think this is perhaps sort of Alain Berto's great contribution is to define cities as labor markets. And these are not the creatures of an architect's imagination, so to speak, right? I mean, so yes, people like us perhaps have the luxury of saying, you know, we live in Mumbai for X or Y reason. But the primary reason why most people who have moved to Bombay have moved here is purely to find a job. And that's true of most cities around the world. So, in effect, the cities are just labor markets. So, you effectively move to where the jobs are. Equally, there's another transitional phase that has happened over the last 200 years, which is the transition towards through industrialization through to service economies, right? I mean, so we were primarily an agricultural society, no matter where in the world you look. And then you have industrial society. So, surplus labor comes out of agriculture. They need to be employed somewhere. That's the industrialization process. And then as productivity goes up in the industrial sector, you start moving into the service sector, right? So, that's the process by which it happens. So, the question is, what is the location of industrialization and what is the location of the service economy? And those generally tend to be cities because you actually start agglomerating people."

So, for example, here you have, say, the city of Mumbai, where people are coming because of the economic networks here. There are all kinds of jobs, no matter what your skills are, you can specialize and so on and so forth. But at the same time, you have a lot of regulations which put restraints on this kind of movement and cohabiting together. For example, we were talking about FSI before this episode and I've done an episode on that earlier with Alex Tabarrok while he was with you guys in Mumbai. So, is that a conflict which somehow needs to be sorted out between governance and the natural spontaneous order which brings people to cities?"

So, you know, when it's a manufacturing or, you know, hub, you need a very different built form than when it's a services hub. So, allowing for higher FSI as your economic base changes, putting in more mass public transit as you have people, more people coming to work versus people being able to drive in is very important. And so I think when we don't allow planning to evolve, we end up stifling the economic base of our cities."

I had an episode on this with Alex Tabarrok, which will be linked from this episode page, which had the title of Reclaim the Sky, where Alex eloquently said that why should we reclaim the sea? And, you know, Mumbai can't, you know, expand much in terms of its geography. We should reclaim the sky and kind of expand upwards. And that's just sort of one example of the kind of regulations which hamper the natural movements of cities. But to this, critics would say that you can't just have anarchy and people going wherever and you need to somehow control all of that. How do you respond to that?"

        "message": "So you do. You cannot have. So FSI, floor space index, is basically a ratio that defines how much floor space you can build as a ratio of your plot area. So it's a technical term and it takes into account things like the location of the plot. It could take into account the soil quality, accessibility. So at a given point in time, a certain plot may have certain features and so can only support, you know, so many people. What we forget is that the carrying capacity of a plot can be enhanced. So if an area is serviced by a road, for instance, instead of the road, you can put in place BRT or you can put in a metro. And so that same plot becomes accessible to so many more people. Now, there is a cap on how much a given plot can take, but then it's for planners to tweak those over time. And so I completely understand why people balk at, you know, higher FSI and lower PRL, because all you think is I'm constantly stuck in a traffic jam. It's hard to walk or to get anywhere. You know, how are we going to have taller buildings with the given transit? And I think what's key that city governments do is enhance carrying capacity at the same time that they allow the area to densify. The other thing that often gets conflated is density of people and density of space. So if you look at the older parts of Bombay, they were built, you know, to a certain height as the areas became more desirable. The amount of built space didn't change. But because more people wanted to live there, they just subdivided and you had more people living in the same amount of space. If you instead recognize that there is demand for an area, allow the buildings to redevelop, you know, taller, more space, you will actually get the same number of people in slightly more space. It, you know, has implications for affordability as well. If you think of land prices as a constraint, the best way to sort of lessen that constraint is to divide the land plot by larger number of units. And so I think the sort of reflexive response to FSI doesn't take into account a large number of these factors."

        "message": "I think there's also an interesting sort of underlying question here, which sits at the sort of heart of public policy, which is how much regulation is enough regulation? Right. I mean, and the fact is, none of us really know how much regulation is enough regulation. Or even how much regulation is too much regulation. It's too much regulation. Right. So I think in the urban context, I think the sort of gold standard is the Commissioner's plan for New York City. That was really a thought experiment that was carried out in 1811, where the state government of New York basically commissioned, Governor Morris basically commissioned these three people to do a thought exercise. And the scenario they were planning was, so New York at that point has, is mostly concentrated in the tip of New York, around Wall Street. And it has approximately 25,000 people. So they basically said, let's do a 200 year planning exercise where the population of the city will actually go from 25,000 to a million. Now, let's plan for it. This plan is the street grid of New York. Right. So keep in mind that nothing's built. It's just a statutory map that's basically been put into place, which says, if New York grows, if the economic activity in New York goes up and therefore people move here, etc. This is the way the city will actually grow. So if you look at the underlying base map, for instance, you won't see Central Park, but Central Park is like a Lego block. It's literally been sort of placed on top of the street grid. So the width of the roads, the size of all of this was determined in 1811. But they didn't then go on to basically say, you will have X kind of industry here and Y kind of industry there. They said nothing of the sort. They simply said, if the city grows, here's how the city will grow. And there's an underlying street grid that basically allows for this growth of the city. And funnily enough, like, you know, some of the old Indian cities are actually built on street grids."

So New York used to be in garments, and then garments just disappeared. You need to allow the city to actually move from one industry to the other. So anything that prevents the dynamism involved in the ability of a city to adapt to changing conditions, to me is too much regulation. Such as? So let's take the FSI of Bombay. Right? Just keeping a strict 1.3 all over the city of Bombay, to me, it's just, it's a static."

Which then allows for the city to evolve based on how the market dynamics work. So it's not like I am suggesting that this is the only way that the city will evolve. I'm saying, I don't know.

And so you just need to go on Google Maps and like zoom into a place like Omaha in Nebraska and you'll see it's on a grid. And this is all stuff that was done ages ago. So Barcelona is on a grid. I mean, there's any number of cities globally that are on a grid. I think a lot of this really comes from if your starting point is that cities matter and we need to plan for it, as opposed to this is a terrible thing. You know, let's try to prevent people from coming in. I think your starting point matters. And so if your starting point is this is a good thing, we need to encourage it and we need to find ways to accommodate for it.

And how have Indian cities like, you know, Bombay, Delhi, whichever, traditionally evolved and how have planners intersected with that in terms of the mindset that they bring to what cities are?"

So, you know, we just talked about slums. I mean, slums are really failing to appreciate the fact that people are moving to the city and what you need then is more formal sector housing. So what a lot of Indian cities have done, or industrial policy did to some extent, was to say, look, you know, cities are growing. You know, we can't control population. We aren't able to provide amenities. And so there was incentives for manufacturing to, or mandates rather, for manufacturing and universities to locate outside of cities. I think there's constantly, and this comes from the master planning approach, right, that we will spread development more evenly across the region, or we will not allow for densification. And so, you know, mandate that things spread out more evenly."

I think one other way to sort of think about it is, I mean, and this may be controversial, but urban planners tend to think of cities the way they would think of buildings, right? Because a lot of them sort of come from this sort of architectural background. A building is a static concept, right? You can plan a building. To then apply that mindset to something that is fundamentally a dynamic, ever evolving organism, right? And then to apply these principles, I think it's just a very bad idea. And I think that's typically what has happened. If you look across the universe of planners who understand the underlying market economics of why people move and live in cities, I'd say that's a very, very small number in the world. That's a very small number in India."

Each week, they sit down with some very cool guests and have an unfiltered conversation about their dating habits, awkward experiences and heartbreaks. Tune in to hear them attempting therapy on each other. On the first episode, we have comedian Urooj Ashfaq discussing rejection. On Cyrus Says, Cyrus is joined by lawyer couple YP and Abbas Singh. They discuss what it takes to stand up to authority in court, corruption in India and how the MeToo movement has affected court cases. Also check out the hilarious Valentine's Day special of Cyrus Says where he was joined by Ayesha, his wife, Kunal Vijaykar and me. The four of us try to discuss and dissect romance really, really badly. On Simplified, the trio is joined by Meghnad and Shreyas Manohar. They discuss why learning school civics can help us understand today's political scenario and about their new podcast How to Citizen. On The Habit Coach, Ashton talks about the importance of substituting your regular table salt with Himalayan pink salt. On Crocs Tales, we have a month-long Valentine's special.

Stop quote. Explain that. Why is there a dispute over what is urban and how much of India is urban and why does it matter?"

        "message": "There's a dispute because the dispute arises from the definition that we use. So there's two ways in which we define urban in India. One is the statutory definition. So that just means that every state government sets its own threshold and defines what's urban and what's rural. And there's, you know, states use widely differing criteria. And once a state government recognizes an area as urban, it gets an urban municipal administration. The second definition is a census definition. Now, the definition changes over time, but the difference is that it's a uniform three part definition that's applied to the whole country. So it has a population cut off. It has a density cut off. And then what's interesting is it has an occupation criteria, which is that 75 percent of the male workforce needs to be non-agricultural activities. Now, this is not a criteria that's used widely across the world. And so our colleagues at IDFC Institute ran an exercise to say, so if you add by the statutory definition, India is 26 percent urban. With the census definition, India is 31 percent urban. Now, it looks like you're quibbling over 5 percent, but 5 percent in the Indian context is 55 million people, which is the population of South Korea. And so essentially what you have is 55 million people who live in dense urban environments, as acknowledged by the census, but don't have a local authority that's required to provide them with the basic services that you need with dense urban living. So things like sewerage lines, fire safety, building regulations. So that's just between those two, there's a problem. But then the larger question is, OK, you know, this is a definition we've chosen, but what does everybody else in the world do? And what if we use some of their criteria? So our colleagues ran an exercise to apply to simple population thresholds that, you know, Mexico, Ghana and a bunch of other countries use. And you find that when you apply different criteria, India could be anywhere from 47 to 65 percent urban. And so then the broader question is not what's the precise definition you should use, but is just the definition we've picked, is that obscuring the reality in front of us? And so the other piece of work we've done is using satellite data. And so satellite data is interesting because when you use administrative data, you're constantly measuring within a fixed administrative unit. So you could have two administrative units that are side by side individually, they fall below your thresholds, but the fact that they're side by side means taken together, they're actually an urban unit. And so, you know, when we use satellite data, we find these, you know, dense corridors growing out of cities that really should be considered part of the larger agglomeration, but aren't. And the reason that we're concerned is goes to what Ruben was talking about before, which is a failure to anticipate this means that these areas then develop and densify in the absence of any regulation, and then retrofitting these areas become extremely difficult."

So what happens is if you have a bunch of places that are urban like, right, I mean, if you just simply use other criteria, but because they are governed by a village administrative unit, actually doesn't have access to these services. So once you actually get into these numbers, you'll actually see absurdities all over the place, right? I mean, so I'll give you a small example of this. We discovered that there's a there's an area in Kerala in Munnar called Kannandevan Hills, which is a panchayat and the population of Kannandevan Hills is 55,000. And it's a panchayat in which world is 55,000 people actually a village. It's an absurd starting point. Now, in that particular instance, it's Munnar, it's the Tata T estates, I'm guessing. So therefore, there is private provision of services, right? Tata is probably providing all of those services. But imagine the same thing is happening in UP, in Maharashtra, etc. without the backup being provided by a private provider. I think that's when you begin to run into serious problems. I think this policy is really messing with people who are actually both moving to and living in urban like areas. But the governance mechanisms refuse to acknowledge them as such. And so part of this, I mean, I think the there's another sort of thing to ask here, which is a lot of these definition, this is globally, right? I mean, they're political, for sure. But a lot of these things were put into place at a very different time, right? When the country was a lot more rural, etc, etc. And things have moved on. And why are we still caught with definitions that were put into place in the 1950s and 1960s? By the way, this is equally true in the United States, right? I mean, where rural areas actually have inordinate power over places where people actually live. So it's this inability to actually adapt, which again, is creating this problem."

If there's enough demand, you get those services. But what seems to be happening here is that that link is broken between power and accountability.

And can we create those same conditions on this side of the border? Was really the question he was asking. And then when you try these reforms, I do not want to go try it in a Beijing or a Shanghai where there's a vast number of installed DOS machines, right? Or Nseekers. I'm going to try it in a place where basically there's nothing, right? Or people are using typewriters."

Prices are the controlling mechanism, a coordinating mechanism, rather. You have foreign investment, a whole bunch of things like that, which just doesn't exist in China. So what he really does is he then realizes that Shenzhen, which at that point of time is just a fishing town, and no one's ever heard of Shenzhen, but it was a jumping off point to Hong Kong. And he realizes that this is a place where I'm going to run a controlled experiment. And it's a special zone is what he calls it. He runs this controlled experiment in Shenzhen where they start putting in reforms, market reforms, really start in Shenzhen. Now, there's one other thing to clarify here, which is that they were not special economic zones. They were special zones. And this is actually the intra-party conflict between Chen Yun and Deng Xiaoping that played out here. So the conservative opposition, their point was, if you let them tinker with the market and economics, it will soon lead to experimentation in the political side and the party will lose its dominance. So Deng Xiaoping, to sort of accede to that particular criticism, inserted the word economic to indicate to the powers that be at the local area that you can experiment, but do not let it come into the political system because the Communist Party wants to retain control. And then Shenzhen happens. We know the story of Shenzhen. In 1981, the place has a per capita GDP of $700. Today, the per capita GDP is $27,000. I mean, it's probably the greatest sort of increase in sort of human development, if you will, in recorded history. I think it's just astounding what happened in Shenzhen. But more importantly, the reforms begin to spread out from Shenzhen. I mean, more zones are opened up, etc. Then Deng Xiaoping does that famous southern tour where the Shanghai area and a bunch of other existing cities complain about the fact that Shenzhen has actually been allowed to power ahead of Shanghai. So they want the same set of reforms. And that's how Pudong is set up as a sort of special zone. And then Pudong drives a very large part of what happens in the Shanghai area and so on and so forth. So what I'm trying to say here is, these are just reform experiments, right? And you want to really try these experiments in ways that don't upset the political equilibrium elsewhere, but allows you to tinker. And if these are successful, they will drive reform because there will be demand for it from other places."

So saying, so, you know, every neighborhood needs a park is fine, but every house needs a certain amount of green space. So maybe not in a city like Bombay, but a tier two city. Actually, then means that instead of going up, you spread further and further out. So, A, not only are you consuming more land, but to then traverse that piece of land in an efficient manner, you need more kilometers of roads, you know, metros at some point of sewage lines. And so essentially, by spreading out, you're much less green. So Ed Glaser and Matthew Kahn have done fantastic work. Looking at American cities and suburbs, it's called green cities, brown suburbs is a great piece. Finding the dense urban areas actually much more green than sprawling suburbs.

I mean, and it's happening in much shorter timeframes, because of the advent of technology and so on and so forth. So where earlier societies had 100 years to deal with a certain kind of change, it's been compressed into 10-15 year timeframes. So what is going on, in my opinion, is just basically the lack of coping mechanisms in people. So rather than denigrate them as racists and whatever else, and I don't know, maybe they're racist, but to assume that they're racist because they lack the coping skills is actually, I think, a fatal flaw. It's a fatal conceit even of the elites to basically just assume that lack of coping mechanisms equals something really bad. I guarantee you, if the same elites are put into the same pressure cooker, they would not have the coping skills either. I mean, it's just that they don't subject themselves to that."

Let's take a simple example of this, which is, why do you need a ministry for rural development and a ministry for urban development?

Even if we dislike cities, you're not going to stop people from coming into cities. There are any number of governments anywhere in the world, the Chinese government tried the hookah system, we tried FSI limitations, we tried all, nothing stops people from coming. Right? So you're literally King Canute telling the waves to go back. It's not going to work. So one way of approaching it is doesn't really matter because people will move into cities anyways and it'll create its own demand eventually, blah, blah, blah. The other way to say it is basically say, look, this is inevitable. It's going to happen. It's happened everywhere in the world. Let's plan for it. The stopping of this tough business will only lead to bad outcomes. So for instance, take FSI, right? I mean, if you restrict the floor space, you'll get slums. You'll just get very bad outcomes if you do things like that. So being able to, as I said, aware of it, celebrate it, prepare for it. Right? And the preparation also has to include building the capacities that are required to prepare for it. I mean, to deal with it as what you really need is you need urban management. You need a cadre of urban managers to now start emerging who know how to run a city. We don't have any of that stuff. There's no urban management schools anywhere. So that cadre needs to evolve for sure. Yeah, I think between the three things that are outlined and creating the capacities that are required to manage the process is probably what I would ask.

If people are interested in the practical application, because I completely understand. You said, what's the reaction to our piece? The piece that I'm actually worried about is the piece that we're going to write on FSI, where I fully anticipate people calling saying, what are you recommending? So the practical application of this is if you look at what Bimal Patel has done in Ahmedabad, and he's worked with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and the Urban Development Authority to do the new development plan for Ahmedabad. It perfectly marries a lot of the concepts we're talking about. Leaving room for dynamism, reshaping both city peripheries and redeveloping incrementally the inner core of cities. I think the work that they've done there is fantastic."

        "message": "Yeah. And if listeners want a more sort of general introduction to the ideas that were discussed in the book, definitely Triumph of the City at Glaser is an excellent place to start. And it has enough references that you can then follow and so on and so forth. But yes, I mean, I just go back to Bertrand's book. I mean, remember, this is a man who started his career with Le Corbusier in Chandigarh. My God, that's like a full circle. Did you know Meenu Masani started as a socialist? Yeah, I mean, a lot of people have. The good news is that, you know, as Alon himself will say, he's a reform planner."

You need to pick the right beans, blend them in the right proportion, roast them to perfection and slow brew at the right temperature to get the perfect cup, which is exactly like great conversations as well. You need to track down the most interesting minds, get them into their zone and settle down for an unhurried, unscripted chat. And coffee for me is always, always, always best enjoyed with friends. I'm Karthik Nagarajan and do share my table as I meet some of the most interesting people I know and sit them down for a strong cup of coffee and an even stronger conversation. Join me every Wednesday for a freshly brewed episode. This is not Frappe. This is the Filter Coffee Podcast. This is the podcast where all the borders and lines that have been drawn over decades has been swept away by this lovely thing called the internet. Where I show you we don't dwell on just the stuff that is now, but rather the wider stuff about advertising, media, content and the whole goddamn circus surrounding it. Tune in every Tuesday for a weekly unboxing of the mystery box we used to call advertising. I'm Varun Duggirala, co-founder and content chief at The Glitch and this is my new podcast, Advertising is Dead."
