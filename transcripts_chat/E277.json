But I am shaped less by geography than I would have been a century or two ago. The biggest influences in my early years were the books I read and the films I saw, most of which came from the West. English is my first language. And once the internet came into my life, it became my window to the world. And that world became my hometown. I read Alice Munro and Yoko Ogawa. I listened to Van Morrison and Joni Mitchell. I'd rather watch paint dry in a Tarkovsky film than bullets fly in a Shahrukh Khan film. I also love Indian authors and music and films, of course, so I'm not quite a deracinated product of the remote West. Some days I have pizza, some days I have biryani and my weighing scale doesn't like it. But while much of my surroundings in Mumbai are a comfort zone for me, out of pure habit, I do wish sometimes that my roots were deeper. I like the idea of being a global citizen, but this globe is an abstract thing, unlike the earth beneath my feet, which is unseen to me as I walk all over it. If one is to be cosmopolitan, one should be, in a memorable phrase used by my guest today, a rooted cosmopolitan."

        "message": "science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to the seen and the unseen. My guest today is Sugata Srinivasaraju. And while he's been a writer and a journalist, those terms seem inadequate to describe him. A better term perhaps would be a man of letters, or even better, a man of culture. Born to a literary family, Sugata wanted to be a writer from a young age, hung out with legends of Kannada literature, found equal fluency in Kannada and English, and by engaging with the world of ideas, he made himself into what Ram Guha once called a dying breed, the bilingual intellectual. Sugata's latest book is Furrows in a Field, a biography of H.D. Devya Gowda that is as much the portrait of a man as of Karnataka politics itself. I went to Bangalore in February intending to chat with Sugata about this book. I read it carefully. I took copious notes. They were passages I almost knew by heart. And then, Sugata and I spoke for over five hours and we didn't spend even one minute of that talking about the book. His life itself was so fascinating, especially when it came to describing the milieu where he grew up, a world of letters and ideas where every neighbourhood in Bangalore seemed to be home to a different school of literature. I learnt about the rich world of Kannada literature, a vast ocean of art that our Anglophone elites miss while staring into a tumbler of water. I learnt about his journey through Indian journalism, a field in which high ideals and petty corruption are always jostling each other. We discussed how our culture and politics are changing, the narrow visions of both nationalism and our many sub-nationalisms. I was struck most of all by a phrase he used to describe himself, rootedly cosmopolitan. I know few people to whom that lovely phrase can be attached. I'm not one of them. Sugata Srinivasaraju is a rooted cosmopolitan. I love this conversation and I'm sure you will as well. But before we begin, let's take a quick commercial break. On the 20th of July, 2007, a lady named Mrs. Gaware returned to her home in Dombivali to find that her daughter Snehal, who had been relaxing in her room, was missing. Snehal's slippers, her spectacles, her braces, without which she never left home, were still there. There was a hunt for the girl, a police complaint was filed and worry gave way to panic. The next day, Mrs. Gaware entered Snehal's room and noticed that a water jar that was normally in the storage under the bed was now outside. So she opened up the storage and found her dead daughter inside, her hands tied behind her back, a towel around her mouth. This happened just a few kilometres from where I live. But I hadn't heard of this till I came across the Desi Crime Podcast, the sponsors of this episode. The Desi Crime Podcast is hosted by Aishwarya Singh and Aryan Misra, and they talk about crimes from India, Pakistan, Nepal, any place you'd call desi. In it, they talk about crimes like the bed-box murder, Snehal Gaware's case. We learn about Hercules, a vigilante in Bangladesh who punished rapists by killing them. Who was Hercules? Why did Hercules act where the law had failed? Great stories can raise fascinating questions that keep us up at night. And the Desi Crime Podcast has plenty of those. You can find it on Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, or wherever you listen to your podcasts. So check out the Desi Crime Podcast and remember, there's a killer on the loose in your neighbourhood. So much better and she took me through you know many decades of it and then someone on Twitter commented that you really must talk to Swagata Srinivasa Raju about Karnataka politics at which point my ears perked up but then I thought that I have to have some baseline knowledge of a subject to begin with to be able to talk to someone about it and I am completely clueless about Karnataka politics was then and to a lesser extent now because of your wonderful book but you know that's kind of the extent of it but I've been following your work since and the book gave me an opportunity to invite you on the show so delighted to have you so you know let's let's kind of you've got such a rich and varied career and there are many aspects of that I'd like to touch on before we get to your book but first tell me a little bit about you know where were you born where did you grow up what were those years like"

        "message": "thank you Amit I was raised in Bangalore I mean I was born in Bangalore brought up in Bangalore and my ancestors in a sense been at least two or three generations were all in Bangalore so I never sort of got a chance to sort of go to the rural hinterland or be part of a rural you know setting whatever so I was always an urban boy but then Bangalore of what what it is today is not the Bangalore of the 70s when I was born so I still always had this feeling that I was a provincial boy and it was a provincial town or it was a small town and so this and it was a very pastoral kind of city because if you you know went into the smaller bylanes of Bangalore you would still see people having cows milking their cows in the morning and it was very laid-back kind of a city there was no the city was not you know I mean set to the space that it is set to today that is after 2000 you saw a sudden shift and many of us don't recognize the Bangalore that we grew up in and I think this is the constant complaint of everybody who sort of has grown up in cities you know and has seen say 20 30 years or 40 years go by because everything is dramatically changed drastically changed and that is my experience too about Bangalore so I was basically born and brought up in Bangalore my mother's side came from a place called Tumkur which is right outside Bangalore which is now connected by a six-lane highway and you can reach there in an hour and it's almost an extension of Bangalore now and my father's side came from a much closer place in rural Bangalore district I don't know if you're familiar with a big banyan tree you know you see it on all the record books and because it's a real big banyan tree and we were my father's you know forefathers were Patels of that village and that is supposed to have come to us as some kind of a Jagir from the Mysore Maharaja my mother's side came I think they migrated after the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire from that area Balari area so they they trace their ancestry back to Anegundi kingdom so but these are things that I've not fact-checked and these are things that I've heard and you know I mean there is in other cultures there is this genealogical thing maps written and all that but here you know some of the property papers mention this but then you know I've never I mean I should say as a journalist and as a writer that I don't think I've fact-checked any of this this is what you've heard and I'm just sharing that with you so so this is basically my background and my father was a professor of Kannada language and literature and he taught at the Christ College which has now become Christ University was one of the founding faculty members of that institution and he was a huge and major influence on me he was he went to the St. Joseph's College in Bangalore his father I mean who had come to Bangalore from Ramohalli which is that big banyan tree thing was a police officer you know he was in the first batch of CBI officers those days and so they were educated he was the first generation he was educated that was the first generation that got educated in the family that was my grandfather and my father was you know I mean relatively better off because of his father's education and he went to the St. Joseph's College to study science so he did his BSc and then got into a job in a mining company again in Karnataka but then I think in the 70s there was this resurgence of Kannada you know activism and pride and the burst of literary activity and all that I think he was drawn into that and he shifted from sciences and mining and all that into literature so he came back to the Central College in Bangalore to do his MA in Kannada literature under Stalwarts so G.P. Rajaratnam who is one of the big names in Kannada literature was his teacher and he sort of almost called himself a disciple of this man and it is very important to mention G.P. Rajaratnam because G.P. Rajaratnam did a lot of good for Kannada not in just terms of you know a creative literature but also he brought Buddhist literature into Kannada Jaina literature into Kannada he himself sort of became a kind of Buddhist and wore white you know all times and this man put this seed into my father's head that it is not just enough to write literature but you also have to create a literary atmosphere and a culture so wherein younger people sort of you know come in and thrive and do good things so culture it's about nurturing that environment was an idea that came from G.P. Rajaratnam to my father and G.P. Rajaratnam got it from another stalwart or a contemporary of his called A. R. Krishna Shastri so they used to run this Karnataka Sangha in Central College and they actually nurtured really great writers like P. Lankesh was I'm just giving you one instance Nisar Ahmed who passed away recently was another very big name so they that was a kind of you know cradle for young writers and they they sort of picked their writing looked at it you know edited it and put it into an anthology published it and sort of made them feel that they were writers and then nurtured a kind of environment in Kannada which was a selfless thankless kind of a thing because these writers themselves were not very rich you know they were themselves first-generation literates perhaps and they were just doing this out of their own you know I mean volition and you know I mean certain kind of commitment and you know a different kind of philosophy totally so my father was in that tradition so my father thought that because he had received so much from this tradition he also has to continue that and besides being a poet and a playwright in Kannada he also started a small publishing house in Christ College which was a Christian institution as the name goes but run by I mean monks who came from Kerala you know it was a kind of congregation which was which was that you know because that distinction has to be made because there are monks also from Mangalore you know in the St. Joseph's College is run by mostly fathers who come from Mangalore so this was a Malayalam Malayali kind of environment a Christ College and so he starts the Kannada Sangha there and has the first book that he brings out is an anthology of poems on Christ in Kannada and that becomes a controversy because you know I mean I forget exactly why it became a controversy but he handles that controversy and what he did was that he kept a small you know portion of his salary aside to bring out these publications so my mother used to always tell us that your father is sort of you know I mean is more worried about what book to bring out next rather than you know worry about your education you know and she was teasingly you know I mean she was a willing collaborator in his enterprise but then but this was the kind of so he sort of did that so today in Kannada a lot of big writers including H.S. Shivaprakash or K.V. Narayan or a lot of people were products of his sort of you know I mean a nurturing you know enterprise literally and a lot of I also met my wife through one of his you know he brought on an anthology and my wife had published a poem so she used to come to see him my later wife you know so that's how I sort of met her so I keep telling my you know I mean friends and family that my father's literature you know I mean indulgence and all that did not after all go waste because you know I mean I sort of found a life partner and it has done well and it has sort of given us so much of goodwill and there are so many writers you know today I am I mean I may have worked in publications in Karnataka I mean nationally internationally and all of that but in Karnataka I'm always known as my father's son so I mean that's another thing which I always I mean sometimes it swell with pride that it is that way but sometimes I feel it or what more should I do to sort of be recognized as you know I mean on my own no terms so that is essentially the kind of environment that I grew up in and my father was a was not a person again this thing has to be told in the environment that we are in today that he was not a chauvinist he was not a no one did not think of literature and Kannada and Karnataka in a in very narrow terms so he was he was rootedly cosmopolitan as a phrase that I later came to use in my first book so he's rootedly cosmopolitan the sense his assignments to be summer assignments to me Amit was asking me to translate say he used to leave the house in the morning so he would say by the time I come back this is a short poem or a short story and you should have translated it by evening so he put me on this bilingual swing you know right very very early so I mean my I think I started translating when I was a three-year in my third class or fourth class and so there used to he used to subscribe to a lot of magazines you know including Encounter used to come home Quest used to come only later did I realize that Quest was a CIA operation right then London Calling the BBC magazine used to come home then we used to get Soviet literature which is again you know I mean from the Soviet Union those days used to subsidize all this then Chinese literature used to come home you know printed on lovely glossy paper with lovely paintings and so this was there and then we also sort of he used to you know he had this habit of taking a loan from say the State Bank of Mysore or Canara Bank to buy encyclopedias or volumes which we could not just buy it one stroke and I mean it was very expensive so so my so the encyclopedia that I have at home you know the American ones or the he gifted me a six set tell me why series and that was expensive those days and I don't think a teacher's salary could afford that kind of indulgence so otherwise you know there was always premium Mr. Shanbhag and they were great friends and he paid his bills only once a month at the end of the month so you know and that was the kind of and houses fully stacked with books and so he introduced us to not just Kannada literature trying to tell us that you should read your K.S. Narsimha Swami or your K.V. Puttappa or P.T. Narsimhachar or say Lankesh, Lankesh was a huge huge influence on me later after he started his tabloid I mean I mean I would call it a compact newspaper I wouldn't call it a tabloid it became a tabloid later for various reasons but then so so so he would ask me to read you know look at Russian literature especially and European literature you know I don't think I would have ever read Stendhal or Balzac or Victor Hugo you know Baudelaire all of these people were being just you know they were names and then they became reality in my imagination and in my whatever so so he sort of pushed me to look at them and he just did not ask me to read them then he just gave me passages to translate so they so they became part of me in a very different way it is not not just about reading them and you know I mean making them part of you but also of your consciousness but also sort of making them a part of you in a entirely different way where those phrases and those so you had to actually dabble in two languages wondering what this is I mean I was just thrown a challenge once you know I mean there is a lovely poem of K.S. Narsimha Swami so I used to tell my father why are you asking me to translate only into Kannada I'll try and translate into English so why why is it why is it that I should not attempt the other way around so he said yeah you're you're welcome try and do it so I just picked a poem of K.S. Narsimha Swami to translate and in which there is a very idiomatic expression which says which is she's this fellow is newly married he's come to his father-in-law's house and realizes the wife is actually not she's having periods and they can't sort of you know I mean there is this whole cultural thing about not being together when you're having your period so so he comes there and then this line is there it is very subtly communicated in the poem so now how do you bring it into English was the challenge to a boy who's still in his early teens who does not understand the idea and then so so my father's friend who was also a great literary critic in Kannada he came in the evening and then he said okay so apparently you're trying to translate Narsimha Swami let me have a look at it and then he said how how will you go how will you translate this line so then I said you know I I just said she's not inside or something like that you know Padumalu Olagilla Paduma is not inside is the literal translation of it so then he he just had a good laugh and then I don't think you know they tried to explain it to me but I realized it much later that you know I mean this is culturally that that's when I realized that there's so much culture idiomatic which you cannot translate there's so much that this culture sort of holds together which another language finds it extremely difficult to capture or the registers of another language or idioms or expressions or phraseology of the other language cannot capture so then that gave me an idea that this is unique this world is unique and there is another world there so I am trying to be an ambassador between these two worlds so I always sort of had this idea that I was an ambassador between two worlds or and and I wish that it became more than two worlds and therefore I went and learned a bit of French because Lankesh translated Baudelaire into Kannada called and it was called Papa the Hoogalu so when I read it I was so thrilled you know I mean so I said okay I should go and read these poems and they're original so I went to learn French at the Allianz Francais but then you know I mean the French that you learn there was so inadequate you just you know got a bit of an idea of what it was what the language is all about like but then I never got to read it and the original but then at least there was that kind of trigger you know I mean to go and seek it out and the original but when I even as I sort of recount all this Amit and I you made me sort of look look back on all these and talk about this which I don't think I would have ever sort of pulled out but I was a student of science I was not a student of literature you know I mean when I joined when I finished my 10th class and that's another story as to why I said I mean I wanted to be a cricketer like every other Bangalorean I wanted to be a cricketer so I went to the St. Joseph's Indian High School which was started in I think 1904 as an alternative to the European St. Joseph's European High School which is a which is where the elites went and this was for the common people so I went to the St. Joseph's Indian High School and there there was a great sporting culture so I wanted to play cricket too so I then we had Salus Nazareth who played Ranji Trophy for Mysore as one of our coaches and then I thought I should get into the school team and I wasn't I wanted to play the BT Ramayana tournament which was like playing the World Cup those days you know I mean so I never succeeded in getting into the team but I was always in the B team there was an A team and a B team I think the school people understood that there are lots of kids who have to be accommodated so they created a B team so you always waited in the wings you know to take the place of a person who's injured or you know I mean who's sort of out or whatever so you carry drinks to the field and come out and so that cricketing thing was very very important because hockey was another thing in our school Ashish Balar was our contemporary and he was he later went on to play for India and then Rojo Bini and Syed Mustafa Hussain Kirmani were the alumnus of this school and 1983 the Prudential Cup thing was a big moment because they had won the cup and I think Bini had taken 18 wickets or something like that if I remember right and Kirmani was a big hero so they were invited to the school and I was given the opportunity to speak at the assembly so and invite them and I was some kind of a school leader you know I mean there were different houses and I was the captain of the Nehru house so I was expected to invite them on to this whole thing and then I did that and that again rubbed off on me and then so I was always again shuttling between cricket and hockey and I thought I should be a hockey star when the school won a tournament in hockey then I thought no no no hockey is my calling then then you saw cricket and the paraphernalia that you know pads and you know you actually went to cricket because you like the gloves or you like the pads you like the bat and you like the name Schlesinger written on it or whatever and then of course television was reiterating that ambition and you were seeing all this and then you had these stars who were coming and watching you play in the morning you know I mean Bini used to be there in the grounds or Kirmani would come occasionally and then and I had a classmate called Krishna Prasad who went on to play I think the under 15 for India or something he went to England those days and I don't know what has happened to him but then he was there and Rahul Dravid was playing for the St. Joseph's he was my contemporary again so so they sent a batch of students for these selections to the KSE the Chinnaswamy stadium and I was not one of them but then I thought this is very unfair on the school's part I was a wicket keeper and an opening bat so I thought I should just go and try my luck and there was Ian James I mean Anglo-Indian boy called Ian James I don't know what's again happened to him I'm not followed he used to open the bowling thing and they were all there they were sent for the selections and some of us who wanted to very badly be there were not there so I think a three or four of us you know decided that let's just go and take a chance we'll just land up there and just also bowl or bat or you know keep wickets so I went there and I still remember Dravid coming and playing and then Dravid keeping the wickets and AV Jai Prakash who later sort of you know gave this 10 out of 10 to Anil Kumble was the selector so of course we didn't get selected and then I then my I think my father was noticing all this and he said see you don't have to always be a player you can also you can enjoy the game like I do you can sort of you know mean enjoy it and you focus on your studies I think that's more important so that's when I sort of turned my back to cricket and got involved in studies and so I got into science which was actually a kind of natural thing to happen because there are two reasons for that my mother's side they had an engineering college and they were pretty wealthy my father's side was more into education because my grandmother herself was English educated that's my father's mother she was a fantastic chess player and she used to read novels in Kannada and English and for me the sight of my grandmother still today is not about she being in the kitchen or making pickles or anything like that or making papadums or whatever which is the usual thing but she playing chess with my father so this lady was used to consume novels in Kannada like nobody's business and I think that she also pushed my mother to do a bit of that so that reading of the two women in the family was very very crucial and all my aunts we were a joint family living in Maleswaram a locality that was created the turn of the century because of plague and people had a new locality had to be created and so there my aunts were there they were all into music you know they were all performing artists so there was a lot of music happening bhajan happening and my grandfather in the evenings used to recite from Jaimini Bharata which is a 16th 17th century you know Mahabharata written in Kannada then Kumar Vyasa Bharata tell us stories about it and these two women used to go to the circulating library bring all the pulp fiction read and you know I mean cry and keep you know I mean sobbing over you know some passage in the thing or the thing about a character you know the death of a character or whatever and we used to wonder what all this was and but it had an effect on you and so this one side it was the mainstream thing coming from your father who's actually putting you into it and then then you're seeing your grandmother and your mother doing this without you know in doing it in a completely different way and then there is your patriarchal grandfather who's finished his evening chores and then sitting and reading it like in the traditional times you know reciting from it so this was the kind of environment that I had at home and then you were you're seeing Western magazines come home you're seeing books you're seeing your aunts perform Carnatic classical music and and so so this is the kind of environment and by I went into science because you know I mean I think the primary thing was also because there was an engineering college that my grandfather maternal grandfather ran with his couple of our I mean a few of our other relatives and so there was a seat that was guaranteed and there was also this long-term thing that I should probably become an administrator of that thing because then they were all first-generation entrepreneurs who had made the money and they were into construction business building dams and bridges and roads and highways all that so they had made money and they were all very close to the Ram Krishna Hegde regime and they had got a license to run this college and so there was that kind of it was I think intellect it was mapped in the minds of my my mother especially that I should sort of probably do that so I got into science and getting into science was not difficult because I had decent scores in my SSLC but then once I got into my PCMB course it's physics chemistry mathematics and biology at the National College which is again a great institution I was there almost ambushed by a very good English teacher called Mr. Badrinath so he used to he used to teach English extremely well he made it very very interesting for for us so there was an environment at home which already sort of you know I mean put you into that kind of you know I mean gave you that orientation but here was a man and for the first time it was an external influence and of course there were other intellectuals coming home you know D.R. Nagraj all the big names they were all juniors in age to my father so they all used to come home you know stay for long periods have food so that was all there but this man had a great influence on me and he I think is now a professor somewhere in Canada I'm not I'm not in touch with him and he did his PhD in sociology he was a very young man he had himself just finished his MA and was teaching younger people so there at that point I started thinking whether I whether it was engineering that I really wanted to or medicine that I really want to do so I quietly started writing poetry and bad poetry in English and reasonably okay poetry in Kannada that's when that's that's my assessment because at least the Kannada poems got published here and there so the English ones never saw the light of the day and I still keep that diary of English poems that I wrote which I feel very embarrassed looking at now so you all you pick the biggest words in the dictionary and try to play with it you know the usual things that all of us do when we are starting this whole exercise so so this Bhadrinath was a kind of influence who sort of shifted my focus away from he was also an engineering student by the way I had given up this if I remember all this correctly and he had given up his sciences and had come into humanities and was doing a great job so and he wore a dhoti and a white dhoti and a white kurta and came to class to teach so there was some some spiritual element in my head which was associated with a simplicity and all that and I never went to ask why he wore as a young man now I mean a couple of pictures that I see now he's wearing a suit and all that but those days I think it was some strange idealism that was there there was already another teacher called Professor G Ramakrishna who had studied in England was a professor of English professor of Sanskrit professor of Kannada and I think it had expertise in all the three languages and I'm still in touch with him is a great man and he wore this Gandhian attire I mean he was also at the National College but at another branch of the National College so so he was his student and I finally became Dr. G Ramakrishna student also when I went to the National College Basundi to do my BA in English literature sociology and economics so after my pre-university I got into an engineering college but I went and told my father that I think I want to do literature like you so I thought there would be resistance but you know the first thing my father said was I'm very happy that you have made this decision but don't tell your mother the way you told me I will convince her but you know you you sort of do what you want to do so I think I think that's a very very rare thing for the father he was very happy that I wanted to do English literature and my father was very good with his Kannada and all that but his I don't think he ever dabbled in writing in English or speaking in English you know I mean it was he was his Kannada only kind of a thing but with a very good reading of English classics and English literature and European literature and all that so he was I think he was quite a quite a liberal father and I mean hugely liberal father who said don't worry about your mother I will tell her but once my mother came to know of it I think she told her father and her father sort of ridiculed my decision and then my grandfather here he is he influenced my paternal grandfather and he was also very upset and I think they were all they did not speak to me properly until I finished my degree you know BA in sociology English and economics so but then of course you know they all reconciled because they saw me sort of going abroad and doing things well and so they all came back later but then nobody sort of made a good prognosis of my thing you know not that I was going to make a lot of money or get a Nobel Prize or something like that but then you know I mean they did not give me a chance but my father gave me a chance he said this is fine it's great you do what you want to do but he said whatever you do I want you to be the best now it's like telling fathers telling their sons that even if you're a shoeshine boy be the best I don't think they would have literally meant it but then you know that was the kind of encouragement and then he then I started accompanying him to seminars where he was speaking or his you know I mean I used to start started looking at his editing process very closely his table used to be stacked up with manuscripts of young writers you know used to get up at 4 in the morning and you know I mean I mean I've written about it somewhere and I think the introduction to my translation of his plays he wrote mind plays during the emergency so so that is the only mind plays that exist in Canada even to this day so I translated it much later around I think 2004 for which I got the science academy prize also so I think in the introduction of that I speak about how I saw my father you know waking up and sitting at the table and he looking at his manuscript and there's a serenity a picture of serenity which I portray so so this was happening and at the same time when I was doing my BA my mother you know she was a homemaker and I think she had started accessing a different set of novels which were in translation and this is fascinating because again translation comes back into my life in a different way and this time my grandmother is out of the picture because she is passed on and we have moved to another house because my father needed to be closer to his institution college to he couldn't travel long distances because he had become diabetic and we wanted to cut his travel time in the morning so we were in a separate setting now where it was not a joint family it was a nuclear family and my mother had started accessing translations of Bengali novels into Canada which was published by Kavyalaya in Mysore and this was the entire Tagore this was all of Bimal Mitra then this was you know I mean Bhatir Panchali into Kannada and all of it was translated by a great soul called Aho Balashankara he had translated 4,000-5,000 pages of literature into Kannada from the Bengali originally had learned Bengali and yet translated them into Kannada and he was with the free press journal and then of course he also learned Malayalam and translated Nambudripad's autobiography into Kannada there's a great man but you know in those days when she was reading this and telling me you know summaries of what is happening in those mega novels written in the 19th century Bengal and you know there was also this affinity to Sharada and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and all that in the house anyway Bengal nationalism and Bengal Bengali culture was the elite culture of the time so it had an influence on all literate I mean all families middle class families and so they came through Sharada I mean Sharada or through Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or through Vivekananda into all our households and there was a big you know photograph in my grandfather's you know I mean it was a pretty huge thing frame of Vivekananda the Hindu monk of India you know standing like this with a nice coat and so it had come into our house like that and so Bengali was an idea that sort of some of got into the culture and there was this translations now so the so she was reading accessing all the classics and translation and I don't mean she was not interpreting it like my father was a literary literature man trying to do that but she would tell me stories you know I mean tell me see this is happening and so this fellow is going to die oh this is I think he has wasted some 25 pages writing on this why should he do that he can come straight to this story so there was a very different kind of kitchen you know she's cooking and she would tell me these stories and I got interested and I started reading for me it was not Tagore it was not Bimal Mitra it was not Bankim Chandra it was Ahobal Shankara I was reading the so powerful translation can sort of come to you in such a powerful thing I only much later realized this Ahobal Shankara was none other than the maternal uncle of Akumal Ramchandra who discovered Harald Szepinski the abstract expressionist and got a 32 page profile in the New York at those times you know in the 80s so this is there was a Telugu Brahmin family I mean so this man was had translated all this so translation started coming into me in a completely different way again so that again made my reading and my looking at the world and the worldview that I had to know this whole idea of the world you started coming in you know you need to have a worldview because you know you had started I had started reading Lankesh by then and Lankesh I tell you all of European politics today there's so much happening in Russia and Ukraine and all that but those days you did not have access to the internet there was no internet in the first place you could not have got subscribed to an economist or you could not have subscribed to a Mother Jones or something else or New York Times so all that you got to know about the about international events or personalities came to you through some very enlightened writers in Canada like P. Lankesh there was another one called Sita Ramayya VC we used to call her V. Sita Ramayya he used to subscribe to the Times Literary Supplement those days he wrote on economics and all that but then he was of an older generation much older generation to Lankesh and Lankesh used to tell us about what's happening with Mitterrand what's happening in Germany what's happening in America and used to write as if he is there and talking to all those personalities used to he had brilliant prose and when he when when Gowri passed away and I was interviewed on Gowri I said see don't get me wrong Gowri was not the great journalist or great writer it was her father and her father always came across to me as a French modernist because he used to write so much on European culture and he had made Steffi Graf a household name and he used to call his dog Steffi right so you know you he sort of presented material to you in a very very fascinating fashion and that's when I thought that you have to write you have to have a worldview you have to be rooted but at the same time you have to present the material before you in a very interesting fashion you shouldn't you know write with 2,000 footnotes and I mean 100 pages of whatever you know I mean which doesn't sort of communicate what you have to make it interesting for people and getting people to read you and their attention spans you know I mean fixing their attention spans is far more important and interesting and challenging than sort of you know just writing and you know I mean letting your ego you know be there all the way all I mean in all places so I think Lankesh was a very decisive influence and then at the same time you know I mean it's it's it's so happened that I've been lucky Amit that there is Lankesh who's trying to give you these lessons there's your father who's being a just gentle mentor and then there is I was also not completely alien to abstract ideas and theorization and the culture of insight as I call it you know it's not the culture of it's not empirical you know I mean stacking up of data which was important but you know trying to look at a culture of I mean trying to develop a culture of insight you know so my father used to always tell me that you shall not write anything if you don't have an insight and something new to say so it's not just you just you know put things together and then say that this is your piece no you have to have something to say until then don't write and don't make writing so easy for yourself which of course you know I could not have done as a journalist later but but then I later realized the importance of the culture of insight which he sort of taught me but abstraction was another thing which you know trying to sort of look at abstract ideas you know I had become interested a little bit in Barth, Rolla Barth at that time and then but I but you know Barth or Foucault and Derrida I'm I sort of came to study formally later but you know I mean in my BA and whatever there was this great literary critic in Canada and a cultural thinker in Canada called Kevin Narayan and Kevin Narayan was the one who introduced me to Chomsky's linguistics and I mean ideas of our ideas on language and then also and he had this enormous ability he was he was the teacher of D.R. Nagraj also and he had this enormous ability to theorize things in a way you know I mean look at something and say that okay this is the kind of broad structure into which it fell so I was fascinated by the way he designed his ideas you know conceptually put them in boxes and he was a sort of student of science too so he's bringing his knowledge of science and learning and all that into looking at literature and making literature look more like science there was a phase in Canada when you know you they thought of making it very precise and you know I mean speaking of it like quantum theory or whatever so there was that phase which I learned immensely from that phase because abstraction and theoretical ideas and how to build you know and put things in a larger frame how to put them in a context how to sort of link them and how to sort of bring this culture of insight into all of that all of this started happening inside me and now it's you know it's just that as I sit here and reflect with you I feel surprised that all these processes processes have happened inside me I mean you're giving me an opportunity to sort of you know I mean reflect on these I'm just having a free flow thing with you but I was not conscious of all these things so this is how things I think get into anybody's mind anybody's personality and shapes you into a person that you finally become or are constantly becoming you know I mean so I think that was happening with me and Narayan was a huge influence Badrinath was an influence my father was a constant force and my mother was doing this something which is very fascinating and my grandmother was doing something and my grandfather I still keep his Jaimini Bharata in my study today even today even to this day it's a old thing the fat thick text and so classical traditional modern European Lankesh trying to take you across the seas now Lankesh never crossed the seas Lankesh never went abroad but he wrote about Europe as if it was his you know I mean the gully next door you know I mean he he wrote so insightfully about Hemingway he wrote so much about Spanish Civil War he wrote so much about the Mitra Mitra France then he is the one who told us about this great writer called Borges he said there is this you should read Latin American writers and then there was another idea which of course there was a secular environment which I now called secular but then it was a very organic environment those days but I my father and Lankesh were friends and it was a very strange kind of friendship because my father was spoke very little so but Lankesh always used to sort of talk to him and my father would listen and probably respond a week later or something like that I still have cards that Lankesh would write and my my father would send a card and then stick a I mean another card asking him to respond because he would I think that was a practice you know you would just spin that and Lankesh would just sign at the bottom empty so I have many cards like that at home so so Lankesh and my father had this thing and once my father I think he would never visit his office he was already a very famous journalist and a writer and much much bigger than I mean you can imagine you know I mean I would you know in the Kannada space you know and I it is Lankesh who's much much bigger than a Karnad or an Anant Murthy or whoever so I mean because he had the masses and he had the classes on a side and I went to see him once and then he asked me very strangely he asked me tell me the names of your friends you know I mean it's very strange thing question to be asked and I named a few and then he said but there is no Muslim name in it there's no Christian name in it you should you should have you should have a Muslim friend you should have a Christian friend I mean it is almost like didactic you know telling you that go and get these people into your life also so your life becomes richer that's all he said and then I mean he spoke about nothing else and then he was very dismissive about this and that and he was very erratic in his thing and very brusque in his you know expression so we one wouldn't want to stay there for too long and my father was a teetotaler and Lankesh always enjoyed his drink and all that so so we just came back and but Lankesh was a huge huge influence so all of these things were happening in my early life and then after my BA I mean I had finished my thing and then I got a seat at the Central University of Hyderabad in the English department and that was another huge huge change because for the first time I was going outside of home it was not very far off as Hyderabad but still you know it was like flying abroad so you you went and you put yourself in a hostel and then there are these students from postgraduate students from the computer applications department computer was a big thing just about getting off the thing and then there were students of doing PhD in physics and then you're interacting with all these fellows sitting in the hostel at your dining table and then I was also introduced there to radical student politics you know I mean Hyderabad was a hotbed of radical politics student politics and I it so happened that I became a roommate of a person who was on the extreme left and later that person became the son-in-law of Varvara Rao right so K Satyanarayana so he had contested an election new student body election and then I mean innocently you went and campaigned and then that's also when I realized that you know I mean how ideologies are constraining and limiting and they try to exclude you because how much of a loyalty I showed these people they would never make me part of them never may never invite me to their secret meetings so I felt very disturbed and then in my second MA I think I wrote a letter saying that I have nothing to do with any of you so I still keep that letter which a photocopy of that letter and so I thought that this is very limiting and then I got back into my literature studies but literature studies literature department itself were going through a transition at that time and there was this huge conflict about colonial curriculum curriculums you know I mean so people who wanted to study Shakespeare seriously or Shelley or the romantics or the key or Keats or Dunn or all these people were looked down upon you know I mean are you what is it that you're doing you know you're you're studying only what the British has asked you to study there's these are canonical texts there's so much that's happening in America and post-structuralism and structuralism that have dismantled this whole idea of education etc. etc. etc. so this was being constantly being thrown at us by one or two teachers and one of them later happened to become my MPhil and PhD guides Tejaswini Niranjana and it so happened that Niranjana's father and my father again they had this teacher-student relationship and it was a lifelong very very good relationship and I mean so she was she had just come back from the United States I mean I think she had she had done a PhD and she had come back and she was very high on literary theory and Foucault and Derry all of that and she wanted I mean she wanted us to read all of that you know and I really appreciate what happened at that phase but then you know it was trying to sort of make you look at your what you had until then thought was literature and I mean it put a lot of questions on that and that was welcome because you know you reconciled your new exposure and your old thing later much later and it sort of blend beautifully inside you but then at that point it was a kind of a disruption for me and then I mean so I moved from the literature department after MA after I got a good MA degree into the comparative literature department for my PhD and I chose her as my guide and I again because I was so familiar with the idea of translations and Ramanujan was a friend of ours you know he used to come home and I still keep letters of it that between my father and him and so he used to I mean out of the blue write to my father in an airmail saying that I need this book Raju can you please keep it for me I'll be coming on such and such a date I'll pick it up from you and then he was very interested in some of the poets that my father had published so he would say that this man is the next Adiga so Gopal Krishna Adiga is another very big name in Kannada and a stalwart of person who sort of shaped the Navya movement in Kannada and Ananthamurthy and others were all influenced by him big man but a Jansangh he contested on a Jansangh ticket now that's a separate thing now how ideologies again did not matter when it came to literature because his literature was good so I mean I used to when he had a he had a stroke and he could not write my father used to send me to his house great man and he would sort of I was I used to write down what he would tell me and then you know I mean that's how I became very very close to him before he passed away I think in 93 or so I'm not sure about the date but then so he was another person but then coming back to Hyderabad and this literary experience and this new challenges that were being thrown at me and trying to sort of undo all that I had thought was literature was a was a great thing and then there is also this little bit of radical politics entering into your horizon because you were a protected boy from a family which was had a literary orientation and you know and very cultural kind of a thing and suddenly you're being asked hard I mean being told that there are harsh realities there and this is all useless you know I mean your poetry is useless because it's very romantic after all it's about individuals you know you should write poetry for the society and that's when I very seriously when I came home for a holiday thing I took an anthology of socialist verse with me which was in my father's library by Alan bold it was edited by Alan bold and it had even to this day it's the most delightful anthology that I've ever read you know I mean I read Neruda for the first time there I read Mayakovsky I read Vasco Popper I read a lot of people and used to you know translate a few of them that I liked and I would keep them so so so so I started opening up myself to bigger questions that were being asked so there's not just literature there was this not this cozy relationship of stories and there's not that literary questions or literary criticism and framing and abstract whatever ideas within a certain area and being familiar with the registers of literature and literary criticism but also larger questions that concern society and those questions were thrown at me without my asking suddenly in the hostels of the University of Hyderabad Central University of Hyderabad so that sort of again so I my mother's dream again because right from my childhood she would make me listen to the AIR news at nine o'clock and she had kept a diary and I had to write the headlines and show it to her and then I would be allowed to go to sleep so that was the ritual that was practiced for years and apparently she did that because she wanted me to be an IAS officer and one of my father's colleagues had written the UPSC exams and had become an IAS officer not not so much an IAS officer but he had become the postmaster general I mean another service which you get if you get a slightly lesser score so so she wanted me to be an IAS officer and then I as officer the connotation was of power and you know you know prestige and all that so I think she had driven that into me or put that into my head and it was there somewhere in the back of my mind so so now that you've not done engineering at least do this you know I mean you know that kind of a thing but that was also completely shattered when I went to Hyderabad you know I I thought that this was gulamgiri of a different kind you know I mean of course you know I mean later some of the finest bureaucrats became my friends and friends of our family and they still nurtured me and great men but you know at that point of time you know I mean this this whole disruption is happening and then literature is being exploded so everything is being exploded in your mind and even this idea got exploded so I never took the UPSC exams and my mother was even to this day I think she's terribly terribly disappointed so when I became an editor and chief secretaries used to call me up or principal secretaries used to come to see me I used to go back and tell her that see you wanted me to be an IAS officer see so many of them come to see me today they seek an appointment so but she was not very happy she said that's then something has gone into your head so don't don't don't really think that you've become something so you know she was still not convinced about it so this was so these ideas got exploded so again you started looking at world very differently and I remember there all night people reading out revolutionary verse you know the Telugu boys especially you know reading out Sri Sri's poetry to me and saying that see look at this look at this is does your KS Narasimha Swami write like this does your Gopal Krishna Adiga write like this is a reactionary so they started labeling writers for me saying that he is this he is that why do you need to read this fellow you know I mean oh Tolstoy you know I mean here's something else no that's not sufficient you know I mean so so so these things completely changed in my mind around that time so this is then I am sort of there and doing my PhD and then I've picked a very interesting subject because translations is very dear to me I thought I'll become a translator in my life you know that was an academic researching on translations doing literary translations I've never meant to be a journalist I was never study I never studied journalism so I picked on nationalism and translations the idea of nationalism and run because my PhD guide Tejaswini Niranjana had done her work on translations and so I thought I mean I think we discussed this and we thought I thought I should look at the the early translations of modern Kannada literature and try to see why those translations happened so linking it up with Kannada sub-nationalism linking up with nationalism so I was trying to look at that and of course she was putting a very heavy theoretical framework and she was not very enthusiastic about the local literature that I was discovering and showing it to her so at some point I felt very slighted that she's not interested in what I'm showing it's it's a one-way thing so I suddenly decided I will not I'll take a break from doing PhD go back to Bangalore for some time and then probably I mean I was still very young so I thought I'll always come back to do my PhD and in I mean at that time also there was this huge subaltern history conference that happened in Hyderabad so there was Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak there was Ranjit Guha all these people congregating and I wasn't volunteer to that whole thing and at that time there was the Deccan Herald and Prajavani people the Sunday there was an editor who I was looking after that and he said this is happening I mean I had spoken to him very interestingly about the idea of subaltern history why it is interesting how it is different and I think I had spoken to him at length about Shaheed Amin's piece on Gandhi as Mahatma or something like that you know I mean I think I remember speaking to him about it and then he got very fascinated he said why don't you write a long series so I said I'll do a three-part series on subaltern history for you and I wrote a three-part series on subaltern history for the Kannada newspaper which also got into the English newspaper later I wrote in Kannada for Prajavani primarily so that made me a bit of a local you know I mean antenna went up people started saying over we read your piece so there was this instant recognition and there was this crisis happening in my PhD program so I thought I can do some journalism some cultural journalism literature literary journalism and then go back to my academics so that's when I came back home and again I met my father I used to take this overnight bus if you don't get you didn't if you didn't get a train ticket you took an overnight bus with which used to play movies all night on that you know I mean they used to have a television set and Anu Malik's music used to run all through night and it was terrible you know those journeys but then I landed up in Bangalore at six o'clock and my father was up he was a very early riser so he was having his coffee he said oh I mean you've come back I said yeah I want to tell you something I didn't even wait for anything I said this is what I've decided I'll go after a point of time I don't want to sort of pursue it now because I don't feel happy so is that so why should you be worried okay again he was very cool about it he said did not ever tell me that you should no no no this is not the way to do it I mean I enough tell my son that you know me no no no don't take the breaks that I took you may never go back to what you want to do so but he never said said that he said okay good you know I mean fine that's all that's all fine you know I mean if you're not happy you shouldn't do it so you'll always sort of you know understand as to why you need to do it so you'll go back to it so and that phase when I came back and then there was nothing to do and I was reading and reading consuming literature again and you know when trying to read biographies at that time you know I mean I was reading all this kind of stuff that was coming up after the breakup of the Soviet Union I think there was a string of biographies that was coming out in the West which was dismantling the character of people like Brecht or Einstein or making them look like you know I mean trying to speak so heavily about their private lives and and the I mean trying to break the icon of these you know the it was an iconographic kind of a thing iconoclastic sorry iconoclastic kind of a biographies that were coming out and I was reading all of that and then suddenly one day my father had another very elderly writer friend who said if Sugata is doing nothing Girish Kasarwadi is making a movie why doesn't he sort of you know go and spend some time with him so I just went to Girish Kasarwadi's house and he was so welcoming and he said see I'm making this movie called Kravya it's based on the short story so you read the short story and come tomorrow let's discuss so I just read the short story and I next day I had a lot of ideas because of course you wanted to prove that you know you've you've you've come out you've come out of university and then you've read all these new things and you have great ideas and so I started discussing and we used to discuss with three four hours and he was very patient with me and he liked a lot of ideas and then I mean I sort of did a conceptual design for the film which you know means it was very interesting project for eight or ten months and then when Girish Kasarwadi finally released the movie I was thrilled of course I didn't get paid because it was I was volunteering or he never sort of drew up a contract for me but then this in the in the scroll in the credit scroll my name was right at right on top with B. V. Karanth and you know I mean that happened that that that kind of joy and you know you jumped off the chair and I mean I told my father see can you see by name it's with the great B. V. Karanth and B. V. Karanth my father were great friends again they used to come to premia together to buy books and they used to go to Koshi's and have a coffee and then disperse in fact Ram Gohar mentions it in his obituary recently for I mean Shan Bagh Mr. Shan Bagh so I mean I was very happy and I thought oh I mean I mean I can do a lot of things there is movies there is these people have published a series for me you know in Deccan Herald so I mean I can do journalism and I can do all this for the next two or three years and then go back to academics so I sort of very promptly applied for a job in Deccan Herald and I mean my application went up to Mr. Hari Kumar and then of course you know with all the you were bragging about yourself that you've done this you've done this and you read this and all that so he called me for an interview and that interview went on for easily more than an hour for a trainee's position and there he sort of started discouraging me at the end of the interview saying that you're not meant for journalism he said you won't fit into this whole scheme you don't know how a newsroom runs so you just think because you've written a article you think you can become a journalist no that's not how journalism that's not what journalism does so I kept you know I needed this job so I kept telling him that no sir I mean I can I can be very useful to you I can do cultural journalism and I at that point of time I never thought I'll do politics or write on politics or it was only about literature and culture and things like that so then he sort of gave a very strange offer he said okay I'll allow you two months in the newsroom then come back and tell me if you like it I'll give you a trainee's job so I had to work for two months without pay in Deccan Herald you know writing and collecting my bylines and then filing it with the executive editor and saying see I've done all this so why don't you give me a job so at the end of two months after much persuasion prodding and nodding and all that he gave me a trainee's job and for a princely sum of about two thousand rupees those days and that was you know I mean some and Prajawani and Deccan Herald that group was immensely respected at that time it was a number one paper the times was nowhere in the picture those days which year was this this is 95 1995 so times was nowhere in the picture it was it was torturing so to say Express had its own problems and Hindu was a very mild presence you know I mean as it is today in Karnataka so this was the number one paper and if you and it and had and it had Sunday Herald and articulations books it used to be a thriving paper so you got into it then you thought you were you had arrived so but he took a liking to me once I sort of was confirmed as a trainee he took a liking to me and then instantly decided to send me abroad on an assignment and there was this Bombay was the minister of HRD and then he was going to Moscow for some cultural festival he said send so get there and I was a trainee so he was extraordinarily generous that and then of course it raised the eyebrows of all the seniors in the newsroom all that happened but then somehow he took a liking to me and then I mean I thought I should exploit that thing and then I wrote a note to him in 96 and I'd by then be become a regular journalist and I mean my training training period was over one year become a regular journalist I said Jacques Derrida has come to India I have some understanding of his writings and his philosophy and his and the polemics that surrounds it so if you permit me I will go to Delhi and interview him I just wrote I without even asking Jacques Derrida if you want to give me an interview so I wrote and he used to sort of have a very strange way of saying yes he used to just write an okay at the edge of the paper so that okay came back so they bought me a ticket and I went to landed up in Delhi and attended the lectures of Jacques Derrida at the Delhi School of Economics it was on the short history of the lie and then I somehow wanted his to draw his attention and get a get an appointment with him and ask him a few questions and I was trying to very seriously brush up my French you know tuta puta kind of a French and all that but then you know I sent a note and left it with one of those people who are accompanying him and they very promptly called me and it was very strange you know people are so generous and kind at times you don't know why they pick you or what I was his rookie fellow you know I mean with absolutely no background and then they called me he said see Mr. Derrida will be free for about 15 minutes you can ask him whatever you want just before he starts this other lecture so I went and I honestly don't remember what I asked him I didn't have a tape recorder to record I think I had a record or something some very old tape some very strange thing so I asked him about Gandhi asked him about Chomsky and I asked him about his own thing one or two things of chromatology a few questions very very academic theoretical something that would not fit into a journalistic piece that I had to write I had been sent to write so I came by I was very happy so I went around telling that Derrida has given me an interview and I had taken a picture with him so I had everything that one had to so this was just 10 or 15 minutes of his tape but then I sat back in the room that night and I was staying at this tandoor hotel what had become called a tandoor hotel and then I sat there there was this I still remember the table was you know I mean it was a stone slab kind of a table and I said I should you know I mean this is my great moment I should craft a piece which will appeal to a larger Kannada audience and it I should introduce Derrida instead of saying that I interviewed I should introduce him so I was reading Feynman at that time you know Richard Feynman's books you know I mean you're surely joking Mr Feynman all the usual stuff that you read at that age and then there was a poem that he had used in some different context I wonder why I wonder why I wonder why I wonder why so I took that and I sort of tried to apply the principles of deconstruction to that and then the question that I had made it a kichdi of something but it had a narrative the most important thing was it had a kind of flow and a narrative and when I gave it to my editor immediate editor here she said it's very good so I was stunned that you know when I had pulled off something and it was published as full two pages in Deccan Herald those days in the Sunday Herald I still have it full two pages I don't think any newspaper would ever you know give space like that today even I have been an editor of big newspapers I don't think I would I would think ten times before giving that kind of real estate you know to any writer so they gave me two full pages and my father was on cloud nine that day because you know I mean he thought his son had arrived and he had bet see as a he was my father was also used to bring out little magazines so he used to bring out a little magazine called Ankana then as a student he had started a magazine called Vimochane and then this so this whole habit of betting on people and writers it was a different kind of gamble was always and I think instinctually was there in him so he thought probably at this time that my son's the better I put on my son has worked so he's actually sort of pulled off something so because he was damn thrilled because that day morning I think around 7.15 because I remember where we were sitting and what we were doing and having coffee he got a call it was landline and D.R. Nagraj was on the other side my father used to be called Mestre in the sense teacher Mestre I read Sugata's piece has done a great job so my former and D.R. was a rising star in Kannada those days and my father for my father to hear that from D.R. Nagraj was a very very big thing and he said D.R. said this and he would not show it off but then he said good great but don't stop here you know you have to read more your responsibility increases because now the next time you make a mistake people will tear you apart now you are still a young fellow and you are publishing only in Karnataka tomorrow you may have to write for a bigger audience and people will not be as generous and kind so you have to be more thorough you know you have to be pakka with what you write and always make margin notes my father's books are always full of margin notes and pencil and all that and he used to keep notes he used to tell me that you have to do that too so I mean that's a habit that came to me also so I make a lot of notes when I read so that is something that happened at that point of time so that was the big break and then next year Chomsky came to India for the first time so again I wrote this thing and now I had a thing so they said okay go and I and another good thing was Chomsky's PhD student was my linguistics teacher at Hyderabad Central, Prabhaldas Gupta. So I spoke to Prabhaldas Gupta and he said don't worry you come I'll get you access so so I went and I met him and then I wrote pieces again then when Edward Said came I did the same thing so I was more on this other side writing about literature, philosophy and I mean big theoreticians people with big ideas in the world and trying to make news out of them and trying to write features on them so that is how I framed my early journalism which was again a very very accidental kind of a thing from literature trying to be an academic and this academic thing I have to tell you this you know when I was going to Hyderabad and because I was so close to Gopal Krishna Adiga the great poet in Canada had just won the Kabir Sanman or something like that very big and there was this unhappiness that he had not been given the Gnanpeet and his student or his I mean the person of the next year Anant Moorthy had been given and there was this huge talk in Kannada literary circles that oh Anant Moorthy had lobbied it would have actually been Gopal Krishna Adiga because he was the trendsetter in Kannada and all that so I went to him and then he said what do you want I have nothing to give you you've done so much for me he was he was actually a quite a rebel actually you know I mean he had given up his jobs and his poetry was something had a very humane and connected with me so I did something very stupid so I told him I love this poem of yours it is so philosophical and it's so small can I have it in your own hand I would like to frame it so he said okay get me a paper and get me a pen which with good ink or whatever so I took a sketch pen and a big poster kind a3 kind of sheet and went and gave it to him and the next day he had kept two copies there I did not realize till that point he had had a stroke and he could not write and this man did not want to deny me that I still keep it in my study it's the most precious thing that I have of a great Kannada writer having written this poem for me and he gave me two and he said see this there's too much of my hand is shaken a lot here I could not write properly so when it stabilized a little I've written another one I kept both and I had tears in my eyes and then he said Sugata you're going to Hyderabad you're going to a very good university those days I think it was only JNU and HCU were the only two central universities said you're going to a good place and when you come back you know people should stand up and say call you professor Sugata and you know they should you know respect you so you should I want you to do well of course I mean by the time I came back he was gone so that was the kind of academic dream that my father put into me Adiga put into me my mother of course was dreaming of something else but then this is the kind of intellectual environment so I think I'll stop there and then probably wait for you to ask me the next"

        "message": "thing. Thank you for these remarkably rich recollections I have like 15-20 things to double down on I'll begin with this when you know when I first recorded with Ram Guha like this time I recorded my fifth episode with him but when I first recorded with him I think it would have been 2018 or so I forget the year we did a couple of episodes on Gandhi and I think when we recorded the second of them he said you want to come with me in the evening I'll be you know Rajmohan Gandhi's book on South India is being launched and I'll be chatting with him and I said sure I'll come so in the evening I went and Ram and Rajmohan were having a chat and it was like Shahrukh Khan and Amitabh Bachchan would have a chat in Bombay it was that kind of crowd like I was blown away there was like standing room only it was completely packed absolute pin drop silence when they were speaking incredible engagement from the audience when the audience questions came about and I thought to myself that my god if you had this in Mumbai you would have like four people and a dog show up right and not a dog because you don't allow dogs indoors but it would be like that and that was kind of my first exposure to sort of seeing this environment in Bangalore and subsequently I have come here I like to tell people that you know Church Street is my favorite street in the whole world because all these bookshops including the Blossoms and all that you know I remember once when I was recording with Ram I told him that when I was leaving after the recording he said where are you going I said I'm going to the best bookstore in the world it's Blossoms he said you fool it is not even the best bookstore on Church Street right and he went bookworm and I'm kind of kidding and exaggerating but in fact this time when I came he said have you visited the two best bookstores on Church Street but I want to then ask you about this sort of intellectual culture this respect for the intellect like you spoke about Herald giving you two pages for a piece on Derrida I can't imagine a Mumbai newspaper doing that or you know I'm not sure maybe in Calcutta they would but I don't think that would happen in Delhi either you know so on the one hand it's pretty obvious that you were kind of lucky to be born into a family of the sort you were born into with a father like that and therefore all his friends circle and all that but it's you know Bangalore itself seems to have some of that so tell me a little bit about you know am I over reading am I overthinking the intellectual culture of this place or you know has it always been this way for you and does it create a kind of a vicious virtuous cycle that once you have a culture like this it perpetuates itself younger people get drawn to it and it grows and in some other place where there might be similarly smart and intelligent people you don't have an ecosystem to begin with so no one gravitates towards it and that"

        "message": "becomes a vicious circle so thank you Amit that's a very interesting question because you spoke about Ram Gohar and Rajmohan Gandhi's meeting see the one thing we need to realize is Bangalore has many such circles and you know there's not one but many and you're obviously referring to a English kind of an environment but there are many such Kannada environments and there are a lot of infighting between those things so it makes it far more interesting so at you know I mean the 70s or the 80s or the 90s or even in the early 2000s you know I mean if you went to the Senate Hall of the Bangalore University and there used to be these debates and people used to come prepared to tear somebody down you know I mean I still remember there was this some presentation on post-colonial theory or some Eliot or something was happening you know I mean I forget what it was but then Anant Murti was there in the audience and that used to be common you know I mean people used to come even if they are not speakers they would come they would sit down and they would raise questions and one of the speakers said you haven't even read the text why are you asking questions reading the blurb you know I mean that kind of combative thing you know you were exposed to that even as a young boy of in my ninth class D.R. Nagaraj actually sort of pulled down I mean of course pulled on this is on in a seminar hall you know he sort of you know accused another literary critic who was very close to our family of course I called him uncle and unfairly and so that was a three-day seminar on Adiga or something you know when I forget what it is it was at the MES college that much I remember and a lot of small little magazines record have recorded that episode so so there I mean I mean I was so disturbed I came back and I read the original essay and I thought that D.R. had completely misrepresented that whole thing so the next day morning I asked the chair who was presiding over that session and I said I have to sort of you know speak for two minutes I want to make a submission on what happened yesterday and this was extremely unfair because he was attacking him because D.R. those days was a Marxist whatever thing this man was more central and centrist and whatever so there was this kind of ideological thing happening I didn't even realize all that you know I mean as I just wanted to defend someone whom I knew so I went promptly read up and I found that this man had misrepresented so I went up and I just said that this is what he quoted that is not there in the in the essay this is what he said that's also wrong and this is the third thing so I just wanted to it was kind of fact-checking of course the phrase fact-checking wasn't prevalent then you know I was just trying to counter so in the audience was this great man called his mentor of Girish Karnad who rewrote his plays initially helped him write his play as well he was from Dharwad he was an English professor who had taught in Gujarat and he had come back and retired there it is name is not coming and it'll come back so he was there in the audience and there was there was another great writer so the moment I came down they just patted my back and they said taming of the shrew things like that so there were several such things and in Karnataka if you just go a little beyond Bangalore see Bangalore of course Gandhi Bazaar was one hub so I mean we don't even consider this side this side this was all later when crosswords and other big you know I mean bookshops came up that they started holding discussions on Bangalore for us this doesn't did not exist there was a iron wall between old Bangalore and Cantonment Bangalore so this was can't so we did not know the Koshy's you know we used to come to Koshy's because my great my maternal grandfather was a great fan of the chicken patties there so he used to bring us there but then otherwise you know this was a different world for us we didn't consider this part of Bangalore so for us it was Baswan Gudi one big hub then Gandhi Bazaar was a great thing then Jainagar, Maleshwaram so there were different hubs you know and different kinds of people congregated there and they fought and they you know had drink at the end of the day and then they just left so there was this great Kannada critic called Kiram Nagaraj and he was you know I mean he had he would he was great on Bendre and he was great on all the old Kannada writers like Kumar Avyasa and all that and we learnt a lot of poetry from him and he would sort of you know and he enjoyed his drink so he would come a little inebriated and you know create ruckus in seminar halls and that was a great thing for youngsters like us okay okay Kiram is going to just screw this person today let's listen or he would you know get drunk and get very upset with people writing songs for the cassette industry in Kannada let's say you write a song for I mean it was canonical of course you know I mean now I understand that this is this is a kind of you know I mean canonical structure there is a hierarchy which is not correct and should not be looked at that way it is all something that came later but at that point he would say you write you were born you know in Karnataka where Narsimh Swami wrote or a Pampa wrote or a Kumar and you write this dirty song I will tear it apart and that fellow would have taught him for five years or six years in the university and he would just and everybody would take it in in their stride because he was such a genius and a marvelous character and those characters you know I mean were allowed today everything is you cannot have such characters you know I mean today you only the such characters are there only in the right wing thing where they come and disrupt but here you had liberal characters who would come and confront you on on your reading of poetry and my reading of poetry so in fact the one phrase that he taught me he had read Harold Bloom or something and he told me Sugata it's okay you completely misread a poem no problem it's called the map of misreading he said I think it was an essay by Harold Bloom or I mean was it Levis and I forget but then he came he was the first who told me that you don't worry you misread everything that is also very important and it's that misreading actually leads you to a different kind of reading so he was a very insightful man and one day when I was at the Hyderabad Central University there was a knock on my room and I opened and I see Kiran he has come and he said sir you didn't even tell me he said no I told your father he must have forgotten to write a letter to you so then I said so why have you come he said no first buy me coffee I heard that there is a nice coffee thing there let's go so we I bought him coffee and he said no I have come here looking for a book by Alfred B Lord it's called the singer of tales this is establishes conclusively it's like he is Alfred B Lord was Milton Parry and all these were one group of people looking at classical literature and it establishes that Homer's thing was a part of the oral culture it was not a written classic so I want to look at it I wanted to read that book that book I heard there's one copy in your Central University library it's not even available in JNU so can you get me that I'll photocopy leave by the evening bus my god so he had come there to just pick up that book then I was so happy and I had heard a new name of an author and I wanted to read it and then for me it gave me a new leg up right I could go to the classroom and say what are you talking about Odysseus or Homer or Iliad you know I mean this is all part of the oral culture it all got stringed up together and then at some point in history it got written it got published and then you now think it was a written work there is no authorship to that see Barth had argued about authorship so much about work and text and he was making a distinction between all of that so here I had this new let thing to go and say that come on you know I mean what are you talking you know so Kiram he used to be called Kiram so we used to pun on the word rum because he used to always be consumed by old monk right so he was so passionate about his poetry and his house was full of you know I mean papers and you know things thrown around and there was I mean I still remember reading the bathroom door open seeing him in bathroom door open he's sitting on the commode and reading you know Pampavartha Deepike which is an introduction to Pampavartha and you know that was the kind of image that he gave so there were a lot of such characters in Bangalore and Bangalore University was a great place it allowed it assembled a lot of good people there was K V Narayan was a great theoretician there was Kiram who was a genius and who never wrote a word but I mean was in Kannada we call it Thondi, oral you know I mean critic so he was there there was G. S. Shurudrappa who became the poet laureate and he was the head of the department he was keeping all these people together there was Siddalingaya who passed away a Dalit writer who had been brought in and there was Bhargur Ramchandra who was another stream of Kannada consciousness so there were different kinds of people they were all in the same department Kannada literature department and they were all looking in different directions they would come together to fight you know come together for some social whatever thing and then you know explored these ideas on you and I mean just throw it at you so that was the environment in Bangalore but if you stepped out of Bangalore there was Mysore again which is a great hub so you had the great man Kuvimpu sitting there you went to Bangalore the coast you had Karan sitting there and you went to Dharwad you had the great Bendre sitting there I don't know if you I mean for a non Kannada reader you should read the just is those two pages of Dom Morris's introduction on I mean Bendre where he says and this man this is a journey through Karnataka book that was commissioned by the government of Karnataka and Devraja was the chief minister in that he says this man goes there to meet a great poet who's one big non Pete and all that and he speaks to him only physics and numbers he's there with Leela Naidu his wife interviewing this great man and he confounds him you know confuses him completely is speaking only numbers asking for his date of birth and telling giving him some formulation and does not discuss poetry at the end of the day so there was that person and then there again these kind of fights were common there were three or four streets were one literary thought another three or four streets another so there was Shambha Joshi one of the finest minds that Karnataka and Kannada has seen was there and would not get along with this man and then there was Kal Burgi who was shot down because he was not he was not seen as in their league but then he was very important of course and then there was if you came to Hubli and I mean there were many more such things and then there was Gokhak of course VK Gokhak was a very important figure who became the who won the Gnanpeet of course but also became the chairman of the Central Sahitya Akademy and he was he had gone to Cambridge and he was from the time of Karnad and Karnad studied there if you so that was another intellectual hub but then that was the Bombay Karnataka region then there was the Hyderabad Karnataka region which was always you know presented this victimhood that we have been neglected our writing has been neglected so there was streams of Sufism and Adil Shahi literature and all of that getting you know mixed up there and it was producing wonderful stuff so that was there so Karnataka was full of such groups literary groups and intellectual groups and cultural groups scattered across Karnataka in fact there's a very interesting book in Kannada called Gedeyara Gumpu by Daba Kulkarni it speaks about the alliance between you know these relationship between these friends in Darwad and how they sort of built a literary culture there and of course there was Manohara Granthamala the publisher of AK Ramanujan and Karnad and Ananthamurthy and they had their Atta there and that was a small little bookshop it's still there and these people would get that was another group so these were different lobbies and Chandrasekhar Patil was there great polemicist he had studied literature at Leeds and come back and become a hardcore Kannada person and wrote great absurd plays in Kannada took on Lankesh and you know I mean marvelous poetry he wrote and then he used to when he came from when he shifted from Darwad to Bangalore he used to say I have come to lobby nagara this is a place of lobby you so you come and lobby here actually Bangalore has nothing you know that kind of a thing gulabi nagara lobby nagara you know that kind of a pun used to used I mean garden city right gulabi nagara and things like that so he was there so there were different groups you know across Karnataka so all these groups played different kinds of roles and put different kinds of pressures and brought in different kinds of ideas during the unification of Karnataka itself so they all the all you can trace all of this back to the unification movement then there was of course Sriranga Shashi Deshpande's father the giant Kannada writer you know I mean for us Shashi Deshpande is of course known to the English world for us Sriranga is more important similarly Gauri is known to the world outside now and for very unfortunate reasons but then it is Lankesh who is more important for us so I mean there is Adiga who is more important than an Anantamurthy known to the Western world of course Ramanujan is equally respected that's a very strange thing because Ramanujan had his firm footing in Kannada he wrote extraordinarily he did extraordinarily good work in Kannada and then Tamil and then it was a genuine trilingual English and all of that so there were there were these kinds of very interesting fights and intellectual disagreements and things that were happening in Karnataka and being my father's son I was a witness to all of this so this this thing that you mentioned about Ramguha and Rajmohan Gandhi was a was something that was taking off in Bangalore which was a literary culture in English so that came to dominate in a different way through translations and others and now it's a very sad thing that you don't see those arguments anymore literally I wrote a piece it's part of my first book where I spoke of the death of Little Magazines and I spoke about how Little Magazines had just died in Kannada and why it had happened so why it so happened and that you know I mean they had lost team and then to shut shop and how they were run in fact I was I quote if I remember correctly I'm please pardon me if I'm wrong I quote from the obituary that was written in the Boston Globe for Plimpton the person who had started the Paris Review he had passed away I think around 2004 I mean I don't remember the date again I may be wrong so there the Little Magazines were described as showcases of you know I mean I forget the phrase also I mean it was beautifully described where the kind of fragile economic environment in which they always ran but had great amounts of passion and all of that so that is sort of gone now even your cultural heroes are different now in Karnataka and Bangalore your cultural heroes are people who have by default have become people who have or philanthropists who made money who have sort of you know I mean led IT industries so there are no longer people you know I mean Akiram cannot be a cultural hero and Adiga is nobody's cultural hero a Kuvempu I mean a stalwart I think he would have made any language feel great you know I mean he was I mean a remarkable mind he is I mean lost in some sense but I don't want to say lost because they'll all be recovered in different ways and I don't want to have this nostalgic kind of thing I don't want to live in the past and say that was great and today is bad but this is these are trends and phases that we are seeing where your heroes are dead you don't have heroes like you had then you know where you said okay this is this is a character this has to be nurtured is straight out of a novel so he probably will get into my novel you know you looked at it in a very fascinating you didn't judge there was a narrative that was always running in your head so you did not stop to judge so that was something that is something that I miss in Bangalore today today it's more corporatized even the book event is very corporatized even you know I mean I mean I have seen what has happened with my own book you know when you have to do it you know I mean it's a very kind of it's not organic you know people don't come and fight in the middle of the street and say you have written nonsense you know I would have loved that that doesn't happen you know and very carefully crafted whatsapp messages that come to you and they say oh it's good but you know I mean but this you're missing this oh I mean there was no such kind of holding back because there was people understood each other and people knew that at the end of the day you're not going to be an enemy of that person you can have a lifelong grudge and that he said this but then you would always go back to it was a small culture you were interdependent and it was a feeling of community I think that is the word there was a sense of community and running a little magazine I write in that piece was like a cottage industry see my father used to edit he used to proofread but the book post wrap that would go around it was used to be done by my mother she would put the Gandhi stamp one rupee stamp or whatever at the edge and then they would both go you know taking this to the post office and mail it so that is that used to be a bimonthly activity that I was witnessed to as a child it started in 79 and shut shop in I think 91, 91 is very significant Indian economy got liberalized opened up at that time so that is that was the kind of and people did not worry about you know they're losing money or you know I mean oh this is an investment gone bad or this is an investment that will get you nothing you did it you know you had a higher purpose culture or this whole linguistic environment I mean you also need a small group which pushes you to do that you have to be supported in different ways you have to be told that you know I mean this is good this is great this is something which so I think everybody lost that at some point that disconnect started happening of course it will all get connected back in different ways but then that disruption did happen in with huge money with huge real estate booms in Bangalore and now we know what Kannada professors do in Kannada Karnataka's universities you know they all do side businesses you know of different kinds I don't think there is serious kind of work that is happening and at least you know I mean I mean I'm not really aware but of course there are pockets there are islands of good work there are there's still a lot of hope and you will reconstruct all of that in a in a different context at a later point is what I feel I think you're comparing what"

        "message": "is there now to the past you know well I compare it to the present in other places and I'm like saying wow what a rich culture and even though I can only see one tiny part of it the English elite kind of part of it so you know before I go back to some of the other questions I you know have planned a slightly provocative question and this starts with like a slight anecdote so you know there's there's a guy in Bangalore his name is Shakeel I've never I haven't met him yet and he's a huge fan he's been a huge fan of the scene and the unseen been writing to me for years listens to every episode take takes notes did my writing course so for a while he was insistent that he wants to send me a gift and I was like that no boss it's okay you don't need to send me a gift and he said that no no let me send it to you or I'll have to give it to you when you come to Bangalore he's he's in Bangalore and it's very heavy I don't know how you'll manage so give me a postal address I will send it to you so finally I relented and said okay let's do it so then two weeks later this big carton comes right and I open the carton and it's full of books in Kannada right by one guy I've forgotten the name now so please forgive me but I think it's poet but it's it's essays and poems and all of that by so and I don't know Kannada right so I asked him that you know what's the deal so he said no Amit your work means a lot to me and this other person his work means even more to me and I wanted to introduce you to his work but there aren't translations and I'm hoping that you will learn Kannada and read his books now it is a sad reality of our modern times that I may not do that but having said that while I have you know while we moved house I gave away a lot of my other books because I was in space I've kept the carton because the sentiment means something to me right but why I'm bringing it up here is that it shows that it shows a deep passion for language and literature right and it strikes me as something that I would expect more from someone in the south of India whether it is Karnataka or Tamil Nadu or whatever than someone in the north I can't imagine and I don't mean to be harsh but just in probabilistic terms it is far less likely that someone from a Patna or wherever is going to sort of an apologies to all Patnaites I think I just got myself into trouble and clearly from what we just discussed about the deep cultural sort of little neighborhoods all over Karnataka and all of that there is this engagement with culture with language with the arts in South India that is not so much there among the Amits as it were as Twitter people would say because Amit has become a sort of a shorthand for North Indian buffoons and sadly I have to bear that name so this is therefore a provocative question it just struck me we have many more interesting things to talk about but I just wonder that don't people like you sometimes look at what is happening in the rest of the country and you're like why the hell have we been buffeted together with these you know uncouth morons you know and it's incredible you know up there they have no idea of South India they think that you know Hindi should be natural language and we have tolerated you and whatever and all of that shit and they have that kind of attitude right and and they are of course you know multiplying like rabbits while South India is chilling listening to good music watching good plays and which is not to say there aren't outliers in the north as well but if I was in the south I would be like to hell with this shit and a question that I've asked my guests in recent episodes also is that we often take the status quo for granted in such a way that it seems like it is solidified it is granite and to me one of those concepts is nation states lines on a map right where you look at the current nation state a lot of it is happenstance right to me like a Delhi has much more in common with Lahore in a good way than it does with Chennai for example you know a few years later we'll have the delimitation problem coming up which can also be sort of something that and I can totally and friends of mine joke about this that we should have the Republic of South India and blah blah blah so yeah so it's just a it's not even a question per se it's just a provocative thought but I wonder if you feel this way sometimes and that you know I mean I come to Bangalore it feels like a different country in a sense I mean it's the same country and I love the whole country but you know what are your thoughts it's very interesting that"

        "message": "you say this but then I mean I've also been fairly acquainted with say through my father as well as later to with the kind of Lucknowi kind of literary environment or I we spoke about the Bengali literary environment you know people are very very passionate my father had great linkages with writers in Bengal and Abhinita Shendev you know I mean there's he there's a joint kind of travelogue that he writes with us I mean he's his part of the travel he's a character in that travelogue where they go to meet this lady and this great grand lady of Bengal and they don't know what to call her they come out of this thing and they call her lady Kiram the Kiram that I was referring to because she's so passionate about poetry and she's spoken to them so much about that so for me you know I mean I don't know if it is a problem with me but I was shown only these things the good things my father had a good relationship with Bisham Sahani so we still have a lot of letters exchanged between the two of them and I have a copy of Thomas which is signed for him and then he would so meticulously inquire after my grandmother's health and stuff like that you know I mean so so there was always these Kartar Singh Duggal another name so Bengal Lucknowi and even in Delhi if you mentioned the partition thing and then in Delhi I had we had rather the family had a Sharda Prasad who mentored me you know I mean and Sharda Prasad was such a cultured man who would host Malik Arjun Mansoor and Shivram Karanth and all these people who were dissenting against Indira Gandhi's emergency at his house you know and he was still part of the PMO so it was that contradiction he never thought that you know I mean he was compromised you know anything like that because Karanth used to stay with this man and Karanth he has translated Karanth's book you know I mean the autobiography and has a couple of novels and all of that and Sharda Prasad is extremely good and so we were always painted this I don't know if my father painted these romantic pictures for us so there was this problem until and unless I started writing seriously on say federalism or finance commissions and GST and looking at the federal issues between the south and the center and how the whole centralization problem operates and that's I've been writing a lot about it in my columns in the times these days on that so I now feel that you know I mean feel more strongly that we are a union of states and there's less common but even having said that and I think I should also sort of add this caveat which is see you had a Andhra Pradesh right a united Andhra Pradesh and it was the one of the first linguistic states that was created after Poteshwar Ramlu started protesting and he has he dies and all that but look at what happened with Andhra Pradesh there was a cultural kind of breakage so the Telangana culture was different and the Andhra culture was different and when we were growing up you know when there was this pride injected about Kannada because Kannada had got so many Gnanpeeths so we thought that Telugu was a lesser thing or a Tamil was a lesser thing but that was not the case but then you know I mean you always sort of you were allowed to go on a certain highway or a certain path and you only saw these kind of markers so I may not be a fair judge of you know what what happens in a Patna thing or other places because I was not exposed to that but my political writing later took me to you know cover elections and all that then I saw that these places were you know what's wrong with these places why aren't they developed if you go to Hassan I write about it in 2009 much much before I even dreamt of writing a book on Deve Gowda that it's an island of some kind of a great development because Deve Gowda had everything going in that thing you know every scheme every central scheme the highways the roads you know you know I mean fantastic development in that place but if you go to say a Rai Bareilly or an Amethi you know you you feel like crying as to what is it that these people have done why is it that they have been showered with so much of affection by these people continuously you go to a filibit where Nehru used to contest his election you know everything looks completely dilapidated and dismantled and nothing seems to be working you know I mean but in Karnataka that was when I started making that it was not cultural see culturally you still got you you you sort of entered into something through a text or through a person or through a song right so Urdu for example I was so fascinated by Urdu at some point I wanted to learn to write and read Urdu but it never happened but then all my Urdu came through the Hindi films so this 60s and the 70s and the great lyricists and I was obsessed with the Hindi film music and now I have Mr. Chiranjeev Singh you know whom I call up the great bureaucrat who served the state a Punjabi extremely cultured India's ambassador to UNESCO at one point and I just call him up and I ask him sir why don't you explain this to me he can I ask him about Bengali poetry ask him what Urdu poetry I ask him about Punjabi poetry he himself writes Punjabi poetry and he's so kind to explain all of that to me so I mean these things were happening so you you enter through text and there is this politics which you enter through experience and you're you know you're sort of seeing it there happen so these two were different worlds for me when I was shocked when I started writing for outlook say on on these states and all that and but this this cultural thing never came up to me because I thought that that is still relevant that is still sort of their subsumed subterranean and it does not manifest itself in popular culture the way we need to but but we should also recognize that Hindi films probably sort of finished off all of this right because you know it was such a dominant thing in the north that it finished everything but in Canada or Telugu or Tamil I think there was still a bit of literary export into into films one of the great literary influences my father had was his uncle who was a bank manager and he was a great literary influence because he was the first reader of one of Karnataka's great Canada's great novelists Tarasu Tarasu Barao and Tarasu Barao wrote historical novels size which I mean huge novels and many of those were made into movies for Rajkumar right so so there was a lot of this that we were exposed to and not exposed to the other side but I became a very serious political writer only after I think went to Hindustan times I because I had it was by force that I had to look at different kind of material and even there you know you when I when I went to Jaipur to be an editor I used to go and create my own little you know I mean comfort zone of culture and literature with the writers there and with oral historians and and think that that is there that is the soul of that place and this is there of course there is Gaylord there is Bhairav Singh Shekawat whom you have to deal with for your pet ka sawal hai, theek hai likh lenge isme kya but then you all also bought the experience you also took the experience of your literary and cultural thing there and started looking at them as characters and so Bhairav Singh Shekawat was to used to be very fond of me used to be very nice to me in fact you know I mean even before he became the vice president of India used to lock up the latch up the door and used to give me a single small peg of black label or whatever whiskey I mean I've had whiskey with Bhairav Singh Shekawat and the age difference must have been you know me say 50-60 years you know you don't know so he was very very great and he liked me because I came from again very interesting he liked me because I came from Karnataka he liked me because I was somewhat related to Devraj Aras and Devraj Aras whom he saw as a great administrator statesman and all that and and a person who had revolutionized you know political thinking and all of that so so there were lots of these connections so then he was nice and then you you sort of started looking at these people for what they were but then there was other there was politics of course so that made my copy interesting so I used to sort of bring in this little insight about the man who newspapers would be rubbishing as you know I mean oh he's sold out or whatever this is but then there was this little thing about the man which would sort of come into my copy which would sort of give my copy a bit of a extra sparkle which made my copies more humane and then I used to sort of look at them not to judge them I used to look at them to sort of understand them and that's something that I got from my very early literary training and my father was someone like that who would listen even to this day he's mythologized you know in Kannada memoirs and a lot of people have written about how they used to come sit in front of him talk for hours he would not just speak anything and then they would just leave that's it and they would feel happy after that so that was the kind of person my father was I am not so reticent as him you know I'm I was my mother used to call me you know punning or the word Churchill Churchill in church in Kannada is debating so she would say you're a Churchill so you always you know you know get into an argument about something or the other so but my father was not like that but that but that that you quietly absorbed that and that came into my political writing also which did not make me did not sort of make me feel that I was doing something else completely divorced from my cultural reading or literary reading or whatever because when I I took all of that into my political thing so when I sat with these big people and I still remember Shekhar was telling me he came back from Delhi that evening and then he telephoned he said Bhaisahab kya kar rahe hain a jaaye hain you know and then I went and had good food and he spoke about his son-in-law and some unhappiness and all that in the family and then he said you know what I did today I went and had lunch with Advani I said why did you do that he said no I want to sort of make Vajpayee very alert about it you know Vajpayee is ignoring me so I just want want him to know that I've had lunch with Advani and then I said were you successful he said ha by the time I was leaving I got a call so Vajpayee called me he said what are you doing what were you doing there why are you doing this to me come let's have a chat so then they had broached the issue of becoming he becoming the vice-president so so I mean he used to he used to be such a he used to just disarm you by sharing things which you thought was was you know I mean high intrigue or whatever he said this is human see he would he would make if Vajpayee was human Advani was human and Shekhawat was human and then they would sort of you know that those jealousies or those kind of dynamics between them he would sort of share it in a very interesting fashion and then he said I just had to go to Advani's house for lunch to sort of get the antenna up there and Vajpayee's house and Vajpayee came to know of it obviously so he called me and then of course we broached this whole thing so I may be the vice-president of India so this was how he revealed to me that he would he may be the vice-president of India I was in Jaipur at that time so so political writing too for me was an extension of my cultural understanding of things I mean it was a it was a it was very important for me not to look at it as data so that is the reason why I keep sort of saying that you know people who really don't want to sort of speak about politics hide behind data because good political writing for me is of course data is there it's very very important it's it's extremely important to read it very carefully but then it's both a mix of emotion and reason because politics is full of emotion it is not reason alone you cannot sort of say why Devya Gowda did this or did not do this or why he goes to his temple so often I mean why did you know in Shekhawat sort of do this so I mean this is something that I have not been able to sort of effectively pass on to say the generation after me to tell them that see don't your graphs and your data is all very important but that does not say much about the person but if you want to write about the person you have to spend time with him look at him a little with critical sympathy is a phrase that my other guru the great guru who would change me after I went to England was Jeremy Seabrook was the one who used it first and he has used it for my book as well which makes me very proud so so critical sympathy you know you can you can be critical you know because all these seminars that and the conferences that I used to go where people used to you know I mean tear each other apart and then be having a whiskey at the end of the day or a rum at the end of the day it was all natural to me I mean for me it did not sort of make me look at this this thing as a black and white thing or a confrontationalist thing yes it's right as part of a culture it is a culture so when politicians you know I mean just shoot away in the on the floor of the house you know call names and then they're having a nice chat it does not surprise me because you know I mean it's I've seen that happen elsewhere in a different setting so I mean they're human beings you know I mean primarily I think we don't look at our politicians as human beings we seem to look at them as power you know filled with power some instruments of power which which they are not actually they are very humane they can be very humane they can be very cruel and that cruelty is also part of you know I mean you'll observe that cruelty much more only if you are willing to go beyond your data and sort of look at them interestingly so so for me it is I mean the silos that you spoke about does not really operate in in those ways it's it's a one continuous thing for me I take this with me there so therefore I see that there and then when I don't see that there I try to reason it out in a completely different way so so but but this whole Republic thing of South as a that South should succeed kind of a thing I don't want to create a controversy but but you know I mean India is a union of states what Rahul Gandhi said was correct in the parliament I wrote a column on that yeah you've you mean trying to create you know manufacture a nation with so much of diversity and so much of you know I mean dissonance and whatever it's it's it's a very false idea right you cannot you cannot you know in any it's inconceivable to sort of think that everything is flat you know to say one nation to say one you know religion one language it's a it's it's utmost stupidity to sort of speak of that and if somebody is trying to do that they're actually should be you know I mean they're they're actually trying to break up this nation you know they are accusing others of breaking up this nation actually the ones who speak of oneness are the ones who are to be charged with the the severest of sedition you know laws because they are the ones who are actually trying to break this whole thing up because if you don't allow this nation to exist the way it has been knit now loosely for whatever you know in some destiny of this nation you know when has put it together in this form if you want to retain it if you're serious about retaining this this whole nation in this form and it's in the same contours that it is in now I don't think you can impose I mean anything on this nation forget about doing it in the south you can't do it even in the Kashmir you can't do it in Bengal you can't do it you've seen reaction to the whole thing now this whole federal argument is coming back I'm very happy it's coming back because in 2018 I was a loner when I used to speak about it even Stalin was not back in power Stalin was not interested to listen to these arguments so federalism argument is coming back for me cultural federalism is more important than political federalism I think they have to move a step further so the Tamils try to make the Dravidian thing their cause but you know I mean if they are to argue for the Dravidian cause they have to actually be more inclusive they have to look at Andhra, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala far more inclusively so it the Tamil exclusive idea is also not going to serve them well which they don't seem to realize at this point of time because you know the Dravidian thing has been completely captured I mean this is seen as a kind of their idea their thing their civil if it's a civilizational thing it can't be just yours so if you are using that to confront the north if you are using your the alternate epics that you have to confront the north and try to say that we are a different country I mean there are fascinating I don't know Amit if you have had this chance to see fascinating debates in Rajya Sabha in the 60s when Anna Durai was a Rajya Sabha member brilliant speeches on this whole thing and you could speak about you know breaking away from India until 65 I think this whole idea was different so brilliant speeches you know and he makes a cultural argument and even if you look at forget Rajya Sabha even if you look at the assembly Karnataka unification debates it's fascinating A.H. Ram his name was Ramchandra Rao I think Devagoda's mentor in Hassan he was the education minister he has a three-hour speech where he speaks about cultural differences and why Mysore should not integrate with the rest of Kannada speak is this on YouTube or something no it's you know just from the 50s yeah so it's it can't be there it's there is a it's an official record of the Karnataka legislature assembly it was those days it used to be called the Mysore legislature assembly you had you renamed only in 73 so it became Karnataka in 73 so you those debates are fascinating and you are not on you don't want there was a huge resistance to Mysore integrating with rest of Karnataka because they were impoverished area they were this would it would bring down the GDP of Mysore right so they didn't want that and as a result culturally Mysore dominated the rest of Karnataka culturally political power has shifted but culturally because the standard dialect that you use in Kannada today is a dialect that was spoken in Mysore so that became the standard thing that became your textbook language so the others who sacrificed because they were all fringes of other linguistic states so they were desperate more than the Mysoreans to become part of Karnataka so they gave up their dual identities they surrendered their Marathi there's there they surrendered their Urdu they're surrendered their Dakhani and Telugu Tamil everything and they became part of Karnataka and wanted to be identified with a Kannada state and now you see the kind of you know I mean rumblings that there are that people are not at all happy this this whole thing is this after the Telangana's formation I think it has become even more sharper where people say development is one part not giving enough funds for development is one part but the cultural differences the you know the kind of characters in Kannada movies you if you I mean since you don't see Kannada movies you may not realize this all the guys who are cooks who play the role of characters of cooks or whatever they're all from coastal Karnataka so they're not given the lead role then the jesters and the comedians and all of them speak a certain kind of Hyderabad sorry Darwad Hubli Darwad kind of Kannada which is very you know I mean it's not very smooth it's like the East Godavari Telugu and the Telangana Telugu it's very rough edges are more in the Telangana thing they have rough edges they come across as very very you know I mean it sounds very harsh the language sounds very harsh so but they're not people like that they're see it's their expression is like that they've spoken like that for centuries but you know I mean the Mysoreans look at it take a take offense to that kind of a usage in fact I was on a train recently to Goa and I was looking at I mean because I I mean I as there was a family which was sitting and they were using the word Gussa so beautifully in Kannada you know in their Kannada sentence so she that lady who was you know I mean sitting family and this little kid and she was telling me how this girl gets Gussa and she was putting it in Kannada you know I mean and then repeatedly I didn't want to make her conscious tell me how it sounded I mean even if I don't understand this girl is very angry see I mean you see and I instantly could understand that they had come from the Hyderabad Karnataka region and they had settled in Bangalore and they were going to go for a trip and similarly if you go towards Kolar and KGF and all that the Telugu you know Telugu is another language but that you know I was very familiar because my father was very familiar with Telugu and he studied in Chikbalapur because his aunt was widowed and my grandfather had a I mean transferable job so they kept the children in one place so that they could go and study there and all that so he had he says Telugu was extremely good he could read and write Telugu so if you go to those regions you go to Kolar, Chikbalapur, Chikbalapur is now a separate district but was part of undivided Kolar district so if you go there Telugu is a street language if you go to Mangalore you have Tulu, you have Biari, you have Konkani and then you have Kannada so I mean none of the Karnataka see Karnataka is not a state which wears its chauvinism on its sleeves like a Tamil or a Malayali whatever thing happens not so much Malayalam but they don't because you know when there are only three or four hardcore Kannada districts rest of them are all bilingual or trilingual areas the street market language is different from your kitchen language the language that you use in your kitchen to converse with your family is your mother tongue or whatever and then you come to the street and you speak say Tulu if you're in Mangalore and then if you're if you're you know into trade or whatever you use Biari because it's the Muslim traders who use Biari and then there is the schools and other places set up by Christian missionaries where Konkani is very dominant there is a there's a whole debate as to how Konkani should be written in which script because that language doesn't have a script and my wife is a Konkani so that is a fascinating thing so Karnataka is again if you look at forget as we spoke the rest of India and the diversity that exists even in the small little state which is the size of a big European country of course there is so much of division and so when I go to Europe and when friends make arguments about Catalonian or Basque or Breton or what I understand it completely well and I don't judge them for that and they say what do these fellows do you know I mean they don't know anything Basque has this thing this expression is so beautiful in the Basque language so that's why that's how I became very very close to my friends in Ireland when I used to work with the Irish times in Dublin for a very short period so because there was a revival happening of the Irish language and I went and made a very controversial statement in a newspaper article that I wrote for the Irish times and I said all these Yeats and Beckett and Joyce all of you all of them you call Irish writers but for us they're English writers because it came through the colonial curriculum and these people whom you celebrate as Irish writers had turned their backs to the Gaelic language or the Celtic culture so why do you celebrate them you know that kind of a very provocative piece which was hugely appreciated because it was the literary editor of Irish times at that time wonderful lady called Caroline Walsh she sort of drowned herself very sadly a few years ago but she was so appreciative of it and I only later realized she was the daughter of the great Mary Levin the short story writer of Ireland and she had dabbled with those issues and she had was very familiar and when this argument was being made I said she said you just write and I was a I was just 26 27 I think and then they got my photograph my my mug photo for an article first appeared in a European newspaper not in any of the Indian newspapers and they were so happy and then they called me for a radio debate like others and then I just explained my ideas and they were so surprised that I know so much of English literature without realizing that we had we were only exposed to Shakespeare and Beckett and Yeats and Joyce all of that so so so I mean I was a small hit you know I mean when I was there with them so Caroline Walsh and they were so welcoming they took you home and they she was so happy with that argument she took me home and her husband was a novelist so she said he's made this argument I'm getting him to write and then she took then there was another person called Paddy Woodworth who was in the foreign desk and he was very familiar with the Basque thing you know when he was very so he was very interested in this argument and then they got me to write a piece on Rajkumar had been kidnapped by Virappan here and that was a completely they didn't know how to understand the whole thing they said please explain to a European audience as to why a film star is being kidnapped in the first place and why is why is it such a big issue and why is the state shut down because a film star has been kidnapped and why is the state government negotiating why are the state agencies getting involved in this whole thing then I had to tell them that this person called Rajkumar is not an actor he's a cultural icon and he was such a powerful guy that in 1954 I think he's made his debut in Kannada and then his the reunification movement was happening at the same time and you know how they identified the outer reaches of Karnataka wherever his films ran were considered Karnataka see it's great for an actor I mean to get such so so so involved with the you know map map of the state or you know contours of the state when it was just accidental but then it was a great thing to happen so I'm this Kannada that he spoke was the was the standard Kannada they said he speaks Kannada the best or one should speak Kannada like him so he was not very educated in fact he's all his speeches he says why are you giving me this doctoral degree I am a I am not very educated all that but then to explain all this to a Western audience was a fantastic experience for me and then that is when I started thinking about all this also so diversity you go to Europe you go to come to South you look at Karnataka I look at India it's completely foolish and completely idiotic and it's not a sustainable project to speak of this one nation one one religion one language and all that and and of course I mean I'll speak to you later about how nationalisms and sub-nationalisms themselves have undergone a transformatory"

Welcome back to the scene in the unseen I'm chatting with Sugata Srinivasa Raju about his rich life as it turns out I mean I thought we might talk about his book with Deve Gowda and maybe we'll get to it at some point and maybe we won't because I'm thoroughly enjoying this conversation and this trip you're taking me you know through your life and through your times and all of that my next question actually comes out of something two of the guests I've recorded with earlier this week I've mentioned and one Ram Guha was talking about this classic essay he wrote the death of the bilingual intellectual where he lamented that once upon a time they used to be bilingual intellectuals and now they're not and it's a loss and Akar Patel when I mentioned to him that I'd be chatting with you he said oh Sugata is a true bilingual person right and and that's actually something that I envy and feel as a loss in the sense that I am multilingual in the sense I can speak and understand multiple Indian languages but there is only one language really in which I consume art and in which I can express myself which of course is English which I'll consider an Indian language but it is just one language and I feel that loss more and more when I speak to people like you or Mrinal Pandey or Sarah Rai or others who've been on the show and they talk about and there's so much richness all around me which I don't have a means to experience and and when you were talking about sort of growing up and being bilingual and translating from English to Kannada and trying to translate the other way and so on and so forth one of the things that struck me and I did an episode on translation with Arunabh Sinha and I couldn't agree more and he was of the same view that translation in a sense is impossible every language is so fundamentally different that you know it's almost an act of creation to translate something because you try to capture the essence and then you try to you know recreate that as it were but it also strikes me that if you are that fluent in multiple languages you are living multiple lives you have multiple brains you know in the because languages are so different and they are gateways to such different worlds that you are no longer one person you are as many people as the languages you are and I'm it's a little simplistic you are exposed to multiple milieus within each language perhaps as well but you know and and therefore it seems that that sort of you know richness and diversity is just incredible so what are your sort of thoughts on this?"

        "message": "Amit, yeah I mean it's the death of the I remember that essay by Ram Guha I think it was in the EPW if I'm right I don't know if I wrote to him after that essay after reading that essay and around that time I delivered the H.Y. Shadaprasad memorial lecture this was I think 2012 of April for his birthday and it was titled bilingualism as a cultural idea so it was a long lecture and I think I raised a few questions about that essay in my lecture I of course forget what what it was I don't I don't remember the specifics of it but I in I mean in general I agree with what both with what Ram Guha is saying speaking about the death of a bilingual and there are various reasons for that you know I mean one of the reasons that I have actually been discussing in my books I mean my earlier books on language not the Dev Ekavatar book is that see the sub-nationalist thing model earlier that is I would you know if one would roughly put a kind of ballpark decades say from the 30s when the consciousness started I mean 30s 40s 50s up to the 60s even early I mean 70s it started getting distorted a little so those precious four of four decades you imagined a Kannada nation as an inclusive nation so if you look at the early proponents of the Kannada nation like B. M. Shrikantaiah or people of his generation they are even you know I mean someone who is referred to as the father of the whole idea and Alur Venkat Rao and others but they were all extremely inclusive in their imaginations you know me and B. M. Shrikantaiah in fact translates a bunch of hymns and songs and poems from English into Kannada and calls it English Geethegalu and those English Geethegalu were never English Geethegalu for a Kannada audience it became Kannada songs nobody remembers in fact that they were actually originally written in another language and they were translated into Kannada for example there is a very popular prayer in Kannada which nobody remembers and I don't want to remind them that it was written by a pastor in I think it's a Welsh pastor whatever I mean it's a song it's a poem it's a prayer which is so popular in Kannada that nobody remembered that it was a translated thing so that is the it speaks about the quality of the translation but it also speaks about the reception of a culture so and it is completely Kannadized you know it's not a verbatim kind of a translation so it's Lead Kindly Light is the poem so it's become Karunalu Baa Belakku it's actually more beautiful in Kannada I mean I've been listening to a different versions of Lead Kindly Light being performed in orchestras and others in the west but then this is so beautiful and it's composed in Kannada so beautifully it's it's you have it in your memory can you Karunalu Baa Belakku Musukidhi Muppinali Kai Hidedu Nadesem Manu that is the that's how it sounds so lovely so beautiful it's lyrical it's it's it's amazing and it makes you feel like you are a middle class person making a prayer in the morning and you are sort of I mean there's a reason why I say middle class because it's it's literary and all that because there is another thing which where it is it wouldn't be a prayer for another community so so you are making this prayer you're sort of inviting light to sort of lead you and there are these tough times and all that and it became one part of movies it became part of a singing culture became part of the light music what is called as quote-unquote light music in Kannada what is as opposite to the classical music is called light music Bhava Geethe Bhava is emotion I think it in Hindi it would be called Sugam Sangeet Sugam Sangeet yeah it's Kannada also it's called Sugam Sangeet but then Bhava Geethe is a more popular and more appropriate way of sort of looking at that so all of these became great Bhava Geethe in Kannada so that was an inclusive kind of imagination of Kannada which you see in the translation of Greek plays coming into Kannada so they were borrowing heavily you know they were constructing a kind of modern literature because there was nothing modern in Kannada everything was you know I mean 15th century 1670s I mean that was all you know closed court kind of literature so you had to create this and you had someone like Masti Venkatesh Iyengar he was a you know I mean Mysore service officer of those days and he creates a writer's fund to publish young writer something that my father did and in a different generation in a different time and I he was inspired by all these people he creates a fund because he is he has this big fat salary and he's working for the Mysore administrative service and he's a big commissioner of this and that and he keeps this money aside from his salary and publishes you will not believe the first work of K. V. Puttappa who became the great mighty Kuvempu later Kuvempu is now not just a literary figure in Kannada he's like Rajkumar a cultural figure in Kannada so he publishes Kogile his first anthology of poems he would be staying in the Ramakrishna mission hostel in Mysore so he goes finds him and you know publishes these poems he publishes the first work of he gives money to Bendre to publish his poetry anthology he gives money to Shivram Karanth to publish his anthology so there is this activity happening and look at all those people Shivram Karanth the kind of work that he wrote was liberal humanism you know I mean the kind of thing that he brought into his literature you know I mean speaking about God or philosophy or anything for that matter or human relate all of it had a great enlightenment influence right so it was it was an enlightenment kind of a thing renaissance kind of a thing that was happening in Kannada and these people were constructing from the broadest possible kind of platforms and broadest possible influences and they were bringing it all into Kannada and they were all of them I mean Atis Kuvempu and these people desired to be English writers and they were sort of you know course corrected and made Kannada writers and so they were not opposing this or that and saying oh this is not mine this is not mine I will not take this this is so there was no such compulsion on their thing and of course there was a mild caste thing underlying thing but that was not so pronounced as it is today but they were making their choices very wisely and they were constructing a broad platform like Nehru constructed the idea of India in a very broad fashion these people and I think in every literature it was happening every regional space it was happening they were all seeing Aurobindo they were seeing Nehru they were seeing Gandhi and they were constructing a very different kind of cultural space see in Kannada Ramakrishna Paravamsa, Aurobindo all are huge influences Tagore the Bengalis the Bengali cultural you know milieu and literature and all of that had a huge influence and they were constructing similar and they were there was a spiritual kind of a you know I mean element to their writing and there was a liberal humanist streak and there was experiential elements and the two novels that Kuvampu wrote Malagalalli Madhumagulu and Kanuru Subba Mahigrithi are I think the two of the greatest novels that I have read I mean I have read Marquez I have read Joyce I have read you know I mean Hemingway and I have I mean sort of even Tolstoy but I think it stands in that same kind of place it takes the same kind of importance in my mind you know I mean and unfortunately it's not translated well there have been attempts and it's not so great but then you know I wouldn't worry about the translation bit because why I mean it's it's I mean it's it's difficult it's difficult to translate and convince another audience I'll I'll I have another comment on translation itself see I mean there are people who write to be translated and there are people who write for an audience they have a dialogue with their people so therefore you don't see a Lankesh being translated because he's having a dialogue with his community but there are certain writers in Kannada who are only known as pan-indian greats for example Karnad did not write good Kannada at all and he he speaks about it himself so so I mean Anant Murthy did not have a body of work he spoke more in fact Sharda Prasad very jokingly used to tell me that I think P V Narasimha was the chairman of the Nanpeet committee when Anant Murthy got it and P V N and Sharda Prasad were great friends so P V N asked him what do you think so he said I told Narasimha to sort of give it to him with the condition that his you know he writes more that's a that's a kind of interesting thing so there are I mean I'm not trying to say that they only wrote to be translated and if Samskara was not translated by Ramanujan I don't think it would have become such a big thing you know I mean because there were lots of similar stuff being written in different Indian languages at that point of time and there was the central saithya academy which for which which had a mandate to get Indian languages to have a dialogue between themselves it was not English centric not everybody wanted to get into English so you're enriching English you're not enriching your regional languages what is coming into you is a third or third degree or fourth degree removed kind of a thing reality that's coming into your languages so you're translating a Paulo Coelho or some other person or another person but you are not actually translating between Indian languages so this is something that I raised when recently there's some very big translation a fellowship was announced by the New India Foundation I wrote up my column in the Express saying why this is you know I mean something that lacks vision so you are giving so much money for somebody who's translating from an Indian language into English and so finally English gets enriched so that's something that has happened with English all the while because of its colonial kind of legacy or whatever English has borrowed so much from these languages and it has enriched itself but Kannada or a Telugu or a Tamil or a Marathi see there it's understandable because they don't get the same kind of importance or same kind of value if it is if it is bit between Indian languages because it gets sort of dissipated for them you know it that philanthropy doesn't look big if it doesn't come into English English is like an approval gang right it is like academicians who become approvers of everything that is getting written or spoken about they say somebody sitting in JNU or in Harvard or wherever or they say this is great oh it's great so these kind of approval gangs get created and they start judging literatures and without knowing much about what is happening inside them and that becomes possible because everything is getting into English and they access English and they think they can understand or judge or make pronouncement based on their reading in English which is so very limited so that's why I mean I have nothing against anglophone elites but you know when I always look at it look at them with a bit of suspicion because you know I mean they are so confident because they're using a language of power which is English they are using a language which is just economically very very sound and it is that which is giving them confidence to make pronouncement about the world and there is it calls for a greater humility to sort of speak about anything that you don't understand or anything that is alien or anything that you have not accessed in their originals so you know I mean and to just say that this is a he's a great writer in Kannada or you say he's a great writer in Bengali without having read even an original text in that language is a little you know I mean shoddy kind of a thing so one has to be very careful of approval gangsters what I always tell myself because I don't need endorsements when you know I mean I've I know that you know I mean things are far more complex so this was the kind of the larger broad-based even a person like Ananthamurthy till that generation Ananthamurthy or a Lankesh or all these people created a kind of Kannada or the after the earlier whatever it was very broad there was so much of enlightenment Europe in it there was so much of reason there's so much of you know many experiential elements getting mainstreamed and so much of different castes coming in bringing in their experiences of course that got expanded in the 70s and the 80s but that took you in a different direction so all of this was happening but what happens in the 90s or yeah late 90s I would say is that the sub-nationalist cultures start borrowing the what I call the Shiv Sena model so they that becomes a kind of exclusionary thing oh no this is not Kannada oh no this is not it had started in Kannada in the 70s in fact I refer to an incident in my book where Anakrishna a great man otherwise you know objecting to M.S. Subalakshmi singing you know we're not singing Purandara or whatever they were great friends but then he sort of you know makes a symbolic protest and he says you should sing Purandara and all that so I mean at a particular concert you know it was just there and so that kind of a streak entered into the sub-nationalist cultures where they it started in a very gentle literary specific way but then it got expanded into a larger culture and then the chain the activism the language activism had wonderful faces as great great faces but they all became lumpen elements you know and suddenly used I mean people who represented Kannada or who spoke for the primacy of Kannada or who sort of started painting the boards black or people who sort of created a kind of environment which started excluding a lot of things and then they started there are certain people whom who are very very close to me who sort of taught me how to look at the world in a wonderful way to sort of perceive Chomsky, Derrida, Lacan or Foucault everybody you know in trying to you know grapple all of that those very same people in the 90s started speaking a very different thing they started saying that it's enough you know Kannada is enough why do why do we need the crutches of any other language why do we need to they were not see they never they were not bilinguals in the sense that they did not write in both the languages they were you know monolinguals in the sense that they wrote in Kannada but had new English read in English read English but did not write in English now that is the kind of another little thing that we need to make so these people started saying that you the knowledge the epistemological thing you have to create knowledge in Kannada so Kannada is enough you don't need mirrors of other languages so that you know they were all professors and teachers and were heading institutions and departments and all that they started changing the way their students think so these people who are under them started thinking that it is enough to be a Kannada person it's it's not important to have a dialogue with somebody who's outside of Karnataka and those dialogues were not to be had in the in the manner that they were being held earlier which is you know I mean on broad terms even if you had it was on very narrow terms it was for a seminar so you go you get it translated you read you make a kind of you know show of it and you just come back so there was no organic kind of exchange that was happening so that got I think that phase made Kannada and the sub-nationalist thing very very very sad in fact so when you became an independent state or when you became a linguistic state in say 56 there was a huge difference between the idea of the nation and the idea of the sub-nation so you again build bridges you said I was the daughter of that mother and mother of this daughter you try to create a kinship relationship with an abstract idea called India and there was this real ground beneath your feet and you try to create that kinship relationship and that was an arrangement you knew everybody knew that was an arrangement that you were creating because Gandhi had created that atmosphere there was this idea of independence and all that had happened so but now and so you were different and therefore you became a union of states in the first place you were culturally different you could not be put with say Assam or Bengal or whatever you were different so you there were pebbles in a thing they were not a soup lovely way to put it right so there were pebbles they were all there so now what happened was now we speak about so much about Hindutva we speak about this whole nationalism one language so now these people sub-nationalist agenda and nationalist agenda have sort of somewhere merged or sort of come closer together because these people also speak of an exclusionary language they also speak of an exclusionary language they say it's only for Hindus only India only for only Hindi and these people say only Canada and when they say only Canada they're excluding everybody and Canada becomes only a language an instrument you can what you put into that Canada you could be speaking the language of NRC and CA in that language and you can be speaking the language of anti hijab or anti whatever in that language so but that language became alienated from the linguistic culture linguistic culture and language became two different entities so the linguistic culture had a broader thing had a bigger thing so you forgot about that you just made the language you know you reduce the language to a kind of instrument of communication that's it it did not carry the culture and the tradition and the heritage and all that you had used to build this wonderful plank for 30 40 years so that is where so so when when this whole Hindi thing was happening and that hashtag don't impose an imposition of Hindi and all that I wrote a piece in the mint a long 2000 word piece saying opposing Hindi alone is not sufficient if you're talking you talk about linguistic cultures because it's okay you will oppose Hindi you want Canada in its place or Telugu or Tamil in its place but what is Tamil and Telugu doing Tamil and Telugu are speaking the same language that they are sort of advocating in a different context and in a different space so you have to sort of actually draw from your own past your own history your own heritage and make yourself more acceptable and more accommodative and more open and more inclusive and that is something which is not happening and that is where these ruptures have happened and that is why the initial question that you asked about the death of a bilingual is a far more serious thing for me than just two people I mean one person talking two languages having gone away it's not just as simple as that it is actually a cultural crisis of a huge magnitude which we don't seem to be paying attention to so it is not about just merely felicity with two languages it's about the imaginations and cosmologies and world and then the world views of two languages which don't seem to sort of sit next to each other anymore they sort of you know operate in silos and operate in compartments and then you know there is a very false agenda that is being put forward to notionally or nominally keep the idea of subnationalism alive so it has become very tragic actually you know you invoke the same activist invoke the name of Kuvempu but haven't read Kuvempu, Kuvempu has not advocated that the same people speak of Karanth they put all their pictures and they say we are a Kannada organization but they don't seem to have read anything that these people have written and that is not the Kannada that's not the modern Kannada imagination that they actually built for the initial decades of this new state so for me the trigger is very interesting but the death that Ram spoke about is very correct very genuine but it's not just as simple as two languages it's far more far more."

        "message": "That's very illuminating and the part that I want to double down on is the irony that movements that look so different like the nationalism that stresses Hindi or the subnationalism which stresses a particular kind of Kannada are actually similar if you look deeper because they are both exclusionary as you put it and I think that too much of political difference really isn't political difference you know these days we think in terms of tribes while I think we need to think more in terms of ideas so it might seem for example that you know that Hindutva today is the opposite of what happened in Pakistan but the point is it's in a sense it's the same thing you're saying that this is you know one nation one religion basing nationhood on that similarly a Hindi nationalism and a Kannada nationalism may seem opposed to each other but they're actually the same and similarly even like you know I keep saying Vox and Bhakts are the same because it's you know you're reducing a person to their identity and forcing upon them a narrative of either victimhood or oppression when of course we contain multitudes and we have to be able to have those conversations. My next question is actually about what appears in my mind to be even contradictory or two opposite things simultaneously existing or two opposite processes simultaneously existing and I don't know what I make of it I don't think I've thought through it enough so I'll ask you what you think of it. One is a danger of homogenization for example you know I did an episode on Indian food with Vikram doctor and he spoke about the Cavendish banana and the funda of the Cavendish banana is it's a kind of banana which was in India it got taken out it got exported out and then in the US and Latin America and whatever it got mass produced factory produced and it was amenable to scale it would last a long time and it basically took over the world and other bananas died and now the Cavendish and then the Cavendish banana came to India where it is now destroying all indigenous varieties and you have a homogenization there where there is a fear that all these other beautiful banana types will disappear. Now I sometimes worry about a similar thing happening with language like even within elite circles or academia you spoke about the approval gang which is a phrase I love so much and you know Snigdha Poonam in her book dreamers and I did an episode with her about young Indians also spoke about this craze in small towns everywhere for learning English. English became this big aspirational thing so a Kannada person will want to learn English a Tamil person will want to learn English. English is that common point similarly when you spoke about translation which is such a great point that you made that Kannada is getting translated to English Tamil is getting translated into English why not to each other why not that dialogue so there is this danger of a kind of centralization and a homogenization so that is one strand but a strand that seems to me to be running in the opposite direction which I have a lot of hope for is a sort of decentralizing strand where across different fields I find that the mainstream is dissipating the center is not holding like I would say this is true of music for example at least Western music which I'm far more familiar with where there is no longer a mainstream you know rock was mainstream maybe from the Beatles or Dylan going electric to Nirvana as Steve Van Zandt sent in a recent interview a link and you know but the mainstream has dissipated and now it's decentralized I won't even call it niches it's just decentralized in media we have seen that that you had your mainstream media in the 90s you had a consensus on the truth now I feel mainstream media is completely irrelevant in India and we are completely decentralized and I net net I think it's a good thing because it empowers individuals of course there are problems like the fake news economy and all of that where we are constantly in narrative battles and truth doesn't have the value and in some senses I feel that even at the level of governments the power that nation-states have will dissipate with technology where a nation-state cannot stop you know a culture and cannot constrain it within its borders we are all talking to each other one way or the other so these are two you know two different movements that I see going in two different directions one is this homogenization driven by you know economic imperative self-interest and it's all rational everybody's learning English that's what they want to learn right so there's one language for the home and there's one language for the rest of the world and the other is this sort of decentralization you see it in entertainment also like I used to love tik-tok because there was so much great entertainment great art I would say coming from small towns and villages in different languages even when I didn't understand the languages you could make out what was going on and just love it you know so what's your"

        "message": "take on you know I mean I think this whole one you know I mean the nation-state idea itself is sort of limiting in the sense it's sort of you always are looking for an official thing you know one language you know what I mean there is a constitution but then the constitution has a different role to play but then it's not about oneness it's about a set of rules that we have given ourselves or promised ourselves so that impulse is always there when you sort of when the moment you frame something as a nation then that impulse to homogenize is always very strong so the moment you made a Karnataka the moment you made an Andhra Pradesh the impulse to impose a certain thing as the standard because this canonical hierarchical arrangements are always sort of you know I don't know whether it's default to the human mind or civilizational thinking or cultural thinking but it happens so you want to have these hierarchies you want to say this is good you want to approve so that approval gang thing comes there also you want to say this is right and this is wrong you start thinking in binaries so there is the moment you start thinking in binaries it's easy see that diversity is a cost in most of the time it's a cost so even companies don't want too much of diversity because it's a cost it's you're you're actually bringing upon yourself into doing a lot of things which actually don't need to be done and it's on the name of political correctness or whatever so this whole impulse to homogenize is part of the idea itself you know because you have to look like you have to you are this and therefore you need an there is an enemy so you create Pakistan becomes your enemy although they were your brother still for 1947 so you you have to create an enemy one enemy we don't speak much about one enemy but we speak about one language but one enemy is also part of the same agenda so so that homogenization thing is part it's it's it's there in the it's embedded in the idea of the nation state itself so you think you have to think through those terms otherwise it doesn't make sense but what happened why there is this kind of counter thing that has happened is because the borders became irrelevant economic borders became irrelevant and and and you know I mean this migration became such a big phenomena and every Indian family now has seems to have traveled right so all that started getting dismantled so the whole if at all I write a next I mean I'm writing two other books but then the big book that I want to write is about the decline of the linguistic state Wow right so the whole your how did you premise your idea of linguistic state when it was conceived in the 20s and the Congress passed a resolution all of that happened you conceived of it as a sealed border which had this language this language this language you thought of it as the imagination itself was faulty you never thought there would come a time when airplane travel would become cheaper they would there be internet the borders would collapse there would be liberalization people would move within in inside the country outside the country all of that was not imagined when these ideas came about so I think this is a phase from the 90s I think from 2000s of the millennial generation is trying to make sense of all that we imagined say 75 years ago this is a good time to think about it because we are speaking about the Amrit Mahotsav and all that so what is it that we imagined then and what is it that we have become now and how much of it is not our own making it is because the world has changed and we have benefited immensely from that so you can say globalization is bad there was a phase in Karnataka when all these seminars would have this theme about globalization and every goddamn writer would say globalization has killed this or globalized but they don't realize that globalization also brought great ideas into you the internet also gave you a lot of great ideas you started accessing a lot of things books that were not available and you know were very very expensive and a father of mine had to you know take a loan to buy books you know became very expensive inexpensive if you walk down that street you will get any book for you know I mean an affordable price so a lot of good things happened so we are not this we are struck this earlier generation which sort of framed these ideas and bought these ideas I mean and are stuck it does stuck with those ideas don't know how to reconcile with this opening up and I think that is a kind of negotiation that happens in a culture we have had this I'm telling you this is not an experience that is for any culture the first time I can go back to the 8th century I can go back to a text called Kaviraja Marga in Kannada and it's a book of poetics and it tells you how to deal with Sanskrit how to deal with Sanskrit Alankaras and it actually looks like it is borrowing a lot from Sanskrit but it's actually creating an agenda for a Kannada kind of cultural space so you know I mean you have constantly dealt with such a cultural influence Sanskrit was a huge problem for Kannada so Kumar Vyasa Bharata is seen as the original Kannada Mahabharata because he sort of shunned Sanskrit in a way that you know I mean is still celebrated so these kind of what you call as like Russia has invaded Ukraine such invasions have happened culturally also and a culture figure takes time to figure out but for the first time these cultures feel a little more threatened or endangered if one has to use that kind of a language is because English also has an economic power which is not just soft power which a Sanskrit had a Sanskrit borrowed its soft power from several other kind of institutional arrangements so English has economic power so money speaks so how does one counter the influence of a language like that which leaves any local language I mean within gives it a clipped existence you know you will you will stay there you will stay there as an artifact your language will survive as an artifact but it will have a clipped existence it will not have the ability to actually sit across the table and speak as an equal it loses that ability and that is why I am a little apprehensive about fellowships or whatever which only promote translation in one direction so you're actually contributing to that stream so there is a larger argument to be made so you know and your software also the the Microsoft thing that when it happened and when all of that was getting into regional languages they were just templates that were coming from English so I met a very interesting I don't know what has happened to him now he was used to be at the Harvard Kenneth Keniston so I interviewed him for Deccanary way back in 96 or 97 and he spoke to me about localization of software and he gave me an example of Argentina and he said I had been to Argentina and there all the teachers in schools where free software and free computers have been given a ruling that all our children are becoming little Microsoftians or whatever you know I mean because you what we don't realize with the software thing it's a binary code that is written the idea of time see when you talk in your languages time is very circular time operates in a very concentric thing but here it is always linear there are lots of such things elements even without you understanding gets into you and you start your imagination and your approach and your cognitive things get a little affected or warped or you know it moves away from your whatever thing so how does one handle the economic strength of English and how does one handle the technological aspects which all again has English that the primacy is English right see the whole structures and templates are all built primarily for western audiences so that is the worry now so how does a small culture which is you know I mean so they have surrendered so this culture now if you look at it the audiences are lost I keep telling these people that okay you are now trying to dumb down do it you may get your TRP today but you are actually killing your culture killing your audience sorry not culture killing your audience because a slightly educated fellow will move away from watching you so how many television or you know I mean channels in Canada does a middle-class family watch I don't I mean it's it's it becomes it is not of their thing there is an aspirational element they are moving up the chain they are getting software jobs they are being so they are being sent on jobs to say Germany or somewhere in Europe or America whatever they see new things and they can't reconcile what he is speaking there you know in an absolutely narrow strange terms and then he says that is not important I'll consume my news on internet so you're losing your audience newspapers have lost their audience because they've become very narrow they've said I mean most newspapers I made this comment some years ago I said the Sunday supplements of most newspapers reads like an obituary thing because they're they're only involved and speaking about the past it's nostalgia somebody dies or you give a full page and you say oh this man died and this is gone so the so you're only speaking about your only sort of recording the decline of your culture you're not trying to reverse the whole thing and say there are there are small groups there are of course enthusiastic small groups trying to do this and that but you know of course you know they don't have that kind of wherewithal to sort of scale the whole thing and become mainstream there are always small groups and they do very interesting and fascinating work which one should not dismiss so lightly even in Canada it happens and I'm I really appreciate what they do for example the audiobooks kind of a thing that they're trying to do there are lots of good work that happens but then the the the mainstream Canada thing which you very rightly pointed on the mainstream thing looks very very weak and nobody people are getting disengaged with it the larger audience the educated the upwardly mobile audience is getting disengaged and you know what happens when that happens advertising stops coming into that media and then it becomes a rag and I mean you know in one of your shows I heard Mrinal Pandey speak about this constant thing about Hindi newspapers not getting advertising and why it doesn't get advertising and the scale and so numbers may be very quote-unquote sexy because the reach may be high but what is the purchasing power of that audience which reads those newspapers is a very very interesting question that comes back and in the kind of economic arrangement that we have now there is no input of money that is going and philanthropy which in a place like Bangalore plays a huge huge role it does not understand the complexities of these cultural questions at all because all these people have been software engineers or made their money through you know I mean new economy industries and for them you know I mean philanthropy is to sort of create a software for themselves and they don't engage with these real cultural issues that is where the death of the bilingual is more important so I mean the death is because you don't understand the other side not because you don't know the other language when I have far greater respect for Ramchandra Guha because he understands that the other side is sort of there and I have to respect it and for me that is a huge thing that acknowledgement is a huge thing but a lot of people don't acknowledge that right so he sort of he may not be accomplished in two or three languages like a lot of people but to know that there is that world out there which is far more interesting complex intricate is an acknowledgement."

        "message": "So let me respond to some of the things you said because you know just thinking aloud like I spoke about that seeming contradiction between the centralizing impulse on the one hand the homogenization impulse on the one hand and the decentralization and while you were speaking I realized that one way of looking at it perhaps simplistically but largely still might have something to it is that politics has that centralizing and homogenizing impulse while culture goes in the other direction you know because for politics number one as Carl Schmitt the German theorist famously said that in politics you need an other and therefore in politics it makes there is this incentive to define everything in stock terms which leads to this kind of centralization conceptually which leads to homogenization and all of that and that's a political imperative but culturally you know culture is getting more and more decentralized now and the incentives there kind of go the other way and you know the other minor aspect you pointed out about Microsoftians creating on Microsoftians and time goes in a linear way I mean I use some software which is organized differently like for my notes I use Rome research which is based on the German system of Zettelkasten where everything is not quite linear or even orderly it can be circular it can you can go off in different directions so I think you know there is scope for doing a lot more than that but the other interesting thing that struck me was what you said about the dumbing down of the media and that's been a constant lament and I think there it's a combination of things that happen like when I started this podcast for example my you know my early episodes were 20-30 minutes my impression was that listen people have a short attention span everybody wants shallow content you gotta hook them in the first 15 seconds and don't do more than 15 minutes 20 minutes one episode I did was 11 minutes and then over a period of time I realized everything about that was wrong one of course there are the you know people listen to podcasts as a captive audience when they're you know working out or commuting and so on so they are less likely to be distracted and also they listen at higher speeds like 2x 3x whatever and therefore they're consuming like one hour of content in half an hour of running but the most important factor was that we are wrong about what people want we don't live in the age of the short attention span people crave depth and they especially crave depth more today because the media doesn't give it to them and the media for all kinds of incentives economic incentive incentives being a big part of that because of the way our systems are structured they want to go what my good friend Prem Panicker calls a mile wide and an inch deep right and you know because you have you pay these enormous license fees to have a TV channel you you have price caps on you know subscriptions so it's advertising heavy you know unlike many other countries in the world so you have to cater to the lowest common denominator you don't have a choice and therefore you have that screamy shouty race to the bottom that we see in our news television and that holds for all other medium I mean that's where radio is different from podcasting because radio also you have license fees you have restrictions so you're going wide you're not going deep and and that's one thing I realized that people crave depth so much and the problem is when you're a mainstream media house and you're functioning under those kind of incentives where you don't have an option you have to go broad then you don't realize how many people there are who want to go deep and the point is a people who want to go deep they are also more engaged so even if my absolute numbers may be lower than say for the audience of a Shah Rukh Khan film just to take an extreme example or maybe that's a wrong example but the point is the engagement that anything that gives you depth is way way more so you know and that's again something that ideally should be sorted out but it isn't"

        "message": "because you know what are your thoughts being a media person? Being a media person and having been an editor with brand managers and CEOs around I mean you're absolutely bang on on this you know they constantly try to tell you that attention spans have become smaller and people are not interested and I always wondered as to where they got their feedback from you know I went to the same market I saw the same television channel I read the same book see but there again you know I mean I don't mean disrespect to any degree any person who holds an MBA degree but you know I mean look at the kind of people put in charge of media houses when I worked with some of the biggest media houses and look at the people who are put in charge of those media houses who are trained to make money who are you know told that you have to make money and they don't sort of distinguish between this and a Pepsi you know most of actually many of the media managers came from Pepsi in fact who made a lot of money for these big houses came from you know I mean people who sold sugared water so they actually they these same people when they're sent to the car industry now we had a very interesting general manager I mean when I was still a news editor and whatever so this man would had come from this thing that shut down you know so he would come and he would say no no no front page you put this and therefore there's a problem so I would always ask him see did you say the same thing in your previous company did you tell them the headlights are looking a little wonky therefore I can't sell the car so your job is to sell what we have given you because we think that we have done a good job so go and sell it now don't come back and tell me that this product is not working because of this problem so I mean the numbers rose we were doing well but there's under such immense pressure from the owners that for them you know I mean they they try to sort of make money everywhere and that that basically does not agree when you're dealing with something like a newspaper or a magazine or whatever because it's a different product it's a knowledge product so they don't seem to have that kind of their training their academic training or their intellectual exposure or their whatever thing is very very limited and narrow and confined and I wish you know I mean different kinds of people are put there and different kinds of things happen I mean not it's not that everybody is like that but you know unfortunately I am in every other person that I have met in newsrooms are like that so I mean I used to have a lot of problem with the CEO kinds and the brand manager kinds who would come and talk glib English but would have absolutely no idea as to what they were talking about and then at the end of the day they would come and say you know I mean we are trying to get some advertising feature from this politician for one week please don't write anything against him so things like that you know I mean so you they are compromised all the value systems that you sort of had that you should not compromise you're on you're an uncompromising journalist you have a certain kind of professional you know I mean ethical framework all of that they actually push you to violate every single day so how will journalism survive so you may have made money in a small run but you've actually killed the industry that's what I meant when I said you have killed the audience so that is why the non-mainstream things are doing so well people rely more on the non-mainstream thing they would like to listen to you more they would like to read something that is being offered and a bunch of very interesting new media products in India now or abroad so I mean they have killed their audience they don't realize that in the long run everything is gone and they have permanently deleted that audience and then they go once that becomes mainstream they go and play the same havoc so at least one has to sort of build a kind of firewall and ensures that the whole thing has to be looked at differently as going forward so that is why I always say when it comes to politics these congresses and keep speaking so much of nostalgia I get really bugged they keep saying Nehru said this Nehru did this for India he built the idea of democracy you know this all of this has been done so the simple question if is that if you ran the country like that or if you did good things then why do you have someone like person that we have now so the project that we need to sort of political project or the cultural project that we need to have is not about restoration of the past or the glorious Congress regime is not the restoration project that we need to have as liberals today we have to sort of make correctives and build something new and far more diverse and interesting so restoration is a huge huge problem because you have made a lot of mistakes and therefore you have you are in the situation that you are in today and if you are not reflective and if you think you were good and you were suddenly overnight thrown away by some some kind of a current that came is wrong because everything builds up and I often tell me in spite of my deep deep respect for someone like Manmohan Singh Dr. Manmohan Singh I keep telling a lot of my Congress friends in my arguments that see Devagoda had far greater democratic engagement than a Manmohan Singh, Manmohan Singh was a technocrat you put him there for 10 years and there was no political engagement and people thought that this is the weak weakest Prime Minister we have in his during his term I don't think he was ever described as a strong man in 2009 I think that was the electoral plank of Advani they called him the weak Prime Minister but you know the economy is doing well and there were other reasons as to why they came back to power but the tragedy is the Congress could not give a political person at the helm for 10 long years I understand that as a stopgap arrangement that's not the ideal that we have to go back you have a CEO running your government and you have a power system elsewhere so that is what this created a urge for a strong leader and somebody sort of made use of that space so things have there is a reaction and there is a reaction to things that you have there are consequences to the your actions and we don't have to think of restoration so similarly culturally or media or it applies to everything that we are speaking about I don't think we have to you know say that I mean Madhubala was great so let's get another Madhubala there are new people coming so you don't have to get into this nostalgia trip each time or retro thing and say that all was great with Nehru and therefore we need to bring back the Nehru in India and that was the biggest thing I don't think it was correct and and Nehru operated in a completely different time and Nehru after the partition this is my understanding I may be wrong after the partition had to build reason into the system so he used reason a lot of reason he built brought in scientific temper he spoke of scientific temper he spoke like an enlightened statesman you know when he used the principles of enlightenment and and all of that and created an India which was which which thought logically you know or or propounded that or put it there on the table and he had such big cherishment nobody cared what he spoke he they voted for him or they voted for the Congress party because there was also the element of I mean independence and the memory of independence and all that but now if you continue in that stream which Rahul Gandhi never gets which is you Rahul Gandhi is logical he is very sincere he has reason sorted out but there is no emotion but politics is all about emotion it's a fantastic blend of reason and emotion and a great leader whoever across the world has operated by actually fusing these two elements brilliantly the formulas could be different the the percentages could be different but you don't communicate only invoking a certain kind of academic logic"

        "message": "in the in the parliament no and I honestly don't think that there is even reason there in fact I think the Congress blunders continuously instead of celebrating Narsimha Rao and Manmohan Singh they celebrate Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi you know every every year when it's his birthday all the official Congress handles will talk about what a great guy he is and even Nehru you know the point is we have the sedition law today because after the court rule the courts ruled it unconstitutional in 1950 Nehru brought it back you know we remained a poor country for more than seven decades which is why 2014 happened you oppose the current guy I completely agree with you you oppose the current guy but understand where he came from and what's going on and frankly the current guy is more of the same right we we have the you know you can think in tribal terms and they can look like opposites but it's in a sense more of the same and a little worse and some margins you know earlier you made the point about the suits the MBAs the CEO types as you put it who only care about money and even there I think that they're not good suits and good MBAs if they care about money in the way that they do because they're caring about it in a short term way if you actually think long term you you'd kind of learn to sort of segment the market and realize that you know that this is not sustainable and earlier you'd mentioned very evocatively when you spoke about the little magazines how your father would put it together your mother would put the little stamp on it and you know you'd go on cycles and you deliver it to people and I think what was happening there and the reason that it worked was that there is that direct sense of who is reading it there is a sense of the human beings who are reading it and they're paying you for it and they're taking it and that keeps it alive and it dies out to some extent not because the audience dies out I feel but because the connect dies out and what I think we need to figure out all the metaphorical little magazines of the day is that one we need to realize that that audience is there if anything it's bigger than ever before and what we just need to figure out is figure out the logistics how do we get our work to them which is easier than ever before because of technology and more importantly how do they pay us and I think that's easy to sort out because you know one thing that I'm seeing in the creator economy is that more and more the one big shift is that creators are being able to get money directly from consumers you don't have to go via advertisers via sponsors all of that so I want to sort of talk about this personal aspect this people aspect also in a context that you brought up earlier where you spoke about you were reporting from Rajasthan and you you're chatting to Bhairon Singh Shikhawath who by one section of the media would be painted as one caricature another section would paint him as another caricature and you try to get behind the person and kind of go deeper in a sense what I try to do as well and what I find in in modern times is that we live in a world where there is almost we are incentivized to pass judgment all the time either to gain status within our own little tribes or to feel virtuous for ourselves that oh I made fun of him and therefore I'm better than him and so on and this really means that we start looking at the world in black and white ways and that there is a constructed world anywhere where you have polarized rhetoric so and so is evil so and so is you know a paragon of virtue and we start kind of falling into those lines and it strikes me that what we need is more of what you were doing and more of what good journalists do today where you go deeper figure out the personal you know figure out basically you delve in all the shades of grey and you make that concrete like you know to me a lot of the dangerous ideas that we have around us are abstract ideas nationalism and purity and all of these and our lived reality when we are actually engaging with the concrete is not like that at all you know you you know in your Devegada book which maybe we'll have to talk about in a separate episode because it's just got so much I want to talk five hours about that but in that book you speak about how his secularism was a lived secularism it came from concrete things you know he could see his you know father employ a Muslim in the field who's teaching him Urdu and all of that and his lived experiences leading to a secularism not some ideological abstract thing and in your view what can people like us or people like whoever's listening to this conversation or just society as a whole what can we do to sort of start privileging the concrete more over the abstract because we are ruled all around us by abstract rhetoric by constructed realities by these imperatives that we have to pass judgment on others that there's our tribe and then everybody else is evil and so on and so forth and these abstract things break down the moment you have you know I mean maybe I'm being very idealistic but they tend to break down when you have you know engagement with the real world so"

        "message": "now the last part is very difficult no but I never sort of defined journalism for myself I was never a student of journalism and ever went to university to study journalism I was a student of literature and culture so culture studies comparative literatures so I was in a whole different world and then I happened to sort of get into a newsroom and the editor was not very trusting of my me sustaining interest but somehow I sort of stayed back and never went out went away or you know because I was I thought I was a little successful and I could continue so I never defined what good journalism is for myself because I was I thought what the place that I was in Deccan Herald and the kind of multiplicity of views that I was seeing and the kind of assignments I was getting and what was getting published was not very different from a very ideal kind of a situation you could write about some philosopher called Derrida and you could get published you could write about Saeed, you could write about Chomsky, you could write about a new director of the Max Buller Bowen who has taken over and was great great new ideas you could write about Brecht in Canada cinema and Hindi cinema and and Canada plays so you could I was just completely immersed in my cultural and literary writing for Deccan Herald I did not think outside of it and also the very first piece that I published was you know it was some kind of a tribute to Adiga where I sort of wrote about Adiga and his poetry and sort of translated a small little piece that he had written about me and my poetry and it was a very intensely passionate piece when it was run again one page so I mean it became a kind of default to get one page for me in Deccan Herald I mean I mean I have so many of those clippings and if anybody cares to look at the archives they'll see how is this fellow you know I mean getting so much of space it's not that I was writing something very big or I was a great writer it didn't it wasn't that it was about the generosity of the editorship of the time it was like you know I mean I always imagined that I should work in an environment where someone like this Harold Evans worked and the Sunday Times and that kind of an ideal kind of an environment where even a Philip Knightley was encouraged and he did a lot of great stories but all of that came later see only after 2000 did I start looking at journalism as journalism should be looked at until then for me it was a venue to get my I mean half fulfilled literary or cultural ambitions in so it could be poetry or it could be short stories or whatever but after 2000 something changed because I went on a shivning scholarship to England and then so there was a it was a for print journalism and it was a program for young print journalists there was this great man who was running the program John Tullock who succumbed to cancer I think in 2016 if I remember right and there was Adam Hopkins who was a travel writer and they were running the program and they sort of put you in touch with great people like Edwin Taylor Edwin Taylor was someone who had designed the Deccan Herald and designed half a dozen newspapers of the world and written a great book with Harold Evans called pictures on the page on designing newspapers so I got terribly terribly interested in the mechanics of putting a newspaper together the design the the layout and you know picking a picture how should we look at that and of course reporting and writing and there was a Putin Blair summit and because you were a shivning fellow you were a giver you were given a pass to go and sit in the media you know thing so I went and watched that I mean there was a great opportunity to grow and there I still when I went to England I went as a provincial boy with my Kannada baggage and my literary baggage and my cultural baggage and besides John Tullock and Adam Hopkins who are putting me who are getting me to look at the mechanics of journalism a little more seriously I met this great mentor who was still with who still mentors me Mr. Jeremy Seabrook and Jeremy Seabrook was such a distinguished writer in England he was writing a column for the Guardian and he was given to me as a personal mentor there was a system where you were given big writers as your mentors I just met I think initially the plan was to give me Julian Bonds I mean there's some such talk you know and that never happened but of course I I mean I happened to run into him and said hello and all that but then just imagine getting a Julian Bonds and Jeremy was no less because Jeremy had published some 30 40 books he had an India interest and he was more than anything else he was someone who would give you time and he was empathetic he would listen and not many people had that kind of would give you that kind of time so he had I think injured his ankle and therefore he was at home and it gave me great opportunity to sort of you know go and vomit all my ideas before him and then he would listen for an hour or he's a great listener like you he would listen to ours together and then he would come back with a response which was so terrific he would say see you are looking at it in a very limited way so frame it this way look at it this way so go back and write it this way and come back to me having read this so he was he gave me I think the grant edition which was being edited by Ian Jack and it was about England and its loss of you know greatness the Great Britain had become just Britain so it was something around that and I forget the exact title of the grant issue and he had an essay in that about something related and he gave me that and he said you can keep this copy and getting a grant free for a student you know I mean was itself a very big thing so he said you can keep this and I am not giving it to you because I have written a piece but then I want you to sort of critique what I have written so then this was I thought he was sort of being very nice to me and so I read that I went I discussed I keep going back to him his house was in Muswell Hill so I mean I used to take the metro underground and reach his place and it was 3 Springfield Avenue Muswell Hill is shifted to another house now closer by but I used to go and I mean I thought I was boring him but he was very empathic and he was always someone because he was a writer he would ask me very personal questions you tell you tell me tell me something about your father what kind of a person is he what did he ask you to read you know how did you grow up you know what kind of an him so he was basically also soaking in my cultural environment he was trying to understand my family is understanding where I am coming from and then this whole Kannada Kannada Kannada business that I had in my head and literature literature and culture all that he sort of brought in a gently introduced polemical ideas you know just just ruffled a few of them and then that expanded the way I look at the world so I mean that is when I decided that this whole Kannada pride thing had because I had written I think I translated a piece in for Deccanary called Kannada pride and prejudice for the one of the November issues and I showed it to him and then he said how that idea can be sort of expanded why you should not sort of limit yourself to you know I mean one particular stream how you can actually make it richer by sort of taking in other things and exploring it there and language is a great dynamic you know I mean you put it into your language it becomes something else it is like you know in a recipe where you mix a certain ingredient it becomes a separate dish so he said you should you should sort of start exploring these things and then for the first time there was a huge problem of migrants and there was this very harsh rhetoric that was being spoken in the papers and British tabloids you know how they so he would tell me stories about migrants and he would tell me why we shouldn't speak this language what is the history of the world what is the history of migration and why you know these politicians are wrong and why you should go and listen to that fellow who's talking at the completely nonsensical thing but then you come back to me and tell me what he spoke and I'll tell you why that is wrong and why you should always sort of have a broad worldview and inclusive worldview but also be extremely conscious of the kind of atrocities committed by people in power how the policies are shaped to suit a handful of people so he would give me examples and there was a huge influx of Russian money at that time that had just about started I think at that time so we would we used to sort of whenever we went for a walk you would say see this is bought up by some some billionaire in Russia who's a faceless guy there's only a small little outhouse where a servant stays and this house has never been lit up fully it is just that little light that glows you know I mean he had a very poetic language he's a he had a polemical sense he is he was superb in that sense and he had visited India innumerable number of times and he had friends here he had written a lovely book for Pluto Press called Another India and he was quite well known in Bangladesh because he had learnt I mean he had worked very closely with the government workers there the workers there and written a lot and he had worked in Thailand so he has extremely was very very familiar with South Asia so the moment I said something he would just you know build the chain in such a way that it would be became started becoming very fascinating so for the first time when I went to England I started reading newspapers completely differently I wouldn't start with the supplements I would start with the front page and then go to the edit page read the edit in a very serious I would read edits here I would throw sort of do all that here but you know the way I looked at a newspaper itself changed because the way I looked at the world had changed can you elaborate on that yeah that is because this these inputs were being given to me and what was appearing in newspapers I was allowed to critique them so there were certain newspapers which were speaking a language of foul language and a very unwelcome language about immigrants and then there was this teacher here a great teacher was telling me that but Great Britain's economy was built by immigrants see look at how much they have contributed and he was he was from Northampton he had studied at Cambridge he was a local person and when a local person tells you that it becomes far more authentic so then then you start transport when transpose yourself into the Canada situation and you're sitting here and if you say that that fellow who's a Hindiwala or a Marwadi or a Bengali fellow so I became extremely conscious and I said I shouldn't talk that language that is not the language that has to be spoken in a civilized world so look at how Jeremy is speaking about people who have come to his land to his city and have made a life there and and sort of enriched that thing in fact he wrote a intellectual history of immigrants later which was I think released in the House of Commons later so it's a it's a thick fat book so he was he was that is the the way I looked at newspapers change because there was a teacher who was telling me see you've come yourself to come here to sort of train yourself to become an editor later or become a better journalist so you have to lot of absorb all these things and then of course there was I read Harold Evans very seriously the good times and the bad times and the Murdochian revolution was taking place so then the whole thing was getting dismantled the layoffs was happening I read John Pilger very very seriously when I went there because I think I went and listened to a lecture that he was giving somewhere and then he had problematized all this whole revolution that was taking place inside journalism the commodification the the kind of straight jacketing of ideas the kind of dumbing down you know reduction of pages for literature or whatever all that sort of you know was put into a context for me when I went to England and then there was a magazine that used to come to Jeremy's I was used to I think write also for the New Internationalist so he used to say New Internationalist had a completely different perspective of the world and there was New Statesman of course and there was the bunch of other magazines and then you went out to make calls to India there was these red little booths and you saw all these porn stickers stuck there saying call this number I am available you know those that was also a shock there was Soho and there was all those things it culturally shook you up and saying that oh the world that you imagined staying in Bangalore all these years is not just Maleshwaram or Basangudi here you are not even willing to accept the cantonment and here you are in this huge big city that everything is so very big so it I became completely conscious of that fact that what I know what I understand what I perceive is very very limited it's better to be humble and pick up things as I go on rather than be didactic and say I am right I have come from India it's a great culture I have a family like this my father is this so and so and my father was a very influential figure in Canada so I mean I had gone with that baggage but then it sobered me down so much and then that changed my journalism so it was basically a shock and then because I was into this there was a placement thing that would happen as part of the fellowship and I think it was John Deluxe idea to send me to Irish times in Dublin so I went from one city to another European city and that oh my god that was completely different from London and here you know people would you know very very with great difficulty nod at you or smile at you when you're in the tube or when you were walking on the street or in the supermarket and supermarket was not so difficult because you had Indians but you went to Southall to bring your masala and stuff like that but here in Dublin the very first encounter was different you know I met this editor called Kiran Fagan and Kiran said what are you doing here come let's have a drink so that was a completely different language it's not that I was much of a drinker or whatever I mean I did not sort of alcohol you know I mean my family was a vegetarian family because you know there was a this whole process of Sanskritization that Ambedkar and later MN Srinivas speak about which was I think part of that part of that family construct that if you are you know elevating yourself you have to give up these things and they were more loyal to the Sringeri mutt and the Shankar mutt and all that so here was I go there and this man who's supposedly you know going to take care of me for the next few months and he's saying come let's have a drink and he's sort of giving getting me the dark stout thing you know and he asked me saying they just taste it it's not going to knock you off and then one comes the second one comes and then I'm I become very very so I mean my this whole inside the I mean it sort of I became this moralistic there's this element of moral thing fiber that gets woven into your learning and reading and all that if you are in a certain setup and that you know you choose because if you drink you think you're a bad man if you smoke you're you get you start to start you know classifying people like that oh he has bad habits so drinking was a bad habit which was sort of put into me very early in my life eating non-vegetarian food was a was not such a welcome thing smoking is no no you know that kind of a thing because my parents and my grandparents were all in that kind of a bubble and you learn to judge people on the basis of their habits or their orientation that orientation was still not clear to me gay or being a being a LGBT person you never learned all that here you know because your culture never even people did not even bring it on their lips and their tongues and this but all of that started becoming opening up there so you went here and you first thing that the man says who's using a senior who's supposed to take care of you says come let's have a drink and that completely brought down walls for me and it was such a fascinating you're such a great good man he was he treated you as an equal he took you there to the pub and then he bought you a drink and then he put you into the newsroom and he put you and he sort of made such a gave such a glowing introduction to all his senior colleagues and the other senior editors he said he's a bright young man who's got the finest fellowship and he's come from India he was in London but the London people have some good sense they have given him to us so we have to sort of take care of me I want him to go back with good memories that's what he said what a remarkable man he was and then he then said Caroline this boy I think knows a lot of English literature you you will find him use useful so why don't you sort of speak to him you know the people were so welcoming and they would take me home in England I except for my mentors drawing room I would have I had not entered anybody's home and here people said you come home Saturday oh come we'll go trekking yo we'll go to that island the things like that started happening I used to share an apartment with a lady called Barbara Clinton and this lady is again you know I mean she was working with another rival newspaper or I think she was doing some work for other newspapers and she was a single lady and she was again very welcoming in her home you know I mean this whole dynamics changes right you're a Hindu boy provincial boy going to England staying in an apartment shared with by another lady and you are you don't know whether you have to tell your parents or your mother especially that you know is this lady also living with me I mean it's all perfectly normal there and you learn to navigate those choppy waters or which is cultural shock for you and because nobody in my family had gone abroad to study my father was so enlightened but he had never crossed the seas he went abroad much later after all of us took him abroad he went to Europe and my brother settled down in the US and became a citizen there so he facilitated it much later but all of that came later for him England he would he could speak so beautifully about London streets through his reading he could speak of you know I mean Russia so you know I mean with such passion I mean that through his reading so everything was a textual kind of a thing that had reached him but he had never crossed the seas physically so this was for me you know in a lot of ways it opened up and so journalism obviously had to be a cosmopolitan idea it could not have been a kind of narrow whatever agenda with which you drive it so it was a cosmopolitan thing because you had benefited from it and you had seen it function you had seen the great examples there and so then I did I had to figure out where does Canada figure if I am trying to embrace the world with such speed so Canada has to be somewhere it can't go away and even if I want to sort of you know flush it down it won't go away so how does it work out so that is when Jeremy sort of navigated my journey and he said that you can be for the first time I think I heard it from him he said you can be rootedly cosmopolitan that's such a lovely phrase rootedly cosmopolitan and I use it much a lot in my writing later I've used it later and I don't think I've attributed to my guru because guru is part of me you know I there is sort of invoke the Indian thing I mean I am part of him and he's part of me so I mean it's like the guru shishya parampara so what is his is mine you know that kind of a thing so he used it very very I don't think he used it in the exact same way but then he spoke about you can be rooted and you can be cosmopolitan at the same time and your cosmopolitanism is not confined to the English language alone because there was this construct that if you had to be cosmopolitan you had to speak the English language and if you are living in Bangalore if you want to appear cosmopolitan you have to go to Koshy's and come to the MG road and roam around the brigade road looking at all the girls in many skirts and go back and say that oh I've had a cosmopolitan experience so so that those notions of the English divide of the other all of that sort of sort of this great man sort of you know pushed me to sort of I mean it made me dismantle all of it so it more than say again as I told you earlier Amit it was not it was not always trying to bring correctives to my journalism it was about everything so if you bought correctives to the way you look at then your journalism automatically changes the kind of topics that you pick to write will change the kind of you know I mean language you use will change the diction will change the tone will change the way you approach people will change so with all this I came back to India and I would have happily settled down in Dublin but then there was a huge labor problem and union problem and all that they could not have absorbed me although they were very very kind and they said we want you for more and they gave me a lovely letter at the end of the day I still preserve and I mean I feel a little embarrassed to frame it or whatever but then they said Sugata was here and he was such a great colleague and he was there on the South Asia desk and LTT problem was big those days so then I used to sort of write a few copies on that and then he had special interest in Irish language thing and all that but his knowledge of English literature put all of us to shame was the I mean can you believe somebody writing that in a letter of recommendation or a letter of whatever I mean there was there such good people you know and I felt that I was a mini success and I came back to India and here then of course I went to Jaipur and Veer Sanghvi had taken over the Hindustan Times and there was nobody to go to Jaipur to look after the news desk so I went there as a news editor and with all this baggage and in a new culture and Godhra was just happening and I was just put in the middle of elections and riots and all that and I had to figure this all out which I had not until then because I was in this very secure cultural literary bubble in Deccan Herald and England had sort of shaken me up given me a way to look at all this but then I was now actually thrown there I was a young news editor a very young person and I had people who had served the organization for 30 years 25 years there and I had to handle them there was a young team also but there was I had to reconcile and so my whole approach of managing reconciling these age differences these language differences cultural difference all of them were put to very good use because I had had a good primer you know I mean so I mean I was I handled it and people accepted me they were good people they were nice people again I was not too it was not too problematic for me to adjust to the new environment and there for the first time I handled assembly elections on my own I created packages I created I got I developed a fascination for polo I still keep in touch with a lot of my friends who played polo there and there was a bit of royalty thing so then you know you just that rubbed off on you a little so I used to bring out a monthly supplement called polo passion because polo was big so I mean I had very generous colleagues I had a very generous resident editor initially he moved on he later and then he I mean pretty much I was left to run the place you know and that was very incredible of the people of people and there this whole again new thing there again I looked at the language issue there I looked at oral histories because oral history was big and so I looked at royalties I sort of made friends with some people like I mean I never thought I'll meet the big man Bhairav Singh Shakawat but then I he took to me somehow you know I mean I was pretty lucky about that and then I then one fine day I got a call from Delhi and Outlook asking if I would like to run their south and the elections were coming and 2004 is when I moved to the Outlook magazine and it was always by then you know I mean my father had created this very lovely image of Vinod and the Sunday Observer and then he used to tell me that he also edited a magazine which was not you know I mean a literary magazine but it was a great magazine he would never tell me it was Debonair something would stop him from telling me that it was so Sunday Observer I think he was very he had watched it closely he had seen Outlook we had I still remember the sample issue of Outlook reaching our home so we had seen all that and somewhere in the corner of my mind by then I had realized that here is a great editor a great man who seems to be very liberal who gives you your space and allows you to do your thing so if at all if it's possible I think I should work with him one day and that dream came true in 2004 and I stayed with Vinod till the day he retired so I mean I had a job offer and I went and told him and he said I'll walk to the sunset stay with me until I'm there and he took eight months or one year to leave so I had to keep that job with the Times of India in abeyance for that long and then I came and took over as the editor-in-chief of Vijay Karnataka their biggest regional paper which was making a lot of money but money yes but then it was completely on the right so they wanted they had bought that paper from another person and they wanted me to sort of bring it to the center make it more acceptable so that their intention was to make it more commercially viable so that big advertisers come in for me it coincided with my mission of making it centrist and making it more liberal so there was a kind of thing together which is running parallel so I think I flourished there it was a real big success so I did not have a problem again transiting from English to Canada because I was anyway a bilingual and I was offered this job because I'm a bilingual but Outlook was a great phase and Outlook became such a enormous thing because it turned me into an investigative journalist it turned me into a political commentator and writer and I was probably the only one to have this record I've written every single week in the magazine since the day I joined and my very first piece was a cover story which is everybody here I came to Karnataka again see the perspectives that you developed become so interesting that I came to Karnataka for the 2004 elections so 2004 there was assembly and parliamentary elections happening and I came here and everybody I met was saying Krishna is SM Krishna is going to come back to power so I said okay TK you're saying this let me go and look around so I went to the hinterlands I went to the different districts I traveled quite a bit see Vinod was very liberal with all that you could just travel and he did not confine me to Karnataka I was covering the entire south I could go anywhere I want I had to just write this proposal and send it a give an interesting idea and then I had a very interesting and a very fine editor who was the political editor was Mr. Ajit Pillai and Ajit Pillai and Vinod Mehta Vinod himself describes him as a very dear colleague and so Ajit was not like other editors in between your top man and you who would snatch your ideas and make it their own and you know he was a he was a man with great rectitude and great moral bearing and he encouraged me he whenever a great idea was there he would say don't worry I will tell Vinod you travel because Vinod is busy I will tell him on Saturday or whatever you travel it's okay I have given you the consent so initially you know that meant mattered a lot although you were a senior guy and all that and there was the reporting structure you always had to sort of convince Vinod through him and and once Vinod saw that he started talking to me directly and of course Ajit would be looped in but we developed this bond where Vinod knew I was a little stuck up kind of a character who would you know it was not very comfortable speaking these small things of life but only speak of big ideas and big things so whenever we had this arrangement where Vinod would call me every Saturday at seven o'clock this was an you know I mean an editor of Vinod's stature having a contact with his bureau head down south with this manner itself was a very interesting thing so he used to call me at seven and he would never ask me what story you're doing he would only say who's sleeping with who what is that happening what is that gossip that I hear why is that fellow behaving like that is he sleeping with somebody you know I mean Vinod was so much on the gossip side initially it shocked me I would say I mean I would all all be ready to you know just tell him that this is happening sir that is happening next week we should look at this and I think this is the the the idea that we pursued last time is not really working but Vinod would lighten the whole thing he would not talk about ideas at all and then when I tried to insert he would say no tell that to Ajit, Ajit will take care of it don't worry you tell me the gossip so so so he would come here we would have great time hopping bar hopping pubs and restaurants so the idea of an editor how I should behave as an elder in the newsroom when I if and when I became an editor at that time was again Vinod Mehta became a model he was he I mean a lot of people may have a lot of stories to say but with me you know I mean I always got you know I mean a great response from Vinod and he never curtailed me on anything in fact when I did the very big story in 2005 on the Infosys land scam that was a big story when everybody was speaking gaga about the Infosys and all that I knew that they were you know making putting making petitions for more land and when when they had not actually used what was already with them and they were making all these projections and all that and I wanted to do a story because I had some documents and all that and it still not reached me but then I had seen them so and there was this big debate that was happening in Karnataka as to why they are greedy after land and all that so I suggested the idea and Vinod said yeah go ahead no problem so I wrote this story and then he called me on a Wednesday he said are you sure of all that you've written because by then he had started getting calls from various quarters saying somebody had leaked that this story is happening and he said I've been getting calls are you sure of what you've written I said yes sir then he would insist that I call him Vinod but then I would never say I could never do it so I yes I said I'm pretty sure I've checked looked up my facts and all that he said do you have doc do you have the documents which support all that you're saying I said sir I have seen all of it this person has promised that he'll give it to me on a Friday but he said but we go to press on the Thursday or your form is going to the press on Thursday how what we what shall we do you know I mean if you're going to get the documents on Friday have you seen it are you very sure are you bakka and this is my first year in Outlook 2005 I said sir I'm pretty much sure it was yeah second year in Outlook 2004 I joined so he said okay then okay I'll run it because he sort of gave himself this reason he said too many people are calling so it must be correct Wow superb he said too many are calling it must be correct we go down we go down together don't worry I'll run it it was a five page thing it's just went on the thing and that was a great moment and then on a Friday I got all the documents I just faxed them to Ajit and I said I've got everything so nothing to worry and then again Saturday the call comes at seven o'clock and he is laughing and he said have we restored the balance I said yes sir so he said everything is quiet and silent and people are appreciating what you have written so it must be true it is correct so he said don't stop with this story it has done well so do two more let's make it a series so I started scrambling for more documents and then I realized that SM Krishna had preferential shares in Infosys then I realized that his son-in-law who I mean drowned himself again had dealt with I mean had underwritten the Infosys IPO and there was a great deal of involvement between these two and then Krishna had accommodated a lot of Infosys people in his administration you know urban infrastructure airport so there was a lot of conflict of interest so I wrote that and then of course I at that point of time Mr. Mohandas Pai was still part of Infosys and then he said I want to meet I said I'll come to your office and then I can never forget that conversation that happened between him and me and I said I stand by what I write so then they sent a kind of rejoinder to my piece and at the end of the last line was this is only for your understanding not to print so I still keep that percent from one of the PR people so that story was not contested so it was great so that was sort of give confidence to Vinod and that led to my big even bigger story that is the breaking of the mining scam in Pallari so we went with the headline the Reddy Republic when even when the world had not woken up to anything like that the Loka Yukta had not woken up and the first criminal defamation case by the Reddy's the notorious Reddy's who finally got jailed was filed against Vinod Mehta and me the very first criminal defamation case so we felt vindicated after that also was proved but in between all of this Vinod knew that I was this I was my feature side was also very good not just the political and the other side and this SM Krishna thing when I came to Karnataka the first time the cover story that I first did I went around and I realized Krishna is losing I got a sense that this man is not going to come I wrote that Vinod published it he said Krishna and the covers cover was Krishna's photograph and Naidu's photograph and Krishna had a red light there and I had explained why Krishna may not come back and it turned out to be correct because although Krishna was very unhappy with what I had written and they sort of somebody from his side called me and they spoke badly I didn't really worry too much but that turned out to be correct so I think you know we journalists or reporters have to convince their writer editors not by taking fancy ideas to them but actually doing these stories and those stories turning out to be correct and that builds a relationship with your editor so he impulsively trusts what you're trying to tell him or trying to you know I mean the ideas that you're trying to give him and then he gives you a so finally it became an outlook or Sugata's what's true a story you would not even ask what it is you say okay one page enough two page enough it came down to that so you felt very happy and in between something very big happened which is the 10th anniversary of Outlook and I was made I was officially made the historian of Outlook so I wrote this longest essay I think the only competitor I had in Outlook was Arundhati Roy it was as long an essay as that which is titled the history of Outlook in ten and a half chapters it was ten years of Outlook and I begin with I mean I'd asked Julian Barnes to I thought of him when he told me that I'd asked him for a it was an eponymous title of course I'd asked him for a quote or something he had said I'm too busy or something I start with that and then I this went on and then for that 10th anniversary issue I sort of all my exposure to the to England and all that had came good because one is of course Julian Barnes which is incidental but then I interviewed Harold Evans I interviewed Shyam Lal the great Times of India's editor I mean I think I had a lot of pages in that you know the biggest essay was mine the cover story was mine and that was a very momentous occasion because it was ten years of Outlook an alternate magazine to India today had survived and Vinod was at his peak and when there was this party that was organized to celebrate in the evening so Vinod came looking for me he held my hand took me to Rajan Raheja the owner and he said he's the one who's written the history of Outlook and that was my finest moment Amit because you know I mean you always dreamt of Vinod Mehta and working for Vinod Mehta and here was a moment when he sort of you know I mean said well done and Vinod was very stingy with praise he would only say well done that's all and you had to even his appraisal letters used to be so very you know in increment letters used to be so very tighted just two lines and then he would if he really wanted to say that he meant it he would call and you would say well done well done keep it up keep it up that's all if he says I would tell my wife he said keep it up twice so which means he's trying to emphasize that thing so I used to be so alert to his phone calls the great man and he did not make he also taught me about financial probity he never made money he never you know built farmhouses and he did not sort of you know go on transatlantic trips and he did not like going to going and staying in five-star hotels used to come here and used to say he take me to some dosa place that corner thing that you took me last time on the footpath it was that kind of a so that taught me a lot of lessons without actually besides journalism of course besides the great journalism that he allowed us to do and that was it was a it was a he was living the role that I you know when I had imagined and it was a great it was a great great time for me when I I think I mean I used to then I when I became an editor I was trying to imitate Vinod many times trying to be accommodative trying to allow ideas to come inside the newsroom I brought in this practice of asking the junior most you know we had a panel you know the junior most in the newsroom should come and sit in the news meeting not just the seniors and they would absorb they could speak and I made this rule that the best idea wins not the senior who speaks you know does not get space it is the best idea that wins and these things you know I mean it was a very nice little cushy ride for the for three years and the Times of India's Vijay Karnataka and then of course Modi happened so that started disrupting things because I think they started orienting themselves differently and I was inconvenient although I had critical and commercial success the papers number we had touched a readership of nearly 8 million readership you know it's not very unnatural for a regional paper but it was huge for a Kannada paper because the market was a very small market for various historical reasons and it had expanded and the circulation had gone up revenues were good we were all being taken you know annual holidays to foreign countries so it was all very good until what he happened and that I think is a statement."

        "message": "Initially yes I think you know I mean I was but also that seven o'clock call stopped after Vinod retired and I moved on and I started editing a Kannada beast called Vijay Karnataka and then of course I was then I mean yeah I think he passed away when I was with the Asianet whatever so that had broken in a way but then you know the mental association and I mean I always wanted to report back to Vinod saying that I have done this so that was always the basic thing you know I mean so if I'd got a if my newspaper broke a big story or if when I got a guy to sort of do something very interesting I just always felt that I should tell him and I would occasionally call him you know because it was also a kind of relationship where you know he's a very big man and he used to appear on television channels and used to be very busy also he kept himself very busy he was editorial chairman but then he used to still attend office and all that I would and it became a little complicated with others around and all that I didn't want to sort of cannibalize on his time and also but I would occasionally call him up and tell him that I wanted to tell you this and very briefly tell him that and my conversations on the phone are very formal so you know it's another thing when I'm sitting in front of him I can confess I can speak I can tell him that this happened so there were a few couple of occasions where I told him about the problems that I'm having in the newsroom and all that and he gave me some wonderful advice and when his Rahul when the Sanjay Gandhi biography got reprinted I was the editor in editor of Vijay Karnataka and he called me up and he said this has got reprinted and somebody in Bangalore wants to organize a launch function at the Taj so will you be in conversation with me so I was mighty pleased you know I mean you know asking me to be in conversation with him and so I did that so I mean I so that that point I felt that there was this kind of it was reciprocal you know he was seeing me as someone whom he could sort of as some kind of a there was an emotional linkage so he never let it out but then it would always be there so so that made me very happy and then of course I read some initial pages from Lucknow boy and all that and he was very excited about that he would talk about it and then I he asked me when somebody wanted to get it translated into Kannada so after it got published and it was a roaring success so that somebody had directly approached him so then he said he told them very very very nice of him to say that he said that will be decided by Sugata so so then it became imperative and obligatory on me to sort of quickly fix up a translator but of course he did not live to see the translation which came out really beautifully in Kannada the Lucknow boys in Kannada as well so I mean of course I Sumita Mehta was there and she was very kind to give permission to the book and it came out in Kannada and it was a big success in Kannada as well so this was Vinod and the kind of bonding and you know I mean I remember a line from William Shon's a book on William Shon written by Ved Mehta and that's a one of the one of the books that I really love reading because William Shon I always thought was a character like Vinod Mehta and I always used to tell Ajit that Ajit you have to write a book and it should be called Vinod Mehta's outlook like William Shon's New Yorker so Ajit of course Ajit wrote a lovely book on journalism which did well Hachette published it it was called off the record it was full of stories and his lovely interaction with Vinod and Vinod wrote the foreword for that book as well and that's where he said that Ajit Pillai would have thrived even without me he was a great reporter whom I sort of had the joy of having in my newsroom so that was the humility of the man as well so he taught us to extend that kind of courtesies to others you know if you are under a great man and a good man he teaches you a lot of these things and and very indirectly without without being didactic and instructive so so that so William Shon I was telling you about William Shon and Ved Mehta so there's a line there which struck me when I was reading it and this was around the time when Vinod was still alive and I was to do this introduction and conversation on the Sanjay Gandhi book so I was preparing myself and I wanted to impress him and I took this line from that book and I and it said that whoever I mean I sort of became emotionally attached to I saw them as my father that's that's some something like that I'm not quoting verbatim so he's here met William Shon and he's given him a job in New Yorker and is nurturing his talent and he says you know you I developed that what he meant was that I developed that kind of kinship relationship with him so whoever sort of they became my kind of father figures or whatever so I use that for Vinod and I'm very very happy that I used it and he heard it and he never responded he did not say anything and Vinod Vinod did not say anything that meant that he has registered on him Vinod did not have children of course he speaks about a girl he sort of may have fathered and must be living somewhere in Europe in his Lucknow boy but Vinod did not have children and I always was curious what he thought of people like us who were bordering on almost worship you know when we literally worship not mean worship was not the bhakt kind of worship but that genuine respect for his integrity which is very very rare in journalism that financial probity that see I went to cover the crash in Mangalore air crash okay I went there and I took the first flight and landed there and I wrote a story and I sent it to Outlook and I was supposed to come back and then you know usually the arrangement in Outlook was that you got the ticket from Delhi you went there and then I had to tell them when I'm returning and they would send me another ticket and this smart Alec kind of a MBA person someone sitting in the in the marketing office or the the business office I sent a note saying that I'm supposed to return on such and such a day so please send me a ticket and all that and we had done mortuary visits for three days continuously and the scene was so bad I write in my story that we went to report but we were actually asked to help so we had to pull out people we had to sort of help people identify so you became part of something else you know you went to report and it was a very traumatic experience you know I mean you can't see charred bodies like that and be normal and it was all over in those mortuaries and we had done that for three days me and the photographer and I wrote for air tickets back to Bangalore and this fellow says oh the air tickets are very expensive you take a bus back I was furious I asked him who told you to deny me an air ticket I mean I was a senior editor I was already an associate editor with Outlook he said no no no we have a the CEO or somebody has said that you know the air tickets are it's it's a bad time for the organization so we have to sort of cut costs so we can't send you the ticket so sitting on the pavement there of a mortuary and I had a luxury of a blackberry those days and I was had this fancy instrument and I wrote on my blackberry to Vinod Mehta directly saying I have done these many things I have filed my story I have done these mortuary visits I'm exhausted I'm broken in some sense and when I write for what is my legitimate thing for a ticket to go back to Bangalore I am told to take a bus this is how you treat your journalists so you know I wrote that I sent it and I was so furious I usually am a very calm collected kind of I don't do it I was very unhappy because you know I think those deaths and those the environment was so bad and I got an immediate response on the mail Vinod said I'm very sorry it has happened without my knowledge I'll ensure that the ticket comes to you I mean which editor on earth of that stature of that kind of thing would say a sorry to a ordinary you know person you know like me a person reporting from some corner of India so that that again was a life lesson he was like Vivek Mehta you know made William Shawn established a kinship relationship with him it happened with me also I have to confess it happened with me also and by then my father was dead my father was gone and I was hurriedly looking to substitute you know I mean people and then Vinod came like that so it was a very special bond it is that bond exists with Vinod that bond exists with Jeremy Seabrook I think there are two people who sort of I don't I wouldn't say they replaced my father or whatever like that but then you extend those kind of that kind of relationship and have that relationship and extend those courtesies and those respects to these two people so they were Vinod I mean more than Vinod it was Jeremy because Jeremy got involved I mean with the I mean with the family in the sense he was he was very he would understand try to understand what's happening in my family what's happening with my children he would talk to my wife for long hours talk to my children would counsel them he would speak to them so he developed a very different kind of bond Vinod could not shake off that thing it was a limited thing but he had a connect with my wife too in a sense he would speak to her would he would ask her a few things when he came here he would be very particular he would tell bring her for dinner when we sort of meet in Bangalore when we went to Delhi to call on him what was he would be very gracious but Jeremy was at a different level but then you exit this Vedmahata thing I quoted just to say that it happens with all of us that people who are you always want to sort of extend the kinship relationship you see somebody as your mother who's not your biological mother you see somebody as your father because he's been nice and not not a patriarch but then someone who has nurtured you who sort of you know sheltered you what was been who's made you feel very special was you know advanced your career without putting themselves before you know a lot of such things so I always remember that line from William Shawn's I mean Vedmahata's book on William Shawn a great book you know I don't still have a copy I read it with some I borrowed somebody's copy and then I have a Kindle version of it so I mean I still have not been able to get a hard copy which I will I hope to buy someday and just keep it there for myself so that was Vinod Mehta so that was the kind of liberal journalistic newsroom he built he sustained and he allowed a lot of people to thrive and I should say he spoiled us all because after that working anywhere was a very claustrophobic experience because there was I'm sure Vinod had to deal with his owners and when I had to deal with my owners directly there was no filter right there was no this man protecting your interests and arguing for your sake getting you money and increments and things to travel and all that so he was I mean I missed him and when I started and then the buck stopped at my table as an editor I used to be as careful and generous trying to be probably I would in with whatever limitations that was there you know the first thing when I went to Vijay Karnataka I realized that I something this is something that Binal Pandey also told you on your show the other day I realized that the salaries were pathetic of people who were stringers and refusal correspondents so the first thing the first big argument I made was there should be a parity and there should be a kind of structure that everybody sort of knows what they're trying to get or will get or whatever so that happened times was times that have bought that argument and they were quite happy to sort of I would tell them that you're such a big organization I don't think your employee should go out and say that we're not paid well and if you're not paid if a journalist is not paid well and if he has a family to run he'll always look for avenues to make supplementary incomes and that's when the politician comes into the picture so he'll try to push something else so let us say try and make it as reasonable as possible and they responded positively to that that whole argument and that happened and then I sort of also sort of I was did not want to look very moralistic or you know having come from the English spear and I knew that you know it was a world of a difference and people were not acclimatized to here so I would sort of very gently bring them around and get them to see my point of view and I would tell them that if you make innocent mistakes I will be the first one to pardon you but if you make deliberate mistakes then I'll kick you out you know I mean I cannot tolerate corruption because there was this problem that it still is there in Canada which is the problem of rampant financial corruption inside newsrooms you know journalists and others they sort of find ways to sort of corrupt journalists and there was a history to that paper also and it was completely on the right and those arguments had to be neutralized made more balanced made to look more like journalism and I had to I mean they all sort of mean it's also very nice that people when you speak to them the way you speak matters a great deal and my colleagues never gave me a problem they sort of care it was the marketing fellows and the circulation fellows who would come and tell no no no this we need to put more of this to sell more but I think journalists started seeing this whole joy of doing a great story and the natural reaction that it evokes you know we did so many human interest stories and that they saw the whole thing changing so I was I used to tell them the next day that this is the power of good journalism see this has changed something I still remember there was the story of a Muslim girl who had been treated I mean incorrectly in a government hospital and she had been paralyzed and her father was a poor Muslim guy who ran a workshop somewhere and he had to sell his I think house or pledge it or something like that and he was in debt and for a mistake that he had not committed it was a simple problem he took her to this hospital a government hospital a children's hospital and they gave her wrong medicine and it had all reacted and she had become paralyzed for life and he was running from pillar to post meeting ministers in a congress government who are Muslims and they were not helping him they were not sort of doing anything and then we were getting furious because he came and met one of my reporters and that reporter sort of did not tell us in the newsroom that there was this big story to be done but we somehow you know one of the chiefs one of his immediate seniors sort of recognized that there was something happening and then he said he suddenly raised the issue in the meeting and I and he said there must be a I think there's a great story there that that father has been coming and eating his head so there must be a story I think we can do a human interest story or something like that so I mean I was trying to humanize the newspaper as much as possible so I asked what this story was then they narrated this whole thing then I said instinctively I said check up the chief minister's relief fund and see who has been given money from the chief minister's relief fund if this child does not deserve money then who else deserves money from the government check up all this you know I mean the chief minister gives doles right to all these people so by evening my reporters had done a fantastic job they came back to me and they said sir you will be shocked one very big Kannada writer is being paid for his dialysis he was a former vice-chancellor he was a former chancellor former sitting chancellor former vice-chancellor and he has enough money he has a house in Bangalore he has a house in Mysore he has a farmhouse and he's being given money for his dialysis and his whole thing I mean I'm deliberately withholding the name so he is being given this money so but the child is being denied this child is a poem and we have been putting this whole story on the front page and the government is not responding so I said just contrast that and write a story so that went on the front page and all hell broke loose this writer who was also a friend of my father would come for his funeral called me and he and he sort of literally abused me and he said I'm sending you a note now and you do whatever you want and I'm it's not my problem if the government gives me money I mean I am in you don't know you're killing me you know what will happen if I see he was in serious medical condition but you know in the government is there for people like the little girl who is and she has committed no mistake it is she went to your institution and you have crippled her and here is a writer who can afford his costs and you're sort of you know pandering him and so he told me that it's not just this chief minister who gave me money the previous Eduard Appa also gave me money the other fellow also gave me money I said are you willing to sort of put all this on mail to me I will sort of carry your version so he sort of sent his version and I think he must have written it in complete he was in it was angry and he must have written it in his angry mood and that had some details which exposed him further so I just published that letter also and that sort of created such a buzz I'm just giving you one example of a story and how systems work unfairly and if you just decide to sort of do a little bit it sort of works to the benefits of the child had of course the child got some aid and all that but it exposed the system and it was a Congress government that was in power and this man had taken money from the Congress government the previous BJP government from Eduard Appa from everybody and I think it was a habit that had been formed that if I am a great writer I have sort of you know contributed to the culture of the state so I need to be taken care of that was a an attitude which I never sort of accepted and it is the same writers and same journalists in Karnataka who sort of protected this kind of an environment who took free sites from government you know they were called G category sites so SM Krishna distributed it all these people distributed all the all the chief ministers have done that it finally when it went to the high court it got state I mean so they were distributing this largest giving them benefits giving them discounted whatever some people took two sides so that they could sell one and build a house on the other one this is this this is I am speaking about G category sites in Karnataka this was journalism and of course communalism and was on the other side it was sort of on the rise and paper that I edited sort of had made it its ideological duty to sort of promote a certain kind of polarization and it started with that I'm sorry to say it started with that and corruption was another element so there were and so we today when we talk about the media Amit we say oh it's all gone bad today it's gone back gone bad yesterday oh it was not like this I'm sorry it was I think there were always people like this if you look at the emergency and the Indian media I'm working on a book on emergency and the Indian-American diaspora I'll be going to the US to research shortly they're full of examples of how media compromised how people sort of board how people sort of did not stand up for what was correct so I mean I mean I am not shocked by what we are seeing today the mainstream media so today we have Twitter and Facebook where we sort of amplify the whole problem but tell me all these senior editors who are in my book on Devya Gowda I speak about Ramkrishna Hegde and the people he cultivated people who did not belong to the state were given sites in the state and they were all big editors in Delhi and he was creating a lobby for himself in Delhi hoping that you know they will support him and they'll prop him up when the time comes but you know I mean Devya Gowda's destiny was something else so he got he became the Prime Minister not Mr. Hegde and Hegde was covering up all his corruption that was happening here with his kind of you know many things that were he could manage through public relations in Delhi so lobbies and cocktail circuits and moulding of opinion in cocktail circuits and the anglophone elite and the absence of understanding of the real India all of this has been true even three decades four decades ago and it's true today as well I think today we are far far far more aware of the problems than that existed then because they were just small little institutions tucked away nobody looked at them seriously now anything you do there are hundreds of people attacking you there are trolls and there are people who question you so I think we are in I mean I agree with you that we are in a slightly better situation now not in a worse situation because we are aware far more aware of the problems that confront us and have sort of put us in this kind of a condition and the other issue is of newsrooms is of diversity nobody speaks about it and you know I mean I try to correct the situation as much as possible I try to create a kind of rainbow or newsroom where people from the backward classes Dalits I appointed a Delhi bureau chief who was a Dalit I had a chief photographer who was a Dalit I made chief sub-editors I mean I'd consciously mix the castes because you know I mean without your knowledge or without your knowledge with or without your knowledge your worldviews that have that you've inherited unconsciously now not many people are cruel deliberately it's an unconscious kind of a thing they come in with those prejudices and that gets perpetrated so when you're reporting when you're when you're a medium that is sort of holding a mirror to the society and you are writing it from a certain perspective without even caring so that's where I remember Lankesh who asked do you have a Muslim friend do you have a Christian friend go and make a Muslim friend you will learn much more about society than actually reading 10 books on Tolstoy or Dostoevsky that was a great thing right so so here diversity is still a very big issue in Indian newsrooms it's largely upper caste it's largely men women have slowly sort of made some kind of thing because because of television mostly because of the screen and the and I don't know how much of control they have over what gets in or what gets out but then at least there are you see women because it's it's a visual thing right so diversity has been a big issue and I think if we don't solve that all this idea of India bankum that we keep speaking about will not get resolved because you don't have people in centers of communication who can pick up those ideas real diversity thing see lots of leaders in India we talk so much about Nehru why is it that we speak so little about a Morarji was he an outright kind of some buffoon no you know if you study Morarji if you read as a three volumes of Macmillan autobiography I mean my respect went up for the man you know I mean he was see you're condemned for one little thing and you're typecast you look at Jagjivan Ram who never succeeded it was a great administrator please know that he was a great administrator Devraj Harris was never celebrated is the man who gave you the idea of backward class reservation even before Mandal was commissioned during the Janata party regime he was the one who you know very innovatively made use of emergency to implement a lot of progressive policies in Karnataka and therefore came back to power when everybody lost when Congress lost everywhere he came back with a far improved margin and a far improved number so that is something that is because we don't have people who are sensitive to these see it doesn't happen in the American newsroom it is there the problem exists it exists everywhere there is a certain class and a certain caste or a certain set of people who sort of dominate environments but at least that consciousness has to grow inside you that we have to make our newsrooms diverse we have to sort of get people from all shades to come in in this mandalization of politics we speak so much about but the same politicians who benefited from the mandalization process are so bad about advocating these kind of causes so they've actually sabotaged their own revolution so I mean they have made it Parivarwad and all that is a separate issue but they never have advocated the kind of things that one needs to and diversity is at the center of Indian journalism and the center of Indian media and until unless you learn to accommodate different kinds of people in your newsroom you will not be doing justice to the idea of India or diversity of India or its multilingual heritage or the various world views that are around us you will just never get closer to reality."

vindictiveness of people who are not ideologically aligned to you is something which is it's becoming so very obvious ideologically or you know I mean who presented alternate point of view forget ideology, ideology is a very big word so that is becoming very obvious but that is the reason why you know we also have to start thinking about how we structure news organizations or what is the business model or how do we sort of incorporate a company and what should see there has to be some kind of legislative intervention as soon as possible or as and when it is possible where crossholding should be banned you know I mean your crossholdings and all of that also create a lot of problems because you are automatically making yourself liable right so you are a businessman you're doing this you're also using see this all of this started when you started using your business your journalism to leverage for your business interests see it is not innocent on the other side also right it is not just journalists who have started these tuta puta small little digital organizations my sympathies are entirely with them and I am I mean following their work and I also write for them occasionally but the problem is the other people who were supposedly upholders of this institutional journalism started leveraging journalism for other things you know they had to extend their plant or they had to do something new license had to be got or they had to import something you know I mean I hear ridiculous stories when I go to Delhi from my friends who would be panicking and then I tell them calm down let's have another drink or you can go later no no no madam had called or sir had called they are having some function and the road has not been asphalted properly I think I need to speak to somebody and just ensure that it is done so this and they hold big conclaves in Delhi and then you have to get guests and you have to get guests you have to sort of use your public relation so journalists have become so many things rolled into one public relations experts and people who speak to the local municipality to get roads asphalted and you know I mean of course you know checking on the application of your daughter or granddaughter or grandson in the passport office and then putting in a word I mean this is ridiculous and it's gone to that level and it is not that it's not again a problem that happened on the other side the government the government realized that they are vulnerable and they started there is somebody who came some smart fellow came in 2014 and he thought he could exploit them for that the earlier regime for was see I always say this about the Congress regimes which is the guilt of the emergencies put on them so much that they at least have a little you know I mean qualms about you know doing something with the media in a manner that will set deepen the kind of distrust about them so the Chidambaram did get Raju Nari Setty out of India so all of that these are stories that get you know come back in a different I didn't say that you said it yeah so they come back in a different context they get so we have seen again what happened with Bobby Ghosh and all of that is true and all of that is very real and I mean in my own it is autobiographical for me I could not stay in a newsroom because I had to once I realized that I had to make too many compromises I said let me keep the relationship and move out and I just moved out this is I mean I both with the times then I moved to the Asianet where I was looking after a very big old Kannada newspaper and also running television channels and then I mean I realized that you know I mean I was just not fitting into the whole thing it is see you're not asked to it doesn't at least in in my experience you are not asked to leave or you're not told on your face but then the situation is made so uncomfortable that then if you have some self-respect left in you you would say let me sort of step down and let them continue in the way they want to so that's exactly what happened with me and then I went and started a digital thing you know which is the first of its kind with podcasting, video, multiple thing you know interwoven thing and that also had to sort of wind up because the people who had funded me their names appeared in the paradise papers and then you know I mean I think they became squeamish about it and they withdrew the funding so then I decided writing is the best thing for some time because the atmosphere is not conducive for you to sort of pursue your journalism so I stood I mean at least I had writing to save me and I had some you know I mean I had I didn't have to worry about a house to live in so I sort of you know but that is not the case with everybody right people I mean I understand and I'm completely respect if people have to stay back in newsrooms because they have to run families they have to support families they have to you know support their children's education I can understand that I was slightly older and I had worked in senior positions and made relatively more money which sustains me for a longer period it's not that it can sustain me forever but and also there is this you know you're this thing idealistic and as I said little magazines were showcases of idealism Plimpton obituary you know it said this beautiful line in Boston Globe showcases of idealism so similarly you know you also have this value system which has been ingrained in you and you want to live up to that and you feel that your conscience is pricking and your answer answering your people you love who have sort of invested so much of trust and love and affection in you and they thought you'll never violate that so you are you're actually the moral you know quandary and that you're put into it is so stressful it's so stressful it is so difficult to negotiate that moral quandary and I think that is the biggest punishment it is not losing a job it is not having to leave a place it's not about making money it's about how do you answer your conscience how do you sort of navigate that delicate thing you know is the more troublesome thing because you're not answering yourself there you're not just answering your immediate material requirements you're answering your father your forefather your teachers and all your learning and education and the weight of that heritage falls on you at that point of time so you don't want to feel compromised because it's almost suicide."

Everybody would be Vishnu Pitamaha. What a horrible thought. Anyway so you know how does that how has that changed your outlook on life in general like you know one of the ways in which I think I have changed with time is that earlier I was kind of goal oriented that I had specific goals yeh karna hai, woh karna hai, yeh karna hai but now I've become more not even process oriented but more journey oriented that take happiness in the small things you know wake up in the morning looking forward to what you're going to do that day and so on so how has that changed your approach to life like when you wake up in the morning what do you look forward to, how do you define happiness for yourself today?

It's it's it's I mean I have slowed down a little I think that is a great thing that I have done you know I mean I used to you know be in office from 10 in the morning till 10 in the night I would not see my daughter not see my son and you know these pressures and I would take calls even at one o'clock in the night because the final edition would go and I would I was very in I was a very meticulous edit I wanted to see the front page before it went to the press and they would wake me up and and calls could come at any time of the day and all that so the best thing that has happened after I have stopped running institutions in the last two or two and a half years or three years is and and it took took the whole time writing and I don't know if I will ever get back to the newsroom it may happen may not happen but the thing is that I have slowed down that it's I'm enjoying that that that slowness because you know I mean you don't have to sort of accomplish something or prove yourself to somebody else all that you're left to prove is to yourself and so that is sort of you know I mean I mean I I became hypertensive at one point of time and now all my indices are good is it's touch gold or touch whatever it's sort of looking normal and and I have to just manage a little and then it I don't have to really be worried about it so so that is one thing that has happened so I I usually get a very early I'm not a I mean for a journalist I'm an early riser I'm up by five so I'm looking forward to the walk with my wife in the morning so that is when I get to listen to you, your podcast you know I mean I I have a I create a playlist and then I do a certain ritualistic listening and then I walk for an hour and so I mean there is a spillover for the next day that the day after so I I look forward to that and then of course you know days that are I'm bored I just listen to music today for instance I listen to Jaitirtha Mevundi who's a rising star in Hindustani music and you see superbly rendered Chandrakants you know I mean so I mean I was listening to that so I mean the pace has come down and that pace coming down also sometimes brings anxiety to me let me confess because I feel that I have retired although because I'm still writing columns you know I mean I breathlessly writing I produce a lot of writing you know I mean I write four columns a month which is a lot and you have to come up with new ideas and then in between there are special requests so you have to do that and I'm working on two books simultaneously and I'm commissioned by Penguin to do those two books so so those things are lying on my mind so library work travel all that is there out there but then sometimes I feel that that buzz that was there in the newsroom is missing and oh I have I semi-retired oh is this how you sort of you know I mean live if you're not working full time so then I take solace from from people on Brunton Street in Bangalore that is where Ramachandra Gohar lives he has lived that life for a long time of just writing so I just calm myself you know I mean that occasionally comes up and because my father worked for his all all his life he went to teach first at the Christ College and then Canada University you know that he was just working and he retired for me my retirement or semi-retirement or a break has come I mean in my you know I'm just about touching 50 and so it's come very early so I mean you don't know what to do so you have to you innovate so I as I work with some startup trying to help them build a media thing and it's it's all it's all mentorship you know basically they come and then I discuss ideas with them so that gives me a lot of joy so there's somebody who's trying to develop a mental health product and they've said how does how does one link media to that and then I was just trying to get consumed with that idea so Bangalore that way I mean one thing I've learned is the small little idea that my father told me that as you grow older engage with the younger so they keep you young they bring new ideas and don't think that you have to pontificate listen to them because they would have brighter ideas they would have come with a different set of questions so to answer which you will have to equip yourself so don't be this person that you know you don't go with a set of ideas with them so that listening sort of helps so I come to Koshi's I go to other places and just listen to people speak and they come home and then there's because of my engagement in the newsroom my the the colleagues who work with me are all over so they call up they say sir if you were there you would allow this story this editor is not so I don't get into that kind of a thing but then I just listen to them so that gives them a bit of solace and whatever so I think writing I have what I have discovered is that after 2008-19 when I in 19 beginning of 19 is when I started working on the Deve Gowda book I feel I mean I have told myself that I'm essentially a writer and my wife has reiterated that she's also a writer so she is she's a poet so she has reiterated that thing that I married you essentially because you were a writer not because you were a big editor or that or this or whatever so that reassures me that there is no pressure from the home front where she's expecting a certain kind of you know thing from me and I am falling short of it so it's very very important that you have understanding partners so so that is there and then my daughter is full of stories and my son is you know I mean full of stories they are reading different kinds of things which I mentioned in the acknowledgement of my book you know I mean they're reading various different things and except reading their father they're doing everything else so which is a very good thing maybe they're"

After years of marriage he stands at the foot of the bed and tells his wife that she will never know him that for everything he says there is more that he does not say that behind each word he utters there is another word and hundreds more behind that one all those unsaid words he says contain his true self which has been betrayed by the superficial self before him. So you see he says kicking off his slippers I am more than what I have led you to believe I am oh you silly man says his wife of course you are I find that just thinking of you having so many selves receding into nothingness is very exciting that you barely exist as you are couldn't please me more.

Narasimhaswamy was very personal to me when I was very romantic and young and thought that every other girl that I meet may fall in love with me so he was he created that kind of connubial bliss and a world that he constructed was so fantastic and his metaphors and his images were even to this day you know I mean sort of they don't escape you so he was there and then Kopal Krishna Adiga tried to rationalize a lot of things for me so he tried to bring in history into his poetry he tried to bring in ideas into his poems and he sort of ridiculed the idea of writing on love and family the way the other man was writing so that was there and so there is Narasimhaswamy, there is Adiga and then of course there is Kuvempu, Kuvempu's prose you know I mean I don't like his poetry to be honest he's very sort of you know I mean I mean I feel he's very artificial of course there are some great poems too but then I love him for his prose and I love him for his novels so he was great and he was he was he again you know I mean what fascinates me was he or Lankesh never left the corner of their room but they imagined their world sitting in that corner, Karanth was not like that, Karanth always borrowed money to travel the world and wrote but these two guys I don't know how it was possible you know I mean it's unthinkable that Lankesh could bring the world to my feet and make it so interesting, Kuvempu if you look at the range of his poems that I was looking he's writing about some little development happening in Mexico at that time in the 50s 60s and then that spirituality which was passed on as some kind of a moral you know thing beautiful core that it built in me is his poetry I may not like but there is one poem that he writes about the conscience and that has been some kind of a mantra for me when I thought I was not theist or agnostic or whatever and I am atheist I try to borrow that as my manifesto so there is his writings and of course when it comes to English Graham Greene is one of my but before Graham Greene I was a great fan of Joseph Conrad nobody speaks of today and secret agent is you know I mean very thrilling kind of thing about anarchy was always something that I have gone back to when I have wanted to understand a lot of complex political problems so secret agent Nostromo heart of darkness so I mean he was later on condemned as someone who looked at things in a very racial frame but then ideology can make everything look like a nonsense so I don't think we should really worry about that but he has given me great joy and he was also very important for me because he learnt his English after he was he crossed his 30s you know he was a Polish guy who learnt English much later in life and wrote such splendid fresh prose so somebody told me this you know long back they said if you have learnt English after having read your mother tongue well you write your English very differently so I always carried that with me and Joseph Conrad was a symbol of that for me so of course Marquez and Borges the Latin American writers these two stand out and then I mean for me oh yeah the great writer was Balzac for me cousin Pons and yeah Flaubert Madame Bovary you know when I read it at an age when I wouldn't have understood it but you know I mean I read it because there was adultery happening you know I mean you know you wanted to explore that whole thing and then Madame Bovary was a great thing that and then I still remember the I think was it a Paris Review interview or some other interview where he's asked on his deathbed Flaubert is asked who is Madame Bovary so he says Madame Bovary say wow it's me so it's I mean things like that which sort of you know I mean made you a lot of European literature Victor Hugo again you know I mean somebody who taught me to sort of look at poverty in a completely different thing I mean Dickens of course how can I forget Dickens you know I mean Dickens was somebody who is an ideal for me for a very long time and it gave me great comfort when I became a journalist that he was also sort of you know doing a lot of these things and Orwell, Orwell the first thing I read of Orwell was not a novel or animal form or anything it was the review that Orwell wrote for my experiments with truth what an incredible review that was. The Gandhi essay is fantastic, the first paragraph of it. So that was there and Orwell and so these are I mean lots of things that you read and off late you know I mean I really enjoyed reading I mean this is a few months ago was Michael Sandel's Tyranny of Merit I thought there was a lot of argument that one could borrow to write about India itself it was a great book then I read I mean the book that I really loved and I wrote about also was Amartya Sen's book Amartya Sen's memoirs or autobiography Home and the World because that is the kind of the local and the universal that I always had imagined and it was just like reading about my own childhood. Rooted cosmopolitan and you know the astonishing thing between I mean that I read there and also read in Marquis's autobiography Living to Tell a Tale is where Amartya Sen says that my English was not so good I'm not was not very confident about my English and he's in 10th class or something and Marquis says the biggest regret is won the Nobel Prize mind you both of them have won the Nobel Prize and Marquis in his Living to Tell a Tale says the regret that I still have to this day is that I never spoke English well or I can't speak English well. So I mean what is it that made me wonder what is it that this language what is this language which extracts regrets from even the most accomplished so this language is there is something else in this language it's very pernicious. So I started looking at English a little more suspiciously because you know if it has that kind of a hold and sway on even the most accomplished then that's that I thought it was not correct. So of course Amartya Sen and I read I greatly enjoyed reading Direndra Jha's book on Gandhi's assassin and not so much for to understand the ideological construct but for the side stories in it the"

The politician is always looked at through the framework of power and achievement and government and state and things like that but they forget that they are often people who are as vulnerable as you and I are and power does not eliminate anything. I mean I see the insecurity of Deva Gowda even at 89 today when he speaks about something or the other so I mean I can feel that you know I mean why is he I mean I feel why is he panicking about this it's such a small thing but then I realized that he's a human being you know I mean he has to react like you and me so those things you know I mean but then there I again that was a great book which is I really enjoyed on the political side was the team of rivals of course it was not read recently but Doris Kearns Goodwin she was remarkable fantastic absolutely marvelous I have been trying to read Louis Bu\u00f1uel in his memoirs again and Louis Althusser I don't know for some strange reason I started picking up on reading it and so I keep going back to a lot of these things I actually went back to a book of interviews by Oriana Fallaci interviewing history it's fascinating because this lady I mean of course there she was accused of making up a few quotes here and there but who cares it's actually written so well same thing about Kapuskinski you know I mean Rizat Kapuskinski shadows in the sun yeah in imperial shadows in the sun Shah of Shahs and amazing thing I recently I think Salman Rushdie wrote a small little note on his Kapuskinski and his relationship and the thing that he does on that new platform whatever it is called and I subscribe and I just get his posts and he had written about Kapuskinski and an immensely talented writer now forget the fudging bit if he if at all he's that is a separate that's a separate issue but the prose itself and the thing itself was so appealing so this is about writing you know but then lots more actually but then Kannada of course lots more but when it comes to music you know I mean I've become a slightly eclectic listener now because if my children again you know they listen to a lot of other things and they make me listen and but I am wedded to committed deeply committed to listening to Mansoor Manlik Arjun Mansoor whom I had the great opportunity to accompany him to the local bank in Dharwad holding his hand when he when my father went to see him so I mean Mansoor because he's very soothing and I've Bheem Sen Joshi and Kumar Gandharvan all the Dharwad singers I like but he is very special because he does not I don't know if it's the right word to use he does not pretend in his singing he's he does not sort of perform he gives himself in he gives himself in so I mean I'm really taken in but and and and something that the rest of outside of Karnataka people may not be familiar is his singing of the Vachanas and again you know I mean it's it's marvelous and I listen to them very often again Basuraj Rajguru singing the Vachanas Basuraj Sidhram Jambaldini another Hindustani great singing the Vachanas for me Vachanas singing has the potential of the Rabindra Sangeet you know which is an independent genre which has not been converted all these Lingayat leaders and politicians all of them seek power through the caste but then they have not harnessed their cultural treasures it's a complaint that I have against them so I love to listen to that and I I love to listen to songs of Bendre being sung by good people I recently for his birthday I compiled a Twitter playlist and it was a I mean I enjoyed doing something like that so that's that's about it I mean I'm on to Netflix because I my wife and I joke that this is the platform which has helped us keep our marriage going that's our time you know when we watch shows and we just finished watching Outlander so I mean I think the sixth season is going to come and we are waiting curiously for that she's watching Nightfall and I have missed the initial episodes and she said you should watch so because we try to catch up with history and all that you know which we which we could not have read deeply we try to sort of understand the nuance of it through them lots of one interesting times you know interesting stuff that comes by us and then we consume and it becomes something else in your head and she did not like watching money haste or whatever so I watched the whole thing so things like that lovely you've given"
