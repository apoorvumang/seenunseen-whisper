When historical events are happening in the present tense, all possibilities seem open, everything seems chaotic, anything can happen. Also, there are far more factors at play that determine the course of history, and most of those don't make it to the narrative that we later tell about it. Also, historians come along who look further, who look deeper, and expand that narrative and our knowledge of the world. Srinath Raghavan is one such historian, and Bangladesh is one such subject."

        "message": "Please welcome your host, Amit Varma. Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My topic today is the Bangladesh War of 1971, but not the events of the war itself, but the global forces that shaped those circumstances. People often think of the breakup of Pakistan as if it was inevitable, and people often see it as a bilateral conflict between India and Pakistan. None of those are quite true. Srinath Raghavan's book, 1971, A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh, takes a deep look at the international events that led to the creation of Bangladesh, and the actions of not just India and Pakistan, but also the USA, the Soviet Union, and China. But before we get to my conversation with Srinath, let's take a quick commercial break. This episode of The Scene and the Unseen is brought to you by Storytel. Storytel is an audiobook platform which you can listen to on your Android or iOS app. They have thousands of audiobooks you can listen to on your mobile, including hundreds in local languages like Hindi and Marathi. An unlimited monthly subscription costs only 2.99 a month, but you can get a 30-day free trial if you hop on over to Storytel.com slash IVM. Now I actually use Storytel myself regularly, so as long as they sponsor this show, I'm going to recommend one book a week that I love. My first recommendation is actually a Hindi audiobook of one of the greatest novels ever written, Raag Darbari by Srilal Shukla. Raag Darbari was written in 1968 and is a powerful satire that nails the nature of government and bureaucracy and life in India, every libertarian will love it, and is still as relevant and biting and trenchant as it was then. I first read it in its English translation, was blown away, and had always intended to read it also in Hindi. Because if the English translation is so good, how good will the Hindi be? Well, now I've heard it and it's mind-blowing. Listen to Raag Darbari on Storytel and remember, you get a 30-day free trial only at Storytel.com slash IVM. Srinath, welcome again to the scene and the unseen. Thank you. Great to be here. So Srinath, I'm going to begin by exploring an angle I sort of explored with, you know, when I did a couple of episodes on Gandhi with Ramchandra Buha, and where I asked him about the difficulty of being a historian, given that we are wired for what is called the hindsight bias, that when you look back at history, everything seems inevitable. And it struck me when I was reading your book on Bangladesh, 1971, that that's one of your starting premises for the book is that the that sense of inevitability plays out especially strongly with Bangladesh. And it wasn't at all as inevitable and you examine the various reasons why. But just as a general question, if I may pose the same question to you that I posed to Ram, how do you sort of mentally take that step back from that sense of inevitability?"

So in a sense, the challenge for the historian is how do you sort of try and find some kind of a point, which does not exclusively privilege hindsight, but hindsight is absolutely important, because that's the only way you can make sense of things together. And to have that sense of contingency, but also causality in play, is I think a bit of a balance that you strike as you go along. In a sense, there is no formula for it. It's more of a craft and how you sort of approach things, right? So this is great historian of the French Revolution, who is to say that, you know, before it happens, every revolution seems impossible. But after it happens, it seems inevitable, right? And that that's true of most great things like the Bangladesh emergence of an independent country and so on. So the challenge for me in writing this book was precisely to come to terms with that kind of a meta question of saying, how are we going to tell the story without making it all seem as if it was so predetermined, which in some ways also takes away agency from people at the end of the day, history is made by people themselves."

And I was working in the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. This was in the early 2000s. And at that point of time, the papers of P. N. Huxer, who was Indira Gandhi's principal secretary during that period, were actually sort of deposited and made available to scholars. So I was one of the first people to sort of go through them, you know, it's a very large collection. Lately, we've had Jairam Ramesh writing a biography of P. N. Huxer, which makes very good thorough use of all those sources. But I think I was one of the first people to actually see that. And it very quickly struck me that there was very interesting material on the Bangladesh crisis, which suggested very different points of view, even ab initio. And then I decided to sort of make that a project. But it also struck me that it would be useful to widen out the perspective and not just do an India-centered account of how the Indians approached the crisis, but to look at the crisis as a whole, to understand this very important historical event in post-colonial South Asia, which is the emergence of Bangladesh, and to sort of do it on a much wider canvas. So that's how the project really began. And then I started working in a range of other archives, you know, I've sort of worked in Britain, America, Canada, Australia, the Soviet Union, Germany. So all of these archives then kind of opened up a much more sort of multifaceted sort of portrait of the period and of that particular event itself."

And at least in the case of the Bangladesh crisis, I think these people were not just bit players, they were very important, you know, and someone like P.N. Huxer was literally sort of the person holding various strands of crisis management together on behalf of the Prime Minister, of course, and looking through those notes and, you know, the letters that they wrote to each other about what Mrs. Gandhi told them in certain meetings and so on was absolutely fascinating."

What I meant to say was that the study of South Asian history, as it happens in universities, as done by historians who sort of teach and research in sort of universities and so on, is still very much focused either on the colonial period or the pre-colonial past. The immediate sort of post-independence period and or the post-colonial period in South Asia as a whole still remains something that historians are reluctant to touch, partly because they see it as too close to their time, partly because the archives for the older period are much better organized, more easily, you know, if you want to work on some topic to do with British India, you can go to the British Library in London, you can look at the National Archives in India, you'd get a reasonable, whereas for the post-colonial period, especially when I was working on the book, things have changed a little bit since then. The official archives were almost, you know, had close to zero holdings. So you had to sort of go through private papers, which is what I was doing, you know, Luxor and others, and then use various other kinds of official archives from other countries. So you, in a sense, that remains a challenge. The second thing is that, you know, there is some kind of a sort of a tacit intellectual or whatever academic division of labor, which has happened, which is to say that historians typically look at everything before independence, whereas, you know, it's the political scientists or international relations scholars who look at the more immediate past. But I think, you know, that then leaves out a very large arena of our contemporary existence, which I think needs to be bought under the, you know, the domain of history proper and of historical investigation and writing. I'm happy to say that since I wrote those words, I mean, things do seem to be moving, though not as quickly as we'd like it to. But I think we definitely have a range of books now coming out, which also try and treat the sort of post-independence, post-colonial period in the same historical fashion as you would do with anything in the distant past."

And that, you know, the way that institutions, structures, and processes have evolved historically is somehow not of any moment or concern, that the only thing which matters is what is the dynamic today. And I think that that ahistorical quality is, I think, been one of the significant drawbacks of Indian political science writing. But at the same time, I think the best Indian political scientists are people who have sort of, you know, used historical knowledge and historical materials, really, to throw light on political processes in more closer periods of time."

You know, archives and sources don't tell you any stories, you have to ask questions of them, you know. And for that, you need to have some questions which come out of broader conceptual theoretical sort of basis. Now, you know, I don't go out with a view of trying to prove or disprove this or that theory. But as a heuristic device, I think social sciences are very important for the historian's craft. But of course, you know, in terms of my own choice, I still prefer the narrative, which I think is the domain in which history is best explored and written and presented.

So, you know, historical narratives, contrary to sort of what, you know, other social sciences typically tend to think are not just about telling a story, right? I mean, you're trying to make a causal argument. I think the central difference between, say, most other social sciences and histories, and I say most because there are exceptions, is that historians are interested in change, whereas other social sciences are typically interested in trying to find longer term continuities, right? So they may use historical materials, but with a view to saying so and so process or so and so pattern is recurrent, if these are the initial conditions, these are likely to be the outcomes, right? So, so that is the kind of exercise that they are engaged in. Whereas for historians, the challenge is not that we're not interested in generalization, we are. But the bigger problem that you're interested in isn't change. How does change happen? How does a country like Pakistan break up into two parts is exactly the kind of questions"

I mean, in a sense that much of the writing on the creation of Bangladesh, it tends to be either from the perspective of trying to tell the story of how Bangladeshi or Bengali nationalism sort of rose and, you know, attained its destiny as an independent nation, or it is about saying why Pakistan, as it was in 1947, kind of was an unworkable project and so on. So there is an implicit sort of teleology and determinism, which is built into most of our storylines to greater and lesser extents, but that's the standard way in which we think. And of course, in India, we have our own story of, you know, this being the most important sort of moment of India sort of, you know, falsifying the two nation theory and so on. Now, I don't for a minute say that any of these narratives are strong. What I want to say is that they are incomplete, and that if you really want a more satisfactory explanation of why this particular momentous event occurred, then you have to place it not just within a national or a regional frame, but actually in something of a global, it's an international and transnational frame."

Well, decolonization, you know, obviously, is a breakup of the old sort of European empires in the post Second World War period, India was in the first wave of decolonization. But by the late 1960s, you had several other countries across Asia and Africa, which have gone through, you know, process of decolonization, but which are also in their postcolonial existence coming up with various forms of other kinds of issues, borders, ethnicities, various kinds of rivalries left behind by older forms of colonial control, and so on. So in a sense, what is happening in Bangladesh is therefore best understood as a continuation of this larger process of decolonization, even though it is happening within the context of a country which is already, you know, out of colonial control, which is Pakistan. But nevertheless, the imperatives and the processes seem to me to be very similar to what was happening with a number of other countries, particularly in Africa at that point of time.

And the Cold War is typically understood as a sort of a geopolitical and ideological rivalry between the United States and its allies, the so-called free world, and the Soviet Union and its allies, the so-called communist bloc. But what is interesting is that by the late 1960s, you know, the Cold War no longer looks like this contest between two rigidly organized blocs. There is a lot of sort of, you know, moving and, you know, turning around of pieces within each of these blocs. And one of the big important things, of course, was the split between the Chinese and the Soviet Union, which was already coming to the fore by that time, and which plays an important role in the story of Bangladesh as well. So in a sense, it was important, therefore, to suggest that, you know, this was an important moment in the Cold War, the realignment of the sort of important pieces of the Cold War geopolitics, the waning of some of the ideological competition in the context of the Cold War, and how that impacts on an event which is not anywhere in the center of things where the Cold War was playing out, which is in South Asia."

But globalization is something that we, at least in our current context, tend to think of as something which is very much a post Cold War kind of a moment, right? I mean, you want to think about Francis Fukuyama sometime in 1989 announcing the end of history, saying that all kinds of, you know, ideological rivalries are coming out. That is the moment when Americans sort of attempt to, you know, to create an integrated capitalist global economy really takes off and so on. But one of the things which historians have been pointing to us, and I sort of picked up on that literature and built it up, was to say that, you know, what we think of as the current wave of globalization, you know, actually is something which begins in the early 70s and late 1960s, early 70s is when the first, you know, real wave of sort of globalization begins. By which I mean that there are a number of, you know, events and processes which are coming together, which are bringing disparate parts of the world in some sort of communication with one another, right? So you have the huge explosion of air travel during that period, so people are traveling to one place another, the whole story of containerization and so on, you know, already sort of starting to take off. There's a huge standardization of various kinds of, you know, economic processes, but also other kinds of things. There is a much greater spread of non-governmental organizations which are trying to bring standardization even in terms of values, right? I mean, the rise of something like human rights, for instance, happens in a much more global context in the same period. So in that sense, not just as a process of economic globalization and integration, but as one where events and processes which happen in one part of the world are quite tightly linked to what is happening elsewhere. And it seemed to me that this phenomenon is very well established already by the late 1960s. Of course, contemporary forms of globalization evolved historically from there on. But that was a very important moment when this began. And again, as I point out in the book, this had important implications for the way the"

Give me a little bit of context into what Pakistan was like in 68. Ayub Khan had already been in charge for many years.

He got a fair amount of support from the US, which is, you know, a process that started a decade earlier.

Well, 1960s are a very important and interesting decade in the history of Pakistan, which is to say that, you know, that was a decade when Pakistan registered, at least in terms of GDP growth and quite an extraordinary accomplishment of almost averaging about 6% annual GDP growth over that decade. That was possible because, you know, Ayub Khan was sort of following a set of, you know, planned economic policies, which were actually a lot of it was crafted by American economists, the Harvard Advisory Group and others who were helping him, you know, do it. And Pakistan also got onto the bandwagon of the Green Revolution even before India did. They started in the early 60s itself. So, in that sense, this was a decade when Pakistan actually witnessed considerable levels of economic growth. But that economic growth as by the end of the decade was, it was becoming was, was very, very lopsided. And some of the Harvard economists who are advising the Pakistanis themselves conceded that, in a sense, their policies were aimed towards fostering capital accumulation and investment. But the groups which are capable of doing it were very small. In fact, at one point of time, the head of the Pakistani Planning Commission said that there were just 22 families in Pakistan, which accounted for something like 85 to 90% of the country's wealth. So there was an extraordinary concentration of wealth by conscious government policy, you know, giving tax breaks, you know, basically all the things that you want to do to enable capitalist accumulation and investment was the game. And that, in the Pakistani context, got exacerbated because of the sort of geographical disparities between West Pakistan and East Pakistan. So if you can just take a step back, right, so in 1947, when Pakistan is created, you have this kind of completely geographically anomalous entity coming out, which is West Pakistan, which is today's Pakistan and, you know, East Pakistan, which is today's Bangladesh, being under sort of one particular sort of, you know, being the same country and in a similar regime. In fact, in this novel, Shame, Salman Rushdie has this fantastic line where he says that United Pakistan was a strange bird. It was two wings without a body, right? Because that body was effectively, you were separated by India. So there was this tendency to assume, therefore, that, you know, divide between these two parts is not just geographic, but, you know, there was sort of economic disparities. East Pakistan was the more sort of, you know, commodity producing area. Things like jute used to grow there, exports of those in, you know, earned dollars for the Pakistani government, but a lot of the investment and industrial development was actually happening in the West. So there was this regional disparity of economic growth as well, not just in terms of class sort of differentiation. And there were, of course, language issues, like Urdu being the official language. And that sort of language issue was in some ways the first major trigger, right? The first sort of major movement in East Pakistan actually happens over the fact that Bengali is not initially accepted as an important language of the state, which is not just a cultural issue, but it's one to do with employment and stuff. So if you want to become a Pakistani civil servant, you will have to write exams in Urdu, right?"

So, so in a sense, the fact that normal democratic pressures were not bought to bear in this period allowed this kind of, you know, disparate economic growth to happen. And the diversity between the two regions was there. So, you know, it's, it's again, what is ironic and fascinating about this period is that, you know, the period of Pakistan's sort of immense, you know, an impressive sort of economic growth in the 1960s. The economists who are there in the Pakistani Planning Commission are primarily of Bengali origin. Oh, yeah. And by the end of the decade, it is those economists who are coming up with this critique of the economic system of Pakistan as effectively a neo-colonial one. They say that East Pakistan has become a commodity producing area, like all old colonies used to be. And all the sort of, you know, stuff in terms of, you know, new industries, investment, etc. is primarily happening in the West. So and then East then becomes a importer of the commodities of the West.

But the point was to say that, you know, in the post Second World War period, the patterns of capitalist development in the Western world was such that areas like Latin America were effectively seen as commodity producing in a similar sort of a relation, right? So that's not where this thing. So there is a sort of a tendency to think that we need to have our own sort of, you know, model of economic development, which is kind of independent of this kind of thing. However, of course, many economies attempted these import substitution policies during that period. But what is interesting, of course, is that all of this happening within the context of Pakistan, right? So the whole argument of a neo-colonial sort of feeling, which Malib's quote captures, was one which was being felt by people who belong to the same state. So in that sense, it was a much more, I mean, you could have had similar policies in India, for instance, but the Indian government of the time, the Nehru government, you know, took a conscious decision to enable investment in various parts of India to precisely prevent this kind of very lopsided economic growth and development and so on, which the Pakistanis never took seriously.

But nevertheless, student groups across the world took the cues from one another, right. And it's important to remember just how widespread this was. And television came to Pakistan in 1968, so they can see everything. Right. So you had, of course, student revolts happening in the United States, which was also triggered by the civil rights, Vietnam War, and that involvement. But you had similar things happening in France, in Italy, in Germany. You also had it in the Soviet bloc, right. In the post 1968, the Czechoslovakia incident, there was, you know, all of that story. There was a student movement happening in Japan at the point of time, there was a cultural revolution in China, which was again a student sort of led thing. So what is happening across the world in some ways was, you know, ricocheting from one place to another. People were seeing that this kind of mobilization is happening. The forms of the mobilization, the vocabularies with local inflections, of course, were still quite strikingly reminiscent of one another. And what is interesting is that in Pakistan, the student revolts kind of come towards the tail end of 1968. And as you said, you know, television in Pakistan, people are seeing all of this stuff. And of course, there are sort of individuals who also sort of bring the story like, you know, the sort of famous student revolutionary of the Oxford sit-ins in the British context was Tariq Ali, who was from a very well to do Pakistani family. And as many student revolutionaries tend to be, yeah. And Tariq Ali actually comes back to Pakistan and, you know, and sees that there is this whole sort of movement against Ayub Khan's sort of authoritarian regime.

Actually speaking, for politicians of Mujibur Rahman generation, the real dream was to sort of not get an independent state, but to take control of all of Pakistan, which a democratic majority could have put them in power, right. And as we'll see, you know, even the Indians thought that that actually would not be such a bad outcome for their own sort of\u2026 That'd be a great outcome.

The six-point agenda was very much a federal plan. But in a sense, because of the radicalization of the students who then sort of energized the Awami League, took it to a very different level and Mujib was a remarkable leader in his own right.

And in that time, Bhutto very quickly insinuated himself into the picture by saying that, you know, he was not the army's favorite when this whole story began. But by the time the sort of negotiations are kind of in the middle, Bhutto is able to play spoiler by telling the army on the one hand that, listen, if you're going to do this kind of a deal and allow them to come without assurances for the West Pakistanis and so on, it's going to be a non-starter.

And from that point on, Mujib has to play a careful role, right? So, on the one hand, he has to keep the momentum and the upsurge going, because it allows him to put pressure on the West Pakistanis. But at the same time, he doesn't want to be in a position where the Pakistan army believes that the situation is getting so out of control, that the only option is to use force to sort of put them down. Right? So, he's trying to sort of balance both of these. There are other problems as well, in a sense that there are non-Bengalis in East Pakistan who are being targeted by the Bengalis, as partly because they were seen as Tujus. So there's another one more layer of ethnic complexity to this. Many of these are Urdu speaking migrants from Eastern India, like Bihar and other parts of Eastern India and so on. So, he has to keep those kinds of, you know, violence and that kind of tendencies under check. So, it's a very difficult time for him. And this is also the time when he's tentatively sending feelers to India saying, listen, you know, if the Indians were to sort of, you know, make some noises and tell the Pakistanis that, you know, we will disapprove of any use of force, etc., then, you know, maybe the Pakistanis will back off. So, and then he's trying to tell similar things to the Americans. So, Mujib is trying pretty much everything, trick in the book to make sure that he can come out of the situation, either, you know, with a sort of mandate to form government or at least some kind of a power sharing arrangement without tipping over into violence. And that is what is his thing. But the Pakistanis are very clear that, at least from about the first week of March onwards, that talks are simply a fig leaf behind which, a smoke screen behind which they will carry on the military buildup. There was not that much of Pakistani military presence in what later became Bangladesh. They had to sort of do a buildup. That buildup was also kind of a little difficult for them to do because India and Pakistan, because their own sort of problems, Indians had shut off their airspace to Pakistani. So the Pakistanis had to do that buildup by going through Sri Lanka, you know, so Colombo was a transit point between the two wings. So, all of that took a little bit of time.

So the Indian government is obviously tracking the situation very closely, particularly after the election results come out, because they know that the outcome of the elections is something that the Pakistani West Pakistani political establishment and the Pakistan army certainly are going to be extremely unhappy with. And they know that there is a possibility of some kind of a sort of, you know, a breakdown of talks entirely. So that that is very much in the realm of possibility. But at least broadly speaking, within the government of India, there are kind of differing views, right? So on the one hand, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Pakistan High Commissioner, their view is that in some ways, actually speaking, Mujib and the Pakistan army will make a deal. And that's not such a bad thing for us at all, because it's better for us to have a Bengali Awami-like sort of prime minister in position than having military rule in Pakistan. Their stances on a range of issues, which sort of were of most concern to India, like Kashmir, etc, were seen as much more sort of moderate and acceptable. But then, you know, the Indian intelligence agencies, particularly the newly created research and analysis wing, the R&DW, which was headed by a man called Arun Kaur, who was a sort of first, you know, person, you know, and the intelligence agencies, however, felt that the possibility of a total breakdown and some kind of a resort to armed struggle by the Bengali people and the Awami League's base was not something to be discounted. So there were these kind of two contending views. The other thing the Indians are concerned is that, you know, maybe in order to divert attention from what is happening in East Pakistan, Yahya Khan might take some kind of military action in the West, just as a sort of a diversionary thing, and so on, right? I mean, so there are all these kinds of things happening. Now, around the 2nd of March or so, just when the talks are kind of, it's looking like these things are not going anywhere, the Indians get a couple of feelers from Mujibur Rahman asking them to, you know, make some sort of military mobilization, etc, in order to put the fear into the Pakistani minds and then prevent them from sort of deploying troops into Pakistan and so on. And Mujib even meets the Indian Deputy High Commissioner in Dhaka to convey the point. But the Indians are still very unsure about what exactly Mujibur Rahman's sort of thinking on these issues is. Now, again, it's important to remind ourselves that from the perspective of Indian decision makers at that time, Mujibur Rahman was a Pakistani politician. You know, in a sense, obviously, they knew him and had some contacts with him. But ever since Mujib had sort of gotten embroiled in this thing called the Agartala conspiracy case, you know, where he was alleged to have sort of, you know, waged a conspiracy to sort of, you know, break up Pakistan, etc, the Indians have been quite wary of being openly sort of in contact with him and so on. So there is a period when Mujibur Rahman actually attempts to reach out, but the Indian political reaction is a little confused. And again, the Indians are reading this development towards the last week before the crackdown as the situation is actually improving, right? That's everyone, including the army leaders thought things were kind of getting better. So as with any such situation, you know, you have sort of conflicting assessments of what is likely to happen. So in a sense, the Indians were also a little sort of surprised when the crackdown actually took place. So it was not something that they were absolutely sure was what the next step was going to be."

So there was this concern that, you know, student and Naxal radicals in Indian part of Bengal might team up with those on the other side and so on. But I think more fundamentally, you know, at that point of time, it is still too premature to think of an independent Bangladesh. And again, that's where, you know, we have to allow for the distancing from the hindsight. You know, what looks like obviously the right solution to us was not at all something which was easily conceivable. You're talking of breaking up another country and, you know, and that meant that, you know, the movement on the ground had to have the force. I mean, the Indians always, you know, they had to assess first whether the Awami League was serious. What was its leadership in the absence of Mujibur Rahman? How much could you sort of trust the others to sort of carry on the struggle? Did they have the moral and physical sort of, you know, reserves to be able to go on even if India provided material support, right? So all of these issues were still to be debated, thought. So you know, assuming that the choices only between either acquiescing in a Pakistani crackdown or plumping for independence of Bangladesh, I think is a very dichotomous choice which just was not in people's minds at that point of time."

So that's that then becomes the nucleus of what would later become the main fighting force that you would use. So and then, you know, many of them wanted sort of various kinds of assistance in order to come together. There are senior army leaders, apart from Ujjain Bur Rahman, were trickling into India from various parts. So in a sense, not responding to any of that was also not an option. But at the same time, I think the initial Indian feeling was very much that, you know, you just, yes, you sort of bring them in, you sort of create some kind of structures to, you know, accommodate them in camps and various kinds of things. But that will also then allow you to keep a lid on what is happening, right? It's not necessarily the case that you're already thinking of them as being, in fact, you know, the decision to sort of really scale up support to the, you know, the army and the Bengali fighters doesn't happen until later in the summer of 1971. In fact, some of the notes which are made by the R&DW, because they were the ones who were directly dealing with many of these people, suggest a great degree of unhappiness with India in the early months, you know, especially in May, June, July, saying Indians are not giving us enough ammunition, they have rationed us to five rounds a day and so on. All of that was, you know, partly because of material constraints on the part of India, but also partly because you did not really think that, you know, you wanted to sort of scale up support in that way. It's only in those months that the idea really begins that, yes, we have to sort of systematically start doing these, you establish training camps. So everything happens somewhat gradually. And Mrs. Gandhi and PN Huxar and others are genuinely quite cautious about what should be done, right? In fact, there is another sort of folklore around this is this claim by General Maniksha, you know, well after Mrs. Gandhi's death, you know, he's said in public quite a few times that Mrs. Gandhi actually called him to a cabinet meeting and said that, listen, why can't the army go into Bangladesh now? He says it's in May 1971. And then he said that, no, no, no, we have to wait, the army has to be prepared, the monsoons have to get over, then we will sort of go in. So, you know, and then she agreed, but, you know, that's a piece of myth making, which I think does very little credit to any of the people involved."

But at this point of time, I think, you know, this point is worth making because this is the most commonly held notion in India that Indira Gandhi actually sort of wanted to, you know, or would have asked Maniksha to sort of do this, but actually it's untrue. In fact, right from the very beginning, from the day the crackdown begins, the thinking of Mrs. Gandhi is shaped quite decisively by P. N. Aksar, who's our closest advisor on these matters, and who's a very experienced diplomat, and who makes it quite clear to her that, you know, we should not be seen as overtly sort of intervening in the affairs of Pakistan, and that if anything, we have to create the ground for the movement to become stronger and for India to then act decisively if necessary. And the position that we should take is that the influx of all of these refugees into India, the number becomes something like close to 10 million by the end of the summer, is an unacceptable situation for a country like ours, and conditions have to be created in Bangladesh where those people go back. And in fact, what is also clear from the documents that are now available is that Mrs. Gandhi, even before that putative meeting with the army chief, actually calls her, you know, the leaders of the opposition and briefs them saying that, please do not make this an issue. This is something that is best sort of, you know, you should trust us, we will keep you informed and, you know, leaders like Adil B. Haribachpai sort of actually go along at that point of time. But it is also true that there were sections within the Congress party, including her own cabinet, people who believe that the, you know, the anger amongst Indian people on this was such that, you know, you had to do something and, you know, this is a moment to act and so on. And it's in that context that Mrs. Gandhi actually calls in Maniksha for the meeting, primarily to let her colleagues hear from the army chief what is it that he thinks is the military assessment. So I don't think it's at all true that Mrs. Gandhi wanted a precipitated invasion and that she was persuaded otherwise by Maniksha."

But gradually, as the numbers grew to 5 million, and then to alarmingly to 8 million, and beyond, as you point out, where the sheer number of refugees, number one became a logistical impossibility and a huge fiscal burden on India. But also it was now 80% Hindu 20% Muslim, which therefore indicated that those Hindus were fleeing in large numbers, because there was a genocide underway, and that the human rights violations, which people sort of had a sense of were far graver than people had suspected. And in a sense, the combination of the fiscal burden of taking care of all these refugees forced Indira Gandhi into a stand where she had to insist that number one, the refugees have to go back, but number two, because there's a genocide underway till you find a political solution within Pakistan, you can't possibly go back, send them back. And a lot of the other nations of the world, which we will come to, but in the foreign, in the international arena, refused to accept that these two could be tied together.

But for the Indians, the key thing was to try and keep these people under reasonably sort of controlled conditions, so that you would ensure their eventual repatriation back to Bangladesh. So, that angle of it, the line that, you know, conditions have to be created such that people can go back was a very carefully chosen one, because the only imperative way that people have to go back. What those conditions would be was left for Pakistan and the international community and everyone else to sort of help arrive at, right? If Pakistanis sort of chose to come to some kind of a modest way and die with Mujib and, you know, came with some solution, and the refugees could go back, maybe the Indians would have been fine. If not, they would go back to an independent country, right? I mean, but that transition had to happen over a period of time. So, that was one major consideration, right, which is that just the sheer number of sort of people. The second thing is about this, you know, the number of sort of Hindu refugees which came in, which again is a number which the Indian government never ever during that crisis revealed that there were so many Hindus, partly because they believed that if this was revealed, it would lead to a backlash against Muslims in India. And again, we had seen that dynamic in older migrations, you know, 1950, there was a crisis between East Pakistan and West Bengal, you know, and then so on. So, she was very keen not to allow those kinds of things to happen.

I mean, so, in that sense, you know, you were concerned about what would be the aftermath of this kind of refugee flows and so on. So, there was this range of considerations for which, you know, by the summer of 1971, the Indian government comes to this conclusion that the best way is to mount a big international diplomatic campaign to get the big powers to put pressure on Pakistan to create conditions under which this would happen. And the Indians were very careful never to specify what is it that they wanted. Because again, you know, you didn't want to be seen as interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs. But gradually by that summer, the opinion is shifting to saying that in the face of continued Pakistani reluctance and intransigence and refusal to either stop military operations or to move towards a political settlement, the possibility of a united Pakistan sticking"

So once the Korean War begins, the Americans are very concerned that the Soviet Union and the communist bloc will sort of potentially carry out a similar kind of a strike in the Persian Gulf, and, you know, in order to prevent that they needed allies who would sort of line up against the Soviet Union and so on. That then leads to the search for various kinds of allies and Pakistan is identified as a significant other country alongside Turkey and Iran, which would form the sort of northern tier against the Soviet Union. And then the US Pakistan alliance is consummated in 1954. But of course, the Americans very quickly start having second thoughts because they realize that the Pakistanis are not in a position really to deliver on much of the story. And so there is a tilt towards sort of, you know, redressing the balance vis-a-vis India and Pakistan under John F. Kennedy initially. And by the time the sort of Lyndon Johnson comes to power and you have around 1965 when India and Pakistan are at war. So Johnson is kind of fed up of, you know, United States having to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and this and that. And he basically takes a sort of a plague on both the houses kind of attitude and in the 1965 war, the United States imposes an arms embargo on both India and Pakistan. And of course, Pakistanis because they have more American kit are, you know, feel the pinch stronger. But after that, the United States kind of, you know, is more deeply involved in Vietnam. There are these growing domestic sort of protests, you know, Johnson is kind of bogged down. But when Richard Nixon comes to power, he is very keen to revive and resuscitate the relationship with Pakistan. Now let's remember, recall that Nixon was vice president under, you know, President Eisenhower when the US Pakistan military alliance was signed. So he was one of the original votaries of the relationship with Pakistan. And he always believed, like many Americans share this common prejudice that Indians are this weak effect, you know, useless, unreliable kind of people."

So, so there is, there is cultural condescension for the Indians, which as we spoke in the last sort of podcast has a long history going back to sort of, you know, American impressions of India in the 19th century. And there is this extraordinary sort of gendered kind of approach towards dealing with someone like Indira Gandhi, who they believe is, you know, can sort of be taken care of and such like things. So the Americans, when they come, when Nixon and Kissinger, you know, start formulating this policy, so they want to sort of, first of all, rebalance towards Pakistan again. Then they want to reach out to the Chinese and they decide that Pakistan can be one of the two main conduits through which that will done. And eventually that Pakistan channel becomes more important one. And in that context, you know, they decide pretty much not to do. And Nixon and Kissinger have this kind of totally insouciant attitude towards the whole human rights question. You know, both of them see themselves as very tough minded, realist kind of people that, you know, at one point they say, listen, the British ruled this country of 300 million people with, you know, just about 100,000 sort of white people out there. You know, the Pakistanis can sort out the Bengalis and so on. So there is a clear underestimation of the forces of nationalism and what the sort of political sort of situation there was. And of course, you know, despite being alerted to the scale of the genocidal violence, which was taking place in Bangladesh, particularly by the sort of American deputy sort of, you know, head of mission in Dhaka, a man called Archer Blood, who sends these telegrams, you know, which have been covered very extensively in another very fine book by Gary Bass, which I'd again recommend to all our sort of listeners to definitely read because it covers the American sort of thing in very great detail, you know, but those telegrams don't even sort of make a dent in terms of American policy. In fact, you know, blood is kind of censured and pulled out of Dhaka and then cast into sort of oblivion. So that is the sort of line that the Americans take. Political imperatives of reaching out to China trump the realities of this India-Pakistan dynamic. But, and of course, the human rights and, you know, the extraordinary sort of gross violations of that in terms of murder of people, which is happening in Bangladesh. And the only thing Americans are keen, however, from the very beginning is to make sure that India does not attack Pakistan, because obviously they don't want their ally to be in trouble. But at the same time, particularly after the sort of Kissinger comes to India in July 1971, you know, has discussions with Indians and goes to Pakistan and famously feigns a Delhi belly and, you know, takes the secret plane out to China. And once he comes back, he basically tells the sort of Indians that, listen, you know, we have this kind of, you know, informal sort of understanding going back to the 1962 war that if there is something, you know, serious by China, you know, in terms of an attack on India, the United States would sort of stand by India. But if the Chinese intervene in an India-Pakistan war, then you cannot count on us to sort of going through with that understanding. And the Indians naturally see that as an attempt to tighten the screws on them, which is part of Kissinger's sort of objective, very much so. But the other thing which Kissinger is trying to do and the Nixon administration trying to do is that they are trying to signal to the Chinese that, listen, we will stand by our allies come what may, because at the end of the day, they are trying to establish a new relationship with China, and they want to establish their sort of credibility as a dependable sort of partner, or let alone an ally. And then they feel that if they sort of let down Yaya Khan at the moment of this crisis, the Chinese will say that, listen, who the hell is going to antagonize the Soviet Union, depending on the Americans, right? I mean, we might as well look after our own. So that whole thing will come through. So for a series of geopolitical imperatives, the Nixon administration effectively turns"

So there are a range of factors which historians have studied, you know, there is ideology, there's various kinds of, you know, conflicts of interest, and so on. There's a sort of personality clash between Mao Zedong and the Chinese leadership, and the Russian leadership, and so on. But by 1969, that relationship and that hostility is actually militarized. They have a disputed border along the Ussuri River, in which Chinese forces actually launch an unprovoked attack on the Soviets, and then that leads to a clash. And thereafter, Mao Zedong sort of panics and says that, you know, we've got to sort of go into national mobilization mode, because there's going to be a surprise attack by the Soviets, and so on. So in fact, after the 1969 sort of clash, Sino-Soviet clash, it is the Chinese also who look to the sort of, you know, finding some kind of relationship with the United States, which will allow them to balance. As far as the United States is concerned, and Nixon and Kissinger are concerned, their primary consideration, of course, is one to sort of have a triangular relationship between China, United States, and the Soviet Union. So you bring the Soviet Union to balance. But the larger sort of objective is to make sure that both these sets of somewhat independent relationships will allow them to extricate without loss of face from Vietnam. Because both the Soviets and the Chinese are on their own steam supporting the North Vietnamese. So they believe that if the Soviets and the Chinese put pressure on the North Vietnamese, that will allow for some kind of a face saving negotiated solution to come up and the Americans can pull out.

But again, what that standing by meant is something that I think we need to unpack a little bit. And again, you know, it's worth going back a little bit in history to understand how Soviet relationship with India and Pakistan evolves during this period of time, right? In the early years, neither India nor Pakistan has any particular relationship with the Soviet Union. You know, in fact, the first Indian ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mithila Lakshmi Pandit, who was Arlal Nehru's own sister, couldn't even secure a meeting with Joseph Stalin. In fact, in the first Indian ambassador to have an audience with Stalin was Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, who was our second ambassador. And it's only after Stalin's death and the advent of Nikita Khrushchev and the change in policy towards non-socialist third world countries that India-Soviet relations starts evolving. This would be around 1953. 1954-55 is when Khrushchev consolidates at home. Then he sort of has this policy of, you know, rejigging, moving away from a hard line kind of saying we'll only support communist countries to look at other non-aligned countries like India and so on. So, Pakistan, because of its alliance with the Soviet Union at that point of time is seen as very much in the US camp. So, the Pakistanis, interestingly enough, always try to sort of also maintain a link with the Soviet Union. In fact, Ayub Khan, you know, in the post sort of 1962 phase, when US-India relations actually start improving because of the China factor, also makes an attempt to sort of improve relations with the Soviet Union. And that actually has some payoffs because in 1965, when India and Pakistan are at war and the Johnson administration decides that the hell with these guys, you know, we are not sort of going to get into it. It is actually the Soviet Union which steps into the position of the mediator between the two sides. The post-war conference is held in Tashkent. It is sort of done and it's a Soviet Union which actually prevails upon Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri to return those parts of Pakistani territory, which were Azad Kashmir territory, which were captured by the Indian Army at that point of time, including places like the Hajibir Pass, about which there is endless sort of, you know, lamenting going on even nowadays on social media saying, if only we had Hajibir Pass, we could have sort of given a bloody nose to the terrorists and so on.

It is in that context that the Soviets first propose a draft of a treaty of friendship, you know, which is there. And actually, some negotiations happened in 1969.

Now, it is very interesting when Indira Gandhi goes to Moscow, you know, the Soviet General Secretary who's sort of, you know, there's a troika, there is General Secretary Brezhnev, there is Podgorny, and there is Alexei Kasygin, who's the premier. So at that point of time, Brezhnev, who's the sort of, by all accounts, the most important figure of the troika, is actually not in Moscow. And she is surprised and went to learn that she will not be able to meet Gromyko. And she takes a decision that she will not leave Moscow without having met Brezhnev. And so finally, she actually decides to spend that evening hosting a reception by the Indian sort of embassy in Moscow, meeting friends and so on, and waits for another day, postpones her trip in order to meet Brezhnev. And in that meeting with Brezhnev, which goes on for almost five hours, is when, you know, they lay the full background of the Bangladesh movement, convince the Russians that there is enough political steam behind this, and that, you know, the emergence of this independent country is now a foregone conclusion in some ways, and that, you know, the right policy for India is only to sort of assist its emergence.

But in as much as, you know, the war sort of came at a moment when public opinion was already quite mobilized around issues like Vietnam. These things were not negligible. I mean, you know, something like the concert for Bangladesh was kind of, was an important moment of creating awareness amongst us. I mean, you know, when you have someone like the great beat poet Allen Ginsberg, writing a poem about on the road to Jaisalmer in the New York Times, and the poem being produced in its entirety, it has a certain kind of a cultural impact, which I think is important for us to recover.

Well, I don't think there's a tape of that, but you can listen to a lot of things that Nixon had to say, not just about Mrs. Gandhi, but about the Indians subsequently. His motivation at that point of time is to tell India and Mrs. Gandhi in no uncertain terms that an attack on Pakistan would be the worst thing that they could do.

And the broad plan, even by the time the war begins, is that the Indian army should sort of enter East Pakistan from 3 different directions, because we have landlocked in that way. And you would capture enough territory in which to sort of put the provisional government of Bangladesh and then declare war, just to sort of go back a little bit, you know. So in April 1971, when the Awami League politicians come to India and a significant number of them are there, they come up with this idea of establishing a provisional independent government of Bangladesh and seek India's recognition of it. And the Indian government actually sort of is reluctant to give that recognition, because under international law, a government can be recognized as sovereign only if it controls significant amounts of territory. And at that point of time, they don't have any territory. They are effectively operating out of the R&DW's office in Calcutta, though the headquarters is supposed to be in this place called Mujib Nagar inside East Pakistan. And in fact, those of your listeners who are sort of interested can go on YouTube and check out this very nice video of the formation of the provisional government of Bangladesh. You know, there's a ceremony which happens actually inside East Pakistan. But you know, that ceremony is entirely facilitated by the Indians. It's the BSF which clears the road to allow everyone to have. Send me the link. I'll put it in the episode page. Yeah, it's a very interesting sort of episode. And so the provisional government therefore exists, but Indians have not formally recognized it. So the plan is that you sort of capture enough territory so that you can recognize the provisional government and then sort of create conditions where the people can eventually go back and so on. Right. And that's really the hope. The provisional government is recognized on the 6th of December 1971 once the war gets underway. Because they've taken some territory. They've captured territory and they're sort of moving with the Indian troops and so on. So all of that has happened. But nowhere does the Indian sort of military plan mention the capture of Dhaka as a particular objective of the plans. The plans are still about saying that you want to do it. And this is partly because of the experience of the 1965 war and other things. Indians know that the international community will intervene. There is likely to be some kind of a UN Security Council push to sort of calling for a ceasefire. So the important thing is to have enough territory quickly to sort of recognize this. Once that is done, that's a fait accompli. Then you know, other things will fall into place and so on. So there is no really no plan to capture Dhaka per se.

So the Nixon administration starts putting a lot of pressure on the Soviet Union, saying that India is effectively your client state and you guys have egged on the Indians.

So by the time the war breaks out, the Chinese are quite clear that, you know, the situation on the ground is such that the Pakistanis cannot hold their own, you know. So they say that, you know, better to sort of take a realistic view."

Pakistan was a very important sort of state and a friend of theirs. But when things kind of reached the point where the war began, I think they sort of reconciled themselves to what would be the inevitable realities. Of course, they were unhappy with the fact that India would sort of emerge in such a strong position and so on. But they managed to sort of, you know, keep their own. So this is the sort of broader geopolitics and the American maneuvering. And then, of course, the United States decides as a last measure to send the sort of, you know, the Seventh Fleet into the Bay of Bengal, which, you know, is a sort of a straightforward threat at Indian sort of forces. And the Indians also kind of panic and, you know, their assessments suggest that the Americans might actually be landing of Adalino Marines somewhere in East Pakistan to evacuate, you know, senior Pakistani officials or American citizens and so on. So there is a concern that the American intervention is going to be much more direct. The Soviets send a submarine to tail the Americans of the Seventh Fleet. So you know, there is this entire story going on. But the paradoxical outcome of all of this is that India, which until that point of time is kind of broadly still thinking in terms of, you know, maximum capture of territory, consolidating position and so on, then feels that now there is a need to really sort of reach this to a sort of a finality, which they had not envisioned before. And the Pakistan and because the Indian forces had sort of made significant gains by bypassing Pakistani positions and sort of converging in the interior of the country, they now decide to make a quick dash for Dhaka and to force the surrender of Dhaka. And that then, you know, was an outcome which was not foreseen at that point of time. And as you mentioned up front, you know, as late as 12th of December, General Maneksha actually was giving orders that, listen, maybe we should go back to some of the towns we bypassed and hold them because there's going to be a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire at some point. So we need to sort of have the territory. But you know, there are others in the army headquarters and people like General Jacob, who was the chief of staff of the Eastern Command, which was the operational command dealing with this, who believed that actually, no, this was a moment when they could actually force not just a quick move into Dhaka, but also a surrender by the Pakistanis at Dhaka."

Well, I mean, in a sense, once it came to it, I think, you know, obviously the scale of the victory then is changed, right? I mean, that's when, you know, outcomes also then, you know, seem inevitable. Yeah, then you see that, listen, I mean, this is just the most extraordinary thing which happened. And in fact, even there, there was one last sort of, you know, slip between the cup and the lip, so to speak, you know, probably, which was that as the Indians were making this drive towards Dhaka in the last 48 hours of the war, there is a resolution introduced in the UN Security Council calling for an immediate halt to hostilities and a withdrawal of all armed forces from Bangladesh. Now, that would have effectively meant, if that resolution had passed, that the fighting forces would have had to stop wherever they were. Some kind of a ceasefire, you know, would have been imposed between the two sides, policed by some UN personnel. And both Indian and Pakistani troops would have had to withdraw, right? And this was still a possibility at this moment. And why was it a possibility? It was because this resolution was actually introduced by Poland. Okay. Now, you know, nobody in their right mind, particularly Indian diplomats, believed that it was a resolution which was introduced by Poland. It was actually a resolution supported by the Soviet Union, right? Which again tells you that, you know, at this point of time, the Soviets had, were in no mood to veto a third resolution.

Why Bhutto sort of decided to sort of, you know, more or less walk away from the UN and not allow the resolution to sort of be passed or even be debated in a serious way. And the best answer it seems to me is that Bhutto knew that the Pakistan army was at the brink of an extraordinary defeat. And he knew that power would then pass to him in West Pakistan and it would pass to him under conditions of when the army was totally humiliated, which was in some ways the best political outcome for him on which to begin constructing a new."

        "message": "What happens? So yeah, so in terms of India-Bangladesh relations, what happens is that basically Mudibur Rahman comes back in January 1972 to independent Bangladesh, you know, becomes the leader. There's a new constitution of Bangladesh, which is written in the year 1972, drafted by a group of young lawyers, including a man called Kamal Hussain, who has been news lately in Bangladesh for having been the figurehead of the opposition against Sheikh Hasina in the last elections which happened. So Kamal Hussain was a, I think, a 35-year-old lawyer at that point of time and wrote this, what was for its time a pretty extraordinarily progressive constitution. You know, it is actually even the Indian constitution did not have the word secular in its preamble at that point of time. The Bangladeshi constitution had it and they were determined to create a progressive state, you know, within the parameters of that time. So it was a constitution of some vision and some ambition for a new state. But of course the reality was that, you know, Bangladesh had a series of problems. First of all, it was not getting international recognition till 1974. Basically the Pakistanis got the Chinese to veto Bangladesh's entry twice into the UN. Without having that kind of recognition, Bangladesh could not access international aid in any significant way. The only countries which were giving aid to it were India and the Soviet Union. And then eventually that led the Bangladeshis to sort of given, you know, Mujibur Rahman gave an olive branch to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, attended a meeting of the OIC, the Organization of Islamic Countries in Pakistan in 1974. That was seen as a moment of post-war rapprochement between the two of them. And you know, then of course the following year Mujibur himself was overthrown in a military coup and assassinated in Bangladesh. And then of course, you know, that history of that country takes a very different turn from that point onwards. So, in a sense, all the sort of pro-India forces are kind of marginalized for a long period of time and that has its own dynamic within Bangladesh. The India-Pakistan relationship, of course, is kind of interesting because that's when you have the post-war conference, which results in something called the Simla Agreement, which is again in popular Indian consciousness and other, you know, area of almost incessant heartburn about why we did not impose a solution on Kashmir at the time when we had the upper hand and so on. And I think the answer to that is what the record suggests is actually quite straightforward. The assumption is that we had these 93,000 prisoners of war and that we could have used that to get the Pakistanis to sign on to whatever it is that we wanted them to sign on to. But the reality was that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was very clear that even if India took all of those 93,000 prisoners of war and kept them in India forever, he would not sort of survive the signing of an agreement on Kashmir in that sense. Politically. Politically. And I think the Indians understood that dynamic and they felt that, you know, it was better to invest in a politician like Bhutto and not to impose a solution. You know, P.N. Haqsir used to say that, he used to constantly say, and even in his written notes, talk about the treaty of Assay. He used to say that we can impose a punitive treaty on Pakistan today, but a democratic politician will not survive it, and whenever you have another group of revanchists coming into power, this treaty will be overthrown by the force of events. Much like Germany between World War I and II. So his whole entire framework was to say that this is not going to be a workable solution, which I think was the right judgment at that point."

        "message": "Yeah, everyone. And, you know, in retrospect, in India, we can keep sort of, you know, beating our breasts about why this happened or not happened. The second dynamic of it, which I think in India, we still do not understand, is the role played by Soviet Union in the post-war position. The first country that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto visits in January 1972 is the Soviet Union, because he knows that that's a country which holds the key to the peace solution. And it's the Soviets who tell the Indians that India has to give up territory, which is sort of done that, and will have to sort of repatriate prisoners of war. Let's also remember, under international law, holding on to prisoners of war after this thing is illegal. In a sense, it was an embarrassment for us to be holding on to them. The only reason we held on to them, actually speaking, was because we were technically not the people who are holding the prisoners of war, even though they were physically in our custody. We were holding them on behalf of the government of Bangladesh. And Mujibur Rahman was very keen that India should not repatriate these prisoners. Till such time, the Pakistanis agreed to try about 180 Pakistani officers whom they had identified as war criminals. So he wanted to have a war crimes trial. There was a legislation which was passed in Bangladesh at that point of time to do that. But ultimately, in order to strike this deal with Pakistan and get international recognition, UN admission, etc., Mujib reluctantly allowed to let go of that war crimes trial. And subsequently, that paved the way for repatriation of prisoners of war. So it was a complex situation. I think the scale of India's victory once again blinds us to what the political realities of the time, which was that, you know, the Indians strongly felt and quite rightly that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto would not survive a day in office if he managed to sort of, you know, sign some agreement which legitimized either the status quo in Kashmir or something else. Or that the Soviet Union, which was your only key partner at that point of time, would acquiesce in some such arrangement. Nobody was willing to do it. So in that sense, I think the similar agreement basically worked on the premise that you would, you know, have the border between India and Pakistan will become the line of control, the ceasefire line. And that over a period of time, the ceasefire line would come to acquire the characteristics of an international border. In a sense, it would kind of become a de facto border, which in effect is what is the situation even today."

I mean, just to give you one example, it's in the period after the 1971 war that Pakistan, first under Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, subsequent to Zia ul Haq, actually starts identifying itself a lot more with the sort of, you know, the, the, you know, Islamic autocracies of the Middle East. In fact, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto says very clearly that, you know, we do not want to be seen as a South Asian country anymore. Our natural inclination is towards our friends in West Asia. That's when the relationship between Saudi and Pakistan and, you know, we've had Mohammed bin Salman coming recently and saying all those things.

The second, I think, important and in some ways very long lasting consequence of the sort of 1971 war is a nuclearization of the Indian subcontinent, right? I mean, the Indian decision to sort of ultimately, you know, proceed its nuclear program to the point where it can start being tested happens in the aftermath of 1971 against the backdrop of the Americans having sent a nuclear armed aircraft carrier into the Bay of Bengal. So Indians want to be sure that we cannot be sort of, you know, put into that position of blackmail ever again. And even before the Indians do it, and already in early 1972, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto gets together with the few nuclear scientists that Pakistan has and says that, come what may, Pakistan has to build nuclear weapons. You know, it's in that context that, you know, he says the famous thing about eating grass and all that stuff. So there is that dimension, which is again a reality of the subcontinent as we live with. And the third thing, I think, you know, in a way that is kind of, you know, significant and, you know, really sort of, you know, has had a long lasting impact on the subcontinent is Pakistan's desire to get even with India for 1971, you know, which is still given a sort of as an ideological justification for its support of terrorism in the subcontinent, you know, every sort of loss of innocent life is justified as a sort of some kind of a payback for 1971. But the reality is that for a lot of people, you know, that was a formative moment, you know, particularly for officers in the Pakistan army, you know, I remember, you know, I think it's in Parvez Musharraf's autobiography, he says that he was a young officer when he heard of the Pakistan army surrender.

These wider geopolitical factors and the way that they shape outcomes and events in subcontinent are always worth bearing in mind. And what is also more important than it was even in the context of 1971 is that the subcontinent, particularly India today is sort of, you know, connected to the rest of the world in a much more deeper way, right? And those kinds of issues will also bring their own sort of considerations and pressures to bear on anything. So the only thing I will say is that, you know, perhaps the most important thing is to understand that, you know, the subcontinent is not some kind of island unto itself, right? I mean, you know, what happens here, the politics, the dynamics of India, Pakistan, or even other kinds of regional crises are invariably going to shape by sort of the wider global context.
