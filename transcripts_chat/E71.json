Did you know that there wasn't one gas tragedy in Bhopal but three? One of them was seen but two were unseen. Did you know that many well-intentioned government policies hurt the people? They're supposed to help Why was demonetization a bad idea? How should GST have been implemented? Why are all our politicians so corrupt when not all of them are bad people? I'm Amit Verma and in my weekly podcast the seen and the unseen I take a shot at answering all these questions and many more I aim to go beyond the scene and show you the unseen effects of public policy and private action I speak to experts on economics political philosophy cognitive neuroscience and constitutional law So that the insights can blow not only my mind, but also yours the seen and the unseen releases every Monday So do check out the archives and follow the show at seen unseen.in You can also subscribe to the seen and the unseen on whatever podcast app you happen to prefer Most of us are very impressed by numbers show me a chart and I'll think hey that looks authoritative This person knows what she is talking about in most cases You can say any nonsense you want and put some numbers besides it and boom the common person someone like me who doesn't have a degree in statistics all the time to do his own research will swallow whatever you're saying and Sometimes it seems that you can actually prove anything with numbers That's where the old saying comes from if you torture the data hard enough it will confess to anything But numbers do matter it is true that lies can be cloaked in fancy figures But they can also be unmasked using numbers correctly and in a democracy It's a vital task of the citizen to question all the data that a government presents question everything"

Also, I don't think it's fair to sort of analyze the economy on one parameter. I mean, you obviously have to look at different things and how the economy is doing on those different things. But as you rightly said, it's like, you know, one of my editors used to say, you think of the headline first. So, before you sort of write a piece in journalism, this is standard operating procedure because, you know, you have 600, 700 words to express yourself. So, before you write, you have to think of the headline first. So, when you're thinking of the headline first, you're already deciding on the slant that you want to take. And when you've already decided on the slant that you want to take, you go looking for data that justifies that slant."

Now, the moment you need a headline, you have to take a slant. You cannot be like, the economy is doing well, but it is also not doing well. That doesn't work, right?

And a lot of your recent ones have examined the government's claims, where the government has claimed XYZ using a certain amount of data. And you've shown why that is cherry picking of data, or in some cases, it's the wrong data entirely. And you sort of, you know, deconstructed that. Let's start by talking about what I would, you know, both of us did an episode on and we agree is the most burning issue of our times, which is a jobs crisis. The government has recently on multiple occasions, in fact, recently come out and said that, hey, jobs numbers are good. People say that there are, you know, India's producing 12 million jobs a year. And where are the new jobs being like 12 million people are coming into the workforce every year, where are the new jobs and blah, blah, blah. And the government is handled that by on the one hand, Arvind Panagaria, ex head of Niti Aayog saying that that number is false is seven and a half million. And on the other hand, Rajiv Kumar saying that, who's in a current head of the Niti Aayog saying that, hey, we are producing all these jobs.

        "message": "Which is a badge of honor we should wear with pride. Actually, you know, you have all these people say, saying on Twitter followed by the Prime Minister. We should say blocked by Arvind Panagaria. So anyway, so he had this piece in the Times of India on the edit page of Times of India, where he challenged this data point of 1 million Indians entering the workforce every year. Now, first, it is important every month, okay, not every year, so which means 12 million a year. So first, it is important to understand where this data has come from. So this data is largely, you know, it was there in the 12th five-year plan. For one, there are other researchers who have come up with similar data. It was also a part of this document called some inputs into the draft educational policy or something like that. So there are multiple occasions on which various government documents at various points of time, you know, have said that around a million Indians are entering the workforce every year, every month, sorry. So Mr. Panagaria essentially challenged it by using projections from a report published by the National Population Commission. Now, as per this report, in 2016, the number of Indians over the age of 15 or more was essentially equal to 929 million. In 2021, the estimate suggests the number of Indians of 15 years or more would be 1003 million. So which essentially means that between the period 2026 and 2021, around 74 million people have crossed the age of 15. So the moment you cross the age of 15, you become a part of, you can become a part of the workforce. So if five or a period of five years, 74 million people have been added, one year average would be 15 million, right? Now, not all of these 15 million are looking for a job, because some of them sort of continue to study. In case of women, many of them are married off and, you know, are not allowed to work. So, if you adjust for that, I mean, you adjust for that using something known as the labor force participation rate. And there are two methods to calculate that. And so the labor force participation rate is around, you know, as per one method, it's 50%, as per another method, it's 52.4%. So if you use these two data points, you essentially come to the conclusion that around anywhere between 7.5 to 7.8 million Indians enter the workforce every year. And this is much lower than the 12 million number, which has been bandied around for a long time. Now, the problem was, I mean, it sounds very, you know, logical. The problem was that Mr. Panagariya was using a projection, which was made in 2006. Oops. So, in 2018. Now, that would have been okay, if between 2006 and 2018, no other projections would have been made. But I sort of, you know, got curious, because it's a funny thing that I was in Noida that day. And it was late in the night. And I got very curious as to, you know, why would anyone in 2018, choose a data point from 2006. So I went looking and I found a more recent projection in a report called Youth in India, which was published in 2017 by the Central Statistics Office, which is as kosher as it can get. Right. And so they had basically, as per their projections, and I'm just reading that out. So in 2011, the number of Indians who were 15 years or more was 838 million. And by 2021, this was expected to go up to 1031 million. So the difference is 193 million. So over a period of 10 years, 193 million Indians will enter the workforce. So which if you sort of, now, as I said, not all of them. I mean, look forward, because some of them continue to study, some are married off. But you use the same formula for labor force. I use this exactly, you know, the numbers that Mr. Panagari had used 50% and 52.4%. Because these rates are from a report which was published in 2016. So it's like not something which was, you know, 15 years old. And it's fair enough to use the same methodology, but better data to show that the man is wrong. Right. So if you sort of do the math, so 193 million over a period of 10 years, works out to 19.3 million a year. And at 50%, it works out around 9.7 million. At 52.4%, it works out around 10.11 million. So roughly around 10 million. So 10 million, obviously, it's closer to 12 than to 7.5. But it's almost 33% more than 7.5 million. So the question again, you know, comes back to the fact that, you know, why would someone like Arvind Panagari, who was the former head of Neeti Aayog, use 2006 data and not 2017 data?"

And as per that, between September 2017 and February 2018, a period of six months, 31.1 lakh subscribers were added to the Employees Provident Fund. Now, this data point was immediately used by Rajiv Kumar, who's the current vice chairman of the Niti Aayog. And he claimed on Twitter that on a pro rata basis, this implies the creation of 62.2 lakh jobs in 2017-18. Cassandra should please give up. So he basically, you know, we had data for a period of six months, September to February, he doubled it and, you know, he came up with, you know, double the number. Now, there is a basic problem with this, you know, with this argument. And the basic problem is that, you know, organizations are supposed to sort of become a part of the EPF when the number of employees reaches 20 or more. So the moment, you know, an organization joins, sort of, you know, becomes a part of the Employees Provident Fund. It is probably, it has had 19 employees till then, and then one more is getting added. So you have 20 employees and you become a part of the EPF.

The second interesting point here is, and this is again, you know, if you look at all the estimates of how big the formal sector in India is vis-a-vis the informal sector. So there are multiple estimates. Some estimates say that the informal sector is 90% of the economy. Some others say that the informal sector is two-thirds of the economy, and there are other estimates in between. So if the formal sector is creating 62.2 lakh jobs in a year, it means the informal sector is creating close to 6 crore jobs in a year. That's his assumption. That is bizarre. I mean, if the informal sector is creating 6 crore jobs in a year, then India does not have a jobs crisis. Right. Right. And then it should, again, if so many jobs are being created, it should be visible in other data points. The economy should be booming. Booming. So if you look at the rate of economic growth, it's been the slowest in four years, 17-18, in 2017-18. The private consumption growth has been slowest in five years, in 2017-18. If you look at the investment data, the total value of projects scrapped or dropped in 2017 reached an all-time high level. The drop between 16-17 and 17-18 was 60%. This is as per Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. They offer another data point where they say as far as projects completed are concerned, they dropped 34% in value terms. So where are these jobs being created? I mean, ultimately, I mean, we all know\u2026 In the Jio-wise publicity department.

And it's a very funny thing because, you know, obviously, as the economy grows, any government would collect more taxes. So what you need to look at are not direct taxes collected in the absolute sense of the term, but direct taxes collected as a proportion of the size of the economy. So the proportion, the size of the economy is essentially the gross domestic product or the GDP number. Now, so in 2017-18, the government of India, the direct tax collection was 5.94% of the GDP. Now, this was more than the taxes collected in 2016-17, which were at 5.6%. Now, before the Modi government came to power in 2013-14, the direct taxes to GDP ratio was 5.62%. And the collection over the next three years was lower than this number. In 2017-18, it improved to 5.94% of the GDP, which was a jump of around 34 basis points. So the moment you deflate the direct taxes number with the GDP number, you suddenly realize that the jump has not been as huge as claimed. I mean, if you look at in absolute terms, direct taxes have gone up by around 17-18%. There has also been increase in what the government calls the tax base. So this is essentially people who are filing returns. But then, as you know, we've discussed in the past, filing returns and paying taxes are two very different things. So when you file returns and don't pay taxes, the government does not benefit, your chartered accountant benefits. So even though the tax base is going up, it has not led to a proportionate increase in tax collections. So the argument offered here again is that, okay, you know, right now, these people are not paying. But in the years to come, as their income goes up, they'll start to pay. Now the problem with that argument is that in the years to come, as their income goes up and as the inflation goes up, the minimum exemption limit will also have to go up. I mean, it's but natural. That's how, you know, it's always been the case. And it's the right thing to do as well. The other thing that people don't talk about is that in 2007-08 and 2008-09, the direct taxes to GDP ratio was 6.3% and 5.93% respectively, which is, you know, one number is greater than the direct taxes collection in the last year and one number is almost similar. Now what happened back then? What had happened back then was that, you know, the stock market was rallying and obviously the government ended up collecting a lot of tax from the stock market in the form of securities transaction tax and in the form of short-term capital gains. My contention is that a similar thing could have happened in 2017-18 as well."

What has also happened is that, you know, refunds have been delayed. So if, you know, the moment you delay refunds, your collection, the net direct tax number also goes up. So once you factor in all these things, you realize that, you know, again, it's a very strong case of optics management."

And, you know, expenditure is accounted for when the money goes out. Typically, in case, when companies account, that is based on the accrual system, wherein, if a sale is made, you know, it is booked as revenue, irrespective of the fact whether, you know, the customer, whoever the thing has been sold to has paid for it or not.

And then they sell that rice and wheat to the public distribution system at a price of 2 to 3 rupees a kg. And then there is also the cost of moving that grain around. So the government has to compensate the Food Corporation of India for that difference. Now, what it tends to do is that the government does not pay on time.

Now what happens is the natural question that one may ask now is that how does FCI function? If, you know, such a huge amount of money is not paid to an organization, I mean, how does it continue to function? So FCI essentially continues to function because it keeps borrowing and banks are happy to lend to FCI because FCI is basically the government. So typically what happens is that when FCI borrows, it has to pay interest on that borrowing. So that interest also gets added on to the subsidy burden."

Then you have the insurance companies, they have to sort of compulsorily invest money in government securities. So the government in its own way has ensured that, you know, the demand for the debt that it issues continues. I mean, the term that economists use for it in the Western world is financial repression.

If you enjoyed listening to this episode, go to the page of this episode on either seenonscene.in or thinkpragati.com. And there are links to all the articles by Vivek Kaul that I mentioned in there. So do check out all those articles. Also, I'd urge you to go to your nearest bookstore offline or online and buy the Easy Money Trilogy by Vivek Kaul. The Easy Money Trilogy has recently been released by HarperCollins and it's looking really snazzy in its new design. So this is not just a random plug I'm doing. It's a great book by a very fine writer you should all read. In fact, it's your duty as a citizen of this great democracy to read and follow Vivek Kaul. And it's also your duty to read and follow me so you can find me on Twitter at amitvarma. Thank you for listening."
