We think about the world and about our society through frames that have been constructed by others. As an illustration of this, ask yourself what comes to mind when you think of the word, the wife. Is the image that comes to mind that of a fallen sex worker, someone worthy only of contempt or pity? Or do you get the image of a bewitching courtesan out of Bollywood, dressed in an intricately embroidered anarkali, glowing with the jewelry she is wearing under the light of a crystal chandelier, Rekha or Meena Kumari at their most beautiful? Both these images are false. But these common impressions of the wives reveal a lot about our own prejudices. If only we cared to examine them closely and"

My guest today is Sabha Dewan, filmmaker and author who has made a series of riveting documentaries, including the 2009 film, The Other Song that journeys through Varanasi, Lucknow and Muzaffarpur, looking at the lives and histories of the wives. She had immersed herself so deeply in the subject that when she was done with the film, she wrote a book called Tawaif Nama, which is filled with some incredible stories as also social insights that come out of history and sit uneasily in our present times. I'm delighted that Sabha has agreed to join me on the show today. But before we begin our conversation, let's take a quick commercial break. If you enjoy listening to The Scene and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the show alive. The Scene and the Unseen has been a labor of love for me. I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe and hopefully yours as well. But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show. Although The Scene and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken up to the insane engagement level of podcasts. I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel and so on. So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going. And that involves you. My proposition for you is this. For every episode of The Scene and the Unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth. You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of your choice. This is not a subscription. The Scene and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in. This is just a gesture of appreciation. Help keep the scene going. sceneunseen.in slash support. Saba, welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. Thank you. Thank you for having me on the show. Before we sort of start talking about Tawaif Nama and you know, everything that's in the book, tell me a little bit about you know, your own personal journey. How did you become a filmmaker? How did all this happen? How did I become a filmmaker? Oh, Lord, that"

And so of course, I didn't want to become a journalist. So the next best thing I could think of was to be a filmmaker. But jokes apart, actually, I was interested in films. And I then joined the Mass Communication Research Center, Jamia. Although at that time, I wasn't very clear, even at that age, about the difference between documentaries or fiction. So I joined innocently enough thinking cinema karenge, filme banayenge. And then hey, presto, found myself in this place where, you know, the entire focus was on the documentary genre. And that opened a completely wide new world for me. I mean, it was and the beauty of the documentary, you know, the beauty of reality, and how slippery a creature reality is, and how difficult it is to define reality, your reality might not be my reality. So I mean, it throws up all these questions. And that's, that's pretty much how I entered the field."

And we saw documentaries, you know, which was certainly not like the films division propaganda that we had grown up associating documentaries with. And also, the early 80s was a very exciting time for the Indian documentary because the Indian documentary, independent documentary was coming into its own, you know, away from state funding. And that was the time when we were students and we were discovering documentary. So, we were exposed to the work of people like Meera Nair, and Deepal Sanraj, and Navrose, Anand Patwardhan. And we were very lucky, we're quite blessed to have them actually come and show their films to us and talk to us. And so yeah, and, you know, even in terms of world cinema and documentaries, international documentaries, I think there was a certain kind of an exposure that we got at Jamia, which then, you know, opened us to the possibilities of documentaries being an extremely creative medium.

But you know, in the thing is that somehow, while working on the documentary, and over the period of time, documentary stopped becoming a poor cousin to the feature film, at least for me, as a filmmaker, because it offers just so many exciting possibilities. And it, it's also very challenging as a medium, because I mean, there is, of course, that much that you have planned. But with a documentary, there's just so much that you possibly cannot plan, and which comes in and if you're receptive to it, it can bring magic to what you're doing. So I think that initial stage, yes, it was always like, or documentary is like a stepping stone to feature films, but that was in the initial stage, then you pretty much realise that documentary actually is a huge challenge in itself. And in many ways, I think more challenging, because there's just so much that's not in your control."

So the emphasis was actually on cinema verity of, of, you know, shooting as unfolding as things happen. So you don't construct. And you don't feed people lines. But that's the simpler aspect of it. I think what is more problematic, and I think a lot of filmmakers tend to fall into that trap. And I think a lot of times that comes a out of ignorance of not knowing better, and be out of a certain arrogance, which is that you presume someone's reality, that you understand someone's reality. And you presume where they're coming from. And you presume that they're going to say this, or they ought to say this, and this ought to be their understanding. And a lot of people fall into that trap, even in terms of very political filmmaking, you know, there's the subaltern, the subaltern has to be in the vanguard of the revolution, the subaltern may not be on the vanguard of the revolution, you know. And so, so, I think I did start off with certain notions, because how can not someone not be like that, you know, you those presumptions, but I think as you grow older, and hopefully a bit wiser, and also, you get enough knocks in life, to get some humility dinked into you, to realize that you don't have the answer. And it's good. It's good, you don't have all the answers. Because that's the only way that you can relate to people as human beings to human beings, not as like filmmaker here, and subject there.

And you know, like, one of the things that has struck me over the last few years reading history and doing a lot of episodes with historians, is that we take the male gaze on history for granted. Most of history, of course, is told from a male gaze. And therefore, there is a lot that is invisible or unseen, as it were, to that gaze. And it struck me while reading your book that so much of the book also sort of deals with that about making that unseen sort of visible. And what I also found sort of fascinating was, you know, one is, of course, the cliched ways of looking at the virus, which I sort of referred to in the introduction, which is, you know, what I grew up with, at least. So, you know, so this is sort of pretty much what you thought, and then you peel back the layers. And, you know, another thing that I have sort of discovered in recent episodes with historians is how so much of what we think of our own society and culture is constructed by the British when they came here, because they were obviously looking for simplistic narratives to explain the world to themselves, so they could neatly categorize everything. You in your book, of course, referred to Francis Buchanan, but this was pretty much the attitude of the British from the late 18th century onwards that they're trying to figure it out. They have access to only the elites who are, of course, upper caste Brahmins, so they get that sort of a version of history and then that gets ossified. And the rich, thriving sort of culture of the wives, you know, then they shine this moralistic light on it and everything just changes. Tell me a little"

The thing is not that, you know, I think what the book doesn't deal with it in that greater detail, although I do mention it, and which is that the wives, it's not as if before the India was colonized or before the British came, the wives occupied a highly respectable position in society, which is the book. The book keeps actually, you know, reiterating that they enjoyed high prestige, which is not the same as being respectable, you know, because they were attached to the nobility and individual men of the elite and the court. So they had access to power, they had access to wealth. And they were, of course, very sought after performers, musicians and dancers, in many cases also poets and writers and patrons of actually artists. They occupied a very ambiguous space between, you know, repute and disrepute, which is because of the certain stigma of being out of purdah. And, you know, out in the gaze of available, actually to all technically, although they were not. But yes, I mean, you know, it's out in the gaze of men. And yet they had a certain designated space within society. They were not certainly not looked down upon. In fact, people, you know, there was this much sought after too. And what was also very interesting, and if while I was researching was, it's not just the men that they've had relationships with, they actually would be invited at points of time by the women in the zanana, not very often, but they did. And so to perform on certain special occasions, etc., which I think is an important point, because the ways in which patriarchy insulates, you know, women of disrepute from what are the pure women. With tawafs that was not exactly happening. So I mean, not all tawafs, but tawafs of the highest repute, for instance, did have some access to the zananas of the aristocracy, because we have mention of that, even in the novel Umrao Jaanada, which actually is, you know, is hailed for its very, very authentic portrayal of 19th century Lucknow, makes mention of that. I think what happens with the coming on of the British is as you know, as you have mentioned very rightly, it's not just the tawafs. I mean, there was pretty much it happened with everything where here is, you know, an alien government, a colonial government, trying to understand in the simplest possible terms, a subject people and a subject people, which, you know, I mean, the most bewildering variety possible and heterogeneity amongst them. So it's not Europe, they chose to colonize India, which is an entire subcontinent in itself. And you know, they had confronted with this kind of a heterogeneity. So one of the ways in which one and you know, colonizers deal with heterogeneity is to actually somewhere smoothen out the differences and to, you know, make uniform or at least impose a certain uniformity of understanding. So yeah, you they had, you know, you have these volley of ethnographers, self-styled ethnographers, they're not ethnographers, ethnographers, but travellers who could be missionaries, who could be administrators, who could be colonial traders, you know, I mean, it's a variety of people who are travelling in India and making copious notes about all manner of, you know, subjects pertaining to the so-called native life. But it is not only actually an exercise in naivety, or even in terms of, you know, trying to understand an alien people. It is also informed by the imperatives of colonization itself. So it's not entirely an innocent exercise. And there is a certain imperative, there's an imperative of, you know, divide and rule. And much as it sounds a cliche now, the fact is that there is ways in which there is a constant refrain about Hindus and Muslims. Whereas the interesting thing is that actually in the early ethnographic records, there are communities upon communities of people who return themselves as both Hindus and Muslims, much to the chagrin of, you know, the colonial ethnographers, because how can you be both Hindu and Muslim?"

So this ways in which there is a certain homogenizing of putting them under a certain labeling people, that process takes place with the coming of the British process gets consolidated, solidified with that entire process of census, you know, which from, I think, 1891 or something when first census records start getting collected. But there's also a process in which especially after 1857, where there are ways in which there is a certain stereotypes being created, and quite consciously being created and projected. Among those stereotypes, you know, are the stereotypes of the decadent, depraved, you know, less vicious, Indian male, especially Indian princes, and who are more usually Muslim Nawabs, but could be actually also Hindus. Because this is the ruling class, the native ruling class that stood up against colonial might in 1857. So there's ways in which they are being maligned, and the kind of lifestyle associated with them then is portrayed as decadent. Now, here, of course, I think what also happens is that evangelism and Victorian morality also come into play, because a figure of a Tawaf makes no sense. She can only be a prostitute. In fact, that treatment is given not just to Tawafs, but even the Afdasis. So any female sexuality that exists outside of marriage has to be prostitute. So in fact, that is an entire spectrum that gets labelled as prostitute, not just the Tawafs."

        "message": "And you know, what also sort of strikes me as interesting is that there are almost like two forms of patriarchy playing out here. One, of course, is that the very existence of Tawafs, as almost a separate class and a separate community of people, points to the fact that the rest of the women, the women who are married, who are part of households, are supposed to keep their sexuality repressed. So that's a separate class. And therefore, because you want singing, dancing women who are expressing themselves freely, it's almost as if there is a necessity for a community of Tawafs, who then kind of looked at differently, but without necessarily the moral stigma, which then the British bring to it and the British come with this moral stigma at this sort of sexual expression, blah, blah, blah, they give a moral colour to it. And you know, even the sort of like, every time I hear of Tawafs being painted as sex workers and prostitutes, and the first thing I think that it strikes me we have to fight is what is wrong with sex workers and prostitutes to begin with? Why should you know that be a slur, but given that it is and is one of the things that we've normalised and is there, regardless, it's a huge step down. The other question I wanted to ask was, how empowered are the Tawafs in the sense that in contrast to the other women in society, they appear to have more autonomy, like sure, they function within that patriarchal setup, and they have to cater to the wishes of men. And that's what they are trained for. But at the same time, within that setup, they can shape their destiny far more, they are the heads of their communities. As you pointed out, for example, they even get a major share of the revenue share, like, you know, if there are 16 Annas, nine goes to the Tawaf and whatever, and they have a very sort of respected place within that community. So, you know, looking back as a feminist, and obviously, these are not people who are feminists per se, they are making the best of what they can within that system. What's your sense of these different degrees of autonomy and how these women are trying to negotiate these spaces?"

The community existed because of patriarchy, you know, patriarchy and in the sense of male entitlement, which wanted actually their wives, but also wanted to have these, you know, fascinating, beautiful, talented, witty, you know, mistresses.

But it never, you see, I think what happens though is that socially when and with human beings, it never quite works out as you expect it to. So for instance, even in terms of, you know, when you're saying that in terms of women of the household being sexually repressed, that's our presumption living in the 21st century. You know, there's enough writing and glimpses that one gets of the Zanana, which seems to have been a pretty thriving sexual space, which, you know, which is something that, but then one would have to understand it within the context of that space. If we try to start posing our understanding of what is active, being sexually active or sexually liberated, it doesn't work out that way. Similarly, with the Thawars. Yes, obviously, I mean, they were there as adjunct and they were very much adjunct of patriarchy. Their entire existence was dependent upon the patronage that they received from men. Without that, they're nothing. But given all that, within that, the fact is that here's a community of women where it is the women within the community who call the shots. You know, they are the ones, for instance, who are the head of the households. They are the ones who are the karta of the house, you know, in terms of the Hindu undivided family. The Thawar head of the family, actually her position corresponded more or less to the eldest son of the Hindu undivided family. They are the ones who, you know, depending, I mean, the laws of inheritance were different for different castes and communities of Thawars. But in many communities, Thawar daughters got a larger share, for instance, of the inheritance from their mothers and aunts, etc. than their brothers. In many other communities, at least the community I worked with, they got an equal share. Sisters and brothers had an equal share. It varied from community to community. But then they were much wealthier, ultimately, because they also held their own property. They made their own property. These were self-made women. So they were also jodhrayans of the community at large. The community itself was not just made up of women. It was also made up of the accompanist musicians, the tabla players, the sarangi players, the majira players, all of whom were men, who were teachers to Thawars, who were also their accompanists, and who were also dependent on Thawars for their livelihood. And in every town, you know, you had these kota communities, and it was the Thawars, and they had their own system of, you know, panchayat or council, which to regulate the affairs, internal affairs of the community. And it was the Thawars who headed these panchayats, always. So, you know, in terms of the household, it is they had definitely, it is they who called the shots of how the house would be run, you know, the family would be run. And they had relatively greater autonomy, in terms of also choosing who to take on as a lover and who not to, which now that depended, you know, if you came from, you're a poor Thawar, and you came from, you know, a poorer family, you might not have the luxury to exercise that choice, because you would have to then take on anyone who offered. But the say the women who were on the higher echelons of the community, they definitely exercise that choice. That's very well known. So, you know, they rejected lovers, they took on lovers. So, yes, I mean, there was a certain sense, a certain autonomous lifestyle, I'd say, that one sees there. And which also, I think, gets reflected in the pursuit of their art practice. That's an argument that I've made, that actually the Thumri and Dadra, etc, that we hear, which is from the Thawar's voice, that reflects a certain kind of autonomous living lifestyle, a certain"

And just women, you know, just my aunt, my great aunt, my mother, my grandmother, and there are no men present. So it is a very telling. Men are there, they are part of the household.

And at one point you say, quote, besides long and arduous training in music and dance, in order to be successful, the wives had to be educated in a range of other skills, such as a grounding in literature and politics, as well as knowledge of the intricacies of social etiquette, and of erotic stimulation. Stop quote. And I have a couple of questions here. One is, how are the arts being looked at by all these people? Like today, the arts are something relatively respectable, that if you, you know, know a woman who's a writer or a singer or whatever is very respectable, you know, Lata Mangeshkar is absolutely revered. How were the arts looked at back then? And was there a reason that it was, you know, more the province of the wives, so to say, and looked at by whom? Looked at in a general social sense. Okay, by society, by society, like, you know, you have women in the in the wife communities, they are being trained in all of those arts, but there is not so much of that happening outside of it. It almost seems happening outside. Yeah, it is almost as if it is restricted to them. And the second sense that, you know, I got from the paragraph I read out, for example, is that all of this, you know, training in the arts, training in literature, training in practices of seduction is all a means to an end, you have to get a patron, there's an economic imperative at"

        "message": "the bottom of it. I think there's this definite shift in the ways in which the arts get constructed and looked upon from the, say, the early 20th century, with the coming on of cultural nationalism. And then there's this entire focus upon our ancient culture, which kind of starts, you know, it's part of a certain kind of nationalism, and defining a certain kind of an Indianness. So that makes cultural expression more respectable. So where, where, yes, music and dance of a certain kind, but then again, that there's a problem there, because music and dance of a certain kind is acceptable and not of another kind. I'll come to that later. But I think that if you read, you know, any of the writings before that, and even if you talk to the older people in the community, even now, I mean, not that they came from that century, they didn't pretty much. But I mean, they carry certain oral memories and traditions far more. I sense a very, matter of fact, robust dealing with the arts. You know, it's not like these rarefied deities, sangeet toh puja ke liye hai, you know, that whatever, sangeet sadhana or, you don't hear that, at least from within the community. Music is terribly important, and not just as a means of livelihood. I mean, sure, it was their livelihood, but it's also the ways in which it defines them. So there is a, their own sense of being gets defined as musician. So I think the ways in which they look at music is so, so subliminal that it's also defies easy categorization or definition. I mean, even if they, I mean, I've tried to talk to a lot of women about it, and then they'll tell you things like, they'll give you anecdotes to explain to you what music means to them. And each one of them is important, you know, I mean, in terms of this woman who told me that how, you know, she got this patron and who, who loved her so much and so deeply, and he wanted to make a respectable woman out of her. And so he took her away and he said, now you don't have to dance and sing for a living. And he looked after her and he was true to his promise. He did look after her and all of that. And she had children from him. Things went, were going fine, but she started falling ill and she went into a deep depression. She was just terribly ill. And and then finally no medicine worked. And then, you know, and this is like a tale that gets told by a lot of sources. It's one of those apocryphal tales, which a lot of tawafs will tell you. It's also attributed to Begum Akhtar. The same thing happened to Begum Akhtar. But then a lot of other lesser tawafs will also tell you that and take that story for themselves. I think the importance is not whether this happened or doesn't happen. I think it's what's, what is it telling you? It's telling you that for all, you know, the music is like, this is saans ki tarah hai. It's your breath. And so, so all the respectability and status that they could get in exchange. This story explains that how actually without music you die, you know, and you die a spiritual death, if not a physical death. Although in these stories, it's like I was dying physically too, because it's just shriveling up in within myself. So I think that to me is a very powerful indicator of what music means. But it's not necessarily imbued with the kind of spiritual connotations that music gets imbued by, say, by early 20th century, under the influence of the cultural nationalist. I mean, the community of musicians saw it that way. I think pretty much even in terms of writing, in terms of society and patrons, music is of course, you know, valorized, validated musicians are made much of. Patronage of musicians indicates a certain kind of your good taste and status and adds, you know, kind of a certain respectability to your position, etc. It's prestige. But music and gavaiyas, you know, there is also a certain kind of disrepute attached to it. You know, it's like, there is, if you, and I think that has to do very much with a certain fear and a certain construction of, this is my understanding of masculinity. And which is that, you know, indulgence in music, in ras, as they say, jo ras mein lean hona, that's all very well. So whether it is music or whether it is the beauty of a woman, love, you know, all of those things, to be an aesthete is something of course, which is preferable and which is much looked up to. But if as a man you lose yourself into that, then it is doom for you. So there is a certain kind of a cautionary note always there in terms of be a good patron, be a judicious patron. If you kind of go completely enraptured by it, then you spell doom for yourself, for your household, for business, for dharma. And that holds true, I think both for, you know, I mean, pretty much within the, you know, Hindus and Muslims, upper classes, there is that certain, and I think you in Mughal writing, again, the ideal Mirza, who's the Mughal aristocrat, the ideal Mirza, he is an aesthete, he will patronize artists, but he will also patronize, you know, wrestlers and he will patronize this and he'll patronize that. But he shouldn't get completely so enraptured that he loses sense of his duties and responsibilities. This is pretty much the same thing as the Kartas of a Hindu household. You know, if you have the means, certainly indulge in the finer things, but don't get so enraptured that it brings doom to your household. And you have so many cautionary tales about that. So I think that that is the certain role, the certain place that the arts occupied, where arts are very well, and they are marker of your status of, you know, the status of the patron. Because they were based so much on individual patronage, without individual patronage, arts could not flourish. But arts did not define in totality, your sense of identity of being whatever you were, in all. I mean, for the artist, yes. Not in the way, for instance, by early 20th century, you have the arts, which start defining a certain notion of Indianness, for instance. Before that, there's also a very robust kind of ways in which arts are looked at, like they're not rarefied. So you have this thing about, you know, when now in early 20th century writing, there's this whole big difference being made between classical music, and so called lowly popular music. You see, writing before that, that kind of difference is not made. Also, in terms of the singers themselves, I mean, not that we have too much of oral record of it, because recordings come in only by early 20th century. But in the early recordings, you have singers who are pretty much singing a whole medley of stuff. And not just very consciously raga based, you know, music. So, I don't know if I've answered your question. But I think there are shifts that take place by early 20th century, under the imperative of nationalism, you know, and which then the arts get start getting defined in a certain way, which is how we receive them now, how we perceive them now. That's not necessarily something that is shared, you know, pre nationalism."

And that has to be balanced. Now that that kind of worldview changes with the coming in of cultural nationalism. And so you have, you know, music, for instance, music now starts defining the contours of Indian identity. And you know, pride of a certain nationalist pride in being Indian. So and that carries with it a whole lot of baggage, because then certain kind of music becomes acceptable. A lot of other kind of music is not acceptable. Certain musicians are acceptable. Certain musicians, many musicians really in which also includes all the wives and the devdasis who you know, who are seen to embody a certain an illicit sexuality. And, you know, their art practice is based on pleasure seeking. Now, that is not something which is very acceptable to the cultural nationalists who are imbuing the arts with these all these spiritual connotations, you know, of some higher purpose and higher being and so those things change.

So there's a kind of women who are living traditional lives, and their housewives and they're doing whatever, in some sense, they are self delusional. But I would imagine that the wives would be less delusional, because they would have a much clearer sense of the transactional nature of relationships of the sort of role that they play within, you know, the patriarchal system that they are part of.

And so people who are placed in that position on the wrong foot, then they find their ways to play the system. So that's because if you see if you were to talk to I mean, you know, I'm not talking about the wives, I'm talking about housebound women, and they interest me a great deal because my own family, for instance, and especially my father's family, pretty much represented that, you know, it's very patriarchal family and very tradition bound to a certain extent. And yet there are all these stories of these grandmothers and grandaunts, whose word was law. Now, how was their word law?

Because, you know, the fact is that yes, there, I think there's maybe a greater awareness than most, in terms of having an awareness of the transactional nature of their relationships, which may be many of us. And I think especially the middle class, we are uncomfortable admitting that. And so we kind of say, we put a lot of things to it. But that's the same as sex workers do. There is a certain and there's a recognition of that, because with the sex worker, for instance, comes stripped of everything else, you've got to recognize it for what it is. And I think with the wives too, what they were very good at, actually was to create illusion. So I think that is the interesting point, because, you know, here are women who are entering into, well, I will be your lover, you will be my patron, you will maintain me the monthly income, blah, blah, blah, you know, it came with a certain ways of being. And so it was a certain transaction, but it was never stated as such. It was all played out as this elaborate love affair. And, you know, which they are in control of. Well, yes, but which is what they would like to believe that they were always in control. But believe me, there were a lot of stories, even in this book, there are, where sometimes they were not in control. They were human beings, you know, human beings win in love, lose in love. And I think that's how things go on. So yeah, I wouldn't make them into some super women. And that was my endeavor also in the book. They're not that these super women who are also clear eyed all the time. Relatively speaking, yes, because the nature of their relationship with the outside, not within themselves, there is a certain recognition, because it's also easier to recognize the transactional nature of that relationship. Because that's how it takes place. And yes, there is a certain kind of wisdom and smartness that is there because they are survivors and these are self made women. I think that is really important. They don't have any padding of, you know, family or someone padding you up forget about family, just your class privileges, or where you come from, or, you know, none of that. So if you are a survivor, then you know, you cannot afford to be in some delusional state, you've got to be far more clear eyed, that certainly, but to the extent that for women who were, I mean, we're talking about the heydays of the Tawaif culture. Yes, there were young Tawaifs who also fell in love, and who also stupidly wanted to throw away their, you know, thriving careers, who fell in love during wrestling matches, as we shall discuss shortly. And who, well, who, you know, it was just as well that Dilip Singh went off. Otherwise, she was quite happy to have gone after, she was a young Tawaif. So those things happened.

You know, their relationships with each other, for instance. I mean, the kind of very close relationships that women share with each other. Now, that is something and the book has it, you know, except I'm not that I'm not underlining it. But the fact is, their primary relationships are with women, with other women. Women with their own family, their sisters or their daughters or nieces or whatever aunts. Or very often their adopted children. Adopted children, friends, women friends from within the community. And these are really intense relationships. So I remember one of the women who's now a very good friend. Very early on, I was flicking through her photographs and I came across these two photographs of the same woman and with her arm around her. And there's something about it. So I said, Who is she? And she said, Yeh humaari friend hai. You know, and that seemed okay. Friend, you know, this and she's also a Tawaif but from Gaya, not from even the same town. Then over the years, I got to know her. To this day, I don't really know the nature of their relationship, whether it's sexual or not. I don't know. I don't think it matters. Yeah, because I'm not sure that for her too, is the kind of woman she is. There's a certain abundance of so much to her, you know, in terms of the ability to give and the ability to also take. So, I don't know. But yes, I know why those photographs are there. Because the intensity of that love, that friendship, humaari friend hai. It really struck to me. I can't explain it, but it meant so much the way she said it. And of course, then I got to know her and I met the other woman. And I know how close they are. I mean, it's like, you know that if this woman, if there's something plaguing her, then the other woman will definitely know. You know, she will know what is the real issue. So, those are also relationships, which are very, very important. Actually, family relationships, it is the other part which is rarely talked about, which is there in the book. Of course, book talks locates them in their family. We make this categorization between family women and tawaifs. Family women are respectable women and tawaifs are well tawaifs. And somehow, in popular culture, in cinema, tawaifs are always shown. You know, these alienated creatures from nowhere almost, with no one. And who've come and then there is some like conniving, you know, lady of the, you know, owner of the kota who has either kidnapped her or bought her or whatever, whatever. The fact is, they all belong to a close-knit community and very close-knit families. And those families, and these are women who are heading those families, and so carry a huge sense of duty and responsibility. Now, there are a lot of it is not it. Most of it, I don't see it as transactional at all. It comes out of, well, those are givens. It's like, very much like I'm the elder son of the family. I've got to do this. So, I've got to do it. And so, you know, you say, well, why do you have to do this? Why do you have to get your nephews into jobs, who will find jobs? Who else will? I have to do it. And until they don't, they have to live with me. So, you know, this, in fact, I see in Tawaif households, there's a lot of emphasis on that. These are women who are, you know, taking care of very extended families, very, very extended families. A lot of them, you know, active, fairly parasitical in nature, because this is one woman earning or maximum two women earning, and everyone just kind of living. But that's the nature of those families used to be. Now, of course, it's changed. But there's nothing there. Now, whether it's delusional or, you know, it's pretty much the same as family, you know,"

You know, in fact, the whole thing builds up to 1857, you know, the rebellion of 1857. And therefore, when this story came to me and, you know, this family, they talked about their great, great, great grandmother, as like completely, you know, taken in, because A, I had not come across a continuous family history that went that long back. And B, she is just lovely, you know, and then there was a mention of her even in the Gazetteer. I found it. So I said, wow, I mean, she's absolutely lovely. But she is not the only, you know, the thing about being a wrestler, strange as it may sound, it actually there were other Tawaifs of later vintage, who also, I'm not too sure what the connection was. But I think maybe it's like physical regimen or exercise. You're really fit, at least. Probably, because I've come across at least two or three instances of, you know, women of Tawaifs, either being interested in wrestling. Interested in wrestling, fine, you are and the patrons of wrestlers, which also you don't kind of associate, but yes, like, but also being in doing wrestling, knowing wrestling, knowing this Lathbazi. So, you know, these swordmanship, etc. It's very strange. That kind of goes out then. By about late 19th century, one doesn't find these references as much. But in Banaras, I have come across. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, even the great Vidyadhari Bai, who is the great Thumri singer, I think, yes, she was very fond of, you know, wrestling, or she could do wrestling herself. I'm not, I can't remember that. But I think doing her, something about it. If you look at it, it's also about a certain mobility and freedom of space of accessing. See, if you are wrestling, or you are, you know, doing Lathbazi and all of that, and also horse riding, then there is an access to open spaces. You know, there's a person who has enjoys that kind of freedom to access and freedom of movement."

And this scene seemed so cinematic to me, like if ever a web series is made, this could really be a pivotal scene. And the pilot episode is that wrestling match, where you describe how this wrestler Dilip Singh is just beating all comers. And then at one point where he's beaten everyone, he's like, you know, does anyone care to challenge me? Does anyone have the courage? And this young 19 year old wife, which is of course, Dharmanbhai, has a self confidence to say that I will challenge you. And then she challenges him. And then that wrestling scene itself is so tinged with the erotic, that they are actually wrestling with each other. And it's a clash where eventually, none of them win. And then they eventually become lovers. And all of that was sort of incredibly fascinating. And one wonders that the people who are telling you the story, her great, great, great granddaughter, you know, in their imagining, how is all of this happening? Are they romanticizing it? Are they sort of building it up? Are you feeling in certain blanks yourself?"

Because I think after all, these are stories that are coming down so many generations, there surely must be additions in them, which I was open to. And my interest was not that this has to be some authentic, that each part of the story has to be validated. Because my interest in these stories was of the Tawaifs telling their own stories. I mean, see what is important to them in the telling of the story about, say, Dharman Bibi. And even anything they've added would actually be revelatory. Absolutely. So that is why I was so interested in hearing from them, the stories about, you know, these women in their families. Because that points towards the ways in what are the things that they valorize? What are the things that are important? Where is the erotic? And erotic, I realized pretty much, could also reside in a wrestling match. And in fact, it was very erotic. You know, when I could see immense possibilities there. It's something if I had been just presented, if I had to think of it, maybe for a moment, I'd be a little bit flummoxed. But once I was told that story, definitely, yes, of course, an extremely erotic moment, and charged moment. In fact, the image that came to mind is in"

I realized pretty early as a filmmaker, documentary filmmaker, that reality is very relative. You know, in terms of what is reality, it could be a slippery creature. And your reality is not the same as mine. And for me, what is more important is in terms of the ways in which a story is told. It's not the whether it happened or it didn't happen. It's actually, ultimately, what is the story telling me? What is it pointing me towards? So there is this kind of element of magical realism, which is there throughout the book. Now, here is a community that, you know, is also very steeped in, by the way, in Sufi worship, and then that cuts across Hindus and Muslims. And there is a ways in which that they, I think that could be true of a lot of other Indians. It's of looking at realities, where this kind of, you know, this junct between what we call the fantastical and the real world necessarily does not exist. So what is, you know, the, there are ghosts who enter your, you know, world, and they are also creatures. And they are also, there are Sufi saints who are your benefactors. And they are people almost, I mean, they become like characters in your story. And they are like these, your family elders also almost taking care of you. So I pretty much realized that, I mean, this was an amazing treasure trove of stories. And I didn't want to reduce, be reductionist and you know, because I think, for me, the way they were told to me, I was interested in telling them as they were, without passing judgment, because how can I claim that my reality is of a superior nature or more real, I mean, or my idea of reality. There's no ways in which there's certain arrogance that I could be speaking from that. No, I agree entirely. And for me, for instance, that you know, the whole bit about when a Dharman baby is giving birth to the baby girls in the sanctuary of Mundeshwari Devi's temple. Here's a Muslim Tawaif. This is a narrative which flies in the face of colonial writing. And also later, even the, you know, the Hindu nationalist writing. It shows you how natural our syncreticness is. So, and here are these Muslim Tawaifs, three generations down or four generations down, telling me that story about so it is their telling of the story that I'm going on. And where Mundeshwari naturally becomes foster mother almost. She's Devi. She is the mother. She's mother goddess. She has to be Dharman's mother. And she will have to protect Dharman and Dharman becomes her daughter. And this Dharman, this great warrior, the wife warrior is now at her most vulnerable because you know, she's giving birth and she's helpless and the enemy is outside. And so of course, she's in the embrace of her mother, who then takes care of her and protects her. When I heard of it, I actually had goosebumps, you know, because and then they attribute and says, you see, Sadabahar, don't forget, she was one of the twins, the daughters, Dharman's daughter. And Sadabahar, you know, has this mystical destiny. And she's also very fearless in many ways. And they said that Sadabahar was after all born under Mundeshwari's gaze. And it somehow becomes that, you know, that transmission of a certain energy that happened. It's all very fascinating. And this also kind of ruptures this kind of ways in which you patriarchy posits the illicit sexuality of the Tawaif and the Devi. You know, Aap ya Devi hai, ya patita hai. But here actually the Tawaif is giving birth in the sanctuary of the Devi and the Devi becomes the mother. So, of course, I love this story. And it said so many things to me and provided me with an understanding with the ways in which they construct syncreticism and lived syncretism. It's not like a spoken off or romanticized. This is like very matter of fact, the way this story was told to me. And I just hope that the readers also kind of give them that kind of peep."

And it strikes me in a way that all histories are in some sense or the other mythologies. And, you know, the fact that a lot of this history is actually almost oral history is coming down through the generations. So, you know, all these layers are getting added on and there were some beautifully filmy layers and all this. But, you know, in her life also, there are these sort of, you see society and the economy and politics changing as well. You know, for example, in the fact that as you pointed out, she was besotted with the Lipsynch, she wanted to be with him. But his economic circumstances led him to, you know, follow his brothers into the army and he's gone. And then she is being wooed by this man old enough to be her grandfather, Kuwar Singh. And at first, he's not willing. And then comes this very filmy element of her aunt Zahooran being wooed and poisoned by this Khan Azad Khan, sort of cut a long story short. And it's a delightful filmy story. Again, she dies and she gets into this marriage. And it's a wonderful, beautiful, loving marriage, which is, you know, it's not a marriage, it's a partnership. It's a partnership. She's a mistress, but it's almost like a marriage in the sense that she's the official sort of, I mean, there's another very nice story you tell about how this English official comes to Kuwar Singh's house and, you know, other Tawaifs are performing for him. And obviously, Dharman is at an elevated level being the mistress of this man, and she's not expected to perform. But then the Englishman says, no, I want to see her. And he can't piss off the Englishman because his economic fortunes are going down and he depends on the British. And she performs and he's getting to sort of carried away by this. And I'll quote from your book, Dharman seethed silently. This Virangi, foreigner, was behaving as if she, the leading Tawaif of Shahabad, was a humble Nachinia, a low placed dancer, or worse, a poor prostitute selling sex to English soldiers. Stop quote. And there is again a delightful story about how she keeps piling him with drinks and then sends one of her... Gets him so drunk and then... Yeah, sends a maidservant dressed in her clothes and the guy doesn't realize the difference, all of which is like incredibly filmy. So if Bollywood people are listening to this."

And so, which is the part which took a lot of time, but actually, to understand a community, how do you understand a community? Yes, the context, I was providing and I was working hard on them in researching the political, social changing context. You know, this is like the unfolding of India through this Tawaif family over 200 years. The thing is that the history of music and musicians in India, especially, there's not that much written material. It's very based on oral accounts, oral histories. You have to actually depend on those. And you come across actually over and over again, you come across very many stories. I make no claims that any of these stories, necessarily, it's exactly how it happened. It may or it may not have happened that way. But it's the family's understanding of their sense of self. They derive their sense of self from these stories of their, well, grandmother, aunts, grandaunts. That is what is giving also like, you know, getting channelized into their sense of self. And what is that construction? How are they constructing these histories? That speaks to me a lot about how the community constructs itself, what the community values. It gives me a peep into their ways of being. So, you know, some of the stories, whether unbelievable or not, but some of them are actually very delightful. And the ones which have the element of, great element of magical realism. Later on, there's this story of this, you know, aunt of the protagonist who literally loses her way. She has this destiny of being one of the greatest musicians. And it's a cautionary tale, actually. And, you know, Tawaif narratives are bound with cautionary tales. So she loses her way because of her own hubris. And then ultimately, because she had for long served, you know, the raag and raagni as well. It's they who come to her rescue literally. And she finds herself in a forest, and they rescue her. And they take her away. I mean, it's an incredible story. So, and it speaks to me about the intensely closed relationship that, you know, these musicians have with their music. That's actually what it's speaking about. In a very personal relationship, which is defining so much of their being that ultimately, where you're saying that if I'm in the danger of being killed, it is my music which will come and save me. And music literally in the shape of a man or woman personified. I just found that those stories fascinating."

It was very prevalent in India, where people would sell their children and people would even sell their wives and all of that. There'd be sales deeds. They'll be sales deeds. Shockingly enough. Yeah. So it is part of our recent history as well. And what our culture, our culture, as it were. And what also kind of struck me was how much of the wife families, how much of the community is sustained through adoption. Like Dharman BB's aunt was herself adopted, as you pointed out. And there's a lot of sort of, like you write, quote, adoption of girl children among childless Tawaifs was most common, but it was not considered unusual for Tawaifs with biological daughters of their own to adopt as well.

No, but actually, as the book points out in the later chapters, and that is from post 1857, you know, the rule shifted from East India Company to the crown, the British crown directly. And so, you know, there's the IPC and all of these, the law changed. And adoption by Tawaifs was declared illegal. So, you know, those Tawaifs who had already adopted, well, then their foster daughters could not claim property because it was not recognized by the state. And any adoption done thereafter from 1860 onwards, was anyway deemed illegal and a criminal activity. So, and then there's this entire thing about how this family, Sadabahar and her, you know, twin, and their foster mothers lose their entire fortune in being taken to the courts over this whole issue. But the thing is that adoption was fairly common. And there are hangovers of some of those terms which still remain. So, you know, for instance, even to this day, I was rather shocked when they use the term Malkin. Malkin is kind of slave owner, I mean, kind of conjures up things. So, but it's obviously a hangover because Malkins, now they say it simply means, you know, like the mother of an active, this is being now used in the context of bar dancers, some of whom come from Tawaif families. But the process of adoption from the outside stopped. And that is because by the criminalization of the entire tradition by the colonial state. So, A, they were being, you know, this point of time, 1870s, 1880s, you have a plethora of court cases, if one comes across in the archives. And where especially actually of, you know, dancers and singer communities from West India and also from the Devdasi communities, and also Tawaif, some Tawaifs, which is on litigation, which is on this very fact, that oh, so and so is, you know, an adopted daughter, well, her claims upon property being contested, because she's illegal. So, you know, that, so, de facto, then her claims are not recognized. So, this process, there was an entire, there seems to have been a big churning, actually, within the community. That's actually where my archival research came in handy, is looking at that and piecing the things. Also, I think that somewhere around late 19th, early 20th century, at least from within the Tawaif communities, adoption from the outside came to an end, because there is no memory of adopting daughters from the outside. Yes, adopting your own nieces, that kind of within the family, that continued. And that continued, because, well, you know, they just felt that that needed no official sanction. One of the smart things that Tawaif communities in the North did, which I don't know why it was not followed by the communities of dancers and singers in the West and South, was that they actually had an embargo of not accessing law courts. It's really very interesting. And because they kind of realized quite early on that, look, we are the losers every time we drag some family matter or, you know, issue into the courts, because there's just so much bias and hostility and prejudice against well, so called prostitutes. So, who are not and certainly their customary lifestyle, their norms, customs are not being recognized at all. So, there was a certain embargo, which is really very interesting, that they imposed, you know, if you go to access, if any family does do that, then they would be excommunicated. Now, whether that was imposed all across all the communities in the North, I don't know. But it seems to have been imposed, at least in a lot of places. And people have a memory of that.

The other aspect was in terms of even in terms of personal, you know, the so called, you know, this, the lawmaking was divided into, you know, this criminal and personal. Yeah. So and so here, what happened was that I mean, that had existed even pre 1857. But post 1857, you had Muslim personal law, Hindu personal law. So communities were to be governed, you know, their matters pertaining to inheritance, separation, property, all the civil matters would be and that was to placate actually, you know, what was perceived to be the traditional, more traditional elements within Indian society, who it was felt had got very offended by, you know, colonial evangelical activity. And that was one of the reasons for 1857. Now, so all civil matters came under these, you know, Hindu law, Muslim law, Christian law, etc, etc. These were necessarily, you know, they are necessarily patriarchal in nature, because where men are privileged in all of these, after all, over women, any of these law things. So the customs, you know, whereas what the Tawaifs or any of the communities, it's not just the Tawaifs, I mean, it's any of the communities, the other communities, they had followed thus far customary law. Now, customary law a because they were all these communities who are not of, you know, so called high caste, you know, many of them did not have all of this written down. This came as part of a certain oral, you know, tradition, and oral memory of law making that what happens is, and it does not fall neatly into being Hindu or Muslim. So for instance, Nat Tawaifs, if they are Nat, Hindu Nat Tawaifs and Muslim Nat Tawaifs, they all follow the same, you know, customs. And that is true for all the other communities of Tawaifs also, in terms of inheritance, property, whatever, whatever. Now, as far as the, and where, of course, women are being privileged, you know, in the Tawaifs. Now, if they go to the, this was the greatest blow to the position and autonomy of the Tawaifs, you know, and one of the reasons why they stopped accessing law courts, because when they went to the law court, the first thing was that, you know, if there was any case, you know, say a brother contesting against his sister, the brother automatically stood much greater chance of winning the case, because that is how actually, whether it is, you know, Muslim personal law or Hindu personal law, it is patriarchal, it privileges men, any of these law makings. Secondly, their customary law was not recognized because they said you are prostitutes, you are criminals. So to claim that you are, this is custom is to say as if a band of thieves has a certain customs. So, you know, their customs were disparaged. And then thirdly, there's a certain identity of being either Hindu or Muslim imposed on them. It's fascinating. If you go through the legal archives, where actually there are these contests made saying, you know, but your honour, my client is neither Hindu nor Muslim, but identifies herself as what, what, what, and this is no how can that be? It's very clear. Her name is this, her mother's name was this, they follow the custom of burial. And so they have to be, you know, Muslim. So that there's a certain imposition is also a certain ways in which there's a congealing of identities that takes place in late 19th century. It's all a parcel of ways in which identities is this disparate Hindu, Muslim, they get shaped also in this period. But actually, it's also it's a greatly contributed to the erosion of the status of the wives. So it is not just the criminalization, which is, you know, in terms of state surveillance, in terms of, you know, like, for instance, the ways in which the contagious disease acts, where you were had to go and get yourself compulsorily, I mean, you examined, etc, etc. All that was there anyway. It was at least civil law, which was really, really eroded their position, which is why actually, they said goodbye, they had a good sense to say goodbye to the law courts, as far as these cases were concerned, they resolved it within themselves."

There's this whole like, big fascination for the recorded voice. So one part, of course, was to record your own voice, your loved ones, etc, etc. But there was much greater demand for music, indigenous music. That's how it's very fascinating that early 20th century, you have these all these companies from Europe and America, you know, just racing and coming to India, who's going to beat, be the first one to reach here, because this was recognized as a huge market, the huge potential. Now, what is really interesting is that, okay, they come in. And the people, the only class of musicians who really show an interest in recording for them, are the Tawaifs and the Devdasis. And very few of the male musicians, especially, you know, the Khayal singers and Drupad Diyas and all, you have much fewer numbers. Why is that? Well, many reasons. See, why the men didn't want it is, you know, the obvious reason is a, the purest amongst them felt that it compromised the integrity of their music. Because something, you know, Khayal can be sung over so many hours, it has to be like, you have to explore leisurely each nuance of the raag and then you hear this was even less than, you know, three minutes, you have to get it over with. So obviously, there was, the purest felt offended, it was seen as something terribly crass and crude. Commercialization, yeah, I mean, so that was happening and a certain vulgarity. So that was one part of it. But well, I mean, all, you know, all the, this is very, all very high minded. But actually, there were also other reasons for it, which were less high minded, which was a, you know, the value of music of some of the effect was based on the fact of its exclusive worth, so that it was being performed for a small audience in these exclusive gatherings of, you know, in the courts and in princely mayfields. And so, they felt that that their value, the value of the music would go, if it was accessible to all on the gramophone, and could be easily copied by everyone. So then what is their exclusive value of their music or their style? And style could be copied by everyone then. There was a genuine real fear of plagiarism. So which dates back then till at that time. And, and the third was actually, you know, and you hear that is in terms of, you know, the horn, the gramophone horn, which there was a fear that this actually, I mean, it's actually speaks of many things, if you think about it, there was this thing, fear that this sucks the soul of the very singer of the singer. People have similar fears about cameras and their photos being taken. Yeah. So and well, I mean, you know, if you were to look deeper into that, it's this, you know, in terms of looking at the market and music and what it meant, etc, etc, then that can one can go into that. So the male musicians had those fears, real fears. And therefore very few of them till at least almost 1920s. Very few of them much fewer numbers except for certain notable, you know, examples like Ustad Abdul Kareem Khan Sahib, he sang, but otherwise you have very few people. The wives who came in, you know, large numbers, they were the main people who recorded for the gramophone, the wives and the devdasis. See, they were being hounded out of the kothas.

So there's an entire hounding that was going on in various ways in the press, in railways, where, you know, the patrons would be stopped physically from holding these notches, etc. So they were under pressure to reinvent themselves. And the gramophone came along and was almost perfect for many of them to actually reinvent themselves as gramophone singers. And to, you know, to make"

I think moving physically from one place to another, but also then that also translates in being able to move from one kind of a performance space to another kind of a performance space. You know, being open to new opportunities in life. I think so it was not just the gramophone, they were theater, then there were films. So in fact, in terms of the ways in which we see now, I mean, the cinema and theater and the recording industry, recording music, it was so much to tawaifs."

But that is how society does, you know, look upon them. And it's also, it's actually a certain systematic vilification that they have suffered, you know, over the decades, till actually, say in Banaras, you know, that hounding, physical hounding went on till they were forced to shut kothas, finally, by the early 1980s. And that just didn't happen because, oh, people's taste changed. That too happened. See, a lot of things happened together. For instance, one thing that happened was that, you know, the emphasis on companion marriages. So, you know, with the emphasis on women's education, women coming out of parda, getting educated, the emphasis on marriages where your husband and wife share, are friends, share ideas. That's a completely new concept for India in many ways. So, if the emphasis on that kind of a relationship, then really, I mean, the need for a mistress who is educated, if your wife is educated, you know, those, that itself, kind of was, you know, that need lessens. Even that need for companionship, apart from sex. Of a cultivated, you know, companion. I mean, if that kind of, you know, was being undercut and cut away. But in terms of the cinema itself, the coming up of cinema and film music, that I think went and before that, the gramophone, recorded music. The thing about, because otherwise, kothas were also a site, was not just a sexual site. Exactly. It was a site for going to listen to music. But if there was recorded music by the same voices available, then, you know, kotha was not the only place you could access music."

If one is using them as a means to an end, then that remains just that. Then the kind of rich relationship between people as human beings, then you don't see them, you stop seeing them as human beings, because they just become a means to an end to you want your film done.

And it's not that I will share an equally close relationship with everyone I work with. That is true. I don't. And I think that also depends from people to people, circumstances, etc. I think for me, that's not just for the wives that I've worked with. It's equally true for all the other people I've worked with all the other films I've made. I mean, it's a cliched question that's asked of nonfiction in general, actually had, you know, these are relationships that I forge, not necessarily don't have to be become my bosom buddies. But the relationships that I forge, and I take care, and I think that is reflected then in the films is one in terms of mutual respect. And that is why I mean, people always tell me, what takes so long in your film, you know, my films take so long in making, not all, but some of them have taken immensely long. And because, for me, the process is very important. You go wrong in the process, then you don't have a film. And the process is not just glibly saying, Oh, what does mutual respect mean? Mutual respect really means actually a of respecting the other person respecting the boundaries that they are setting out for themselves, respecting those and not trying to be clever and hoping the boss one day or the other, I'm going to skip them because people are not stupid. If they have some boundaries, learn to respect them the way you have boundaries and you want them to be respected. And yes, over a period of time, if you know, there's a relationship that intensifies and you know, you they allow you in good for you, if not too bad. It's also means of opening up yourself, you know, because that is a relationship and that is a real problem. The unequal power dynamics, especially in filmmaking, where I'm right up here, I'm looking at my subject, I expect them like with a microscope, I expect them to open up their lives. But what about me? You know, and I don't work like that. There is a certain giving and taking in terms of like sharing my life of sharing the way I am as a person. And that is building up of certain relationships, not necessarily of like friendship, but in terms of just also as colleagues, but relationships which have to be based on a certain equality. And I guess also based on honesty, because you're very upfront about what you're there for and how much they give is up to them. Absolutely. And so for instance, I mean, there is a certain process that is involved. And it's true from the film I've made, is that, especially with, you know, the trilogy I made, because it was very sensitive. Here were women who were really sharing parts of their lives with me, which I felt very privileged that they trusted me enough to do that. But then there was a certain process we followed. We cut the film and then the rough cut had to be passed by them before and anything. If they said, no, this, you know, people say something and then they change their mind and say, no, I'm not comfortable. I said that, but I don't want that to come in. You've got to respect that. Because I genuinely believe in, you know, in all humility that a film or a book is not more important than a human being or a human life. So, you know, you can do this, no great film at the expense of someone's, well, peace of mind or whatever, you know, their existence. That's how I work. And that makes for a very slow moving process. But I think at the end of the day, at least I sleep easier. You know, the relationships I've shared thus far with everyone I've worked with, it's like I feel yeah, fine. Some people have become lifelong friends. I mean, like the protagonist of the book and her family. I mean, that family is now family to me and she's a very close friend and comes and stays with me and all of that. There are some others who might not be my close buddies. But yes, we stay in touch. There is, you know, festivals, etc. You wish each other or whatever. So just I think it's also I just feel that in some ways I'm very"

You are on your own. And not lonely, but on your own, rather. So in that sense, working on the book, didn't feel that very different. I mean, the research process was the same. I didn't do anything different. I followed the same processes, just that it became much more intense. The process of like my archival research, obviously had to be much more thorough, intense and long drawn out, wider than I'd done for a film. I don't need to do that much for a film which is at the maximum 120 minutes long, which has many other elements too. I think my greatest challenge as a while writing, and certainly in the first part, first phase, first few years, I'd say, A was to find my voice. I mean, as a filmmaker, over the years, you know, in some way, you fall, you get up, whatever, by just doing and you learn, you get a sense of what is working, what is not working, you get a grammar, you learn and as a film student, there's some basic grammar of the medium that one learned.

But also, then it was also diffused chances of easy identification. You know, people say, okay, but this is not like that in his family. And that's all done very deliberately.

And, and, and especially in the past five or six years, it was very obvious, you know, what was, you know, I could see it. I mean, I could see it, of course, at the level of, you know, what was happening around at a macro level and reacting, etc. But here I was dealing with a family and with my friend, who, you know, she's always, always been shamed, and, you know, victimized for identity. So fine, she was victimized for being a Tawaif. She left that far behind. It's leading, I want to reveal the book, but yeah, it's leading a certain life, which is very different. Book actually talks about it. It's, you know, very respectable life. How does she leave behind being Muslim? And now she's, she has to deal with being a Muslim in the India of today. And well, and also a single woman, you know, woman headed household with grandchildren, young grandchildren, it's a very vulnerable position to be in, especially in UP, to be in UP and in Banaras, to be a Muslim in Banaras. Although Banaras actually has a very sizable Muslim population, which is a very well kept secret. But it would strike me. And, you know, while I was writing the book, it really would come home to me because it was also the ongoing conversations. It was becoming more and more about her sense of identity as a Muslim then. And also this just completely, I mean, here is someone who I don't know of anyone, really I don't know of anyone who in her lived life and her practice, intensely a spiritual person, you know, there's a lot about Apa that I kind of go along with, but it's not that I fully understand because I'm not, I don't necessarily share that. But an intensely Catholic, you know, very Catholic in her belief systems completely. I mean, you know, the secularism, of course, means that you keep religion away from other aspects of life. But in the Indian context, secularism actually means when all religions are given that equal importance. She is the great one practitioner I know of that Indian version of secularism, you know, just genuinely, there's no bias, no prejudice, never. And I mean, come on, the person she had her longest relationship with, like her husband, her long standing love, was a Hindu. Her children had a Hindu come out of that union. So, I remember when, you know, in 2016-17, when the mob lynchings were at their peak, she's really perplexed. She just couldn't make sense of it. And she said, how can they do this? How do I explain to her, you know, this? And the point is that it's not happened overnight. The point is that there are, I think it's been, we might tend to now conveniently say, oh, 2014 was this, like, that's when things went bad. But I think the fact is, there's been a slide and there's for a very long time. I'd done an episode with Akshay Mukul on his book, The Gita Press, and this has been a strain in our society for decades. The Tawaf Nama, actually, people have commented. And I was conscious of it. I mean, it's not that I did it consciously. It's as much also a book about Hindu nationalism. And the fact that that dark underside of nationalism, which is Hindu nationalism, has always been present. It's just that, you know, it could, at certain ways, points, be balanced out. But it was always there. And almost as an extension of British colonialism. And then there's been a slide in, you know, I mean, especially from the 1980s onwards with the whole thing of opening up of Ram Mandir, you know, Ayodhya and all of that. I think that kind of, but it's not as if before that, it didn't exist. It was there. It was that darkness was there. You know, the so called non communal parties, they opened the doors for this, for them to come in and we are paying, all of us are paying the price for it today. And today, of course, I mean, the very existence, when she says she's panicked, she's paranoid, you know, this whole thing about not accessing courts and all. Now it doesn't hold because she is paranoid. She says, you know, about, she's been running around collecting every shred of paper about, you know, proving your identity. What do I say? You know, you boycott it. It's someone, she's one of the most vulnerable people."

It cannot be at an individual level, because, you know, they just, the people are just so, so vulnerable. You can't push them into, you know, this and can't hold here in front of that. So I mean, if there has to be a, you know, this civil disobedience, well, then it has to be across localities or communities, whichever way it works best. So yeah, I mean, I have, strangely, you know, this book came out, and then from since last year and been busy with the thing of promoting it and going through the thing. And it's been fun, but it's also the danger that we are all in, and which is looming in a way, because we, well, we are inured by many things, you know, class and all of that.
