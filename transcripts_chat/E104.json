        "message": "of evolve over time on i think so uh to begin with he was a racist so let's say from 1894 till for about a decade he came he was absolutely shaped by the prejudices of his class and his own race i mean indians are a very racist people not only in how they treat people within india i mean marriage ads are of course the most famous or notorious example of that but also the sense that indians are heir to a great civilization you know a great sanskrit civilization they've fallen on bad days now but they will recover their past glories that indians have built you know great glorious structures famous ancient cities they have elaborated the most profound and original philosophical theories they were once leaders in science and mathematics and astronomy so they are a great civilization in the same way as the west is a great civilization now there's a bit of parallels here though it's a bit of a digression but uh it's relevant the interesting parallels here between how hindus in late 19th and early 20th century saw themselves and how muslims saw themselves because muslims also thought they had to great civilizations i mean baghdad is the flowering of everything you know for literature philosophy music science i mean it's lamenting the loss of those great days and the west has come and the west has conquered us partly through our might partly to artifice and cunning but one day we will recover our glories and baghdad will come back and you know the gupta empire will come back you know so there's a very interesting parallels in the ways in which muslims and hindus thought of themselves as in theory equal to the europeans in the greatness of their civilizational achievement but in practice politically subordinated so not able to achieve or recover their true glory that should be their destiny now in this context the africans are ranked both by the muslims and muslims are the great pioneers of slave trade too you know in africa and by the hindus as the bottom africans are seen as someone who never had a civilization and what is unpardonable will never can never have a civilization so gandhi is captive to that form of thinking from the 1890s onwards now by about 1906 1907 he started organizing indians for collective action at this stage he is most skeptical of british proclamations he feels that the british have betrayed their promises they're treating indians harshly he wants to protest against them but his is still a movement of indians alone indian struggle is kept completely away from the question of rights for africans you can so there is a period in which gandhi is a racist which runs from what you know the time he lands for about a decade or a little more then there's a period in which gandhi starts viewing africans a little more sympathetically i mean if you read the accounts in indian opinion he's talking about discrimination against them i mean how they're excluded from certain professions how they're not allowed to enter the pretoria town hall so indian opinion is not he's not fighting for african rights but he is noticing for the first time that africans are discriminated against too by the colonial regime there's this unjustly neglected speech he makes in johannesburg in 1908 where he says every race can achieve full greatness so that the path to civilizational or national or cultural greatness is available to africans he's arguing that by 1908 now uh indian opinion is covering aspects of african discrimination against africans move a little further on 1910 11 uh he's interacting uh with the first president of the african national congress dupe uh there's another great leader of the african national congress pixley seme who visits gandhi in tollstoy farm african newspapers are covering his non-violent resistance and saying we should also organize in the same way but he still keeps his uh how do i put it his uh his movement separate from that from the africans but there is a shift in his position you know uh you know as we were discussing before that arguably there are four stages in gandhi's attitude to race there is the first stage where he's an unapologetic racist there's a second stage where you could call him a recovering racist because he is nuancing and rethinking his views there's a third stage where he's a kind of a lapsed racist because he no longer thinks in racial terms and there's a fourth state which is from about the 19 late 1920s on mid or late 1920s onwards where he's a principled anti-racist so you have to look at his career in the round i mean we'll talk about this is the maybe the second episode but through the 20s and 30s and 40s gandhi is consistently talking about discrimination against africans he's telling indians in south africa that they are treated much worse than you he's saying we must build a solidarity of all colored races he is taking a greater and greater interest in the african-american uh situation in the united states so you know he is growing out of his racism and i think that while acknowledging absolutely that he was a racist like many other hindus were at that stage and many other you know arab muslims were too at that stage you know the hindus of south asia and the muslims of central and west asia in the late 19th and early 20th century had a similar framework by which to analyze civilizations that arabs and indians are fully equal to christian civilization uh but africans are somehow you know not can never join that exclusive club so gandhi has that worldview but he outgrows it slowly you can say he's too slow in outgrowing it but certainly for the last two and a half decades of his career he's comprehensively outgrown in that he's a principal anti-racist so i think that whole arc has to be seen you know it's it's even someone like gandhi who writes so much and you live such a long life it's very easy to quote him out of context but as he himself says take what i said last also likewise with regard to science and medicine you know he's knocking doctors and allopathic medicine in his world in 1910 but in the 1920s he's praising uh how surgery can save lives so i think that's that's the way you must"
