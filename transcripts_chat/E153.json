Protests are ongoing across the country in response to this Government Citizenship Amendment Act, and the state is cracking down on innocent and defenseless citizens with incredible violence. The reports that have been coming out of UP, for example, are just horrendous. I had an episode last week with Srinath Raghavan that gave deep historical context to the notion of citizenship in India, the history of the NRC, the troubled history of Assam, the current consolidation of Hindutva, and student politics. I recommend you check that out. At this moment in time, all the focus is on the BJP's radical social agenda and all the dangers it poses for our nation. So why am I doing an episode on economics? Because I believe economics matters. People often think of economics as an arcane, abstract subject, numbers and graphs floating in the air above us that don't actually have an impact on people's lives. That could not be further from the truth. Everything in our lives is shaped by economics, and often by economic policies we cannot control, decided somewhere far off by social engineers who believe they can design society, influenced by special interests who are experts at redistributing money from the poor to the rich. This is not a problem of this government alone. For decades, we have suffered from bad economics, and the poor have suffered the most. Perhaps that's why we have even normalized it, and we take it for granted. But we must not. Bad economics"

One of the reasons that the BJP won in 2014 was a consequence of the bad economics of previous governments, especially the UPA right before it. Many people who voted for the BJP in 2014 did so assuming that they would not further the social agenda and they do economic reforms. Well, we can see what's happening on the social front. As for economics, at first they carried out no reforms at all. And then they progressively carried out what I can only describe as economic deforms, which only damaged the economy. I've had many episodes on demonetization and the botched implementation of GST, both of which basically helped devastate our economy. Those episodes will be linked from the show notes. In a nutshell, instead of helping to free our markets further, we now have less free markets and lower growth. Mahatma Gandhi once said that he would judge every policy by what impact it had on the poorest of poor Indians. And that is exactly my yardstick. It has been estimated that every 1% of GDP growth in India takes 2 million people out of poverty. If that growth goes down, it has a humanitarian cost. It's a human tragedy. And that growth has unquestionably gone down in recent years. In this episode, as the year draws to a close, I'm only going to focus on 2019. Where we started the year, what were our causes for hope and despair? And how have we performed through this year? My guest for this episode is Vivek Kaul, also known as the Shahrukh Khan of economics. Every time some news comes that has anything to do with the economy, there is an outpouring of requests on Twitter for Vivek's take on the matter. Vivek, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thanks Amit for having me. So as we are sort of, you know, one of the constant criticisms you get on Twitter from people is that Vivek, why don't you write about good news once in a while, it's always bad news, bad news. What's your response to that?"

And at least in the last few years, I mean, since demonetization happened, there is hardly been anything good to talk about. I mean, a couple of things notwithstanding, I mean, like, if you look at how the insolvency and the bankruptcy code has gone, it can be called sort of a partial success. I mean, despite the fact that it was launched with very little preparation, and the fact that our legal system wasn't really, you know, ready for it, it has managed to deliver a few good things, especially given the fact that some of the largest corporates who had defaulted on their loans, have lost control of the companies. And I think that is very, very important, because you know, more than the recovery, I mean, recovery is important. But even if recovery does not happen, and decent recovery doesn't happen, and corporates lose control of the company, the message that it sends across is very, very strong. So, in the years to come, any corporate who previously has been in the habit of defaulting on loans and getting away with it, will think more than twice, you know, before doing anything like that, because he's likely to lose control of his company. So, I think that's one good thing that's clearly happened in the last few years. The other good thing, again, I mean, this is not something specific to this year, but so, you know, up until a few years back, there used to be a funny home loan deduction that used to be available to the taxpayer. So, if you bought your first home, the total interest that you could take as a deduction was limited to around one and a half lakh rupees, which was later raised to two lakh rupees. But if you bought your second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or whatever your 10th home, the entire interest on your home loan could be taken as a deduction from your taxable income, as long as you declared a notional rent. And this was a huge tax saving device for especially for people at senior levels in corporate India. And I mean, the one thing that I never sort of figured out is was why should the government of India encourage people to buy a second, third or a fourth home? I mean, I can understand encouraging people to buy their first home and giving them a limited tax deduction. But so, so Arun Jaitley did away with that in one of the budgets. I thought that was also a great move. So, these are, you know, two good decisions that I can immediately think"

But the largest question I'm going to ask is, you know, as someone who's commented on economics for a decade and a half, what happens to the economy is often a consequence of decisions taken long ago, there's a big lag sometimes between an economic policy actually being announced and implemented, and then with the results of that being failed. And you know, one example of this, which people doubt is that some of Vajpayee's reforms, they started actually showing the effects only in UPA 1 and the UPA 1 gets credit for those numbers. And similarly, a lot of what has gone wrong with the economy today, in a sense started with the bad loans, so to say, the phono loans policy of the UPA 2 government, especially when Pranab Mukherjee was finance minister. And I of course, had a great episode with Pooja Mehra, which really elaborates on those sort of events in granular detail. And a lot of what is what 2019 started with a lot of what we have seen unfolding through 2019, and tell me if you agree, is essentially the inevitable consequences of DEMON and the botched implementation of GST. Like we thought at least I thought that DEMON, when it was announced, I thought on the same day that this is going to devastate the economy. But it took a while for that to actually happen. Or if it did happen immediately, it took a while for those numbers to come. But this year, there can pretty much be no doubt that the full consequences of the bad economic management of the last few years is now unfolding."

And because I've seen some of my friends struggle with it, you know, when you're running a small enterprise, and you start facing headwinds, you don't shut it down immediately, right? Because I mean, you started it, and that's the only thing you do. So it takes time for you to sort of realize that this is not working. Now, I guess that's, that's something that's happened because of one demonetization and the botched up implementation of GST. The informal sector and the smaller players in the formal sector have over a period of last two to three years, been facing a lot of pressure on the performance front. And that pressure is now, you know, starting to show and it's triggered into the overall broader economy as well. Yeah, I mean, I would agree with"

        "message": "that completely. And the thing to remember here is also that economists use a term called welfare shocks. And what is a welfare shock? What happens is that when something like demonetization happens, and, you know, somebody who's running a business on the margins in the informal sector, and remember, he's on the informal sector, not because he wants to evade the law, but because of the panoply of bad laws and regulations we have, which force many entrepreneurs into the informal sector. And if someone on the margins like that goes out of business, it is not the case that when the economy gets back, he can just, you know, come back and start the business again. Like, for example, I may have a business running two ACs, I can't afford to run two, I start running one, when things get better, I put the second AC back on. But that's not how this works. These people suffer what is called welfare shocks, where once they are done, they are completely done. And you know, they just don't come back, they're down for good, they just fall from that status level, they might go slip back below the poverty line, if that's where they came from. And the other problem there, and I'm also going to ask you about this, is that it's very hard for people to get a grip on it, because there is actually no data from the informal sector."

        "message": "Yes, so there's very little data that actually comes out in a formal way for the informal sector. But there are enough, I mean, if you look at a lot of the industry, small industry associations, they have put out a lot of data over the last few years, which tells you that a lot of small enterprises have been destroyed in the aftermath of demonetization and a botched up implementation of the GST. I mean, you know, a great example is a place like Tirupur, which used to be a global hub for producing t-shirts. And, you know, the mess that the city got into after demonetization is very well documented. And a lot of players operating in Tirupur were basically, you know, small players who sort of employed up to 50 people. So, you know, bits and parts of it are pretty well documented. Obviously, it's not documented at an overall economic level. Having said that, you know, the interesting thing is, you know, when demonetization happened, most corporates like the idea because what they thought was that the informal sector will now get formalized, and they will benefit because of it because their business will go up. But what they did not realize was that if the informal sector of the country gets destroyed, the purchasing power or the consumption power of people who used to work in that informal sector also comes down. You know, and that has also impacted the corporate revenues and earnings in a big way over the last few years. Another point I wanted to make here was that, you know, this and I mean, this is something I've said before, but it is important to say it again, is that over the years, you know, the informal sector in India has often been linked to the black economy, right? Which is partly true. Yes, I mean, people who are making money there do not pay income tax, but you also need to take into account the fact that a lot of people or in fact, most of the people who work in the informal sector do not make enough money to be paying income tax. So while the owner himself may be waiting on tax, you know, people who work there, I mean, they don't need to pay tax, but and they do pay tax, indirect tax, like we all do. So, so I think these are, you know, some points that people need to realize that nothing is all black, because, you know, ultimately, when black money is also spent, you know, the guy who earns it, at some level does pay tax on it. I mean, it's it may not be a direct tax, but he's definitely paying an indirect tax."

So it's not even three or 4%. But having said that, everybody pays indirect tax. No, I mean, if such a small proportion of people pay income tax in the country, what it shows is, one, the general poverty of the country, and two, the fact that our income tax department has really not been up to the mark and a bad tax policies, which, you know, at some level over the years have led to a situation where people simply they feel they're dealing in black"

And one of them Devanshu Dutta said, hey, please ask him about how much the phrase he used, I really liked it was a forced formalization, how much the forced formalization attempted by the government has contributed to this and forced formalization was, of course, the one of the stated intents of demonetization that bring the informal into the formal sector, to which another of my friends, Mohit Satyanand, and both of these guys have been on my show before.

But what has happened is that, while the informal sector has been destroyed, that business hasn't moved to the formal sector, simply because when the informal sector gets destroyed, you know, a lot of people lose their jobs, the purchasing power comes down. And once the purchasing power comes down, at some level, it does impact consumption. And that leads to a situation where corporates do not benefit from, you know, forced formalization. But as Mohit rightly put it, it's more of forced exits. So, which is what has happened in the last few years."

Now, we know that a lot of the numbers that the government puts out are extremely unreliable. And, you know, even with something like the GDP numbers, even if you take the GDP numbers, say at face value, and I had a long episode with Rajeshwari Sengupta on this where we discuss why they cannot be taken at face value, but going deeper into the problems with GDP as a measure itself. One of the things we agreed on, and one of the things which was debated when the GDP was first mooted was should it include government spending in it or not. And because you know, it was a measure implemented just before the Second World War, the decision that was taken, if I remember correctly, against the advice of Simon Kuznets, who in a sense was the father of the GDP, was that, no, let's include government spending in it. But the problem with that is that if the GDP is being used as a measure of economic growth, that is an incentive for the government in power to spend more because all that spend gets counted. And it may be ineffective spending, it may even be destructive spending. You know, like you would actually, you know, the GDP would grow if you simply, you know, build bridges and blew them up and just reiterated that forever, the GDP would keep growing. And what has happened? And like, do you therefore feel a need to pass these numbers more closely, especially the GDP and say, okay, how much of this is just government spending? And how much of this is society itself?"

        "time": "00:18:19.760",
        "message": "Okay, you know, so there are two answers to this question. One is, given the unreliability of the GDP numbers since January 2015, when we moved on to a new method, a simple way to get around that is to look at a broad set of economic indicators. Now, while those indicators may not give you this one number to come to a conclusion, like, you know, GDP does, it gives you a better feel of the way the overall economy is headed. So, I'll substantiate this with an example. So, sometime in late March, I think early April, not late March, I wrote this piece for the Mint, wherein I said that India is getting into a consumption slowdown, okay. And so, when I said this, a lot of people didn't buy it, but then that's that's a different story for another day. But, you know, the way I caught it was simply because, you know, I looked at car sales, I looked at scooter sales, motorcycle sales, moped sales, tractor sales and commercial vehicle sales. So, six kinds of vehicle sales for different sections of the society. So, car sales, a very urban phenomenon, motorcycle sales, both rural and urban. Scooter sales, primarily more urban, more women. Moped, obviously, you know, for people who cannot buy bikes and scooters. Tractor sales, rural rich. And commercial vehicle sales, basically, you know, a good indicator of whether investment is happening in the economy or not. So, all the six indicators had fallen, okay. And this hadn't happened in five years. I mean, I had data for five years, it may not have happened even beyond that. So, what that told me was that there's something which is not right. Now, the GDP data would have never caught on to something like this, right. So, that's one part. So, you have to obviously, you know, if you want to do serious economic analysis, you can't rely on just one indicator, you have to look at multiple indicators. You have to look at government indicators, you have to look at private indicators, you have to look at theoretical constructs like the GDP is like the inflation is and you also have to look at high frequency, you know, economic indicators like car sales, and two wheeler sales and so on. So, that's one part of it. The second part is government spending. So, one exercise which I always carry out and that again has helped me quite a lot in getting the, you know, the economic scene right is, see, GDP has four constituents, right. Primarily, you have consumption expenditure, which is the major part of the Indian economy, with close to around 58-59%. Then you have investment, which is down to around 28%, 28-29%. Then you have government expenditure, which varies anywhere from 8 to 12%. Now, it's like close to 13%. And you have net exports, which is exports minus imports and is negative in the Indian case. So, a good thing to do while analysing GDP numbers is to just get rid of government expenditure, okay. Subtract that government expenditure from the overall GDP number. And what you get is non-government GDP. I mean, you can call it private GDP, you can call it whatever you want to, but or actual GDP, or as Kuznets GDP, because that's how he would have made it. That's how he had imagined it. That's how he wanted it. So, if you look at that number, that gives you a better indication. So, like, if you look at the first six months of 2019-20, the GDP growth is 4.8%, whereas the non-government GDP growth is 3.8%. Wow, that's a big difference is 100 basis points. And that brings me to the point that I try making all the time, but nobody really seems to get it is. So, you know, whenever an economy is in trouble and not just Indian economy, economists want the government to spend more money. I mean, this is something that comes from John Maynard Keynes. But what Keynes had said, and I mean, obviously, I mean, I call it the bastardization of Keynes. Keynes had essentially called for savings during good time, and then spending that money in bad time. Now, obviously, no government saves money. I mean, all of them run a fiscal deficit. So, now, if you look at data for the last three years, the growth in the Indian economy has been driven largely by government expenditure. So, the government expenditure in 17-18 increased by around 15%. And these are real GDP growth numbers not, you know, adjusted for inflation. So, government expenditure went up by 15% in 17-18, around 9.3, 9.4% in 18-19. And in 19-20, I think, in the first six months, it's grown by 12.7%. So, the point is, you know, it's not like so the government is already spending a lot of money. And that has been driving the GDP growth number. I mean, as I said, if you take out government expenditure from the GDP, the growth this year is 100 basis points lower. Now, the question that no one seems to be asking is, and I also don't have a sort of a correct answer for this is that, where is this money going? Right? Because if they're spending this money, it has to go somewhere, you'd want to see some of it come back in the economy and create some kind of, so where is this money going? Now, I have a sort of a theory on it. And so, a lot of this money essentially is going towards buying rice and wheat, you know, which the Food Corporation of India buys and distributes through the public distribution system. But if you look at FCI data, you will realise that the organisation stores much more rice and wheat than is required. So, in that way, we're basically buying rice and wheat from large farmers, giving them that money. And then that rice and wheat is essentially rotting in the go downs of FCI."

Now, the example I used in the speech was slightly different. I mean, I had compared four lane highways with the amount the total amount of money that the government has been spending in order to recapitalize public sector banks and to keep them going in the last few years. So between 1718, 1819 and 1920, the government would have ended up spending close to 270,000 crores to keep these banks going. So which basically means 27,000 kilometres of four lane highways,"

One is beyond the obvious point one is just a simple moral cost of government money itself. Every rupee that the government has is coerced from someone that carries a moral cost, the person it is coerced from, which is some taxpayer who is buying a bar of soap or salt or whatever, that taxpayer could have found an alternative use for it, which would have contributed to their welfare. And surely which they would know more about than you would that's that's one."

        "message": "Let me just take this forward. So where is this money to recapitalize government banks coming from? It's been coming from the excise duty that we pay on petrol and diesel. Okay. So in that way, every petrol and diesel buyer in India direct or indirect, I mean, indirectly, we all buy petrol and diesel, right? Even though we may not have vehicles, but let's say we go to buy, you know, vegetables somewhere. So that cost of transport is built into the price of that vegetable, right? So indirectly, all of us are essentially paying a sort of a premium. Every time you know, we buy anything to bail out the public sector banks in India now. So there's another angle to it. Now the angle is, India produces very little of the oil that it consumes. Okay, we import close to 85% of the oil now. And at the same time, you know, our exports have sort of fallen over the years. So one of the things that people regularly talk about, and especially when it comes to, you know, low value exports, in order to get them going, you need to let the rupee depreciate. The problem with letting the rupee depreciate is the moment you let the rupee depreciate, your petrol and diesel prices start to go up. Okay. Now, one way of ensuring that the petrol and diesel prices wouldn't go up is by cutting down the excise duty on it. But the moment you cut excise duty on it, how do you finance the recapitalization of public sector banks? So the moral of the story is that I mean, the direct effects in economics are very, very obvious. But it's the indirect effects, which actually hurt the economy more."

To continue with sort of the two part point I was making very quickly about government spending is one, of course, that all government spending carries a moral cost because of the coercive effect of acquiring that money, which is why whatever you which doesn't mean that government should not exist, we need it. But before we needed to protect our rights to begin with, but before you recommend any kind of government spending on anything, you have to firstly justify that moral cost. Now, assuming that you do that, the next step that then comes is you have to think about the opportunity cost of that spending. Like you just gave a great example of it Vivek, when you spoke about how the 8000 kilometres of four lane National Highway, but essentially, the opportunity cost can be anything if the money just stayed with the people it was coerced from, in the name of taxes, they would spend it in their own lives, it would be their consumption. That is also a cost, there is also a crowding out effect of such money, and various kinds of indirect effects as you know, of which, you know, you just give one excellent sort of example. So, you know, like you just said, in March, you wrote this piece about how there's a consumption crisis and nobody believed you. In August, I recorded an episode with our friend Mohit Satyanand on, I mean, the episode was called to economic crisis 2008 and 2019. And at that point, people were still in denial that we are in a crisis. To some extent, but I think there's a slightly greater awareness that higher crisis."

But, you know, it's not just because of that. I mean, so there's a very long answer to this question. And I think there are two answers. So the first part, where the global excuse has been used over and over again is essentially when it comes to our exports. And, you know, when it comes to exports, the exports of India have sort of fallen from around 25% of the GDP in 2011-12 to around 19.7% in 2018-19. Now, you know, as I keep saying over and over again, you know, no country in the history of economic development has gone from being a developing country to becoming a developed country without a successful export sector. Okay. I mean, maybe India has some new model brewing, but at least it's not happened up until now. And also, I mean, if you look at our two previous growth spurts between 92-97 and 2003 and 2011, that was, I mean, I wouldn't say largely driven by the export sector, but the export sector played a very important role in it. Also, the export sector tends to create a lot of jobs for what we call the MSMEs, you know, micro, small and medium enterprises, which have traditionally provided around 35-40% of goods exports. So, it's very, so, you know, so it creates a lot of economic growth. Also, within the export sector, sectors like textile, okay. So, textile is a very important sector because it creates jobs for women. And especially given the fact that our female labour force participation rate has fallen dramatically over the years, where, which basically means that lesser and lesser women who are a part of the workforce are actually going out and working. Now, the excuse that has been offered in case of the export sector is that, no boss, it's a global phenomenon and blah, blah, blah. But that's not true. So, I mean, so recently, Dr. Shankar Acharya, who, you know, he's a senior economist and a former chief economic advisor, he wrote in a column in the Business Standard and I quote, so between 2011 and 2018, India's goods exports increased by only 8%, okay. In sharp contrast, Vietnam's exports grew by 154%, Cambodia's by 114%, Myanmar's by 82%, Bangladesh's by 61%, the Philippines by 40%, and even China on such a large base by 31%. So, obviously, what this tells you is that our export sector has been unable to compete internationally. And that's the long and the short of it. I mean, you know, obviously, you know, the global slowdown has some sort of a impact, but largely our exports have slowed down because we are unable to compete internationally. And, you know, I mean, to compete internationally, I mean, this is very, very obvious and cliched and has been said over and over again, reforms are required on the land, labor, capital,"

Now, even, you know, for competing within the country, the entrepreneurs need to pay a fair price for electricity and freight. Now, the cost of cheap electricity right now in India for farmers is borne by the industry. Along similar lines, railway passengers are subsidized at the cost of freight. The taxes on aviation fuel have ensured that air cargo rates in India are one of the highest in the world. So, I mean, these are fundamental anomalies which need to be set right, and they cannot be set right overnight. And on top of this, we have a GST services tax system, which is in a mess. Now, in fact, Kelkar and Shah have a very interesting point in the book where they say that 80% of countries which introduced the GST after 1995 have opted for a single rate GST. And this is a fundamental point which our lawmakers do not seem to get. I mean, you know, we are still stuck in sin goods and it's not, you know, it's about the overall simplicity of the system. So, I can understand two rates, but the current, you know, paraphernalia is, in fact, now we have a funny situation wherein the GST on inputs, a lot of inputs is greater than the GST on the final consumption good. So, because of that, a lot of companies are getting refunds. And so, it tells you this is the problem of launching a system, you know, and wanting to give a bhashan at midnight and claiming that it's a big victory without really planning for it properly."

So, the truth is that, out of the many episodes I have done on GST on the scene and the unseen, the first one was before GST was implemented with our good friend Devanshu Dutta and Devanshu identified exactly the problems that have eventually turned out to be problems. Everything was foreseen, not just by Devanshu and me, but by all good economists. But this government, of course, does not value expertise as we have found out again and again. Moving on from this, you know, another sort of very interesting point that you made in your speech and that harks back to a book that both of us have been reading and talking about, Narrative Economics by Schiller, is about how the mentality of consumers can lead to vicious cycles in the economy which just keep it going more and more further down. And you've used a historical analogy of this with the Great Depression of 1929. Can you can you elaborate a bit on that?"

        "message": "Sure. Before I talk about narrative economics, I think Robert Schiller is this one economist who gets these broad predictions right. I mean, very few economists get, you know, as the old joke goes that economists predicted nine out of the last five recessions. So Schiller got the 2000 stock market bubble right and even got the real estate bubble of 2008. Right. So in narrative economics, he basically sort of the core point of the book is that how the narratives that human beings create in their heads and in their lives, essentially end up impacting the overall economy. So the example he gives is that of the Great Depression of 1929. And I'll quote him. He says that in the four years after 1929, GDP per cent, which is per capita income, went down by a catastrophic 20 percent. It's not called the Great Depression for nothing. But at the same time, the sales of new cars of by the Ford Motor Company fell by 86 percent. So per capita income went down by 20 percent, but car sales went down by 86 percent. Obviously, there was a disproportionate impact on car sales. Now, the question is, why did that happen? Now, you know, during the Great Depression, close to 25 percent of the American labor force lost its jobs. They became unemployed. The absolute number was around 13 million. Now, what happened was what this told you was that everyone knew someone else, you know, someone in the family, some close friend or a relative who had lost a job. So this created what we can call the psychology of the slowdown. Right. So the bigger problem during the Great Depression was not I mean, obviously, you know, people who lost their jobs had a problem. But the bigger problem in the minds of people was the fear of losing a job and not being able to find another one. OK, because everyone knew someone who had lost a job and was just sitting at home and doing nothing. And this started to influence their consumption decisions. So like Schiller writes, and I quote him, some people postponed buying a car or other major consumer items and which led to a loss of jobs in the auto and consumer products industries, which led to more people postponement, which led to a second round of job losses, and so on for several years. Now, so it essentially, you know, the psychology of the slowdown had set gotten into the minds of people. And that created a bigger problem over the years. So what happens is a lot of people talk about this in a very, you know, sort of a nondescript manner where they say, oh, it's all in the mind. I mean, boss, when it gets into the mind, it becomes a bigger problem than the"

        "message": "cut back on the lifestyle. And that creates a vicious cycle. And so what that does is, you know, when the consumer confidence goes down, the business confidence also falls very, very quickly. So it's like, you know, like, Mr. Modi recently made a speech, I think, at the 100 years of Asocham, which is a business lobby, and asked the industry to invest. Now, the problem is, you know, I mean, you can ask the industry to invest, but the industry is not there to, you know, for social service, right? So the industry will invest when people will consume, because when they put money into something, they're looking for a certain rate of return, which is higher than their cost of capital. I mean, the capital may be equity, it may be debt. And in a scenario where the consumers are not interested in consumption in the same way as they were in the past, expecting industry to invest is problematic. I mean, there is there's a problem with that argument. I mean, as a government, you can only sort of set a series of reforms in place and encourage the industry to invest. Now, whether the industry invests or not is, you know, depends on the industry when the government cannot do much about it. So anyway, so once the consumer confidence goes down, the business confidence also goes down very, very quickly. And when the business confidence goes down, you know, tax collection becomes a problem, which is exactly how things are playing out in India. I mean, if you look at the I mean, I have data for the first seven months, I remember the tax collection, the gross tax revenue of the government has gone up by around 1.5, 1.6%. Whereas in the budget, it is assumed to go by 18%. So that tells you, I mean, if there is one data point that you need to look at, to sort of convince yourself that there is an economic slowdown, this is it, because this is government data. And it is a high frequency economic indicator published every month. It's not a theoretical construct like the GDP is. So in this scenario, and obviously, you know, all of these points are understood by the politicians of the day. Now, in 1929, what happened was that the American President Calvin Coolidge tried to talk up the economy by, you know, saying things like all is well, and you know, the stock market is doing well, and stuff like that. So, you know, you had public officials, businessmen, journalists, all trying to talk up the economy. And there is this, again, there's this something that Schiller writes in his book. And he says that this led one observer to quit because everyone was being so positive about the entire thing. Unfortunately, there appears a strong tendency among writers on business subjects to put out nothing but optimistic statements, and to avoid all discussion that might be construed as pessimism. I mean, I can vouch for the fact that, you know, one of the leading business dailies in the country, or rather the leading business daily in the country operates exactly like this. So their feeling is that if we keep saying all is well, ultimately, all will become well. So because they believe they're so influential. So now, if you sort of look at it, you know, if you compare this to what has been happening in India, the situation is slightly similar, obviously, we are not in a depression, technically, we are not even in a recession. Recession is when the economy contracts for two consecutive quarters. So we are growing at a slower rate than we were in the past. So we are a part of a slowdown, or what former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan called a growth recession. So the moment he called it a growth recession, you know, a few smart people on Twitter commented, how can the words growth and recession be used one after the other, obviously, they do not understand that, you know, economists have terms for various situations. This is a jargon which Rajan was using. And growth recession is essentially a situation where economic growth is slow. But the economy is in contracting, to be called a technical recession. So basically, your growth is in recession in the sense what was growing at 7% that became 5, became 3, that's in the growth rate is in recession. At the same time, the unemployment is going up. So anyway, so we are in a growth, you can call it a growth recession. I think Arvind Subramanian has called it a growth slowdown or something like that, you know, we can keep arguing on the name, but that's not important. Now, you know, even in India, you know, our ministers or policymakers, government, journalists, television channels, have all tried to talk up the economy. Now, I think my, the statement which obviously became most famous was the one that Nirmala Sitharaman, wherein she said, the finance minister, she said that, you know, car sales have fallen because millennials are buying Uber and Ola. I think for a finance minister of a country as big as India is to make such a juvenile statement was sad. And this is like, you know, the government has access to, you know, so many people in the Indian Economic Service, it has access to so many think tanks. If such a statement was to be made, you know, there had to be some research evidence backing it up. Okay. Also, it's like, you know, millennials have been around, the poor guys keep getting blamed for everything, but they have been around for a while now, right? And so have Uber and Ola. So it's not like millennials were not there in 2014, 15, 16, 17 and 18. And Uber and Ola was also there. So why was it that millennials stopped buying cars because of Uber and Ola only in 2019? Right? I mean, so there are basic logical holes in what the minister said."

They are smarter because they invite you to gift talks. No, I mean, so it's not, it's not like that. So I mean, so you can see you can make out the smartness of a group by the kind of questions they ask you, right? And so everywhere I go, and I mean, I talk to millennials, I think there's nothing, I mean, wrong with them. I mean, they may have a different approach to life, they may have a different approach to learning, like one of the beautiful things that I sort of learnt at the IIM in Vishakhapatnam recently, where I had gone to talk, where the professor just said he's Vivek Kaul. And he said, I won't introduce you because these guys have already googled you and they've seen your YouTube videos. And, and I was like, yeah, I mean, this is how this generation operates. And otherwise, what would have happened is in any other scenario, he would have introduced me for five, seven minutes, and then I would have had to crack a joke. And, and we lost the first 10 minutes of the class here, within the first minute, I was talking what I had gone there for. So they had done their homework, it was just done in a different way, wherein, you know, in our generation would have probably dug up, read a book or whatever these guys are, you know, they have their ways. So, so getting back to what we were talking about, so other than Nirmala Sitharaman, the other, you know, the statement that was made was by Ravi Shankar Prasad. And he said that on 2nd October, people spend 120 crores watching three movies, Joker, War, and Saira, Narasimha Reddy, Chiranjeevi's big release. And he said, so where is the slowdown? Okay. Now, you know, in a country like India, whipping up a big number is never really a, you know, it's not, it's not a problem at all. But you also have to see where that big number fits into the overall scheme of things. So if you look at the projected GDP of India during for 2019-20, I mean, this is the GDP, which is on which all the calculations have happened in the budget, which was presented in February last February this year, not last year, we are not yet into 2020. So the GDP forecast is around 211 lakh crore, okay. Private consumption is around 58-59% of the GDP. So at 59%, I think it works out to around at 125 lakh crore, okay. So if you divide that 125 lakh crore by 365 days, so the average consumption expenditure on any given day in India is around 34,250 crore, which obviously will be a little higher on a day like October 2, because it's a holiday, long weekend, and people go out and spend on these opportunities. So now imagine 120 crore as a part of 34,250 crore, which Indians anyway, spend on a given day. So the percentage is around 0.35%. So, you know, you have to look at the broader context before you go out and say things. And the funny part was, he later said that I have withdrawn my statement. Now, how do you this is something I've never understood. How do you withdraw something you have already said, you can either say, I stand by my statement, or you can say"

So, and so then, you know, so there are these points which keep getting made, wherein someone picks up a part of the whole, and then throws that number at you and then asks you this question, where is the slowdown? So, the other example that I love giving is on cars. And there are these two cars, car companies, I should say, which are doing very well this year. One is the Korean company Kia Motors, and then I think the other is MG Hector. So, these cars, companies have sold a few 1000 cars. And every time you say there is a slowdown, they say, but what about Kia Motors? So, I did a very rough calculation. And so, I'll sort of read out these numbers. Kia Motors has sold 40,845 units this year. By this year, I mean April to November. MG Hector has sold 11,401 units. This is between April and November. In total, 11.49 lakh cars have been sold this year. So, Kia Motors and MG Hector form only 4.5% of the total cars sold. The total car sales during the same period in 2018, stood at 15.35 lakh. So, from 15.35 lakh, we have fallen to 11.49 lakh, which is a drop of 25%. So, so clearly, there is a, you know, I mean, you can always take one data point and you can cherry pick and yeah, and see, it's like the example I give these days is let's say India grows at 10%. I mean, let's say, I'm assuming here. Now, obviously, there will be parts of India, like let's say, Karnataka. Karnataka may grow at 15%. But Bihar might go at 4%. So, that does not mean that there is no problem in just because India and Karnataka are growing at a higher rate does not mean there's no problem in Bihar, right?"

My new podcast, The Book Club by Amit Verma begins in early January exclusively on Storytel. This is a weekly show that I run for a year. Every week on The Book Club, I will recommend one book that I enjoy reading. And I will speak about what it brought to me and why you should read it. You can use my show to take random recommendations yourself or you can start a reading club of your own using my show as a starting point. I'll discuss all genres of fiction and nonfiction. And hopefully together, we can understand the world a little bit better. Coming soon, The Book Club by Amit Verma, only on Storytel. Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with my good friend, Vivek Kaul, the Shah Rukh Khan of economics, the doomsayer of Twitter, about, you know, economics in India in 2019. And you know, one of the things I learned as a cricket journalist, because I started at Wisden and then Cricinfo and so on, is that look, everybody's watching the match and the basic commodity of the information, the news, what has happened, people know. So when you're writing about the match the next day, for example, you should have a lot of analysis and go deeper and have more color and all that because the bare facts everybody knows. But the thing is, you know, with the economy, I'm not sure if we even know the bare facts, because it is such a complex subject, and there is so much rhetoric around. So I'm actually going to ask you for the bare facts. How did our economy actually do in 2019? How does one sum it up? What is your match report?"

So basically, you know, what has happened is that, I mean, as I've said before, the private consumption expenditure is by far the biggest part of the Indian economy. And it constitutes around 58-59%. And the growth in private consumption expenditure peaked way back in 2011-12, okay, you know, at 17.5%. And after that, the private consumption expenditure growth has largely seen a downward trend. But it has always managed to grow in double digits. And this has basically ensured that India has continued to grow."

Now, in 2019-20, for the first time since 2004-05, the private consumption growth has fallen into single digits, and it's been around close to 7%. I mean, nominal 7, not adjusted for inflation. So, the question is, why has this happened? Okay. The answer for this lies in the fact that our household savings and our net household financial savings have been falling in the last few years. Now, what do I mean by this? The net household financial savings are essentially, you know, fixed deposits, insurance, mutual funds, small savings, etc., minus the liabilities that people have sort of accumulated over the years. So, the household financial savings peaked between 2008-09 and 2010-11, when they were greater than 10% of the national disposable income in each of the three years. Okay. After that, they have been falling and in 17-18, they reached a low of 6.5%. And this has primarily happened because financial liabilities of people have been growing, which basically means people have been borrowing more. Now, what does this tell us? It tells us that the consumption growth, since it's peaked in 11-12, has been financed more and more by people borrowing more. Okay. So, the borrowings have essentially continued to finance our consumption in the last 7-8 years. And that story is now unravelling. Now, other than looking at the\u2026"

Now, what that tells you is that other than borrowing, a greater proportion of the income is being spent towards consumption. So, which again explains why people are saving less and using that money to consume more. Now, the question again is why are savings falling? Okay. And the answer for that lies in the fact that our income growth has also slowed down in the last few years. In fact, the per capita income growth peaked way back in 2010-11 at 16.9%. And I think since 2014-15, the growth rate of income has been in single digits. Okay. And if you look at the income tax data, it tells you that between assessment year 12-13 and assessment year 18-19, salaried income has grown at just 4.5% per year. So, what that tells you is that if you adjust for inflation, the salaried income has actually come down. Rural wages for men, you know, sort of grew at 28% in 13-14. Since then, they have grown in single digits, with the growth in 18-19 falling to just 3.8%. Wow. And this is again nominal terms. If you take an inflation, it's gone down. And all nominal. The same is true for the rural wages for women. So, basically, because the income growth has slowed down, people have used a greater proportion of their income to consume, because of which their savings have come down, and they have also borrowed to consume more. Right. So, all this was essentially financing Indian consumption since the consumption"

        "message": "No. So, which is what I mean, I was coming to. So, basically, now, the question is, why has the income not been growing? The income has not been growing primarily because if you look at the investment to GDP ratio, that also has been falling over the years. So, the investment to GDP ratio peaked in 2007-8 at 35.8%. And in the last few years, it's varied between 28 and 29%. Now, just to give you a few data points, which essentially show you how bad the situation is. In 2010-11, the new investment projects announced were worth 25.7 lakh crore. In 18-19, this was down to 12.1 lakh crore or 46% of the earlier year. During the first six months of 19-20, new investment projects worth just 2.04 lakh crore have been announced. So, this tells you how bad the situation is on the investment front. Now, this is a scarier number because announcements are okay. I mean, people announce all kinds of things. When it comes to investment projects drop, the situation appears to be even more grim. In 10-11, the investment projects worth 4.04 lakh crore had been dropped. This jumped to 20.74 lakh crore in 18-19. During the first six months of 19-20, projects worth rupees 7.9 lakh crore have already been dropped. So, basically, what has happened is that investments haven't sort of grown at the rate they were expected to, because of which there has been an impact on income growth, because of which there has been, you know, people have consumed a greater part of their income, and they've also consumed by borrowing more, and because of which our consumption growth sort of, you know, which should have slowed down dramatically earlier did not slow down. And all this is now sort of coming together. Now, the problem is you might ask that, you know, why are you saying this now and not in 2018? The problem is that a lot of data in India is not available quickly enough. So, if you look at the financial savings data numbers that I'm offering now, were not available back then. So, the numbers were available only as of 15-16, and then 16-17. And the trend was not very obvious. But once the 17-18 data came in, the trend became very, very obvious. So, basically, you know, as our current chief economic advisor keeps saying, investment ultimately finances consumption. Consumption can only finance consumption up to a certain extent, because it is investment, which creates economic activity."

And it's a virtuous cycle. What we are in now, as you also described eloquently before, this is a vicious cycle, where people are consuming less and less.

I think it's very, very important to talk about this. So, you know, the first time I sort of encountered this term was sometime in 2006, 2007, when I used to be a journalist covering personal finance for this newspaper called Daily News and Analysis, which shut down sometime back. And I used to have to cover these new mutual fund, equity mutual fund schemes being launched. Now, obviously, there was no difference between once, you know, all the schemes were the same, you know, they'd probably go and buy stocks and make money for the investors, hope to at least. So, all these press conferences used to have a presentation made by a fund manager. And all the fund managers used to have what I started calling the IDD slide, which is basically India's demographic dividend. Now, demographic dividend is essentially a period of few decades in the, you know, in the life cycle of a country where the workforce increases at a faster rate than the overall population. And this happens primarily because the infant mortality rate over the years, which is basically the number of babies who die before the age of one comes down dramatically. Now, as these people enter the workforce and find jobs and you know, make money and spend that money, the economy grows at a faster pace because of that millions of people get pulled out of poverty. And it's happened in all the countries which have gone from being developing to becoming developed countries have had, you know, demographic dividend play a role in it. Now, in India's case, we were told back in 2006-7, that a million Indians were entering the workforce every month, okay, which is around 1.2 crore a year. And this is when our female labor participation rate is low. You know, if a majority of the women start entering the workforce, this number could go up to at least 2 million a month, not 2 million a month, but around 1.8, 1.9 million a month easily. So, now, so obviously, you know, there had to be, you know, jobs had to be created for these people. But given the fact that, you know, investment isn't really happening, the kind of jobs that had to be created for these people haven't been created. And because of that, you know, now you have all this unemployment data coming out, which is very, very scary. So, you know, you had the National Sample Survey's offices, periodic labor force survey, and according to which the rate of unemployment among 15 to 29 year olds was at 17.4% in 17-18, having jumped from 5% in 11-12. Now, the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy puts out more recent data, and they say that the rate of unemployment in January 2017, among 15 to 29 year olds, 20 to 24 year olds, and 25 to 29 year olds was 27.3%, 21.6%, and 8.7%. In November 2019, the rate was at 40.9%, 39.2%, and 10%. So, there has been a huge jump. At the same time, the labor force participation rate has fallen. So what that basically means is that a lot of people who could not find jobs have opted out of the labor force. And even then, the rate of unemployment has gone up. I think Dr. Ratan Roy, who is the boss man at NIPFP, if I remember correctly, made a very interesting point in a recent interview. And I think this all of us should have this data point in our heads. And this is coming from Dr. Roy, I mean, who's, you know, as nonpartisan as one can get. Not from Dr. Debra Roy. I mean, we need to differentiate between our Roys and"

What really happens is that with every passing generation, the amount of land holding within a family keeps going down. Because if you have two kids, your land is halved, if you have three, it is one third and so on down the generations. And why you have so many landowning castes across the country, Jats, Partidars, Marathas, agitating for reservations in these numbers is because agriculture is simply not a way for them to make a living and they need an exit. And because our sort of industrial policies and our policies regarding land and labor still haven't been modernized, unfortunately, the sort of generation of jobs that should have led to this demographic explosion actually being a dividend simply hasn't happened. I mean, when we talk about you have 1 million people coming into the workforce every month, and therefore you need to provide jobs for them. Provide jobs is the loose way of putting it. The point is, it's no one's job to provide jobs, you know, a government is not going to provide jobs, it can only create the conditions in which the natural creativity and entrepreneurship of people can thrive. And then those industries will happen, those jobs will happen. The truth is that those conditions have never for the most part existed. Yes, you know, the 91 reforms did help a little bit in terms of liberalizing product markets, but not factor markets, not land, labor, and so on.

So it's already, Andhra Pradesh has done it, the Maharashtra's new three party government in Mumbai is talking about it. Now, I think this is basically a race to the bottom and puts the entire idea of India at stake. You know, if we cannot even move around in the country to get a job, then you know, where does that leave us? Also, you know, this is also gets us into the touchy subject of migration, right? Because within a country, people are bound to move from parts which have less economic activity to parts which have more economic activity. And migration is by far the quickest way of reducing inequality, okay. So if that is not allowed to happen, and you know, it's it's a very tricky situation. Now look at Andhra Pradesh, it's a new state, right? I mean, and it needs a lot of investment. So how do you get that investment? I mean, companies come and establish factories and offices there. Now, would you expect a private company to go to a state which insists on hiring local labor? Or would a company go to a state which lets you know, hire the best people available for the job, right? Now, so the point I was trying to make, you know, I think I said this somewhere in I think in Bangalore only where that, you know, imagine if in the late 70s and early 80s, the people who ran the IT policy of Karnataka, even if there was anything like that, I would have said that only Karnatikas have to be hired, right? Or only people who are local to let's say, Karnataka, I mean, they may not be Karnatikas because Bangalore is full of Tamilians, as well, and even Telugus. So would the IT companies have come to Bangalore and established as many, you know, companies as they did, or even take the example that I remember here is when Indian School of Business first came to India, or rather when the idea was mooted, it was supposed to be established in Mumbai, what happened was that the Maharashtra government wanted 20% reservation or some such number for the local population, which is an end Chandrababu, when I do saw this as an opportunity, because Hyderabad had just started coming up at that point of time, and ISB in Hyderabad would have been this trophy project, which would sort of attract a lot of global attention, which it did. And he just seized on to the opportunity and just, you know, and ISB ended up in Hyderabad. So my point is that, you know, how will it will be interesting to see how will companies react to this? Also, how will politicians react to this, because it's very easy for a politician to just say, okay, we'll reserve jobs for locals, you know, that again, I mean, it brings us back to how you know, what we were talking before we came to the studio to record this episode as to how governments and politicians like to put out simplistic things, right? So okay, there are jobs are a problem, okay, we'll not let migrants come in. But is that really the solution? No, because ultimately, what you want is economic activity, right? And when migrants come in, I mean, they do create economic activity, lots of it, in fact, I mean, they spend money, they eat, they rent homes, they go out watch movies, in fact,"

And I've in fact, had I had a great episode with Chinmay Tumbe on his book, India moving, which, by the way, I think is a great book, one of the most underrated books of the year, which talks about just internal migration without India and its effects. And I want to elaborate a bit on this question of simplistic narratives. And then come back to you with a question after that, which is that, I mean, what has always been the case, but what we've seen more of over the last few years, as populism has grown, is that these simplistic narratives, finding a certain popular validation, for example, one of the things that distinguish Trump from say, Hillary Clinton, when he was standing against her in 2016, was his use of powerful, simple narratives to explain the problems of the world. For example, he said that, why are there no jobs in middle America, two of the simplistic explanations he came up with, one, immigrants are coming and taking away your jobs. And therefore, let's stop immigration, let's send the Mexicans back. And two, outsourcing is bad, your jobs are being shipped overseas. So you know, let's stop shipping jobs overseas. Now, both of these explanations are completely wrong. But both of these are very easy to understand and get behind in a rhetorical sense. Similarly, you've pointed out how in our cities, people will often say, oh, there's a jobs problem. It's migrants are coming and messing it up. They are also a problem in the culture and blah, blah, blah. Let's stop migrants. Let's give jobs to locals. I mean, one simplistic narrative that I see coming up in the days to come, and Modi has alluded to it in his speeches, is the population problem, which is not really a problem in my view at all. But because you know, there is a jobs crisis, I expect him to blame it on our growing population and propose population control measures such as only two kids per family, which will of course, which he expects to hit Muslims disproportionately, because that is a rhetoric that they have more kids than Hindus do, which is not exactly true, though it is true that the poor have more kids than the rich do, and the Muslims tend to be disproportionately poor.

Because you know, one of the basic fallacies that people tend to hold about economics and society is that more people are a bad thing. That is not the case. People are what the economist Julian Simon called the ultimate resource. People bring in more than they take out. I mean, a classic illustration of this is that look, all migration happens from rural areas to cities, from places which don't have so much population density to places of very high population density. The most prosperous parts of any country are its highly dense cities. Why do people migrate to them? Because more people means larger economic networks, more opportunities, better markets for whatever goods or services or talents that they might have. And you can point to say, a Bangladesh or an India which are poor countries and say, look at the population density. But you can also point to a Bahrain or a Monaco which have a greater population density and are far more prosperous. So in that sense, population isn't a problem at all and of all people, our current generation of leaders who grew up during emergency should realize that. My second point, which is a slight disagreement, is I don't think we've got here the right way."

Now, the explanation is much simpler to sell than say something like incomes have risen at a slow pace, and hence people have not been spending money, or the fact that they don't have much confidence in the economic future, or the fact that they have over borrowed in the recent past, or the fact that India's so called demographic dividend is collapsing, or the fact that investment in the Indian economy is collapsed. I mean, these are all proper nuanced, sometimes difficult to understand arguments, right. And you know, in our daily lives, in our busy lives, we are basically looking for pointers.

And for people who haven't, you know, read my columns on this before, I quickly want to clarify the point Vivek was making about inequality and poverty that I think in India, our key problem is poverty, because the pie is not fixed. Inequality is not an issue we should worry about simply because as what happens in developing countries like India, and the data shows this, is that as poverty goes down, inequality inevitably goes up. It doesn't mean the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer or staying poor. Everybody is getting richer, except the rich are getting richer faster, which leads to increased inequality, but which also leads to people coming out of poverty. This is also, you know, people moving to cities is also an illustration of this because cities have far more inequality than towns do. And yet people come there because that is a way to get out of poverty. So India's problem is poverty, not inequality. Inequality has become a fashionable term and a lot of people when they complain about inequality, they are at they actually mean poverty and poverty is our moral imperative. That's what we have to solve. And the kind of policies which would tackle poverty and inequality are very different and almost opposite in some cases, which is why I feel that that's distinction which otherwise seems merely semantic is important."

So he gave an idea, kill all sparrows, right? That's his attempt at saving crops. But what happened was that the fragile ecosystem went completely out of whack, the sparrows were killed, and insects, especially locusts proliferated and the crops were destroyed anyway. And it was a massive economic disaster. Now, what this tells you is that a certain kind of social engineering on such a grand scale is flawed, even if you cannot predict exactly what will happen, people may not have known the ecosystem so well to know that if sparrows are killed, locusts will destroy the crops. But simply because there are all these massive unintended consequences, that you should keep your interventions as small and local and measurable and reversible as possible all points which Kelkar and Shah make in the episode you'll hear next week.

That's a comparison I then made and which Kelkar and Shah also made in this book that such grand attempts at social engineering always fail and yet, we have this engineering mindset all around us, where people imagine that because they can design a machine or they can run a company that they can actually design an economy and construct a society and that simply isn't possible, it is always bound to fail and has led to nothing but heartbreak and misery every time it's been tried through the 20th century by both the left wing and"

        "message": "The RBI in the Indian case through the Monetary Policy Committee decides on. So they decide to sort of either raise or, you know, decrease what is called as what is called the repo rate. So repo rate is the rate at which the RBI gives loans to banks. So Shaktikanta Das led RBI has cut the repo rate by 135 basis points from 6.5% to 5.15%. The hope was that banks would also cut interest rates as the RBI cut the repo rate. Now, what has happened instead is that if you look at the weighted average lending rate of banks, instead of going down, it's gone up. So it's gone up from around 10.35% at the beginning of the year to 10.4% I think as of October, if I remember correctly. So now what has happened? I mean, this is something that a lot of people are baffled about. And you know, what you need to understand here is, again, if you're the kind who just reads Times of India, you will see that every time there is a repo rate cut, the next day the headline that is run is repo rate cut, home loan EMIs, EMIs, whatever, vehicle EMIs to come down. But that's not how it actually works. Now, how does a bank operate? You know, a bank borrows money from all of us, and then it lends money at a higher rate. Now, if you look at the cost of borrowing, which is primarily through deposits, so if you look at the cost of borrowing of term deposits of banks, it's gone down slightly in the last, since the beginning of this year, it's gone down by around 12 basis points. And the RBI has cut rate by 135 basis points. So unless the cost of deposits come down, the lending rate on loans will not come down. I mean, this is as basic as it gets, the RBI can keep cutting the repo rate. Now, why is the cost of deposits not coming down? Now, if you remember what we sort of talked about earlier, I had said that the financial savings, the net financial savings of India as a whole has come down in the last few years. And I explained as to why it has come down. Now, in this scenario, banks, in order to encourage people to save, need to offer them a good rate of interest, so they are not in a position to cut interest rates, or not as much as the RBI wants them to. The other thing that has happened, and a lot of people don't seem to know about this, is that the overall public sector borrowing, and by this, I mean, the real deficit run by the central government, these fiscal deficits of the state governments, the borrowings of organizations like the Food Corporation of India, this has gone up over the years, I mean, it used to be around 8% of the GDP, now it's more than 9%. So in an environment where the financial savings have come down, government borrowing is going up. So in this environment, expecting interest rates to fall is a little silly, okay. So now what does this tell us? It tells us as to how intricately linked everything is in the economy, right? I mean, you know, it tells us as to, given the fact that India has gone the way it has, where investment is not happening, because of that consumption is being financed through savings. And because consumption is being financed through increased savings, you know, savings have fallen. And because of that, banks cannot cut interest rates on their deposits. And because of that, they can't cut interest rates on their loans. It's all, you know, in economics, they used to teach the vicious circle of poverty. India is poor because India is poor. So this is sort of, you know, the vicious circle of India's lack of economic growth. I mean, if we can call it that. So this is something that, you know, has to be tackled. The only way it can be tackled is through increased savings, right? Now, how will people increase savings? One is if they consume less, but if they consume less, it hurts the economy, right? So the way to increase savings is essentially to increase incomes. Now, in order to increase incomes, investment has to happen. For investment to happen, the government has to create the right conditions. Also, before that, the consumption slowdown has to unravel, because businesses won't invest until, you know, consumers start consuming. So to sort of solve that problem, you know, one of the things that the government could have done is to cut down on the personal income tax rates, but they chose to cut down on corporate taxes, which helped no one because it just helped push up corporate earnings, and money did not end up in the hands of people who could spend it. So yeah, I mean, so this is basically, you know, how intricately linked everything is. And at times, it's not the solutions are not."

The other sort of thing that struck me was how you pointed out that everything is so intricately linked, which is also why people in government imagine that with public policy by using different levers, one lever here, one lever there, they can influence the process, not having the humility to realize that the process is so deeply complicated that every intervention has unintended consequences, and therefore, you're better off sticking to certain first principles."

I mean, as I say, over and over again, is how do you solve a problem without admitting to it? Right. So, I mean, so unless you do that, I mean, yeah, I hope in 2020, they see, I mean, they lose a few more elections, and finally, some sense comes in."

And you know, one of the things I think about in these troubled times is that what will save us is art, like, I look around me and not just in the protest movements, but even in general, the quality of cartooning has just gone to a new level, because there is so much happening that is so surreal that, you know, comics have so much material to"

And he wrote some of his best poetry under the dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq. And a couple of his, you know, famous poems, one is called Main Nahin Manta and the other is called Hukmara. It's essentially about intellectuals who kowtow to the government. And he'd written it on this other big Pakistani poet called Hafiz Jalandhri, who had essentially become an advisor to Ayub Khan. Anyway, that's different. But what I'm trying to say is that, Habib Jaleeb would have been proud with the kind of protest poetry that's coming out now, especially the one that, you know, Varun Glover,"

I think the despair is obviously what is happening all around us and the fact that the media has been so subdued. In fact, you know, one tends to get more news from what people share on the social media now than the real media. I mean, like the other day, there was this huge march in Dharavi, I mean, which barely made it to the newspapers, whereas it was there all over the social media. So that is the huge and the fact that so many educated people, so many people in my immediate, you know, some of my best friends, immediate family, by this entire idea of NRC and, and the citizen amendment thing. So I find that very, very disturbing because, I mean, when the people you're closest to believe in these things, I mean, how do you talk to them? Or more than that, why should you talk to them? Forget how do you talk to them? That really is disturbing me. The hope obviously, at the end of the day, as I've always said, is the people of India, because I mean, and that's been shown in the last few days, where people have actually come out, you know, against what, you know, Modi and Shah have been trying to do. And so that gives you hope and you know, the funny thing is, and I was just thinking about it the other day that, you know, when Modi made this speech in Delhi, and he said that, whatever he did about NRC and the fact that, you know, Amit Shah had sort of contradicted it over and over again. So I was I was just wondering, you know, has Narendra Modi also reached a stage where he's become the mukhota of the BJP?"

Lies is when you care about the truth, you acknowledge the truth, but you choose to deliberately deceive somebody by lying. Bullshit, it has no relationship with the truth. You don't care if what you are saying is true or untrue. You just say it at the spur of the moment, because it sounds good. And it's a thing to say. And this is true for a lot of things Donald Trump says on Twitter. And once of course, having come up with some spontaneous bullshit, he will always keep doubling down on it. But I think of, for example, Modi's speech as like, of course, it was full of untruths. But was he lying? Or was he bullshitting? And that's, that's a question I'll leave it to listeners to answer. Any final comments? You did not mention what gives you hope?"
