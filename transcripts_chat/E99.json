Trump in the US, Erdogan in Turkey, Orban in Hungary, Modi in India. What do they have in common? Well, the author Jean-Werner Muller wrote a book a couple of years ago where he pointed out a number of things that populists tend to have in common. I wrote a column on the book for the Times of India, which is linked on the page for this episode. One of the things he pointed out is that populists tend to try and consolidate their power by undermining the rules and institutions that otherwise act as a check on them. These rules and institutions are the subject of our show today. My guest on the show is Amaya Naik, who is a lawyer and policy analyst, a graduate of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and a former research scholar of the Takshashila Institution. He also writes regularly for the magazine I edit, Pragati, at thinkpragati.com and is one expert in foreign policy I have a lot of time for. But before I get to my conversation with him, let's take a quick commercial break.

Ameya, if you know if you ask young kids at the age of 10, what do you want to be when you grow up and they'll say all kinds of things, you know, they want to be astronauts or they want to be rock stars or they want to be even engineers or doctors if they're too influenced by their parents. Very few people kids say hey, I want to grow up and be a policy analyst and I want to specialize in international relations. How did you get into all this? So if you asked me at 10, I'm guessing my"

I guess I read a lot of like, it's like thrillers, but more about negotiation and diplomacy than about spies and shooting. That was one part of it. So like not John le Carre, but Morgenthau. Yeah, there's fiction to be had in the diplomacy space as well. I did a bunch of like debates and model UNs and things in school and I remember just being you know, the experience of playing diplomat for a day was fascinating enough that I was like, this might be what I actually want to do with my life. In India, that's not necessarily the easiest thing to do because you sort of have exactly one professional path, which is get into the foreign services. And so I sort of spent college and law school trying to do that and didn't quite make it and then had to look around and be like, okay, so now if I want to study this professionally and find other ways and other places to do it, how do I go about that?

And one of them, which all of these people we named have have in common is that they immediately start attacking and eroding institutions. And it's almost as if you know, guys like Trump believe that democracy is all about elections. And that's it, you win that particular beauty contest, and you're king for five years and nothing else matters. But actually, democracy is a lot more than that, as much as the act of the people expressing themselves through voting. It's the you know, the rules and institutions matter a great deal. Why is that?

Whether it's machines doing them or humans and so on and so forth. None of those are trivial decisions. But zoom out to sort of the big philosophical question, right? In a sense, what you're asking is, do we need governments? And why do we need them? And I would say, yes, we need them.

It begin as protection rackets. And then we've, you know, figured out how do we rationalize it and then how do we bring it under control?

Tilley's essay is famously war making and state making as organized crime. And it's right. It's sort of the function that it served was, hey, I'm a feudal lord. I'm going to stop other feudal lords from raising you. And Olson's book, in fact, was called Stationery Bandits. Exactly. But let's make a distinction here between sort of the historical reason that governments evolve. Absolutely. And the theoretical function that rules or institutions serve, right? And so on the latter on the on the theoretical function that they serve, it is precisely that if you let the guy in power do whatever he or she wants, then that person is going to do things that are good for them and not necessarily for the people in whose interest they are supposed to be acting. And the reason that Axelrod's work is just so defining of the field is because he shows that if you actually play out that game and by the way, he did this by mailing a version of that game to a bunch of people and asking them to play it. There is a clear superior strategy that emerges. That strategy is what he calls nice tit for tat. Right? Start by assuming the other guy will play by the rules. If they don't punish them as you go on punishing them, that sort of devolves into a situation where clearly you're not able to work together. If they do continue cooperating and as that builds up, it goes beyond the point where you're just building trust between those two people related to that interaction. That trust itself becomes a valuable commodity that can be used to do other things."

Right? And then one of the monkeys is taken out and a new monkey is put in. This new monkey has no idea about this cold water thing. That monkey starts walking towards the ladder because hey, fruits, the other four will jump and pull it back before it gets anywhere near the ladder because they know what's going to happen. Then you have three old monkeys, two new monkeys, two old monkeys, three new monkeys, four, five new monkeys, none of which have experienced cold water and yet they pull each other back, but they know that there's a rule.

In a game that's played out long enough with enough trust builds out, the rule actually takes on that sort of existence of its own. You know, if you read like Fraser's work in sociology on like the evolution of religion, for instance, it's precisely that first it's the divine that's sacred, then it's the rules that you have to follow in interacting with the divine that becomes sacred. Eventually, you know, the divine is forgotten, but the rules and the people who enforce them still have sacred authority. You could substitute government for sacred authority there if you like. Right. The church is one form of government in itself. And the government is one form of religion. And the government is a form of religion in itself as well. So as I said, one thing that happens is that the rules take on a life of their own. The other thing that happens is that there is a sort of social and political capital that emerges. And somebody who's a reasonably talented political entrepreneur can say, here is this other risky area where we haven't really solved this cooperation problem yet. But you know that you can trust me from this other arena. So come let's try and do this here as well. Right. And this is a development of alliances as a concept over a period of time. And so what you get is you get these rules that stand on their own and then you get these institutions that are built on a shared understanding of the rules and on a shared set of values that, you know, are the philosophical equivalent of we don't go near that ladder.

Like, not every country had to go through the collapse of the Soviet Union to decide that fully planned system of government was not necessarily a bright idea. And so there is an element of vicarious learning that goes on as well.

For example, you had the Constitution that was really your set of rules and you had the First Amendment protecting everybody's free speech and blah, blah, blah, all the way down the line. And all of that kind of falls into place. But in sort of other states across time, like if you look at India's formation, what we really did was we adopted a hodgepodge of rules and laws from everywhere. We kept a lot of the colonial rules that had been formulated in the first place to suppress a populace. And you know, the rules and institutions for that reason in India aren't so robust and aren't so liberal, as for example, they are in the USA evolved differently in different places. So what are those sort of do those processes move in a particular direction necessarily? And can we pass a value judgment on the process?

But clearly, from what we see, I mean, so again, the caveat is that more and more as we get into the 19th century and the 20th century and the 21st century, states are not evolving and societies are not evolving in isolation, right? The most closed societies on the planet right now are North Korea and Eritrea. Even those states are not sealed off from the world, right? Part of how Eritrea makes its money is by taxing overseas citizens. They are able to collect that tax because they threaten family members of those people who are still within the country. Protection racket. But protection racket in its simplest form, right? But international, right? And so, the more that the world itself is interconnected, the more that these institutions are interconnected, there's something like a tipping point that comes about, right? So, the way that the institutions and the rules will evolve is still distinct within each country. But the range of possibilities that it can hold are getting progressively constrained. They're falling within a certain band of things that other countries share, and especially post the creation of the UN that they have formally stated a commitment to sharing. There is a Declaration of Principles that starts the UN Charter as well. The first of those is that every country is a sovereign equal and nobody shall intervene in its domestic matters. But historically, even that is quite the exceptional commitment for a country to make, right? And clearly, many countries have failed to abide by it, even since the adoption of the UN Charter. But it's no longer really open to a country to say, you know, as part of our constitution, we're going to say, we espouse the virtue of territorial conquest. It won't fly."

And she wrote an op-ed about this somewhere at the midpoint of the US presidency, which was titled AUOMFG. So she smushed together AUMF and OMFG. Just to say, how far are you going to stretch this authorization to like, you're in 17 countries when you said that it shouldn't even be two, right? And Obama's sort of dodge on this was, I'm going to authorize drone strikes, but I'm not going to deploy. So have you heard the phrase boots on the ground? Yeah, of course. I'm not going to deploy boots on the ground. And you know, this got roundly mocked in Washington, they were like, cartoons of like, you know, people doing like, Tom Cruise Mission Impossible style hanging from a wire and like, my boots are not touching the ground. And it's just an example of there were probably more productive ways to handle whatever threats there were to American national security at that time, right? But they would have required the executive and the Congress to work together. But Obama found himself in a situation where having once said, no, look, it's within my power to decide you gave me the authorization, I'm going to target these guys, whatever these guys are, I can go. If he walked that back, he'd have to walk back everything else he wanted to do as well. Right. And so it was no longer in his interest. He became a strong"

If you think about it, if the outcome of this was basically that for like eight years, no laws were passed, I can imagine that people would sort of be like, okay, this is no longer working. We need to change this. We need to either like mess with the majority margins that are involved. Or we need to make one or the other party be bound by the decision of the other, right?

Trump fits that classic populist mold that you know, John Werner Muller wrote his book on and that I referred to of a populist who's come and you know, he shares all the things that populists tend to have in common through the ages and in the world today in the sense that they have this sense of victimhood and they are ranting against the elites and they are constructing all these simplistic narratives and they are breaking down institutions. And the interesting thing about Trump is that this works at two levels. One, it works at the domestic level where there are so many institutions and there is this constant interplay and like you pointed out, he's not the first person to have, you know, tried to push those boundaries. But it's also more worrying at the international level because the US is simply still the reigning superpower in the world. And, you know, one mad guy on top who is trying to undermine all the international institutions and rules which do a lot of good is extremely dangerous for all of us."

They exist so that people in power will serve the public interest. And so sort of the, you know, almost rule zero of government is avoid conflicts of interest. Right. Right. Trump is like, Trump actually shares that opinion about we should not have a conflict of interest, but he's, you know, he's flipped it on its head. So he comes in saying, what is the conflict, I'm going to pursue my own personal interests, national interests be damned. And it's, it's pretty amazing.

And so there's just so many ways that this plays out in the domestic space. Right. So the most obvious one, again, has to do with just making money. There is a clause in the United States Constitution that has suddenly sort of like nobody used it, nobody heard about it. And then in the past couple of years, it sort of made its way back into public discourse. It's called the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, right. It's roughly the same as like the Office of Profit Act that India had. It basically said, if you are a functionary of government, you should not be making money on the side. The Emoluments Clause is a little more specific. It says you should not be accepting money or anything of value from a foreign government. Right. But foreign government is pretty broadly defined, right? Like it's, it's also agents and representatives of a foreign government, counters from a foreign government. Things of value is also fairly widely defined. It's not literal money. There can be various things that would be useful. This is why there are like protocol vetted and approved gifts for state functions, right. And this is why any senior like an ambassador or whoever or whatever, if they receive anything, they have to like report the gifts that they get. If it's above a certain value, then it's actually, I mean, confiscated is too harsh a word, right? They voluntarily surrender it. And it's either like given to a museum or something, or it's put into this big auction and the proceeds are used towards, you know, whatever, like a widows and orphans fund or something. Trump owns multiple commercial properties around the country. Around the world. He actively promotes them. The shining example is the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, which was renovated and reopened right about when he became president, and which has been booked out by foreign governments ever since. Right. And of course, this is money going into the president's pocket. Of course, people are like booking large venues and like keeping it booked into like stay in his good books. He has golf courses around the country. He has whatever that holiday resort is in Florida that he keeps escaping to as well. The name escapes me for a second.

Right. So here is a term that I will generally not use because I think it gets abused a lot, but I'm going to use it of Jeff Flake. He's virtue signaling. He really is. Because he has the ability to vote differently. But he sort of furrows his brow and says, this is a very sad thing. And then he votes for it. And he's not even running for re-election. His seat has now been taken over by somebody else. Right. Or will be. Sorry, his seat is falling vacant and somebody will be appointed to it in the near future. So Congress is a check, iffy, right? With the Democrat Party taking control of the lower house may start being more effective as a check. It's possible. The judiciary has been being a check in many ways. Absolutely. The problem, so there's a little bit of a tangent, right? But if there's listeners who are sort of interested in the comparative legal system between India and the US, one of the biggest differences between the US and India when it comes to litigation, especially litigation against the government, is that the US has extremely strict rules on standing. Standing is who actually has the right to bring a lawsuit. Right. So we have phenomenally lack sort of PIL style standing, right? If somebody somewhere is harmed, you as a civic minded citizen can sort of approach the court saying, look, somebody is being harmed, violation of fundamental rights, please do something. Right. And different judges over the years have sort of had their own attitudes towards this. In the US, the rules are a lot stricter. You have to typically show that you, the person bringing the suit, are experiencing some kind of harm. And it can be even more complicated. You might have to show that, say, for instance, you're not actually a national of the country, you might have to show that even though you're not a national, you actually have the right to approach that forum because the nature of the harm that you're facing offends the right that is not guaranteed just to nationals or just to citizens. It's guaranteed to like all people who happen to be within the territory of the country or something. So you could bring a freedom of speech action even as a non-citizen, because that's not limited to citizens. It's guaranteed to everybody in the country. You might not be able to bring a right to bear arms action. Right. And so suing the federal government in the United States is actually a lot harder than suing the central government in India. That said, a number of Trump's policies have landed up in court. Right. He revoked a reporter's press pass a couple of"

It's a very, very live debate about whether the Democratic Party, having gotten a measure of power, should respond to Republican or Trump hardball tactics in kind, or whether they should sort of model a different kind of behavior. I would say Obama tried this as well for a while, right? He tried to model Trump's sort of consensus model of decision making. And at some point, he was just, I think he said something to the effect of like, you know, you can't dance without a partner or something like that. And at least on a certain set of issues, stopped trying. So yeah, one possible outcome is that all like the general nature of politics in the United States becomes coarser and more divisive and more aligned to groups and more aligned to what some theorists, although again, I disagree with this characterization, but what some theorists will describe as identity politics, it's possible, because it's the classic, it's the domestic political equivalent of the security dilemma, right?

But the other area also that we have to touch on when we talk about like dismantling treaties and the trade wars is in nuclear nonproliferation, right. And so the Iran nuclear deal that he's pulled out of, which was sort of the, you know, the landmark achievement of nonproliferation of the past decade. I did an episode for this with Pawan on the Pragati podcast before. Trump basically pulled out of it on the grounds, not that the deal was not working, but that it was not stopping Iran from doing other things that he didn't want them to do. Excellent. Right. Which again, sort of negotiation 101 is that you hive off issues. Yeah. And then you reach agreement on things that you can and you kick down the road the things that you can't. And then you cooperate on the things that you do when the trust builds up. And then you're actually able to re-imagine a solution to the things down the road because now you trust each other more.

A very simplistic version is that Trump is going amazingly soft on Russia. Right. Again, apply Occam's razor, apply Hanlon's razor. A range of explanations emerge. But the fact that territorial aggression is not being punished and other countries can consider it hugely destabilizing and damaging. Again, not something that we'll see play out immediately, but potentially down the line, somebody else who decides that they want to be adventurous has the Russians to point to and has the fact that the world sort of acquiesced in that. Right. Or has Trump's actions to point to as proof that the world has acquiesced in it, which is not at all a positive development. The other is non-proliferation. Right. And non-usage and like steps towards denuclearization, independent of any specific thing that's been done. Right. Let's just say this is the very last subject on which you want someone who is zero-sum, short-termist and uninformed by science to be in charge of things. Right. The potential for disaster is enormous to the extent that actual proliferation does continue, which is a very real threat because the North Koreans have shown that they are extremely willing to sell nuclear technology. They're an extremely poor country. This is one of the most valuable things they can export. If they get the opportunity, they'll try. Anybody who's willing to buy nuclear science or material from the North Koreans is almost by definition someone who should not be getting their hands on nuclear materials or science. And if the US sort of has this blas\u00e9 attitude towards North Korea of like, no, the president and your leader met and like they worked out a deal and they now they have a love story or whatever it is, then it's going to be hard to keep track of those things. So that's my two for security. Economic, I would split into, I mean, look, whatever we have to say about the trade war is still inadequate, right? Like it's just so harmful on so many levels."

And the WTO is the basis of one of the rarest and most valuable kinds of things in international law, which is an agreed forum for dispute resolution. So if that loses its effect, right, to be fair, the US is a very spotty track record of actually complying with WTO rulings and enforcement in the first place. Right. But I mean, this is the difference between Obama or some other president saying, I'm going to find a loophole that lets me do this, but that keep the optics right. And they'd still be seen as upholding the role or the value of the institution. Right. And Trump just sort of being like, they took our money. Yeah, they were rude to me and whatever. And so we're not going to, oh, sorry, I actually have to backtrack and add one to security. NATO, the fact that he's like, so averse to NATO that he claims that NATO is like taking American money so that it doesn't spend on defence, which is not a implausible interpretation of the collective defence agreement. It's just that that agreement doesn't really mean that European countries have to pay money to the United States, right, to loop back to where we started. It's not that kind of protection racket. And Trump had to be cornered into saying something that should be just like, like a casual statement for any US president, which is, we believe in Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which is the assurance of mutual self defence. And he resists it, he fights every time because he doesn't want to say I'm willing to come to the defence of, in fact, he says the opposite. He's like, why should I care if like X country in Europe is being targeted? Right. And like, of course, it's not about X country. It's about the value of the existence of this alliance.

But so on economy, China trade war, WTO, migration, right? Like we should not lose track of the fact that one of the major ways that global flows happen and that value moves around the world is through people. Right. And Trump is clearly trying to build Fortress America that like people cannot actually get into that multiple levels, whether that's like asylum and refugee policy, whether that's like labor migration, whether it's migration by skilled workers, whatever. And again, if he just does it in the United States, arguably, like the people who could have gone to the United States lose out, obviously, the United States itself also loses out. The danger is that other countries either retaliate or take it as a precedent, right, which is not implausible at all, right. When he when he first brought those travel bans, one of the things that he said was these will apply even to dual citizens who have one of their citizenships from these countries.

And if you're not allowing someone who's a French citizen into the country, you know, in theory, the French are supposed to like suspend access for US citizens into France. Right.
