        "message": "Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadma. Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen, my guest in this episode is the economist Tyler Carvin. Though describing him as an economist seems inadequate, Tyler is a polymath who blogs at Marginal Revolution, which is by far my favorite blog in the world, and he's written numerous books on a variety of subjects. He also runs a Marginal Revolution University, MRU, with his Marginal Revolution co-blogger Alex Tabarrok, who has been a guest on the Scene and the Unseen a couple of times. The subject I invited Tyler to chat about is his latest book, Stubborn Attachments. This is not actually a book of economics, but of moral philosophy. In a nutshell, Tyler makes a number of bold assertions in this book. One, he argues that we need to regard future lives of people who haven't yet been born as morally equivalent to the lives of those alive today. We should not discount those lives at all. Two, he argues that for this reason, aiming for high economic growth is a moral imperative, as that will lead to the best outcomes for future humans, and so we need to build institutions and social norms that maximize the chances of achieving sustainable high economic growth. Three, he says that we should do all of this within the constraints of human rights, which he defines to be negative rights. This conversation with him was recorded in late December 2018, but before we get to it, let's take a quick commercial break. Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings by the artists you like hanging on your walls? Well, worry no more. Head on over to IndianColors.com.

Tyler, my friends and I have a theory that there isn't actually one Tyler Carvin, it's a collective that calls itself Tyler Carvin because you actually get so much done that it seems impossible one person could manage it all, you write multiple posts a day on Marginal Revolution, you've written 15-16 books, you obviously read so much, you immerse yourself in other cultures, you travel, you've written a book about food, so you eat out a lot, and you teach. So I'm really curious, how do you structure your days? Like, what's a typical day in the life of Tyler Carvin like?"

That would be my account of what value is. And I thought, well, you know, a book like this, I can't just finish it in two or three years. I've got to work with, I'll need to think about for a long time, talk about with many other people, see, you know, much more what has been published on the topic. So just every year, I would spend about a month revising. And this book kept on changing. A lot of the time, the changes were just me cutting things. And finally, it's come out. So I'm very happy about that. But a lot of my books are these like longer term investments. You know, my book on food, I didn't spend that long writing it.

So the countries that measure as having the highest GDP really are the countries with the highest living standards. Maybe the oil monarchies would be somewhat of an exception to that. But if you look at the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway, those are the places where people want to migrate to if they can, and they're the places with high GDP. So I think the measure works surprisingly well. It doesn't mean that money is all that matters or even the main thing. But as you mentioned, GDP correlates with having a more secure life, lower levels of stress, a more rewarding or safer, more creative job, many, many other non-monetary goods."

The second of those about civilizations being more stable is more something that would appeal more to conservatives and environmental problems more to left wingers.

And in the hunter gatherer rage, it's you know, you're going to survive longer if you think of the short term imperative of surviving rather than think 10-20 years into the future. So one, people think automatically in the short term. And two, when you think of the political economy, if you just look at what the incentives for political parties are like, every party just gives a damn about one thing. They want to win the next election, they don't really care. I mean, just to take an example from India, which is going on these days, is that it has now become the rigor for any party which wants to win elections, to offer farm loan waivers to farmers. And farmers, of course, are I mean, we are in the middle of an agricultural crisis, farmers are in great distress, it's completely natural for them to ask for farm loan waivers. And it's completely natural, therefore, for the supply side of the political marketplace to promise them those farm loan waivers. And rationally, everybody can sort of say that, look, this is not really good for the long term, what we need to do for the long term is we need to do structural reforms and blah, blah, blah. But there's no demand for that in electoral politics. Thinking of the long term just doesn't come naturally either to individuals, and it doesn't make sense to politicians to cater for it. So even if people agree with you at a rational level, that yes, this is how we should think to be moral beings, how does that find expression in actual action?"

Something like that never would have or could have happened in the 70s, 80s, or even 1990s. So I think I'm optimistic. But you know, there's not a set answer. It is up to us. And a lot of countries, they get wealthy, and they grow sloppy in their thinking. And that's what's happened in America."

Because what we sort of see in India, and no doubt across the world, but, you know, with reference to India, is that there is this constant vicious cycle of the past being invoked. For example, a few hundred years ago, a Mughal emperor, you know, broke a temple here allegedly and built a mosque. We must now break the mosque and build a temple, which is something that the right will say, or the left might say that, you know, Group A was oppressed by Group B. And therefore, we now have to switch the oppression and recompense from it, which is a thinking in a very zero some kind of way. And B, it opens the gate for identity politics, which just vitiates the hatred between people and doesn't help us move past that."

We've been running this thing for the last few weeks and we're going to keep doing it. If you are listening to an interesting show that you're enjoying, pause it, take a screenshot, tag us on your Instagram story and drop us a comment and we will post that to our own Instagram story. So I want to tell you about a new show that we're launching. It's called Gana Tantra. It is hosted by Surya Natarajan and Alok Prasanna Kumar. They discuss how politics goes beyond intriguing elections and its implications in everyday life. I think you'll really enjoy that. Also starting on the 4th of February, we're launching a new show with Ambi Parmeswaran. It's called The Sponge Podcast. He talks about all the invaluable lessons he learned from his 40 years of experience in advertising. Speaking of Ambi, he's also on the Filter Coffee podcast with Karthik Nagarajan this week. They discuss the importance of data and advertising. It's a really, really insightful conversation, which I think you would enjoy. On Sider Says, we have author Mopia Basu, who talks about her new book on the Rani Ujjansi and clarifies some historical misconceptions held about Indian history. On Pesa Vesa, Anupam talks to Ashok Kumar, CEO and co-founder of Scriptbox about the importance of tax planning and the effective ways in which you can save tax. On the Pragati Podcast, catch special guest Ambassador Shiv Shankar Menon in conversation with Pawan about the importance of connectivity on a geopolitical scale and the economics behind it. Here's what's in store for you on our regional language shows. On the Hindi show Puliya Bazi, the hosts do a deep dive into Dr. Ambedkar's most famous yet controversial essay, The Annihilation of Caste. On the Hindi film show Cinemaya, director Paromita Vora joins Swati to talk about her documentaries, her directorial decisions and the politics behind camera. And with that, let's get you back to your show."

Well, you know, I don't think it's true that Stalin killing people boosted Soviet economic growth. But the point I want to make in the book is not to argue that fact with people, but just to show that killing innocent people is wrong. You can have an absolute prohibition against it. You don't have to think we should do that to get economic growth, that you have morals and you have the practical benefits of growth. And the right way to think about the world is to combine those two things and think of human rights as a constraint that you should operate within."

I mean, the whole idea of negative rights is that you don't go by what the majority wants, but you protect the rights of every individual. And the whole, the sort of classical liberal vision of the state, I would imagine comes from accepting that you do need a state to protect rights, and therefore that calls for a necessary infringement of rights.

I would say when it comes to economic growth, we often know a great deal about how to thwart it. But it's much harder to have very exact knowledge on how to stimulate it.

And one of the things that he tangentially wrote about there was the thrust towards family planning and population control in India, which, you know, took place over a period of decades and was driven by Americans like American institutions like the Ford Foundation, were actively talking about coercive family planning. And at one point, the American government itself made aid conditional upon the Indian government carrying out family planning policies. And of course, this was magnified massively during the emergency. But leaving that aside, coercive family planning continues to this day, and is based as I know you would agree with me on, you know, flawed Malthusian principles and, you know, looking at human beings, not as resources, which they are, but as a problem and the damage that this sort of thinking caused, at that time was, you know, had enormous consequences. I mean, there are millions of people who would have been born and would have lived fulfilling lives who simply don't exist. And that seemed to me, you know, since it just happened yesterday, it seemed to me to be a great example of how, you know, consequentialism can go dramatically wrong, because all of those people were acting out of good intentions.

I think it's much easier to say, well, look, this is wrong. It's coercing people. We just shouldn't do it and leave it aside.
