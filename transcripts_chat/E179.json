One of the saddest things about the way ideologies are formed in our modern times is that personal freedoms and economic freedoms are treated as two separate things but I believe that they are at their heart the exact same right and the exact same expression of our autonomy as human beings. Many people especially on the left give personal freedoms such as the freedom of speech the respect they deserve but not so much economic freedom and it is often vice versa on the right and in India these distinctions of left and right don't really apply and most political parties don't give either kind of freedom the respect they deserve.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the case of street vendors. People sell on the streets because people want to buy from them. Every voluntary transaction leaves both parties better off and so society benefits from this exchange and yet our street vendors are routinely harassed and exploited and preyed upon and are often too powerless to fight back. My guest today to speak on this subject is Prashant Narang, a lawyer and legal expert who works at the Center for Civil Society in Delhi which has fought for the rights of street vendors in India for many, many years. Before we begin our conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break. Are you one of those people who not only loves to read but also wants to write better? If so, I have something for you. Since April this year, I've been teaching an online course called the art of clear writing. Our webinars spread out over four Saturdays in which I share whatever I've learnt about the craft and practice of writing over 25 years as a professional writer. The course also contains many writing exercises, discussions on email and WhatsApp and much interactivity. It costs rupees 10,000 or 150 dollars. You can check out the details at indiancut.com slash clear writing. This link will be in the show notes. If you want to bridge the gap between the thoughts in your head and the words on the page, then the art of clear writing might be just what you need. July batches begin on Saturday, July 4th. So hurry and register before then at indiancut.com slash clear writing. Prashant, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thanks Amit. So Prashant, you know, before we sort of get to the subject at hand, tell me a little bit"

My family is also a family of Punjabi refugees, grandparents migrated from, you know, some parts of Pakistan in 47, 48. Prashant was really a partition child, because he was born here, but probably conceived there. And you know, I come from that kind of a family where daughters are more educated than sons. And most of my cousins barely finished their schooling. And for me to take that step, you know, take that decision to go to college and take up a vocational course or even then think about law. So law was something that I'd never thought before. And I did a professional course after my 12th, and then joined Dad's business, you know, departmental store. And it was only in 2005-06, I was thinking of doing some sort of masters, I was not too sure what. And I ended up attending a CCS seminar on public policy. I wasn't too sure of, you know, what it will be about. But there, you know, someone suggested to me that I should think about law and I'll be a good lawyer. I don't think whether, you know, I was really not sure whether I should, I should not. But I prepared for the entrance exam and I got admission in Delhi University, age was no bar for Delhi University. That's one of very few places, you know, you can join law at any age. So that happened. It was only in my first semester, I realized that I loved law so much. You know, it was a similar feeling what you saw probably on Amir Khan's face in Three Idiots movie when I was sitting in the engineering class. So that kind of enjoyment and, you know, the feeling of joy I had. I love my constitutional law classes, jurisprudence classes. So that's how it happened. But in terms of other influences, you know, life has been set of contrasts. So I have been into two kinds of schools. One is a missionary school, but also a school run by Sangh RSS. The other set of contrast is I have been in JNU, but also in Center for Civil Society. I worked there. The next set of contrast is that I studied law in a state run university, Delhi University, but also in a very elite private university, Jindal Global Law School. And these are the diverse experiences that influenced and shaped my journey."

But they will not understand that the same freedom should apply to all interactions two people have with each other. So if we are two consenting adults, it should have the same moral value if someone stops us either from sleeping with each other, or from trading in the marketplace. And there's a certain kind of left liberal view that voluntary action is to be respected as it should be if it is happening in a bedroom and it's a personal interaction, but not if it's in the marketplace, where suddenly it becomes something entirely different and their coercion is justified, intervention is justified. And that's almost, in a sense, written into the DNA of our constitution and our laws, where some freedoms are respected more than others, while all of them arise essentially from the same source."

        "message": "Actually, during my law school, I never took up any internship with any law firm. And I was looking at the issue of auto rickshaw drivers in Delhi. And, you know, there were different kinds of policy responses to the problem of auto rickshaw driver. The problem was, commuters often complain that they don't go by meter. And policy response was that we need to discipline them. How you discipline them is either you have a digital meter, you have workshop for them, you prescribe a uniform for them, they have to have GPS, and so on and so forth. And at times, you know, you hear, and you read in the newspapers that there is a cultural issue, they are migrants, they don't know how to behave with commuters, so on and so forth. So, while I was in law college, I with my other friends, we investigated, we did some research and found out that it was more a policy issue, because of the disparity between demand and supply. And there was a permit system, the government didn't issue any further permits. So, this was one issue that we studied. And we, you know, made a documentary called third wheel, a shorter version of this documentary still available on YouTube, it's called third wheel. Right after finishing my LLB, I joined a lawyer, Miss Indira Unnayar. And I assisted her in another public interest matter, which was about cycle rickshaw pullers. And same issue, very similar, there was a permit issue, you know, fixed number of permits and the government didn't issue further permits. And the number of permit was limited to 99,000. But there were actually 6 lakh cycle rickshaw pullers in Delhi, which meant more than 5 lakh cycle rickshaw pullers were illegal. And that give an opportunity to the municipal officials, traffic police to basically seek rent. So, on 10th of February 2010, Delhi High Court decided in favor of cycle rickshaw pullers. And basically, you know, the so called mafia became entrepreneurs. And I found that really very interesting. That was around the same time CCS was probably doing Jeevika campaign related to street vendors in Rajasthan. I took up masters after that. And it was only in 2013 that I joined CCS, CCS was already doing street vendors project by then. And they had an office in Jaipur, Rajasthan, and the street vendor associations knew them quite well. So there was a PIL pending before these High Court of Rajasthan with respect to this issue. And Rajasthan passed a state law for protection of street vendors, but it was totally a toothless law. A lot of other organizations as well as street vendor organizations were advocating for a central law. And if you remember, UP had a National Advisory Council, they began to have consultations, I think in right from 2009, 2010. And finally, the Central Act came in 2014. Also the Supreme Court passed its orders and asked, you know, the Parliament, I mean, the Supreme Court asking the Parliament to come up with a law, a federal law to tackle a municipal level subject. So these were my experiences with livelihoods of urban poor and similar issues, be it auto rickshaw drivers, be it cycle rickshaw pullers, or be it street vendors. The issue is state harassment, you know, the harassment caused by police, by municipal officials and permit and license against at the core of it."

And is it the case that like when you describe the cycle rickshaw pullers in Bombay and all the policy responses, which were all horrible, and all the other popular sort of responses people had to that which are equally horrible. And the key thing that they're missing there, obviously, is that people respond to incentives. And if you have a system where the incentives are absolutely horrible, then everyone will behave rationally, and you'll get really bad outcomes. For example, if you have your x number of rickshaw pullers, but you're giving licenses, which are point 2x, then obviously, you will have that rent seeking, you will have bribery and the cost for society go up massively. So has that been like, it seems to me that that's a fundamental challenge at the core of either making government work well, or even how we look at other issues in isolation, be it the constitution or legality itself, that people don't understand this fundamental, and I won't even call it the economic way of thinking, because that seems to imply that there is something niche about it, which doesn't apply to everything. Because economics is a study of human behavior, we all obviously respond to incentives. And that's a fundamental fact you have to take into account. And if you don't, none of your other thinking or intervention will work. So has that been a big challenge with you both in terms of changing mindsets, and then in terms of actually getting things done?"

Because if you look at the judgments related to cycle rickshaw pullers, or street vendors, you know, especially in 80s, I would say 50s and 60s were not that bad. The judges did what they were supposed to, but it was in 80s that you see the problems in the judgment. So for example, you know, when we talk about cycle rickshaw pullers, the judgment that Delhi High Court passed, and it's stuck down some of the provisions that apply to cycle rickshaw pullers in Delhi. Those provisions were challenged four times in 80s before the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court upheld those provisions. And if you see those judgments, and if you see the rationale that the court gives, heavily influenced by socialist reasoning, and they mentioned this, and they call the entrepreneurs who own the cycle rickshaws, and so basically, let me first give you the background of what the law was about. There was another law which said that one person can't own more than one cycle rickshaw. So owner must be the puller, which meant that you can only own one cycle rickshaw, you will not give it on rent, but which also implied that no one else can hire a cycle rickshaw from the other person. Now, there were a lot of migrants who came from rural areas during the non-agriculture season, and would come to cities and towns, and would hire cycle rickshaws, and would ply them and then probably after three, four months, will go back to villages. But when you prohibit, when you make it illegal to give it on rent or to hire cycle rickshaws, you are basically, by sort of intervention, you are attacking the economy, you are making that consensual transaction illegal. Their reasoning is that, you know, the person who owns more than one cycle rickshaw is a greedy capitalist, and they say that in their judgments. Now that judgment, those four judgments, look at the contrast between those four judgments and the Delhi High Court judgment where this time in 2010, the court calls the police, you know, the harasser or the exploiter. So in 80s, the exploitation is done by so-called greedy capitalists. And in 2010, same issue, same problem, same law, and the court finds that it is the police"

One is that to summarize what is wrong with that earlier socialist judgments of the 80s, for example, just let's unpack that one clause that no one can own more than one cycle rickshaw. What does it do? Number one, it prohibits scale. It means that if you get one cycle rickshaw and you're successful and you want to scale up, you cannot do that, you're only allowed to own one. Number two, it is an entry barrier. If you want to be a cycle rickshaw puller, you have to then get the means to actually own one. It is illegal for you to drive one for somebody else. And presumably, if you rent one against the law, then both you and the person you're renting it from will have to pay bribes to the police concerned or whatever and do other jugaad to get out of it. The third aspect is that with restrictions like this, there is often the moralistic line taken that, you know, it goes against a man's dignity to pull a cycle rickshaw. And therefore, you know, for their own good, we should keep them away from it. Where, again, what people fail to realize is that, yes, pulling a cycle rickshaw is just an horrible job, you wouldn't wish it on anyone. But everybody who is choosing to do so of his own free will, is doing so because it"

Is that one is actually a two part question one, has it actually been a trend within the judiciary? Or is it an isolated instance of an opinion changing like this, from something less liberal to more liberal, as we would call it?

He says it was, you see the society changing. And he points out at the, you know, for example, the Bollywood movies. So you look at how capitalists were portrayed in the movies, in 50s, 60s, then suddenly in 70s, you see an angry young man. And the perception, the portrayal of the police also changes. And come 90s, and you see, you know, very benign capitalists. So the movie Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was a story of a benign capitalist family. And then it changes.

        "message": "So let me begin the story from the 80s. You know, two cities, mainly Delhi and Mumbai had their largest share of cases on street vending with before the Supreme Court. And there was a case from Mumbai in 1983, Bombay hawkers union, you know, the hawkers union actually challenged provisions of Bombay Municipal Corporation Act 1888. If you look at this act, the provisions of this act, these were very skeleton provisions. Okay, the provision did not have any details of how the commissioner will issue the licenses, it only talks about terms and condition and the commissioner can issue the licenses subject to those terms and condition, but it doesn't guide the commissioner as to what sort of parameters should he employ for giving licenses, what should be those terms and condition, nothing, no guidance. And this is cardinal principle of administrative law that when the parliament or you know, the legislature makes a law and delegate certain powers to the executive, there has to be some guidance given to the executive, because executive can't make law, the executive can make rules, but the rules are there just to fill the gaps, you know, just to fill the details, but the rules can't be abused or misused by the executive to do what as per its whims and fancies, that that's not permissible. And the court has the power of judicial review, that if there is over delegation, or if there is arbitrariness, then it can strike down those rules. So what this union was doing, the street vendors challenge those provisions saying that this is not guided discretion, it is unguided power in the hands of the executive, because they apply for licenses, and they don't get their license, they also don't get any response from the municipality. And there is no deadline to give any response. Now, this is purely an administrative law question, right? And something similar happened with Delhi vendors. So you know, there was a vendor in near Janpath called Sodhan Singh. And he faced the same issue, he was given a license. But when he applied for renewal of license, there was no reply. The license wasn't renewed. When he went to the Supreme Court, their NDMC filed an affidavit saying, well, we rejected his license on so and so reason that, you know, he is supposed to be a moving vendor, a mobile vendor, but he stands at the bus stop, you know, sort of like a stationary vendor. That's not permissible. And we allowed him to sell only peanuts. But he started selling garments. You know, I mean, is that a material fact? Why would you give license to just to sell one particular such specific commodity? And what is your interest to control what commodity will he sell? Of course, it's not selling bombs or ammunition. It's not very clear from the judgment whether the NDMC had informed him in some timeline in some deadline, you know, why they are rejecting his license. And so then he can if he disagrees with those reasons, he could have challenged that reasoning before the court. So that's not very clear whether he challenged that there was no reply from the NDMC or whether he challenged the reasons. I believe it was that he did not get any response and the NDMC filed his response only before the court later."

And that happened in 90s because there is a context to it that you know, while the Sodhan Singh and Bombay hawkers union judgments, you know, were being heard by the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court did not take up this judicial review question, the administrative law question. It abdicated from its role of doing the judicial review, and instead, it passed directions. So in case of Bombay hawkers union, it asked the commissioner to frame some details as to how it should give the licenses. Now, the commissioner did frame some directions, you know, which he called the scheme, and the court also sort of modified the scheme and passed an order with that modified scheme, but also asked the commissioner to take inputs from all stakeholders and further finalize the scheme. This was very, very ambiguous, not something which the court should have ideally done, because the court should have ideally scrutinized the provisions in the Municipal Corporation Act, whether there was unguided discretion, you know, whether there are parameters there or not. The scheme business was not, you know, something the court should have gotten into. And in case the municipal commissioner was framing a scheme, you know, he should have gone ahead and framed the scheme and notified it. And then the vendors could have challenged the scheme if they liked. But the court shouldn't have put the scheme in its order. Because once the court puts the scheme in its order, it seems the court has laid down the scheme, which still is, you know, the most courts, you'll see the subsequent judgments. And it seems that the court framed the scheme, and you can't touch the scheme now because it's court order and whatever the court says is law. And that's very problematic, because now that scheme is off judicial review. So who will review that scheme now? Subsequent judges won't touch it or this is laid down by the Supreme Court judges are seniors and that becomes problematic. In case of Delhi, NDMC, you know, told the court how this vendor has come to the Supreme Court under which law, you know, where is his right to come to the court? Is he saying that he has a right to sit on the road to vent? There is no such right. So the vendor claimed that he has a fundamental right under Article 19, 1G, right to pursue any profession, business, trade, occupation. And NDMC said, well, you know, how can you have a fundamental right to sit squat on the road? There is no fundamental right like that. And the court, instead of again, reviewing the administrative law question and reviewing the municipal laws, got confused with this proposition. Is there a fundamental right or is there no fundamental right? Now, the problem is that there is conceptual ambiguity with the court. The court did not really understand that in our scheme of constitution, there is presumption of liberty. Citizens don't have to ask and take permissions before they do something."

Number two, it gives the power to the legislature to restrict those rights reasonably and in general public interest for the purpose of 19, 1G. So you have two grounds, a there should be reasonableness and second is general public interest. Right. And then a citizen can challenge those restrictions on the ground that either it is not reasonable or it is not in general public interest. This is precisely that the vendors were doing. They were saying, of course, on the administrative law grounds that, you know, this is not a law because it goes beyond the law. The law doesn't ask you to, you know, and you have to have some procedural safeguards on the issue of procedure, also the challenge, but they could have also challenged it on reasonableness and general public interest. The court, instead of asking that question, got into the question, where is the right? And this is really, really troubling. The court doesn't understand, you know, the way the right is coming from. And these are the Supreme Court judges. And this is really dangerous for the society. I mean, if the Supreme Court judges are not very clear, you know, where the source of the right or the concept of fundamental rights, then God save the country and the presumption of liberty and the presumption of liberty. So I'll give you another example. So for example, you know, drone was a recent phenomenon. There were no drones earlier, or for example, e-rickshaws, you know, the battery operated rickshaws, battery operated rickshaws didn't come under the purview of Motor Vehicles Act, but they were not cycle rickshaws either, right? But the government did not have a law to ban them. So the question is, is it legal to ply battery operated rickshaws or not? I argue, yes, it is legal, because you don't have any law to ban them, or for that matter, cryptocurrency. Where is your law to ban cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a commodity, and you can trade in cryptocurrency. But the government has gone ahead to ban cryptocurrency by way of a notification, which is not even a law."

And one of the things I find in the facts that you lay out before us is that there seems to be a tremendous flouting of this whole notion of the separation of powers, that the judiciary should do this, the legislature should do this, the executive should do this. An example being in that superb sentence that you said earlier in this episode about the Supreme Court directing the government to pass a federal law about a municipal issue. And this seems completely confused. So does this confusion at the level of conception where, you know, the Supreme Court is legislating from the bench and the legislator is pretty toothless these days, but and the executive is doing what the legislature should do and the center is passing laws for municipalities, you know, is this just a fundamental problem in any change getting done even outside of this limited context that we're talking about today?"

        "message": "So you know, also, let's complete our chain of events, because after they passed directions in Bombay Hawkers Union, in case of Delhi also, what they did in Delhi, Delhi was even more weirder, because they constituted a five judge bench to decide whether it's a constitutional, it's a fundamental right or not. And it decided that it is a fundamental right and the parliament can restrict it. And they said now the individual or the smaller benches will decide on the individual cases, because Sodhan Singh was not an isolated case, they were, it was a bunch of cases. But what seems in the later subsequent judgments, I found the reference to, you know, what happened to the rest of cases is that they forwarded those cases to a Lok Adalat. Now this is bizarre, because Article 32 of our Constitution guarantees that the Supreme Court is bound to hear your writ petitions. Writ petition meaning if you challenge, you know, a government action or a state law that it violates your fundamental rights, the Supreme Court is bound to hear. It's a guarantee. It's a constitutional guarantee. And the Supreme Court forwarding these writ petitions to a Lok Adalat, I think that's absolutely bizarre and there is no other parallel or there is no other example to my mind. I mean, imagine, you know, people would be on streets and the Supreme Court forwarded, let's say the Kashmir issue or the Ram Mandir issue or the, you know, something of that sort to Lok Adalat. And but this is what exactly they did in 1990. And after that, they started constituting committees. So first they constitute a Thareja committee. So they took up a civil judge from the lower judiciary in Delhi and asked him to, you know, basically, it was a committee of one person. And he was on the streets of Delhi, you know, counting vendors. And but why are you counting vendors? You know, why are you counting vendors? Now, the other problem is, the court forgets that street vending is not the only private use of public space. There are many other private uses of public space. So for example, car parking, you know, we are recording here in this neighborhood. This is a residential zone. And you see cars there on the road on the pavement. Are these people paying to the municipality for parking their cars on the pavement? No one is paying. Is it legal or illegal? You ask this question to municipal official, he won't also know, right? So the cars are being parked in a public space without payment. Is it legal or illegal? No one comes to take off the cars. In commercial districts, yes, that happens that sometimes the crane comes or the traffic guy comes to chalan you, but that doesn't happen in the residential zone. So other use, for example, the building repairing, you know, the building owner would put a scaffolding and the scaffolding often is in the public area, right? You have building materials lying outside in the public area, or let's say family picnic in a public park, right? Why people smoking outside on the road and blocking the pedestrian path, isn't that a public use? And for that matter, you know, we are in Delhi, barats, barat is the biggest example, you don't take any public permission, the police permission or the traffic permission, you know, to have a barat on the roads and the roads are jammed when there is, you know, we call it in Delhi, sayabhari hai, there are a lot of marriages, weddings happening on a particular night because of a shubh muhurat and the roads are jammed because of barats. But no one raises any questions on these other public uses. It's only the street vendor issue where there are a lot of questions. So my question is, to the Supreme Court that while you frame a committee, he's counting vendors on the road, but what about other public uses? And while they were thinking, and of course, the one problem is that they were trying to regulate street vending. But the other problem is, which they shouldn't have done. But the other problem is while doing that, they left other private uses of public spaces. I mean, they left those unregulated, they didn't think about that."

So, you know, the question that automatically comes up, takes me to something that the Bombay High Court in 2014 said, which you've quoted in one of your pieces, which both plays to this question and also sort of seems to articulate the common impression that most people have about street hawkers. And the court is, quote, street hawkers create dirt and nuisance, if they were to be conceded the right claim by them, they could hold society to ransom by squatting. And you know, in 2017, you've pointed out how the Delhi High Court said, quote, being pitched between the conflicting rights of the livelihood of street vendors versus the life and security of the public in general, including the street vendors, we are of the opinion that the former must bow to the latter as without life and security, no question of earning a livelihood can arise, stop quote. So now, you know, just at the level of the fundamental principles involved, we would both agree with the judgment you cited from the 50s that, you know, public space belongs to the public, not to the government, the government is sort of safeguarding those spaces. So equally, you know, people have a right to sell things, people have a right to walk on those streets, we can stand together and you know, have a smoke break or whatever the why don't smoke and you know, the people can park their things there and whatever. The question that arises here is, and I'm kind of thinking aloud, is that if you're to take a thought experiment, where would you draw a line, because the more people sort of use these public spaces, each use has a tiny disruption that does not justify or is not a reasonable restriction of that right, to what point where where do you draw the line where the disruptions get so much that you say that no more this is not allowed. For example, if we were to take a crowd of people and completely block a public street outside here in Housecast where we are recording for days on end, the government would have to intervene because we'd be blocking all the highways and it would affect traffic all over the city. But when that happens for shorter periods of time, like say the Ganpati Emotions in Bombay where I live, the government doesn't do anything because it's just a handful of days and whatever let it happen. You know, one, where is the line to on what basis do you think the line should be drawn and is that necessarily an arbitrary distinction and three, would you agree that the street hawkers no matter you know, in the current dispensation, no matter what they do, simply do not come anywhere close to that line, they are not disrupting life in that manner."

Because the street vendor is there because he is performing a social need. He is only there because people want to buy from him. All transactions are positive. Some games are mutually beneficial. So you know, that's the logic of the market. He exists because he fulfills a social need, sort of a public utility, a public utility. The guy who parks his SUV is not fulfilling anyone's need, but his own. Absolutely.

They were heavy deployment of police forces and a lot of municipal officials were there. And we saw those thadis being bulldozed, although there was a, you know, state run dairy kiosk that was left. They didn't do anything to that state dairy kiosk. We went to a police station because as per the law, this was illegal. And I asked them to lodge an FIR and they laughed at us.

That was one victory. Then I thought, you know, one state, we spent one year pushing that state to implement the law or just frame like rules and scheme. How do we deal with all the states? And that's how we came up with the idea to design an index, which would be an interstate index that shows which state has to what extent implemented the law. And in 2017, we, you know, launched the first version of the index, then last year, we did the second version, which shows that, you know, the implementation is really poor. And most states have not implemented at best they might have. So barring three or four states, most states have drafted their rules and schemes. But in terms of constituting town vending committee, which is a participatory forum, also comprising of the street vendors, almost one third have only one third towns and cities have constituted town vending committees, but almost two third have not done that. And then there are other steps. So, for example, there should be a grievance redressal forum and so on and so forth, which most cities or municipalities have not done.

And you say there are three features for the 2014 act, quote, one, the participatory mechanism of TVCs, TVCs being town vending committees, decentralizes decision making from municipal bodies to a committee of all stakeholders, including vendors, government officials and resident associations. The provision of 40% mandatory vendor representatives in the committee aims to ensure that their interests are accommodated in their party to their own governance. Two, until the survey and issuance of certificate of vending to all existing vendors is complete, no vendor can be evicted. TVCs are required to enumerate vendors every five years through safeguards and processes. The law creates a permitting framework instead of a licensing regime.

The municipal officials and the police. And why do they harass? They harass because either you are, you know, you don't exist on paper, you don't have a piece of paper, which is called license, right? So the problem, the core problem is licensing and harassment. And what is the solution that they propose to this problem of licensing harassment? They propose that A, you will be counted, B, there has to be some sort of participatory body to decide on certain questions of regulations and see that there will be some sort of grievance redressal mechanism. The problem is, who is going to constitute the body and who is going to draft rules and schemes? So again, the government body, you know, the state government will draft rules and schemes.

And now they were constituting the town vending committees, and they were to conduct surveys, but the survey has still not been conducted in Delhi, similarly in Mumbai. So Mumbai conducted a survey in 2014, you know, under the old policy, there was a national policy for hawkers in 2009. And they conducted a survey, and then again, vendors approached the court. The interesting part is, you know, the way Mumbai conducted the survey, they distributed the application forms, and asked the vendor to submit the forms. Now, this is not a survey, but they have been calling this as the survey. And it fails because not all the vendors will get the form, not all of them will be able to fill it. Absolutely, because, you know, as per some estimates, there were some estimates say there are 2.5 lakh vendors, some estimates say there are more than 3 lakh vendors, but they could distribute only 1.25 lakh forms amongst the vendors, and they received 99,000 forms filled. And then they had criteria, you know, who is a real vendor. So you have to submit proof of vending that you have been vending in Mumbai. And then you also have to have domicile certificate, which was, you know, that, of course, the whole son of the soil debate in Mumbai inspires that kind of requirement. And apparently, very few vendors, some figures say 5000, some figures say 15,000, you know, as per the news reports, were finally able to get some sort of I cards or spaces to vend, they were formalized. Out of all these lakhs of vendors. So imagine the figure says, I mean, some estimation says that there are 3 lakh vendors, but the government distributed only 1.25 lakh forms, they managed to get 99,000 filled forms.

What is the chief impetus towards status quo within government circles, like government circles are very resistant to change, and they prefer status quo? Is it a inertia? Or B, is it rent seeking? Because very often, what seems to me is that the people who can change the law and can change the system are not actually people who are collecting bribes at the local level themselves. There's nothing in it for them personally, which seems to dilute the reason of rent seeking. So is it some kind of inertia? Or is there the influence of interest groups? What's going on here?"

And NAC's bias was towards more participatory forum. But tell me one thing, for example, you know, that in commercial zones in Delhi, you know, in the markets, you have car parking model. And how it works is, the municipal corporation would auction the car parking spaces, it would do an inventory of the car parking space, and it would auction the space to the highest bidder. The contractor, I mean, we were at SDA market, right, just now, I mean, I paid 20 rupees, and he had a machine to issue a ticket and collect the money on a per hourly basis. And so the contractor employs these people who collects money on per hourly basis from the car owners. There is no car owners committee to decide where should we park our car, there is no survey of car owners, or cars, you know, who parks where. This is absolutely, you know, ridiculous to think of an election. And you know, the election has to happen for street vendors to be able to represent in the town vending committee. So a you have a participatory body, then there has to have elections. And from through this elections, people will be nominated, selected to elected to the town vending committee, the town vending committee will pass resolutions, and then will regulate street vendors in the city. And this is such an unviable model. And we see this because it's been six years next week, I mean, we are recording now in February third week, and March first week is the sixth anniversary of this law. And it's still not been implemented in most cities, most towns, it's still not been implemented. And this is the reason because it's unviable."

And eventually it should belong to you. And that's typically how these things evolve. But when the state doesn't recognize that they change that land into what de Soto calls dead capital, right? It is capital, but it is dead because you can't monetize it. So I may live in a slum and effectively own the house that I live in. And I've lived for three decades, and maybe I was born there and my parents were born there. But I can't, for example, mortgage it. And I can't sell it to someone else. And what that does is that the value of the land which a piece of paper from the state would, otherwise, you know, all it requires is a piece of paper from the state saying that I own it. And because that piece of paper doesn't exist, the value of a parcel of land, which could be 20 lakhs, is effectively zero or much less than that. And that's a loss to society, because that person could then mortgage that land, get a loan to, for example, run a business, start a business, everybody benefits, society benefits. That's how we grow. And yet that doesn't happen. Now, does a similar analog apply, for example, to street vendors?"

So I'll give you, you know, another interesting insight from a paper written by Kettles. It is a case study of MacArthur Park sidewalk vendors in the US. And he gives an example across the road, you know, so this side of the road, there was a formalized vending zone and that side of the road, it was unauthorized vending zone. So it, you know, there was no planning for vending, but there were nonetheless some vendors who were vending on that side. And he compared the two. He found out that in the unauthorized vending zone, the vendors that were vending there had evolved their own norms of allocating spaces. So there were two kinds of norms. One was first come first serve basis on a daily basis. So some spots that were not in much demand, and whoever comes first will occupy that spot on a daily basis. And there were some vendors who have been there for a longer time, and their spots were sort of fixed, and they assert their property right on those spots, and other vendors would not claim those spots. And even if they did, these vendors would assert their right. And you know, without the intervention of any police or any mafia or any gang, the disputes would settle amongst themselves, which means that the, you know, that sort of understanding of property rights was working very well. On the other hand, this side of the vending zone, the government engaged an NGO, some organization to allocate spaces, and they did, you know, draw flaws, and they tried to make it aesthetically superior by saying that all the food stalls will be at one place and so on and so forth, and nothing worked. Many days, many times, you know, those vendors didn't even come and the government spent a lot of money on the NGO, trying to figure out and make it work.

In the Municipal Act, municipality has the powers to impose chalance, okay, for violation of sanitation, for nuisance, and so on. And the chalance can be 50 rupees, for especially for sanitation, it's 50 rupees. So last year, a vendor came to us, he was given a chalance. And when he went to the magistrate, municipal magistrate, he was asked to pay 2000 rupees. And you know, the vendor's nephew was quite net savvy. He pulled out a judgment from Google, which said that the chalance can't be more than 50 rupees. And he showed that judgment to me, and I was quite shocked. And then I, you know, we bought a copy of the municipal because as CCS, we don't really work on municipal corporation law, we work mostly on education. But we got that copy at Bayer Act. And we found out that the chalance was indeed just 50 rupees written in the law. And so it can't be more than 50 rupees. And you know, how can the judge ask for the magistrate asked for 2000 rupees chalance. And I appeared before that magistrate. And he one thing, first of all, he was not aware of this law. He says, you are encroaching. And this is why I have chalanced you, you know, I'm imposing a penalty of 2000 rupees. So you know, when the sanitation inspector issued him the chalance, it mentioned the provisions for violation of sanitation norms. But now the magistrate says it's for encroachment. And this law 2014 law does not define encroachment. There is no concept of encroachment because you are a street vendor, it's a public private use of public space, how can there be encroachment? And anyways, because before survey, no vendor can be evicted. So there's no question of encroachment. So I, you know, brought that to his attention. And he said, nahi nahi aise to nahi ho sakta, aapko toh paise dene padenge, maini kab kyun denge paise, where is the law? I mean, it and it says 50 rupees, you take the 50 rupees, okay, we even if we confess that, you know, there was some violation of sanitation, you take 50 rupees, and they were happy to give 50 rupees. But why should they give 2000 rupees? And he was very adamant, we came back and he showed, you know, later if he showed billable warrants, and then he threatened to issue attachment of property notice that will take away your stuff, they'll confiscate your goods, and things like that. And then we asked for a copy of the order, and the magistrate refused to give us a copy of the order. We asked him to, you know, inspect the court records that at least show us the record, you know, very how you are passing these orders, give us a copy, we can challenge it, he refused. Then we challenged it in the Saket district court without a copy of the order and told the judge there that, you know, the magistrate refused to give us a copy of the order and you summon that court records. And she did that she passed for that order. And after two days when she got the orders, the judge had signed and pass that order without, you know, the accused signing the form. And the appellate court, the session judge found that very, you know, surprising because this is violation of the law, you can't pass an order without the accused confessing. But this is what he intended to do. And she sent the case back to the magistrate, and he told, the magistrate told this vendor that you don't come with the lawyer, I will, you know, acquit you of all charges. He said, my lawyer, whether he will come or not, you first, I mean, my submission is that I have not done any wrong. So then he agreed and he acquitted him. Four months later, the same vendor was Chalant again. And this was a different magistrate this time. Again he went. He says, you will have to pay a fine of Rs. 1000. He said, why should I pay? This is my right. I can vend on the street. He said, so will you sit on the road? He said, yes, it is my right, why won't I sit? He said, if you don't pay, I will send you to the Patiala district court. You know what the vendor said? The jurisdiction is with the Saket district court, not with Patiala court. He said, are you trying to teach me law? He said, no, I'm just saying this that the jurisdiction is here. He said, then the court master whispered into the magistrate's ears, sir, he is the same person who brought a lawyer last time. And then the magistrate asked him, will you bring a lawyer again? He said, yeah, he will come if required. Then the magistrate was silent. He did not impose any penalty. You see, I mean, it's not, you know, maybe we say this is informal. Define informality. What is informality? Informality is when you have a formal norm and you are non-compliant, that is informality. But who is not informal? Your executive is informal, your legislature is informal, your judiciary is informal, and not just the municipal magistrate, right to the Supreme court, everyone is informal in this country, you know, and we call the vendors informal. Everything is informal."

It's a spin to what I always say that, you know, in the popular imagination, there is a sort of a dhaba on the word informality, that if you are in the informal sector, you are in some way there is a moral taint attached to you that you are evading the law, you're not paying taxes and all of that. And the point I keep making is that look, 80% of India is in the informal sector, not because they are immoral, or they don't want to be good citizens, but because they don't have a choice, because your laws are so bad, your regulations are so bad, you know, there is absolutely no option but to exist in what you call the informal sector. And in this case, what strikes me is that the vendor is not even actually in the informal sector, because there are laws which kind of deal with him and regulate him. And despite that, he has to go through this and all this while that you were telling me this story, I was thinking he get this is actually an outlier vendor, in the sense he is an outlier, because he has an access to a lawyer, which is you and you are going there. And despite that there is so much friction in dealing with this micro issue, you're neither of you, whatever judgment you get is, you know, changing the bigger picture, it's one micro issue. And this vendor is so lucky. And most vendors don't have this, they have to pay by hook or by crook. And if that 2000 fine is too much for them, then they go out of business, there is no choice and no one is measuring that all of that is unseen, you know, not just a damage to the vendor, but all the people who were buying things from him were getting value from him, which is also now lost to them. And it hurts society when sort of things like this happen. What do you guys do to also then change things at the macro level, key, you know, the implementation of the laws, the writing of the laws, you know, what's going on."

One is this even relevant to that because ease of doing business people think of a different kind of a formal thing where you're setting up a business and you're doing whatever. And two, any metric that exists can be gamed. And what I hear from everyone in the business space is that ease of doing business itself hasn't changed or become better. It's just that the few metrics that were there which were being measured in specific places have been gamed as metrics are liable to and things are still incredibly hard for businessman like recently, I think there was news in Delhi that you need to submit 40 something documents to open a business, but 19 documents to buy a gun. So it is easier to buy a gun legally than it is to open a business. And it must be, you know, even worse for street vendors, because there are so many other variables at play."

Even if they're formal, they are formal, we know that they're formal, because there is a law governing them, regulating them and protecting them. But for all those purposes, they don't exist. Right. So what is their ease of doing business, it simply doesn't matter. Although I mean, I'm glad that the Prime Minister, given his background that he was himself a street vendor earlier, and he talked about, you know, the pakora walas, and so on and so forth. So I was quite hopeful that things will probably change. But yeah, I mean, it's to that extent, I have not seen that kind of a change. And the law definitely, though it was passed by the previous government, but this government hasn't done really anything to reform the law. It's still going at its own pace."

And this is why it doesn't become a political issue. In Mumbai, it does become a political issue, because, you know, then it's about son of the soil issue and that all the Zonka Bakar stalls should go to the local people and not to migrants. But otherwise, in other cities, it's not really that kind of a political issue. I think it's more a mindset issue. Because for example, in Jaipur, you know, the establishment thinks that they make the city look ugly. It's an aesthetic problem. But if you know, another thing which they probably don't understand is that once you formalize it, then investment will flow into it. Yeah. Right. Provided that you don't have poverty mandating laws. So poverty mandating meaning, you know, the law has another condition. So one condition is that you can't transfer. The second condition is that you can't have an alternative source of employment, which means, so for example, three MBA students called me up to say that we want to put up a food truck. They can't, you know, because then they have to show that they're poor or they don't have any alternative source of employment. A retired government bureaucrat once called me to say that I want to put up a food truck in Noida. What is the law? This is so ambiguous, a person who wants to really invest money, you know, a food truck would it's not a handcart or something like that. But our mindset is street vendor. It means a poor guy clad in dhoti and, you know, kurta pushing a cart or something like that. No, you know, your kiosks in T3 terminal, they're also street vendors. As per the law, the kiosk in the Supreme Court, you know, there is a guy who sells lawyer's band and stationery in the corridor of the Supreme Court. He's also a street vendor. But this kind of understanding is absent. We are conditioned to see street vending in a very narrow and conditioned perspective. That has to change. Street vendor does not and many street vendors, I can tell you, I sold my last car, you know, my old car to a street vendor. And he paid me money in white, I mean, he, you know, paid the money, transferred the money through bank account. And street vendors are not poor. Not all of them are poor, at least. Number two, they can become rich only if you don't, you know, force them to remain poor."

And you know, it's kind of a now a gated community. And I said, you have to ask women, do they not want vendors? First of all, I mean, that's another issue of legality, you know, whether you can oust the vendors like that, because it's a public road, we are not a cooperative housing society like Mumbai or Gurgaon or Dwarka.

And it seems to me that that question takes on far more relevance now, after all these years of experience doing all of this, where you look at the law, not just as, you know, all these statutes and notifications that are written somewhere, and you, you know, you download the document, but you have to deal with them on a daily basis, you've argued all these cases in courts of law, and you've seen close up how these laws and how our Constitution itself, in fact, impacts the lives of ordinary people who do not have the sort of privileges that we do.

I don't believe any hierarchy of fundamental rights, which a lot of people, other people claim that there is a hierarchy of fundamental rights and on that have fictional hierarchy. Freedom of speech and expression is at the top. And but you look at the number of cases, you know, the writ petitions right from 1950. So you know, there are search engines for lawyers wherein you can look for cases. A simple exercise, just type article 19-1A and look for what results you get and type article 19-1G, which is the economic freedom right. So 1A refers to free speech and 1G refers to economic freedom, right? You probably would get twice or thrice the number of results for Supreme Court and also for high court cases for 19-1G, right?

Now for each cow slaughter law, when it is challenged in the court, you have 4000, 5000, 10,000 members of Qureshi community, you know, challenging it in the court, right? And when these people say, when other legal scholars say that, you know, right to religion, for example, is a higher right than economic freedom. But you know, these things are, there is sort of intersection between these things. Your economic freedom intersects with your identity, right? So you can't see these things in isolation. You know, when there is a law which impinges on your freedom to, let's say, deal in beef or a deal in meat, it impacts your identity. When a law, you know, that taxes a commodity, let's say, Parle-G biscuit, I've heard Shruti on your podcast, you know, imposes a higher tax on Parle-G than on diamonds. Then also it impinges on your identity as a consumer. Often there are patterns of consumption and production. So for example, hypothetically, let's say, government imposes higher tax on coffee than on tea. Okay? Who will it impact? It will impact South Indian coffee producers, as well as South Indian coffee consumers, right? And more tea drinkers are consumers are in North, and the producers may be in Northeast, right? I mean, there is a pattern, right? All that I'm trying to say. So to say that one right is above the other, because, you know, of so and so, and these people probably have never vended, never done any sort of business, they are probably there in the universities taking a salary, I'm saying just one day, stand in the street and do street vending, or earn money and start a business and try to earn money, then you will be able to appreciate, you know, a the right and as well as the daily struggles of other people, right? Unless then, until then, you have no right to say that freedom, freedom of speech and expression is your vested interest, because you write, you express yourself, but what about, you know, the livelihood right of other people. So very interesting, you know, when there are when there were cases that involved intersection of free speech and economic freedom, you know, for example, in cases where a newspapers building was to be acquired, or the machinery was to be acquired or things like that, or, you know, there was some restriction on your right to sell newspaper or right to acquire newspaper, then both rights intersect, right? Then how do you perceive this right? So it's easier to say that one right is important over the other. But unless you ask the person who is in that shoe, you can't make a universal claim for"
