Certainty and moral posturing get us likes and retweets and raise our status on social media. And yet, those who are sure of themselves and sanctimonious towards others also tend to be both ignorant and useless. And while we do need to tell simple stories to make sense of it, we also need to be humble. And in the face of the multitudes around us, we need to nurture the multitudes within us. The less dots we join to paint a picture of the world, the less accurate that picture is. Also, while it is tempting to pass judgement all the time, as that makes us feel both knowledgeable and virtuous, it again ignores nuance, context, circumstance. And it stands in the way of our actually changing those aspects of the world that we do not like. Those who change the world do not stand at a distance and pontificate. Instead, they plunge right in, get their hands dirty, and try to move that needle one inch"

        "message": "Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My guest today is my friend Suyash Rai, who I often describe as the finest thinker no one has heard of. Suyash has been on the show a couple of times before, but in older, shorter formats, and I think I've described him as someone who always makes my brain expand a little bit after I meet him. He always makes me rethink my beliefs and examine my character, though I do have some disagreements with him. Suyash used to work at an IPFP, he was a consultant with the finance ministry for a while. He has been in the weeds when it comes to actually changing and shaping policy within the government of India, and he is now a deputy director at Carnegie India. Suyash has grown up in villages and towns, worked in government, and this conversation, in many ways, is a close look first at Indian society, then at the Indian state, and then at the Indian economy. We discuss tradition, modernity, urbanization, family, ethics, and he even mentions, quote, the limitations of the canine condition, stop quote. It's a great conversation with one of our finest thinkers. And it was recorded, by the way, in Delhi in August this year. I've made you wait since then, and I'll make you wait another minute, because hey, it's time for a commercial break. Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?

And then episode 120 something, we chatted for two hours. And then I started that episode by saying that you know what the podcast has changed. I do deep dives now, which is lol because that was only two hours and I was listening to it and realizing that I didn't deep dive into some of the things that I like to do. So you know, we've known each other for six years. And as you correctly pointed out, there are very, very few people in India who've known each other that long, if you look at a total set of possible pairs. But I feel like I still don't know enough about you. So tell me a little bit more about you know, where were you born? Where did you grow up? What were your childhood years like?"

        "message": "I'm not very comfortable talking about these kind of things. But so I come from Eastern UP, my village is in a district called Mau. And my father was the first from his family to come from a village to a city for the first time and get his college education, get a job and basically live in the city. So I was the first person from my family, from the father's side to actually be born in a city. And so my father first made the move basically to come to the city and find a footing in the city. And so it's like, basically, he was the first amphibian in that sense in the family. He's a man of the village, but he also found a place in the city world. And that itself is somewhat of an interesting story, I would say that he studied in a local village school. And in that school, there were a couple of good teachers who were interested in teaching as an activity which is worth pursuing seriously. And he was touched by their excellence in some ways. And he worked hard and he got a good schooling education, even though the village is far from any nearby city, it's 30 kilometers away from the nearest town. And the school was right close to that village. And he did well in school education and basically would have studied in some nearby college only. But it just so happened that that year when he passed out, there was a census or some large case survey was being done, perhaps census, that's what I am told. And they came to our family home in village and they were taking basically all the details of all the members of the family, two persons had come to do this. And they asked the head of the family, so to speak, who's my uncle, my grandparents passed away when my father was still a young boy of nine or 10 years of age. So my uncle was the senior most person who was also not very old, frankly, just out 15 years older than my father. And so he was, he is the one who was basically took charge, I mean, that was his virtue that he saw that as his duty to take care of his family after having lost the parents at a young age. So the census was asked him about who all in the family, then my father's name came up and they asked him what is he doing? They said that he's just completed schooling and is now going to go to some degree college nearby. Then they asked him how much, how many marks have he got, how well has he done? And he told how my father had done. They said this is a very good score that he's got. He should actually try for a better university, not go to college somewhere nearby, which is okay. I mean, the degree college near village was okay, it wasn't great. But he said that he has done quite well and he can get admission in Banaras Hindu University which was the best university in that region, BHU in Varanasi. My father was very moody. He didn't want to do that. He didn't want to leave the village. He never left his village, you know, since he was born, maybe traveled a little in 20-30 miles in one direction, but not further than that. But my uncle had the good sense to basically insist that he should go and he should move to, I mean, he should try to get an admission in BHU and he listened to him because he was his elder and he did listen to only one person and that was his elder brother, otherwise he didn't listen to anyone. So he went to BHU trying to get admission in engineering, but by the time he landed there, the engineering admissions had closed. So then he was coming on his way back, he thought I should have some, have a meal sitting in BHU itself at a dhaba and there another student he met who suggested that even though the engineering admissions are closed, you can get admission in BSc physics. So just chance, right, like the census came and then this person gave him advice and he said okay, that sounds interesting to me, I mean, physics is interesting. So he got admission. That's how he basically made it into a city, you know, and he got his education at BHU, he did his master's also from BHU, then he worked in the private sector for a few years and then he got a job in the railways. So I mean, I was born a few years into his first job and then once he got to railways, we used to get transferred every few years, three to four years. So I lived all over UP, we moved to Gujarat for some time, I lived there. So my schooling was basically all over three to four years in a city and then we would move on to another city. So that's the way it was."

        "message": "Fascinating couple of things I want to double click on and one of them is you spoke about your uncle that, you know, after your grandparents were no more, he had to take charge, that is what you do. And I'm just thinking about the question of how sometimes character can be shaped by necessity in the sense that his path also, you know, had his parents not died, might have been different. But here he is in this position of being the eldest male in the family and presuming and therefore he's got to look after everyone. He's got to, you know, take almost premature parentship of these younger brothers of his and all of that and his life, you know, hit as much by circumstance as your father's was then just goes off in this direction and I'm thinking of how it can work both ways in the sense that on the one hand necessity can shape you and shape your character. So like another example could be like any number of single mothers out there, you know, who are widowed early or husband leaves them or whatever and then they become completely different person, maybe prematurely when they are very young, they get a different kind of responsibility and they discover a different kind of strength within themselves. And that's one way it can work that your character is shaped by situation. But another way it can work is that circumstance can be oppressive in the sense that your true nature is something that you then have to suppress because you're going along a particular, you're following a particular destiny as it were to use that term loosely and there's nothing you can do. And I think many women in India, for example, would say that this is what happens to them because you know, in a sense, they have no choice but to follow the conventional path. You get married, you have kids and you know, maybe even if a couple decides not to have kids but accidentally even that can kind of take you along a certain path which you may not otherwise have gone down and that can affect character in a different way and that can affect a person in a different way. So what are your thoughts on this sort of broad question about, you know, how circumstance can change character and how the notion of duty falls into all of this?"

        "message": "Yeah. So if I look at my uncle, when this situation arose, when in his early 20s, he lost both his parents and with two younger sons, younger brothers and a sister, I mean, he had to decide what it was to be done. There were different paths to take. So he actually had a job offer at that time to become a teacher. He gave up on that to actually take care of the family, to take care of the family farm. We are not a large farm for farmholders, we have medium-sized farm but it was a mainstay and if he had taken up the job, it would have probably meant neglect of the farm and also the family. It's not just about earning money, it's also about the day-to-day business of running a family with their social obligations to be met and all of that. So he made a major sacrifice and I wouldn't ever take it away from him that it was his choice. It was a decisive choice and he saw that in that situation, what he had to do is to prioritize the family and he and my aunt both together basically decided that this is something that they needed to do and they did their duties fully and completely. And so there was a necessity that arose in some senses but the necessity leads to different kinds of choices that people make. You still have a certain set of choices available to you within that situation that you find yourself and I would say that he was a very virtuous kind of a person as far as the practice of running a family is concerned. He was very much devoted to the virtuous side of that practice and he was a great role model for us. Even though he didn't study much, he was, I mean at that time, if you remember, he didn't even have to be a high school pass to get a school teacher job, you know, the education standards weren't as high. So he didn't even do his high school but he was good in his studies, whatever he studied and he still gave up on a path of further education and job and all of that to be able to take care of family. So that's on the side of individual choice and virtues and how you define your situation in life and what do you do when you face a situation. The other side is the larger setting in which you find yourself, right? That if you look at a few centuries ago, basically the main predictor of how prosperous you would be would be where were you born, you know, like which family you were born in, not even where were you born. Basically, it was a Malthusian world, not much productivity growth. If you are born in a rich family, that's great and chances are that you are going to die in a rich family and if you are born in a poor family, chances were that you are going to die in a poor family and there was a little bit of immobility that time. But in the last few centuries, especially since the Industrial Revolution and since social structures have become more, I mean, liberal and open, there's been much more opening of opportunities, you know, and there's much more, I mean, there are many more chances for a person to find ways to, you know, flourish in different ways. It need not be just pursuing a particular kind of career, but whatever your interests are and it's become possible because the larger society has changed, right? Because the economy has changed, the society has changed, the polity has changed. In many countries now you have a little somewhat more open polity, more open societies and also economies have changed a lot. So resources are much more available now. So now, for example, the main predictors of how you're going to do well, you're going to do in life is which country you are born in. That's the most important because I think the, I mean, if you're born in a rich country, there are just so many more opportunities that you have and so much more that you can do as far as your own kind of past are concerned. There are less constraints basically imposed upon you and then there are other factors that go into play to define how well you do in your life. But even if you're born in suppose a country which is a little poor, then quite a few countries have shown that in a fairly short period of time that can change, you know, and societies can change, things can become different, families can become more liberal and open. My own family I've seen is that there was a certain opposition initially when I was very, very young. I remember when I was a kid, there was some opposition of the idea of women working, you know, in a job, like a formal job. The only job that was acceptable at that time was a teaching job because a half day job, you know, in that sense, you go in the morning, you come and then there are things to be done. But now it's completely changed. Like my family still, most of them live in the village, my father, my brother, me, I mean, we are the only ones who live in the city, our family is still a rural family. But the opinions have completely changed in terms of education and being open to having women work outside. You know, it just happened in less than a generation basically because they saw, I mean, what works more or less and basically they are following some kind of a herma, what's good for the family and what would work and then they are changing the opinion. In fact, my uncle who passed away a few years ago, I mean, he was, at a very old age he changed his opinions about all of these things, on education, on question of work and all of that. So, I think both things have an interplay. So, what is the kind of larger social setting and I think modernity in many ways offers many more opportunities. There are fewer constraints on, people don't feel so hemmed in by their circumstances as much, no need to, so more and more societies offer more opportunities, but you still have to exercise your virtues, you know, and have a sense of your, what is it that you should be doing in a particular situation and what would be the right thing to do for yourself and for your family and for your friends or your society, for your nation, for the world, you know, in that sense. So, it's both of them have to go hand in hand and to be able to, you know, make most of your situation basically."

        "message": "So a bunch of broader questions and one of them sort of, there's this beautiful story I, you know, share with my writing students as an example of really great simple writing and what it can achieve. It's a story called Paper Menagerie by Ken Liu, I'll link it from the show notes. And it's really about a young man discovering his mother anew after she is no more and discovering that, you know, he judged her as what we would call unparagovar kind of person, somebody who was an embarrassment to him, he could never speak to her. And then when he discovers circumstances of his life, he just sees her in a completely new way. And it's an interesting, so I recorded an episode with Natasha Badwar just before this, I don't know whether it will come out before or after this, but she revealed something very interesting. She married someone from a slightly different background, a Muslim man who came from this village, and she grew very fond of his family and vice versa. And she realized that initially, they thought that their respective parents would oppose the marriage and not like each other and all of that. And they found just the opposite. But what she said was that she, that one thing that surprised both of them, both her and her husband, is how much their respective in-laws turned out to be different from the portrait painted of them by their child. So you know, her husband had portrayed his parents and the village and in a particular way, and she meets him and she finds out that no, they are completely different, right? And and vice versa. And the realization there was that there is this human tendency that we have, that we fix, you know, we know a person, they become a fixed point in our head. And then they are that. And that fixed point remains that, you know, they are frozen in our mind as a particular kind of person, even when they change and, you know, those changes can sort of be invisible to us. And roles can do that. Someone is fixed in a particular role, like she says, she looks at a mother so much more differently today in her early 50s, as she did when she was 20, you know, but you can look back and see that, you know, then you are relating with that person just within the bounds of that role and what it means. But now you can look at them as a fully fledged human being and all that. And I'm just thinking that in this fascinating story of your uncle and your father and the younger generation, you and your cousins and all of that, you know, I get a sense from this of your uncle, in one way, being a profoundly interesting man who is faced with difficult choices. He thinks about within, you know, the limited bounds of how he can understand it. He thinks about what is the right thing to do. He makes a choice, that choice involves sacrifice and courage. He does all of that. But it is possible that a kid growing up in the family may just see him as an old fogey and may not ever see that side of him and may not see him."

I mean, you know, they are not held in a manner which is very deep, you know, so you may have all kinds of opinions and they can change at times through experience or you may not even mean that very seriously. But yeah, I mean, there is a, I mean, this is the story of each human being, right? In some ways, there's a lot more than meets the eye and it takes a lot of effort and that's why literature, I think, plays a very important role that it is able to show us this reality of human life and it's very much in our, the nature of human beings to be able to change in some ways, you know, in terms of human nature as such may be permanent, but our ability to change our opinion, adapt to circumstances, do things differently. So another story. Okay. So, I was, I think, 10 years old or something. I used to spend my summer in my village, usually, it's a month or so doing summer vacations. So, I was in my village and I fell ill, very, I mean, I had very high fever and I was just basically bedridden. So, they got me some medicines and I took some, took them, I mean, they were helping the symptoms a little, but the fever wasn't going away. They took me to a proper doctor and they gave the medicines. So, I was taking the medicine, but in the meanwhile, they call this old Muslim gentleman, you know, he must have been at least around 70 at that time. And he said that this guy is unwell and you have to cure him now, you know, like I said, what is he going to do? So he said, he's a, you know, he's a kind of person who does this kind of thing, you know, like, so it's an alternate way of looking at the situation. I was a young kid and I was very much situated in our kind of, you know, what Auden says, believing still versus believing again. I was still believing still stage that you are very naive about these things and you actually accept that, yeah, there is a kind of a magical side of the world and things can be cured in this way. So he gave me a talisman, you can call me and say, you tie it around your arm and then this will cure you, you know. So whatever, it may be placebo or whatever, I think it may have been placebo, but it worked and I got better a few days. And he used to come and talk to me every day for one or two hours and really comforting talk. He was a, I would say, gentle kind of a soul, very refined, uneducated, but very refined in that sense. He was talking in a very, very fine way, you know, his language is very good. He spoke very pure Urdu and he used to live basically 20 meters from our house. And when I got better, he used to still come and talk to me every day for an hour or two. It was just a ritual for him. And he told me that when his family got into trouble many years ago when he was younger, my family basically gave them some land very close to our house for them to settle down. This is a Muslim family, you know, and very conservative Muslim family. And they said that, please, you can, and they had a kacha house at that time and they were living in that house. Then the family did better. So his sons got handloom, got into handloom, learnt a skill which could turn into a kind of a livelihood opportunity. And then they built a pakka house on the same land and they live basically like 20 meters from our house. So village is very much, I mean, divided around communities, but there are these interspersed interesting spaces where people kind of intertwine with each other. And I was just, at that time, it was nothing, you know, it was just something that I had an experience. And that was the last time I met him. A few years later, he passed away and I never got a chance to meet him again. And he gave me a story about how that happened, how that land was given as a, like, this is not a very large farmer, so giving a land is not a small thing. But we had some land and we gave it to a family that was, that needed it. And I was thinking, I mean, just a few months ago about that episode just came to me. My memory had suppressed it. Then just think about it. I mean, we are a Hindu family living in a basically a Hindu area and some small patch of land we gave to a family, a Muslim family to kind of build a small house for some time. Then they basically settled down there. They did better economically, but they still continued to live there and there was no question of taking the land back or anything. It was their home. And it is also that all the neighbors agreed to that, right? Because you're basically family settling down right in that area. And the way our village works is that basically if you go back hundreds of years, it's the same family that basically broke into parts and set up houses nearby. So they are our distant cousins all nearby, but they all agreed to that, you know, to that process. And there was a kind of a very complex intertwining of lives, I would say, which I experienced at that time. That the eldest son of the only member of the family that has moved out to city is he has a high human capital potential. And still you bet on this one guy, you know, magic to cure him while, of course, also giving medicine. You know, that's the way belief works. Last time also when we spoke on the podcast, this kind of a dynamic came up in the discussion. And when you talk to my uncle or someone about their views on Muslims, they were, I mean, a little suspicious, you know, that, okay, they are, they have many wounds of the Mughal Empire and all of that. There are lots of stories that you hear. But the fact of the matter is that there is also this side of it, you know, and that in actual decision making and actually day to day living together, our village has a large number of Hindu and Muslim families both. And in many ways, they are very intertwined. And in some ways, they are separate, you know, so they live in different areas. In some places, as I just gave an example, they also live in the same area as well. So, I think what matters more is that when a situation comes to take a decision, what is to be done, what do you do at that time, what are the, are you following some kind of a, some notion of dharma, I would say, you know, or some notion of virtue or righteousness at that time or not. For the rest, I don't pay too much attention now, at least as I've spent, because my family lives in different centuries at the same time, you know. So we've seen that, you know, how things can change and what really matters and what doesn't matter in some senses. So I told you the story mainly to be able to highlight this, the question that you asked about people and how complex they can be and how their actions can be very different from their stated opinions if you ask them in a survey, whether it's a Pew survey or whatever. So give me a sense of the, you know, but before you get in, there's a book recommendation I can make. So this is a book on Ghazi Mian, which Shahid has written. I think it's worth reading carefully in terms of how modernity changes our imagination of identity and how in a way it hardens it, while also pretending to give us the opportunity to make and remake ourselves continuously and also sometimes it also can harden it. So this is an interesting book about this conquistador who comes to India and gets intertwined in our lives in very, very interesting ways."

        "message": "Actually, my question was just going to be about that, about modernity itself, because, you know, through our lenses and my lens, a lot of my lens really comes from the West in a sense, the Enlightenment and so on. We think of modernity in a particular way, but modernity plays out in, you know, different kinds of subtle ways when it comes to our towns and our villages and all of that. And what you sort of describe here, for example, where opinions on women have, you know, subtly changed over a generation, where you're moving in so many directions and at the same time, it is true, what you said of your family is true of India, that we're living in many different centuries at the same time. So what is your sense of modernity? Like how is that village changing? I can look around me and in a sense, we have a sense of how a city is changing like Bombay or Delhi, and of course, it's deeply complex, and there's a lot there, but it is whatever of that we don't know, I think would fall in the realm of the known unknown. But in villages, which especially for, you know, city slickers like me, is such a dark space and, you know, and it's been either romanticized by Gandhi, who, you know, which he started doing from a time when he hadn't actually been to a village as Ram Guha points out in the 19th century, or it's been condemned with some justification by Ambedkar as a den of localism and all of those vices. But it's a complicated space, it's a complicated space of real people, you know, who are reacting in unusual ways, which are hard to pin down, as you just pointed out through the story. So give me a sense, maybe using your village as an example, that how do we look at modernity in an Indian context? What does it mean to be modern? What does it mean to progress? And is some of this movement in a direction which others may not call modern, which can lead to, like you said about Mr. Amin's book, can lead to a hardening of identities rather than the suffering?"

        "message": "So I'll give you a few kind of images of and then see how, let's see where it goes. So another short story, I went to my village and so to get to my village, you have to take a narrow lane away from, I mean, there's a branching off from the road and then that lane takes you to my village. My cousin had come to pick me up from the bus stand. So then I was on a bike with him and we were going, this is a few years ago. And then as we got into the lane and came near the village, there was a Maruti van, a car parked next to the lane and with this very bright light, fluorescent light glowing from inside and very loud music being played. So I said, this is very odd for us to see that in a village, right? And then some guy is sitting there and drinking Limca, Limca, Coke, mostly Limca. And I said, what's going on? So my cousin said something about, you know, basically a caste related thing that these guys have gone and earned some money abroad from the city and showing off in the village. So I said, yeah, very interesting. So that's one image. Another image is of locked houses. So quite a few people in my village have basically left the village now. I mean, the urbanization is happening at a much rapid pace than perhaps even the official data actually indicates. So lots of people are moving into cities in a manner that the entire family is gone. So lots of houses are now basically locked. I mean, I wouldn't say at the percentage, it may not be very large, but it's conspicuous. So maybe 5% or 10% of the houses are now basically locked. And earlier what used to happen is that obviously some member of the family will go to the city to earn and maybe even settle down like we did. And but there will be people in the village, like in my family, most of the families still live in the village. But there are now families that are basically just up and left and that will have some impact on kind of village life there, you know, if you're part of the village can entirely leave. Third is that you see, and market has entered significant ways. So my village, slightly larger village than the nearby village. So people come there for transactions, economic transactions. So 30 years ago, you could only see basically agriculture commodities being exchanged there on a Thursday market that used to be held in my village. Now you see much more, you know, there are many more products being sold and bought and this much larger market. And this is, of course, outside of the APMC, you know, the India markets work if the state is not looking at it very carefully. So the market has expanded very significantly. This is something I've got a very clear 30 year, year on year time series on what was being sold earlier. I used to go there, we would get five rupees to go and go in the market on Thursday evening. Now it's much more selling, many more people are participating across different caste groups and all of that. So there's urbanization, there is some degree of mobility, I think, as far as people going to cities especially is concerned, there is some degree of market activity in this in the villages. But overall, I think the village productivity story is not taken off. So if you look at my own village land and how much we earn from the land per acre or something, it's a very, very small improvement over 30-40 years. And that's a big problem because it's basically become that so much of the migration in India is now pushed that you don't have anything to do in the village, so you move out and do other things. So we need to get the agriculture, you know, productivity story right, invest in infrastructure, get the markets working, whatever is required. I study a little bit of this, I'm not an expert myself, my colleagues have worked on it, that per acre productivity in countries like Taiwan and China and all is much higher than us and we need to get it right. So that's become a problem because especially for people who have land, you know, it's become like an albatross around your neck or I don't know what the right metaphor is, it basically ties you down in some ways. And in fact, people who don't have land are more free, you know, because they don't have much anyway, so by the way of property, they freely move and go try to find, it's not easy to make it in the city, so I wouldn't underestimate the struggle. But there is at least less to be tied down with. And that is creating, I think, some degree of bad blood also. So I think we are seeing a little bit more of conflict in some ways. I'm just talking about my little microcosm, there's a little bit more conflict across identity groups, a little more perhaps because there is a little bit more envy that people who are supposed to be, you know, in a different class have suddenly, you know, in just a few years gone and gotten a little cash rich, you know, and therefore are able to assert their identities in a little more assertive, more clear way. So it is a time of churning, you know, and it's been a time of churning for because see, I am talking about the last 30 years. So basically, this is a period of, you know, economic renewal in India, revival, renewal, whatever you called it. This is a period in which there has been quite a bit of economic activity in India, even though UP has been not as much touched, but UP has done, I mean, better than it had done earlier. Plus, also people from UP go and work all over the country. So my village, in fact, the main destination is Bombay, you know, people who go out to work, they work in Bombay mostly. Lately, many of them have been going to Kerala, Bangalore also, and some come to Delhi. But main destination is Bombay and Bombay has always had cash opportunities, you know, you land up there and you can make 500 rupees a day, basically at the beginning itself. And that's the thing Bombay even today offers. So even though UP itself hasn't got its kind of economic story, right, there is a long distance migration that is to be done to be able to make some money. My village has always had, at least for last 30 years has that. So this churning is economic and social and also to some extent political, you know, like I see so much of this coalitions happening across because every year, every election there are different party wins in my part of that constituency. So and caste alignments are becoming far more, you know, flexible in some senses. And I think BJP has a lot to do with because BJP has been making claims for all kinds of, you know, because they believe that pretty much anybody who identifies as an Indian can vote for them. So they make claims for everybody's vote basically. So they've been able to make headways into a number of communities and then others have to hit back and try to claim what they think is there. So political mobilization has also become very, very, very intense, I would say. So whenever I go to my village now, there is some kind of, I haven't been in the last two years, so to be very clear, because of various reasons. But until then, whenever you go, basically, there's so much activity happening, you know, like something will be happening, either BJP doing some kind of a Ramayana Katha or some kind of bhajan or some social, we are socially very active and politically also very active. So these things come together sometimes. So one of the things about my village is that it holds the entire Ramayana, this, it stages the Ramayana during the Dussehra time. So every day, so somebody will play Lord Ram, somebody will play Sitaji, somebody will play Lakshman, somebody I used to know, recently used to play Hanuman, he was a local Pehalwan and it used to be a very seriously done thing, you know. So those traditions have continued, but there is a little more commercialization around it. So now they get sponsorships, all of that earlier, it used to be just Chanda, go to hand, family after family, collect Chanda. So I think the association life is still very rich. So there is, there are all kinds, so there is, I know there is a Jawahar Yuva Mandli, which is basically, it's kept after Nehruji's name, that it's an association of young people. Most of them are BJP supporters, but Mandli is still called Jawahar Yuva Mandli. But then there is a Gau Raksha Samiti, but not the kind that gets the bad news, but they take care of cows that are basically abandoned by others and all of that. There is a market and I think because more resources have become available, a little more than earlier, people are able to do these things in a slightly grander scale. So yeah, so there is churning, there is a little more conflict, there are more opportunities overall. There is more opening to different people of different identities, men or women of different groups. And I mean, I would say, I mean, to put a long story short is that we are modernizing,"

        "message": "you know, in our own way. Yeah, and those two stories, the first two stories you told have such resonant images. I mean, I can totally imagine a book called The Village of Locked Houses, or the image of people drinking Limca in a car with fluorescent light from inside. And both those stories in one sense are stories of escape. Like in the Limca case, it's like you pointed out a bunch of people, they are trapped within this caste identity and so on. But then they go to a city and they feel like with, you know, with what they've earned and living a better life, perhaps they can transcend it, perhaps they can escape it. And the other story of locked houses is again, very overtly a story of escape, you want to get away from the village. And you spoke about how, you know, a lot of people leave villages and go to cities because of the push factor. It is not what is attracting them. But it is life is so nasty, brutish and short, as it were."

        "message": "And if you have better opportunities, you go out. So, my question, therefore, is about how have aspirations changed? Because I imagine that in an earlier generation, you know, your typical aspirations would be that if life is tough in a village and you can't make it there, that you get some kind of government job somewhere, either in the village or the nearby town or the city or whatever. But you get a government job because the government is everything back in the day before liberalization and you become part of the rent seeking apparatus and being part of the government raises your social status and all of that comes into play, right? But in these times where, number one, markets are much more visible, there are many more different kinds of opportunities. And number two, technology and the spread of the smartphone, especially post geo, when broadband kind of became much more widely available, you know, how does that change aspirations and the way that you look at the world and all of that? And how does all that also change the politics, because I imagine in the past, from the views I have, and you can correct me if they are not nuanced enough, but in the past, I would imagine that your village politics would really revolve around two things. One is you vote for whatever tribe you have taken, and I don't literally mean tribe, but whichever side you have taken, so you get some of the spoils of power are shared with you or shared by whatever identity grouping you're part of that you voted for. And the other is an assertion of that tribal feeling, you know, a lot of voting is actually all voting is in a sense irrational at the individual level, because one vote doesn't make a difference. But people still do it for a variety of complicated reasons, one of which is you're asserting your identity, you're saying I'm part of this group, you know, I'll go to watch a, you know, Manchester City match, because that's my tribe, right? So I'll go vote for Bhajapal or whatever, because that's my tribe. And I would imagine these would in the past have been the dominant two reasons for voting. And I'm wondering if aspirations regarding to that have also changed since you point out that politics has become much more fluid, in a sense. So, you know, in contrast with what we think about voter apathy, like, again, I have an old impression from a long while back, you probably know better, that people in urban areas vote less than people in rural areas. Is that true?"

        "message": "But it's also a secure job, other privileges, as I said. So it's still there, but it's basically become like a lottery, okay, you'll get it and some people who are good in studies, they aspire to good government jobs, like they write UPSC exams and all. Although once in a generation, once in five, six years, somebody will crack a serious like PCA, Professional Civil Services or IAS exam. Others will try to get entry into CRPF and police and all and that's a larger number, much larger number. I know at least quite a few people personally who have become, who at least got into CRPF or BSF and all these kind of places where you have a clear entry condition and you pass that and you can get in. For the rest, as you said, rightly, that the economy has changed significantly and we are one country, so whenever, see, it's just a question of longer train rides, right? Because you take overnight, you get to Delhi, a little over, more than overnight, get to Delhi. Travel for 12 more hours, you get to Bombay, you travel for 12 more hours, you get to Bangalore and travel a little more. And then, I mean, if you're going there for a long time and you're trying to, and it's not an issue. And one of the things that I think about India is that you feel like it's India wherever you go. Because that's something that I always felt, I've been to most states of India and you feel some kind of familiarity, very strangely, but language is very different, cuisine is quite different. But there is, in the unconscious, there is something about Indian, of course, go to temple, you see some other form of the deity, but you see, you can make a connection, you know, like I didn't have as much difficulty doing darshan in temples in the south, you know, because I could see where the larger mythology is coming from. So anyway, so the point of the matter is that the opportunities have really increased in terms of, not in my village as such, they have increased a little, but you know how UP is and how it's not been as bad as, say, some states like Bihar have done, but it has also not done as well as some of the states like Haryana and Tamil Nadu and all of them. But so you have the opportunity to move out. So there's a lot of seasonal migration, basically, to get a fine and have a footing in the urban area. So I'm now talking about large numbers. So there are some who get a government job or something, some who get a better higher quality private job, like a formal job. But most of them, actually, most of the people can't do that, you know, even, even if you have a slightly better family, if unless you have very good studies and all, it's very difficult to do that. So there are two paths, either you go and work as a entry level worker in any, you can get into a private bank, basically trying to, in the sales side, if you have got a little bit of education, or if you are actually you got no education, then you have to basically work as a manual labourer and then work and get some skills. So within that there are directions, some people have become contractors, or some people who went as manual labourers, then in 10 years, they became contractors who then started sourcing labourers from from our village. Then that's so that's one set of paths, there is a trading path. So you start trading something, so you start getting stuff from some other part of the country and selling here or get take something from here and sell somewhere else. Because markets have become a little more, you know, vibrant, there are more opportunities of that kind. So for example, in my village, there are a few shops that get the person takes a truck travels to Punjab, buys clothes and sells here at 2x basically the price, and including the transaction costs of going and coming and and still the reasonable business, somebody does the same thing with shoes, they'll go to Agra or somewhere else and get it. So the opportunities are now much greater, agriculture has become basically a much smaller part of the economy. That's the main main thing that has happened. So earlier as a share of the activities in village, if you're a landless labourer, something and it's not just NREGA, NREGA has had an impact on that as well, because it's pushed the wages up. But there's just so many other opportunities going on at the same time, because the economy is growing and not just maybe not in UP, but you just see Haryana is the richest large state in the country in per capita income, and it's basically overnight from our from our part of the country. So you can just go there and if you go to Gurgaon, you will you will end up earning at least a decent way so that and what you send back is actually has a much more purchasing power, right? Even if you send back 200 rupees a day, that 200 rupees a day goes a long way in the village as cash goes. So the so economic aspirations have really diversified a lot. So people are seeking different paths, because they're also good at different things. And obviously, you have to keep maintaining the dynamism in the economy to be able to do that, you know, to have these opportunities growing. So I think these are still I'm talking about mostly about men. For women, it's still if you're a woman born in a village, still there are very few paths that are available to you directly, unless you get very like, I know, one of my neighbor's daughter, she actually got very good, she's very good at studies, she got admission in Ames, you know, and did medicine there and basically settled here in national capital territory only. And but that's very rare, otherwise, basically, the best thing you can aspire to be is a government school teacher, still, because one of the main reasons is very poor quality education in my village. So I told you about my father and how he studied in a village school. And there were two good teachers there, who basically, you know, there's, I think Henry James, a teacher, she's at Trinity, you know, so it's like that he they basically were so virtuous and so devoted to the what you call goods internal to the practice of teaching, you know, they were just enjoy teaching so much, that they just changed lives, you know, and now this just gone. And that just shapes the paths of so many kids in my village. So the small number that I'm talking about, who are able to get good jobs and all could be much larger, if you had just one good teacher, or one good school with two, three good teachers, who just did their basic duties, you know, and then there's so much hunger in this in my part of the in my village, on young kids, whenever I go and try to talk to them or what they plan, they just want to get ahead, you know, they're young, they're full of dreams. But I feel that many of them will basically settle down at something which is much below their potential. So when my father retired, he started this practice of basically going and doing counseling for kids in village schools. So he used to just take here a driver in a car, just go and give a talk to all the students in a school orientation talk, then give each of them a psychometric test of their aptitude. These are the ninth or 10th standard kids. So they have some, some understanding of, you know, some aptitude has formed in some sense is clear, what is a good direction for them to take, and then give them some guidance. He developed these tools with some psychology professors in Gorakhpur University only who also seemed keen to at least contribute to their community in some ways. And he did, there was thousands of kids, you know, to just give them some kind of guidance about what would be good for them, what would be a suitable path for them. And he used to tell me the hunger with which he was, you know, received, because nobody would talk to them, you know, nobody would say, see, internet is full of a lot of information, but guidance is not information, guidance is somebody has to take interest in you, you know, somebody has to care about you, somebody has to follow you up and somebody has to push you when you're feeling down, you know, and that's just missing from our, I mean, at least in my village, the private schools that we have and the government school, and I'm sorry to say one of the private school is run by my family also, where the teachers simply are not, they're just going through the motions, you know, and whenever we try to say, okay, can you do it, but the whole economy is set up in such a way that you get teachers who pay a little, you can't pay as much, you know, in a private school as the government schools get paid. And they do it only as a part time thing, and you lucky once in a while, you find a good teacher, but then they leave and go elsewhere. In the government school, they get paid a very good entry salary for a young teacher in government school is several times of the per capita income of that village. But they don't teach and that's a big problem, I think, because for the private or government, nobody teaches basically, people send under the illusion that private schools are doing better, but they have better, you know, looks, so to speak, in terms of, you know, teachers come on time and leave on time. But whether you're learning, I really doubt it. So that's become a very big impediment to opportunities are there. And if you had a little bit better thing going for you, more guidance, not even so much skill, you know, like, if you look at like low end manufacturing, decent salaries, one of my neighbors, I mean, a few not neighbor like 50 meters away from us, he got a job in escort a young man, and his whole family got lifted out of difficulty because he and then he got his brother also there. Then his nephew also got, you know, three people with a formal sector job, their entry level only, but they got skilled in the on the job because see, at entry level jobs in manufacturing, you don't need to be a very well educated person, they'll train you, apprenticeship works very well. Only thing is some basic education and some guidance key where to go and where to look that even that is sometimes missing this is kind of a big information asymmetry, there are transaction costs that come in the way. And there is, I think, if more of that would be there, then these aspirations will be fulfilled in a more in a better way, but markets are working. So more or less, we'll have better situation than if we had earlier, but public systems and even the private systems on education and all are failing. And it's a greatest tragedy, I see, because I've grown up with these guys, like who are my eyes to play with them. Now, I'm in my late 30s. They're also late 30s. They have nothing, you know, like a childhood friend of mine, he drives a taxi in the village from one place to another and then plies and it's a hard life. It's a very tough life. It's also not a life of great dignity, because people don't treat you very well. So it's a and I mean, I wouldn't say I don't know what he would have done, who knows. But I mean, if just a different setting, he would have done completely different, his life would have been very different. So overall Indian economy is a low middle income economy. So it's not like we're a rich country. And within that, I think these failures of systems in our part of the world makes it even harder. Now on the politics, I mean, which is all intertwined in this, because it's like democracy is working its way through India, and it's been working its way through India 77-75 years. There is more or less now a sense of you know, that even in my lifetime, you know, I've born about halfway into the democracies life. And I've seen like, there is much more of a sense of equality people, the way people assert themselves and talk, you know, there's a much more subservient sense, if you're poorer than you would assume that you are inferior, you know, in that sense, forget about whether I, a person of upper caste will say that you are inferior, there was a subjective sense that your place in society is such and such. And that I think is so significantly changed in just last 25 years itself that I've seen. Because this whole, that local myth has broken, right, like there's now boundaries are broken, urbanization, capitalism, all of that has come in. And there's, it's just much more of a, when people talk, they'll say, okay, we're talking with peers, you know, and there is some degree of at least democratic equality is there and everybody's people vote very enthusiastically in my village, like 70% types, turnouts. And in fact, India generally does very well for its level of development in terms of voter turnout. It's a pretty and it's improving in the last few years, so much for the death of democracy. But people are voting and they're participating. And, and that's the process through which any change has to happen. It's not, you may not like what they vote for, but you have to still, I mean, engage with that process. That's, that's the right mechanism that we built as a people. So, and that is what you see, as I said earlier, there is much more mobilization. And when politicians come, there is the rallies are raucous, like, there is so much discussion and so much conversation, so much questioning. And, you know, it's a, it's a very interesting thing, you know, in fact, India scores very highly, even if you look at the data and all of it is very highly on citizen participation in these kind of forums. So, people will go like, there is a power station near my village, substation, through which other villages get power. Whenever there's a power cut, if it's too long, people will go and do dharma, dharna there. Once they tried to actually break it down also, it's a self-defeating kind of, that was many years ago. But they will resist, they will try to fight, they will try to, you know, voice their opinion. So, it's, I mean, if you're sitting in your room, and you're assuming that Indian citizens are apathetic, and they're not worried about the common good or association life of democracy, it's not true, simply not true, at least in my part of the village, many where I've lived in many cities, I've traveled the length and breadth of this country. I think it's a very, you know, we are, we are now understand that we are a democracy, and we citizens more or less, to various degree, each individual has a different view, think that we have a say, we, our voice is there, and we can exercise it may not always work, the state is very impervious and a little opaque and often also very quite low capacity. So, many things will not get done. But you go to a government office is full of people trying to petition for something or the other, you know, it's full, people are approaching, they have trust in institutions, they want to institutions to work better. So, participation in electoral democracy is one thing, sense of democracy as a equality of people is, is one thing. And then assertion with the state and demanding the state to do more is also I mean, one thing. And I think in all these three, there is compared to say 30 years ago or 25 years ago, I would say 25 years ago, because that's when I became a teenager. So, I have a sense of what was going on a little bit before that I was a very young kid. So, it's, there's a directionality is I think, I mean, much more of a spread of democracy, I would say at least, and I'm talking about Eastern UP, you know, which is actually a pretty underdeveloped part of the country economically, socially very conservative. But look at the politics is so much churning, you can't take your seat for granted. You know, you can't take, nobody can take your seat for granted, you may whatever caste, you have to still come and ask for my vote, and I can vote you out. And every, every election some other person wins, some other party wins, you have to still make that make that demand. And then hopefully, you will be honoured with my vote or you will not be."

And so when we talk, we talk about what's going on in the village. He asked me about my life in the city. And, you know, let's we go to our, to the farm and we walk around. I mean, there's no grand theme in the conversation, right? It's just a, you know, like,"

        "message": "Yeah, so I think, so he, let me be very clear, he wasn't very good at studies. So his expectations were very modest. I mean, he got into bad company at a young age or whatever. But even then he would have at least he got a job in a factory, you know, he did high school and all of that, that didn't happen, you know, and after you miss the bus, you miss the bus, you know, at that time, and I also didn't have the way to, you know, get help him at that time, we were roughly the same age, he's slightly older. So then he took this path, he started driving, he was driving with the big auto that you have there, you know, like, which can have 25 people inside it, then he started driving a taxi, he's trying to drive, buy a car and basically drive his own car. There is some sense of what you call, see, the good thing about the village life is that your basic consumption is not to be worried about. If you're living in the village, and you have a little bit of cash, you'll be okay, you don't have to pay rent, you know, you don't have to say, so there is that. So it's like the city, city poor can be very, very harsh life, you know, very harsh, like you can, why do people just walk back to their villages, you know, because this whole city ecosystem is very cash intensive. Everything is paid for, you have to pay for the rent, you have to pay for the power, you have to pay for water, everything you have to pay for. And if your cash flow stops one day, you're done, you can't stay here for one minute or two. And anybody who knows India knows this, the reality of India. So people just literally walk back, there's no train, there's no bus, I'll just walk back to home because there was urban poverty, rural poverty, and he's not, I mean, very poor, right? He has some income, his brother also owns a little in the city and sends a little bit of money back to his family. So he has got some sense of, I mean, stability in that. But yeah, there is always once in a while that conversation about the counterfactual that what if he had got a job in a factory. He did try, he went to Kerala once, but he couldn't make it there. He tried to go to Gulf once, but that didn't work out. He was almost scammed, he got the money back eventually. But so these things they've tried, I mean, everybody tries these things in my part of the, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't, it doesn't. But if you look at overall the number of people who have been able to be mobile economically compared to say 30 years ago, it's not even close, it's not even close. Earlier, it was just a few small people who could get good education. Some who could just deal with the hardship of I mean, the limited opportunities that are there basically in Bombay and a couple of other places. Now it's just spread out. There are some people who go to Gujarat also now and earlier that wasn't at all a migration pipe from my part. Like Odisha to Gujarat pipe is very well known, South Gujarat, South Ayushan to Gujarat is quite significant. So there are these like, but now it's very spread out and people are trying to find opportunities and it's a hard life. It's a very hard life, because you have to live away from the family. That's a very tough thing because you can't, there's no, when you're seasonal migration, you can't really take your family to eat up all your resources. So it's a very tough life. But once you make it there, then you settle down and then you are an amphibian."

        "message": "And it's interesting how language evolves, like people call people from UP who come to Bombay, they're typically called bhaiyas, right? So once we had a domestic help at home, and we asked her where she's from, and she said, main to bhaiyan hoon, which was an interesting evolution of the language. So the next big question that I want to drill down on is what you mentioned earlier, where you spoke about teachers, that your father was lucky that he had good teachers, and how most teachers are going through the motions and all of that. And what you meant by good teachers, I'm guessing was not someone who is teaching the syllabus well, you know, ki geography achche se para diya, ya math achche se para diya. There's something else you meant by teacher, that, you know, you spoke about the virtues of it, that aspect of it of how a good teacher can lift you. So a good teacher in that sense is not just teaching you what's in the syllabus, in a sense, he's within the system, but he's also standing outside the system. He's, in a sense, helping shape your character, showing you something that you may not otherwise see. So can you elaborate on this for me, both in the microcosmic context of that particular village, and you know, what your father may have picked up from those teachers or what you may have picked up later from teachers who inspired you? And can you and that's a microcosmic context, but also a broader context, that everybody needs teachers in their lives, right? And most of us, if we are fortunate, we'll probably find we might find teachers who are actually in that official position of authority in a school or a college, or we might find teachers elsewhere in life mentors or people who teach us things and all of that. So elaborate a little bit on both these microcosmic and macrocosmic aspects. And in the macrocosmic aspect, perhaps even, you know, a sense of that, do you sometimes feel that you have a responsibility also, to pay it back not in a formal sense, but in the sense of if you have something to teach, if you can touch somebody's life in some way, that lifts him a little bit that you should do that. So take me through all of this, a big question, I know."

        "message": "Yeah, it is a big question. It's about life itself. So I think, so there was a teacher in my father's school before he went to school, this is a story that he heard, who used to insist when it came to the 10th standard that the bottom third of the class in the 9th standard, he will teach. And then he would use to produce good results from them in 10th. He said, this is my duty that I will take the worst performing third on the 9th standard, or fourth or third, whatever, but the basically the people who are doing very badly. And then he will make it his life's mission to spend a year with them and basically prove that you know, there's nothing wrong with the kids is basically, you know, you as a teacher can do a lot, even if there's something wrong, there's a long, big dent that a teacher can make, you know, a good teacher. It should be all consuming, right? It's a very intensive process, not just going through the class. Lots of kids require special attention, you have to spend a lot of time after the class and to keep track of this. So one story that a friend of mine who's a very senior civil servant in the government now, he told me that when he was in school, he was in 11th standard or entered just 12th standard, his teacher called him home. Okay. And she gave him a piece of paper in which the list of top 100 of CBSE in CBSE exam, the students was given. And he said, this is the list of people who came in the top 100 this year, you need to be on it next year, what do I need to do to make sure that happens? You know, and, and he did, he came in top 20 in the country. So I went to St. Stephen's and all of that. And I mean, but he's, yeah, he's a great guy. So now do two different categories. One is this guy who says, okay, I'm going to raise a large number of kids who are not doing well to a level of standard in which they're able to get through the 10th, you know, and then they will find a path, hopefully forward. And then there is the other, where you point at a few kids who just need a little bit, you know, special attention to go that extra mile and basically get to a completely different league, right? So teaching involves both of these things. I've not really done teaching in my life, but I have been on the other side of the racing that you need both. I mean, you need to be in a larger setting in which education is happening and whatever, or learning is considered to be a good, to be an important thing and it's being pursued. And sometimes in life, you need somebody to give you that extra push, you know, where you're lost and you don't know where you're headed, you need guidance, you need mentorship. And more than that, you just need emotional support, you know, that, yes, I have faith in you, you don't have faith in me, you know, and that actually, you know, I, it's kind of a preference that is there inside the person, you know, who's the teacher. And I'm not one of those believers, I have a lot of long standing debates with friends about incentives and all shaping it. These are virtues that actually people basically, the combination of factors, perhaps something to do with their childhood, how they socialize, how they saw they got into this profession, and how they saw it as a meaning of their life, you know, in that sense, how they saw. So we can talk about the philosophical framing of it, like the way Alessandra McIntyre and all of these guys have done about how to think about virtues. But it's something which is which happens, I mean, I would say upstream of the markets, in some senses, you know, it happens. And then these are the preferences, which then the market can take and do whatever it wants to do with it, it can reward them or punish them as well in certain circumstances. Like there are situations in markets punish bad behavior, because a good doctor may take a long time to treat a patient. And the markets may, I mean, the way the hospital corporates are set up, they may want to do it in a quick way, so that you have a lot of people are being churned out quickly. So and then there is a conflict between virtues and the working of the market in that particular setting, you know, markets also have work in segmented way, you may find a good segment in which you are actually the best place, because that segment rewards this kind of a performance with respect to your patients, patient. So I think what you need, especially in a country like India, where you have still a long way to go, we are quite poor, you know, we are a lower middle income country, is that you need to basically have lots of teachers who are, who have at least raised the basic standard up, you know, like, do the basic thing that teach the kids on a regular basis, get them to a minimum standard, and then they'll find it. And then you will have a few who just go above and beyond. And they say that I'm going to give my life to it in some senses. And for that, you need, I mean, I don't know how that is done, you know, because I've seen I've, I've been lucky to have some mentors in my life, like, maybe it'll make them uncomfortable if I name them here. But there are people who have touched my life in very important way. My father was one, my mother, my, my, my uncle, I said,"

He came from a, he had a hero's journey from the village to a city and he settled down here, he, he got an education, he got a decent stable job. In his 40s, he did his PhD, again from BHU. And then after the retirement, he goes out and helps kids who are really hungry for guidance and support and all of that. My some of them may not be very comfortable. I talk about them in public. My uncle, I told you how much my uncle and aunt both how they took control of their family took charge and how basically they saved the family from utter ruin. Utter ruin, you know, it would have been a complete ruin if they hadn't performed their duties at that time. And in fact, it was a very difficult time generally for the for our village. There was one year in which there was a major drought. For two consecutive, there was a major drought. He literally had to walk for 50 kilometers to be able to get some help from a distant family, you know, walk with up they took a bullock cart and all. It's part of our family lore. And I mean, he's the kind of person so I remember I went to village once and I had a Spanish Ark beer and he saw it and said, this won't do. I immediately removed it. There was a question that I want to debate with him. It's my right or whatever. He didn't like a Spanish Ark beer. He said, this one, this is not looking good."

And I landed in a village and he said, this is not looking good on you. This is not going to do. I just removed it. A lot of fear. I just loved him, you know, that I had a sense that this is I come from these people, you know, and whatever I am is because of these people and my father and my mother, my uncle and my aunt and I have a written history of eight generations back and I know the stories and how much it takes to keep a family together to have to stabilize in this world, especially in a poor country, you know, we were poor at that time. Now we're low middle income country. It's hard, especially in that Eastern UP and Bihar context. So there is a sense of my mother's side, for example, my Nana ji was like that. He also came from a village and he became a teacher. He was a college teacher in Agra and he came from Eastern UP again from Azamgarh and he was again a very, very amazing person, you know, he did his PhD and all of that. He became a teacher. He wrote a book, which is still going on in Hindi book on research methods, which is still in circulation as in taught. I have a copy of that book, very nicely written book. Anusandhan Parichay. So it's an introduction to research methods. So, and he came from a, he used to teach in a village school and then he got into college and then he did his PhD and became a professor and all of that. Very happy man, you know, one of the happiest persons I've ever met. Always smiling, always laughing, always joking, always trying to make everybody very happy. He passed away many years ago, but I was like, he passed away 15 years ago. Yeah. So I was not that young, I was still in 20s. So he, he was also like that. And many of the stories of people who actually make these difficult journeys, you know, and are like, and each family has this, you know, like, these are the great heroes, you know, and they are, they live private lives. And their heroism is basically limited to the, to serving the immediate good, which is the good of the family and the friends and the communities, you know. He started a school back in his village, which ran for many years. I don't know whether it's still running. In fact, that part of my family, my mother's side has left the village. So the village home is literally logged now, because everybody moved to the city. So another one logged home. So he was there. And when I was in school, I had a few teachers who really helped me out. I, when I started working, I mean, I had last 11-12 years, I've had a number of mentors, not a number, a few really good mentors, who I look up to, they're very virtuous people. Especially one person, I will not name him, you know him. He's an economist. I don't want to embarrass him. But I really look up to him as someone, a very decent human being, you know, and very good person to learn from, not just economics, but also about life and things in general, and consistently good person. I've known him for not 12 years. And I've never had a feeling about him that there is something, what you see is what you get with him. It's a very, very, very interesting, very good thing to have in a mentor. So, yeah, I think it's a very, so this is how societies improve, I think, like one person at another time, and you go through an internal process. In some ways, I've improved as a person over the last 10 years. And I'm trying to get better, you know, and it's a journey that you go through internally and others can help you, you know. And there is a very important role that others can play. In that sense, we are not completely isolated human beings, we are very open to influence, but not lecturing. In subtle ways, you know, like Jung has this insight on how, if you want to change somebody, then, you know, Gandhi also had the same insight that you want to be the change. I think it's a misquote, he didn't say that, but it's often attributed to him, is that, you know, you have to be the change, you have to see the world. Similarly, Jung has a very interesting portion in one of his last books, Undiscovered Self, where he writes about how in some tribes that he was observing in the Pacific Islands, it was this, there was a term, I forget this term, it was called, it'll come to me. It was basically a quality of a person that you just watch him and observe him and try to, you know, don't copy his bannerisms, just try to, you know, take his character in some ways, you know, in some senses, it's almost like a mystical participation in that person's personality. And you're trying to, and that's the way to, you know, lecturing and hectoring is not the way any human being changes, it puts us in a defensive mode. It's much more of a, we learn and get better by observing others who are better than us. One of my favorite examples on this is this Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was a great, great author. And I loved love his work. And he was one of the great thinkers on human nature and very, very humane kind of a writer. And there's a book called The Life of Marianne. Oh, this very young girl who was stricken by cancer and she passed away at a very young age. And there was a convent in which she was being taken care of. And the convent basically took care of only cancer stricken or very badly sick kids. And this young girl was very, very, what you call, was considered to be a bundle of joy and very wiser than her age, basically nine or eight or nine years of age, very wise, and made everybody very happy. And of course, she passed away later. So, then the nuns from that convent came to Flannery O'Connor, who's also a great southern writer, America, really great writer. I love her work and said, why don't you write her life? So, Flannery said, I am in no position to write any life of a person I didn't know, but she sounded like a perfect, great, great person and you should write it, the nuns should write it. And I'll happily write a foreword to it. So, in the foreword she writes actually very interestingly, it's a very interesting life to read about, her foreword is also more interesting, is how Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was a very humane person who wrote a number of very interesting stories about human life and dignity of human life and the beauty of imperfection and I mean, basically the antithesis to the Aldous Huxley's, you know, utopia of trying to make best human being by taking chemicals and by doing genetic engineering and all that, taking human life as it is. And his daughter started this convent. And in a way, she draws a line between one of his stories, Hawthorne's stories and the life path that his daughter took when she started the convent to take care of young stricken children who were terminally ill. And then how this little kid who got a good life, even though short life, a good life in a convent because of that. So, I think that is the main thing that I have learned more recently in life, I wish I had learned it earlier is that, you know, the big ideas and the abstract thinking and discussions and great grand ideologies are one thing and maybe in some context, they are useful. But the most important thing is to, you know, nurture these ways of improving things, whether it is in professions, different professions, in which good virtuous professionals can create role models for others and help others and aid others, whether it is within families, you know, how to be a good father and how to be a good mother. It is not easy, none of this is easy, not easy to be a good professional, not easy to be a good parent, not easy to be a good professional, good worker, good politician or anything like that. All of that is challenging because there are so many necessities, quote unquote, and demands. But I think that is the main thing that needs to sustain, there is a hidden thing which we do not see in the, because it is kind of a quality which is not easily captured. But that is a hidden thing that makes a civilization, country great and other things can flow from there, other utilities can flow from there. But this kind of a continuity of good, you know, that and that is it. So I think that is the way I draw the arc in teaching and life and all of that. How important\u2026"

Thereby kind of missing the point in the sense that the answer to the question is not the point, but the thoughts that can spark other points. So, I certainly found it very illuminating and it, I think did its job of giving me more questions to ask. The first of which is this, how important to you is the rootedness which you feel? Like you mentioned, that you know the genealogy of your family going back a long way, that you feel rooted in that village, you know, your friends are still there, your family is still there, all of that, and you carry that with you. And I'm guessing part of that rootedness is not just a memory of people or a sense of place, but also this bedrock of values that, you know, you carry with you. And I see myself in a sense in contrast to that, that I don't really feel that rooted. And it's a loss, it's something that I bemoan, that I do feel, you know, deracinated. And I mean, I see, I embrace the positive aspects of what comes out of that, the fact that I feel like a citizen of the world, I take ideas from everywhere, my influences are from everywhere. But I also see the loss that there is. And maybe you and I are sitting here, and you are an extremely rooted person, and I'm not. And maybe it's a good time for you to sort of talk about what you feel your rootedness brought you in terms of the way you think and the way you see the world, and how it would be different from somebody like me, like what is perhaps then lacking in my vision, like one of the themes that I've looked at in past episodes also, is that many of our English speaking elites, like myself, grew up in this small urban bubble, where we looked at the country the wrong way, we didn't really know this country, right. And one way of reacting to understanding the country when we do see it, see it a little better, is to perhaps swing to a negative extreme, like I might sometimes have done and say, Oh, we are so bigoted, we are so illiberal, we are so this, we are so that, right, which also might be an overreaction to whatever. But, you know, so just going back to that sense of what does rootedness bring you? And what do you think the absence of that rootedness does to somebody?"

My family has been in that one spot for 400 years, same house, same place as house has been 400 years, it's been made, built and rebuilt many times. We have a written record of eight generations, we have some sense of who we are, but it only goes some way, you know, it's, it's just a sense of gratitude that, okay, there are people who started the family, who kept it together, who continued the kind of values that went into our family, who had different difficult junctures, kept things together when they could have fallen apart, they kept the center held, so to speak. And there is that. But if you look at me, I actually, a lot of what I have learned is not just, I mean, that's the base, like, I would say that's the bedrock. And then you go and it's great, right, to be in the modern world, you can read and think and talk about, talk to anyone, you can learn from many, many sources. See, one word that I always grew up hearing is dharma, dharma, dharma. It's like, okay, what's dharma, it's difficult to define, but you know, it's a, it's a basically a way of thinking about what is the right thing to do, you know, and what would work in some sense. And then you need to learn, you know, it's not, there's no substitute for practical judgment. And practical judgment requires learning from many, many sources. And for that, you need to be able to open and I mean, you know, it's not like I figured things out, I'm still struggling and learning and trying to get better at what I do, whatever I do. And that, for that the sources are many, right. But I got basic set of, you know, starting because of my, what my father did, my uncle did, and others may have done. And that's my past. And that's my history. And I'm very cognizant of that. Not a day goes by before I feel gratitude for what they've done for me in some sense. Because, but because of the way I am in my family, nobody ever talks about this stuff. I'm sitting here and talking about it in a podcast.

It wasn't much of a demand, you know, I remember when my I got married, within a year, my wife had to, we had to go to higher studies in the US. And my uncle was one of the first ones to support it. You know, he's a 75 year old man living in a village. And within a year of a village, I mean, so called daughter-in-law of the family is going abroad for a few years to study. And he was the first to support it, you know, because and he's the guy who for 30 years ago, I remember had very, very conservative views, not just for job or even on education, only teaching job is good, all of that is good. And so I mean, there are people who earn respect, you know, in some senses, because they act according to situation they learn, they change, and they do what's good in many ways. So I'm very grateful for all that, that I mean, a certain kind of in fact, I wish I was able to make more of what I got from them, you know, it is my own feeling that I'm not a better person or a more virtuous person. I'm not done more contribute in many ways, you know, it is my own feeling and I could do more. And to be able to do more one has to actually expand, you know, it has to venture out and understand how things work, learn and you know, it's a, but it's the love that one gets from there. Like one of my favorite quotes is from Chesterton, that he wrote somewhere that Romans didn't love Rome because Rome was great. Rome was great because Romans loved Rome, you know. So, and that's the foundation. I mean, one loves one family, one village, one community, one country, even if they have done you some harm, you know, and they may have like, we've been betrayed so many times as a family by others in our village, there have been violence, there are a number of court cases going on. I mean, in fact, one member of the family is always fighting court cases, designated that this person will go and appear in the court. So much conflict, violence, all of that has happened, but we still, this is our village, this is our family, we love each other. And there is a tension and conflict with that, all that happens. So, then the question comes how to make Rome great. And for that you need to be, you know, the past is not a great guide, it's just a little bit you get from there, a sense of rootedness. And there actually, in some ways people like you have more advantages because you are much more seeing and learning and I learn a lot from you and others, like my friend, friends in the economics side. I'm not an economist, but I learn a lot from economists, political scientists, I learn a lot from different people and say, because my work is in political economy. So, I try to learn as much as I can to be able to say how we can, how the Indian economy can grow better, how can we do better. Similarly, I work a little bit on professions. So, I learn, in fact, my main thinking on professions initiated by Alasdair MacIntyre, who is a, I mean, completely rooted in the Western tradition of philosophy, Aristotelian and Thomist and you know that tradition. But one can actually learn from many, many places because dharma is universal, you know, and there is a, I mean, it is not something which is a monopoly of a particular people. In fact, that's, that would be the completely wrong way of thinking about it. It's about what you, how you think about the world and what you do. And there, actually, you see a lot of dharma all over the world in many ways and one has to be able to learn and see what is, what would work, you know, what would be practically the right thing to do and morally also the right thing to do at the same time. That's the combination that you need to be able to do. And for that, being open, learning from the world, understanding things from different perspectives, you know, because you don't see, from your perspective is only one side of the mountain and there are other sides of the mountain. So, you need to talk to others, learn, you know, you need to wake up with the moderns, spend the day with the medievals, retire with the ancients, you know, and have a sense of all encompassing perspective to form a world view and then contribute. That's in the world of think tanks and intellectualism as in where I am. But suppose you are working in a bank, you can still feel rooted in your family, but you still have to be a good banker, right? You need to figure out how to do banking well, how to be a good banker. If you are a teacher, you have to do that. Whether you are a, if you are a civil servant, you still have to figure it out. But the love for this land or this people, we as a people and our whole long history of common suffering and struggles and the way we have come is the root on which all of that stands, basically. That's the way I look at it. That root is not the future, but that is where we come from."

        "message": "So, I want to now move to the question of virtue and there are many angles to it, but I'm going to start with the personal angle in the sense that, you know, one question that I ask myself a lot is how should we live our lives, right? How do we live our lives? How do we think about what is the right thing to do and what is the wrong thing to do? And I think how we come up upon it early in life is there's a conventional way of thinking this is good, that is bad and we kind of go by that. And of course, you know, we are hardwired in certain ways with different sort of codes, which often conflict with each other. There's a great book by Robert Wright called The Moral Animal, which kind of talks about some of this and that's one sort of way of looking at it. But, you know, those are knobs that nature gives you and nurture turns them and nurture turns them in different ways where you pick up values from your immediate surroundings. You know, religion is one codification of it, but that's also diffuse and contextual. But then there comes a time where you actually start thinking about it, where you go beyond your broad moral instincts, as it were, and you start thinking about, you know, what is a good way to live one's life? And why is it a good way to live one's life? And start thinking along those terms. So what's sort of your journey been towards? And I asked you this question, I won't ask many others this question, but I asked you this question, because I know you've thought about this deeply read about it deeply done that self reflection. And it's something I struggle with in the sense that struggle with in the sense that it's an ongoing journey, obviously, for everyone. But so I'd be very interested in knowing what was your intellectual journey towards, you know, figuring out what one should do, like we've been using the term dharma. And, you know, we can talk about it in the context of professions after this. But first, I kind of want to focus on the personal, that when it comes to your dharma as a person, or perhaps broken into roles, your dharma towards your family or dharma towards your wife and kids and so on, you know, how have you thought about it? Who are the writers? What are the books that have shaped your thinking on this? And what are the lessons that you feel you've learned in time?"

        "message": "Yeah, so I don't think this is an intellectual kind of exercise. I mean, one reads about these things, but I think it's much more of an experiential thing. And one has to engage with one's situations and try to do the best one can. And sometimes one can get it wrong. Sometimes one can get it right. And later you realize whether you got it wrong or right. But yeah, I think reading and thinking about these things helps talking about these things also helps. So I the way I see human life is basically there are different phases in which look backwards and you see what what what is going on. It's not when you're living it. So basically, when you get into this world, initially, you're a family person, like in many ways, your behavior is shaped by your family in significant ways and your friends in a circle in which you find yourself, your teachers and all of that, then you have to make a place for yourself in this world. So you enter into the educational and professional realm and you start working or start business or whatever it is that you want to do, you get into politics. At that time, you're playing a game, right? Because the what is the game that there is some situation that you find yourself and you want to get ahead, right? And that's the game you played basically, at least in the middle age, you know, and within that game, if you're not playing a game, then it's a completely different world. If you just kind of like some people do at a young age, they decide that the spiritual path is for them and they basically take sannyas. There is a small number who do that in India even now. Other traditions also, there is a very small number that that used to do that. But otherwise, you're in a game, you are basically, if you're in politics, you want to get ahead in politics. If you're in a corporate setting, you want to get ahead in politics. And then in certain qualities of your life get accentuated and other qualities get suppressed in the process. You know, to some extent, you can have this, you know, both ways a little bit five days you work and two days you do whatever, you know, weekends. But more or less, I mean, that's talking about our, many people don't have that luxury also, there's hardly a weekend. But the structure is the same that there is a period in which you are basically trying to find a footing in your life and trying to find a place in this world. And you are playing a particular, to repeat myself, game in which you find yourself, right? You entered, you did an MBA or whatever, you got into a job, and then you're trying to get ahead. In that, I mean, you may have a sense of right and wrong. But in many ways, you find yourself in a situation in which it's very expensive, and then you have to take a decision. And then those decisions can be hard. If you're lucky, you will not have to take those decisions and you will find yourself walking a path of virtue and something which keeps you and your moral sense, pride, your conscience is not suppressed too much and you keep walking that path and you still do well. But in their situation, which you have to actually pay a price for that. So the point I'm trying to make here is that it is not just about you sitting in a room and deciding what is virtue and what is not. It is more experiential and you are actually interacting with the real world and dealing with situations and trying to say what would work and what would. So there is a kind of dialectic between virtue and success and there is sometimes they go together very well and more often than not. And so the point I'm trying to make is that two journeys happening at the same time. One is the journey which is of you being a person in this world trying to find a place for in this world. You have a family, you may not have a family, you are trying to make a career of whatever kind you want to do and there is a journey. A young person, you don't know what the world is like, you are uncertain how much the world will accommodate you. So you accommodate a lot of the world, right? You try to adjust yourself to a significant extent and if you're lucky, you will continue to be virtuous and get ahead and your sense of yourself, your own righteousness and what is required to be done will not be unmatched much. But often there are compromises. Then you get to something like a middle age, you know where at that point you need to actually because you've at least in our setting not universally true but in many, we will find some kind of a footing, right? Like after 15, 16, 20 years of working, you'll find some kind of footing, you've got some sense of who you are and all of that. At that time it's important to say what did you suppress? What all that you actually compromised? What got hidden inside you, you know? And then you need to deal with that and then there is another rediscovery at that time and that's where I think the most important obligation comes in that you actually start living your life at that stage. That is your life, that in a way you have a better sense of who you are and you have an obligation to have a better sense of who you are because in some ways you've done that bulk of the Maya part that you played those games and you've done whatever to the extent keeping your conscience alive and then the real moral obligation start that now you need to have a very clear sense of who you are and what is the right thing to do and all of that. So when you are younger, the obligation is not so much on you. It's about people around you much more, you know? So again, I always think in a social sense, it's not myself as an individual isolated way. So when I was 22 years old, if I got something wrong, it is the elder near me who should have known better to tell me or guide me or whatever or I'll just say I was unlucky. I didn't have a good better sense of what is right or wrong. As 42, I don't have that luxury. I'm not 42. But when I'm 42 years old, then one has to go away, you know, like always said that at 50 everybody deserves a face they have like at 50, everybody deserves a character, you know, that's the character they have actually in a way chosen to have. So then you actually have to ask this question. And I think more and more I'm thinking about it is in terms of trying to find a way in which you you're more cautiously driven by some values, you know, and that's those values can be I mean, it depends on where you are situated. But broadly speaking, there has to be some sense of virtues, you know, that, okay, this, this is what the right thing to do. These are the broad kind of markers of what right and wrong are in my setting. And I'll try to follow those. So, for example, if you're in the intellectual world, some commitment to truth is very important. Some open mindedness is very important. Some sense of rigor, some bit of rigor is important, depending on the purpose and the timeliness within which you're working on whatever it is trying to find out some kind of a social commitment in terms of that you are not just doing this for your own sake. But actually, there are some consequences that are going to flow. All those are important, you know, in that sense in the work life. Similarly, there are obligations that you feel and the virtues towards your family, towards your spouse and your children and your parents and all of that. And as a situation comes, it can I mean, you'll have to then make a decision about how to how to approach it in a way that is that is the right thing to do. But one thing to always keep in mind is that you will always fail. You will always fail. And it is important to try to get up and still try to do better the next day, you know. And the only thing is that by the end of your life, you should try to be as good as one can be. There's a journey. If you're unlucky, you'll die young. Okay, that's one. But towards the end of the life, you should try to be you know, there's a great Catholic writer who wrote, I think it was Catholic, who wrote that, you know, the only tragedy of life is if you don't die as a saint. You know, so something to that effect that at the end you should, you know, all that things about playing the games of the world and trying to compromise all of that and not have not knowing what's the right thing to do, all those issues should fall apart, fall away. And what should matter is what is good. And it's a great tragedy if you see someone who's at an advanced age has seen this world, lived through many ups and downs and made a place on the world, but still haven't figured out what being a saint is like, you know, and don't have that sense. There's a very interesting story by Isaac Singer, Gimple the Fool. You should read it. It's a very interesting story about this guy who's fooled by everybody in his village, you know, and everybody just takes him for granted. His neighbors take advantage of him. He's a baker and his wife is very promiscuous. She also takes advantage of him. So lots of people take advantage of him. And, you know, the basic thing is that it's better to be fooled than to fool others, you know, and that's the message of the story. It's a very nice story. It's worth reading. It's based on some old kind of folktale of Judaism from those traditions. And I think, so yeah, I think there's a kind of interplay between trying to find a place in this world. And then we also need to create a social order or a setting in which virtues are easier to practice in some sense. The right thing is easier to do. And I think that's very important because if you put all the onus on the individual, it just becomes a very, very difficult situation. So what is good is something that we discover over time and in specific situations, but also to be able to do that good and to be able to behave well and to be fair to each other, to be just. And it's very important to find a setting in which it's something which doesn't destroy your life or take too much away from you, you know. And that I think is very important. That's why you should think in social settings, virtues. So when you think of profession, you think about professional bodies and professions as such, you know, not about the individual heroic professional rising up and doing whatever. So when you talk about, for example, you need to, for example, these days we talk about institutions and judges and all of that. I think it's completely wrong to put things on individual judges and why didn't you stand up and all. What did we as a polity do? I mean, why don't we have more balance of power in the polity? Why is a heroic judge has to stand up to a dominant power structure and say, oh, I will stand up and show it to you. Why? I mean, we as a polity have created a situation in which judges have to take very difficult decisions and you say, oh, it's very easy to say, right? It could destroy everything and stand up to basically for a meaningless quest, because if the government really, a dominant party really wants something, it's very difficult for a judge to stand up to it. And you can stand up, but it won't be fructuous because they'll find other ways to undermine whatever you did that the judge writes in an order. So these are, I think, cost cutting themes across institutions, professions, families, all of that, that there's a setting in which it's easier to exercise virtues and be a good judge or a good teacher or good doctor and all of that. And then the owner still remains on the individual to figure it out and do it, you know, and then you'll always fail and you will try to do better. So, I mean, I do have, I mean, situations where I behave badly and I still, I'm haunted by them. But that haunting, I try to now process towards doing better in the future, you know. I have misspoken with somebody, fought with somebody, said something wrong. But it's just a part of human life. If you long, I've now lived for almost 39 years in this world. So there is a certain sense of past, you know, and then there are wrongs and rights and all of that. But one thing is for sure that one keeps getting better is I think what one has to take that the arch should be in that direction and hopefully one dies as a saint."

        "message": "You mentioned you're almost 39. Listen, my episodes go on for a long time. So by the time this recording is over, you might actually get there. You mentioned Orwell, who is of course one of, like two of my intellectual heroes Orwell and Bastia and they both died at around 50 and they both kind of wrote their greatest works just before they turned 50. And I have like a year and a half to go till 50. So, but I, yeah, good luck to me. But that's a great quote about, you know, how, which I hadn't heard before, where you quoted Orwell as saying that by the time you are 50, you should know your real face or whatever. Then you mentioned sainthood and Orwell's thoughts on sainthood are also interesting, where in this great essay he wrote called Reflections on Gandhi, this first para is just a work of genius. And he wrote, quote, saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent. But the tests that have to be applied to them are not, of course, the same in all cases. In Gandhi's case, the questions one feel inclined to ask are to what extent was Gandhi moved by vanity, by the consciousness of himself as a humble naked old man sitting on a prayer mat and shaking empires by sheer spiritual power? And to what extent did he compromise his own principles by entering politics, which of their nature are inseparable from coercion and fraud? Stop quote. And this leads to a couple of themes, which you and I have sort of discussed in the past. And one of them is my sense that sometimes the quest for virtue can be driven by the vanity of wanting to see yourself as a virtuous person. And this entangling that can be, you know, interesting. Like, for example, what I see on social media is that those who project the most virtue are often the least virtuous, right? And we can both think of examples of people like this. And that's therefore something that makes me question myself. And I think of the right thing to do, like one test I have for myself on social media these days, I have failed this test in the past, but these days, is that if I'm putting out a tweet, I need to ask myself that am I doing it for the validation of other people so that other people think better of me, because that is a natural motive, but it is a little suspect. Now, the other aspect that it leads me to think about is the way you presented these phases of life, you almost seem to be saying that once you reach a certain age, the examined life will lead to the virtuous life that you need to sit back and introspect and whatever. And thinking about this, I think about your earlier reference to spending your younger years playing a game, which is a great description and the term is apt. But I'm just thinking that you can look at it in retrospect and know you were playing the game. In the moment, 99.9% of people don't know they are playing the game. Yes, they are in the game. And the thing is that the game is shaping who they are. So after the game, there is no point in introspecting, they have changed. And the morality that they had to or the ways of doing things that they had to adapt while playing the game is something that would have sort of changed them so much. Like I think it was you who once told me about how politics corrodes character, because the incentives of the political game are such that you can enter politics with the finest of intentions. But all the necessary compromises that you make will eventually will shape your actions and your actions will eventually change who you are. And then you are a different person at the end of the process. And that's exactly what Orwell talks about in this para as well. And so therefore, you know, I'll just sort of end this by saying that, therefore, I completely agree with you on the centrality of thinking about the systems from which these incentives emerge, the incentives which drive us to do the things that we do, like one thing that I've always said of our system of government is that we should design our system of government in such a way that even the worst, most immoral psychopath is in power, there's limited damage he can do, because the system is one that rewards good behavior and punishes bad behavior. And it works in that respect. And, you know, so a lot of the responsibility is, therefore, you know, comes from the system, you want to design the structures in place in our society. And in, and by design, I don't mean in a top down way, obviously, as you know, but, you know, we need to think about how to move society in the state in directions where they are providing incentives for good behavior, rather than just the other way around, as we see."

        "message": "Yeah, it's a lot to chew and talk about. So I think that two questions that you asked, one is that, when is virtue, virtue, and one is virtue vanity. And the other question is that, what is the point of introspection after a point when you already become something by having played a particular game? So I think both of these questions go back to the nature of human consciousness. I mean, in some senses, and it's a big term, human consciousness, and I'll put a simple kind of a beginning frame to it that if you reflect back on yourself, at least when I reflect back on it, I know that my conscious thinking rational mind is only the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot of me that I actually don't know, because that's the past that is suppressed, and it's unconscious. And I feel it in terms of emotions, and sometimes certain longings rise out of it, and certain things come to my mind, conscious mind, and I have to pay attention or ignore or whatever, there are complexes hidden. And psychoanalysts study this and write about it and all of that. And who we are is often not what the stories that we tell ourselves, right? So, but the stories we tell ourselves at the readings we do and the conversations we have do have a bearing, you know, it's not a, and in fact, the fact that we read something or talk to some people about some things itself reflects the kind of a deeper longing, right? And the fact that we're sitting here and talking about virtues, maybe partly vanity, and but there's also more to it, perhaps, because we're talking about this and not something else, which could also serve vanity at the same time. So there are different paths to vanity, which path to vanity do you take? But one key point that I've experienced in my own life is that, can you keep a distance between what you need to do out of necessity, because it's again going back to the human consciousness and then self nature of the self that you have. So, do you have this kind of a clear sense that this is a persona that you're wearing, and there is a certain role that you need to play. And then there is a self that is within it. And that remains a little less uncontaminated, you know, because it's a duty that, for example, if I was a prime minister of this country, I would have to do horrible things. I would have to just the nature of the responsibility is such that you need to sometimes order violence on your enemies. Sometimes you do order violence on your own citizens, because they are doing things which are they're trying to break away the republic or something. There are things difficult decisions to be taken, which will create harsh hardships, but maybe create good things on the on the whole utilitarian kind of logic is particularly sound, but it creates some harm. So, if you're sitting in a position like that, and you have to take decisions, at that point of time, can you simply get your personal morality into it and make it completely transferred into a position that demands by the virtue of you being sitting there. I mean, it could be any other human being, the same demands will be made on them. It's not about you as such. So, and there is a possibility I think that we need to give that there are people who behave badly, but are quite virtuous, actually, because the bad behavior was necessary in the context in which they found themselves, because of the nature of the world that we live in, that there are power struggles and you have duty to play those power struggles and defend your own, you know, especially in the international order, right? You're more or less anarchy kind of an order where you're trying to protect your country and further its interest in a way others are also fighting the same game and many of them don't see it as a, you know, as a win-win situation. Some of them actually want to impose a win-lose on you. So, you have to do the things that are necessary. You have to hide things, you have to lie a little bit, sometimes you have to cheat, you don't do things that you may not do in personal life. So, I think if you want to, if it's particularly interesting for anybody to understand someone's character, then you have to watch and see how they behave in different situations, you know, and then make a view about, well, is it vanity or is it virtue or is it a bit of both, you know. But I see the point that Orwell is making that sometimes something like this can also be presented as, and we see that in some of the scandals that come out about our Babas and all, sometimes, very rare, it's a very small percentage to be very clear. There are many, many spiritual people in this country, gurus and all who are not like that. Most are not like that. There are a small number who come out and give a bad name to everybody else who play that game that this is a path to glory and vanity and all of that. So, I think there's a distinction that McIntyre draws, which is very important and it's easy to state it, very difficult to actually assess it what's going on. So, he says there are two things. Whenever you are doing something, there are two kinds of goods that you can be pursuing. One is the goods in external to the practice. So, you're doing podcasting because you want to get money, fame, all of that. Or there are goods internal to practice. You're doing podcasting because you love the joy of podcasting and you want to be a better podcaster. This activity itself makes you feel very, I mean, good and you want to do better at doing that. And it's just a great podcast, even if it makes no money for you and basically you die in penury. That's not the case with you. Thankfully, in your case, both are more or less aligned. But in many cases, there is a conflict between goods internal to practice by trying to be a good practitioner of something, being a good professional or whatever it may be and goods external to practice, which is the money and the fame and all that comes with it. So, virtue is the latter, which is the goods internal to practice. A person who is genuinely virtuous is the one who is acting well because he actually wants to act well. Because for the sake of acting well, the right behavior is the right behavior for them. And they do it because it's the right behavior, not because it will give them something else or something. A completely different example. Recently, I read an interview with this Harshal Patel. He said that I am not the kind of person who needs 10 crore rupees in his life. He got 10 crores in IPL, but it's a signal of the fact that I am a good player, you know, something to that effect, he said. It was very interesting to me, because he sees that 10 crore rupees is basically a sign of what he's good at. But he actually plays it because he enjoys playing cricket. If you go by what he said, and I take it on a space value, why not? So, he basically enjoys playing cricket and he wants to be better at playing cricket. It's just incidental that he's getting 10 crore rupees. He would still play cricket maybe if he's giving him less. So, he said it, I'm not the kind of person who needs 10 crore rupees a year in his life. But it just shows that I'm good at this, you know. So, that I think distinction is very important. What is it that you're seeking when you're seeking, you're working on doing something, whether it's in the personal life or professional life, political or whatever. So, there are politicians who do all the bad things, looking from a very simplistic perspective of some principles of good or bad. But in their situation, bad or the right thing, they may still be very virtuous, actually, as human beings, their duty is demanded. And even vanity can sometimes, if you're in a particular position, you have to appear a certain kind of a persona, you know. You can't say that I will not give public talks, I will not do this and that. Because if you are in public life, you have to do all of these things. There's a vanity or is that your duty? You know, giving speeches is your duty, right? It's not just vanity, seeking people's attention and all that. The other question is a harder one, what you become and what you can become by reflection and all of that. It's a much harder question, because I mean, I'm at a stage of life when actually I'm going through that kind of a process, right? Because one is looking back and saying, okay, I've had this kind of a life and what can I take from there? So, there is a becoming, which I'm actually not aware of, because it's just kind of unconscious. I've shaped, I've been shaped in certain ways, the directions that took me in. And now I'm trying to gradually understand it by trying to imagine myself and trying to, through my dreams and all whatever, to understand what is it that I suppress and what is it that I elevated to the level of my, this kind of illusory category that I created with my name and put a lot of, you know, cool features into it and said, this is what I am, you know, which is what actually the persona is. And then the rest of it is basically to be discovered and figured out. And to, as I said, you can try to do better and try to be good without being too, I mean, you don't have to be very self-conscious about it. No, it's not some kind of a project where you start, okay, this is a start date, that's the end date, I need to do all this is a critical path I have to follow to get there. That's all. It's just a longing and you need to be aware of it and try to do it. It's not something which is can be fully planned in advance and there will be surprises in life. And sometimes you'll dream something and it will mean something to you and it will change the way you think about something. Sometimes you meet somebody who can provide you guidance, you can find a guru or something. You sometimes you'll have a conversation with a friend which can certainly strike you, okay, yeah, I didn't realize that about myself. Now I'm trying to be, I'll try to think more about it and thinking will go some way. I don't think we can change completely by just thinking about ourselves. But it's one part of the puzzle and self-reflection has in many people's lives made a difference. Not by yourself only, but talking to others, reading, thinking, talking, behaving differently, building better habits, those kind of things. Having some kind of rules of thumb as well sometimes, although they're often kind of meant to be broken. But I don't think that we are completely formed by our experiences by the time we are in middle age. At least also, that's not the bet I'm taking. I think there is room for a new birth, you know, in some senses, a renewal of sorts"

        "message": "Life has no meaning. But just to just to kind of go back to what you said about how even someone who does bad things can be virtuous. And I'll say yes and no. And yes, in the sense that we are responding to incentives within a particular context. And yeah, so I get where that is coming from. And I sort of get where that is coming from. But equally, I think that there are places where you have to draw a line. Otherwise, you can do the worst of things and you can rationalize them and say that, hey, you know, these were the incentives and this is why I did them. And there's a danger in that because you internalize that rationalization. And, you know, just when you were thinking of having to do bad things and you could still be virtuous and like the two men who came to mind are Vajpayee and Modi. And I think Vajpayee, if he was still alive and still active and still in good shape, and if he took over in 2014, he would be very different. He was a pretty good prime minister. And in my view, the diametrically different from Modi, who is a terrible, terrible prime minister and a terrible, terrible man. And the thing is, they would have done different things. And you can see this in the sort of not quite the conversation, because they weren't talking to each other. But that sort of conversation through intermediaries that they had after the Gujarat 2002 riots, which Vajpayee came out against, and he, I think, used the phrase Rajdharma. Right. So there was a sense there that there is, you know, a sense of ethics that remains overarching. And that pervades what you do within sort of the context of within the context of politics and what's within the context of that particular profession. And after this, we'll also speak about how virtues relates in a professional context, which you have thought about deeply and studied and all of that. So I think, so I agree that, you know, the incentives around us shape our behavior and we could, you know, and it is what it is. But at the same time, I think there is a danger in letting that excuse and justify everything else that letting that excuse and justify crossing certain lines, which we should not cross regardless of context."

        "message": "Yes, but in politics, things are very different from the way you and I, it's a unit of analysis that which our mind kind of, in a way, to be applied very carefully to be able to make sense of what's going on. But one thing is for sure, as I said earlier, that virtues exist in a particular setting. And I mean, sometimes it's easier to be virtuous, sometimes it's easier to be vicious also. So one of the things that is different, like just a setting is that Mr. Vajpayee ran a government, which was a coalition government, we never really, he never really had the kind of power that is required to actually reveal what he would do when he was a kind of a, he had real power in some senses. Mr. Modi has run is now the second term of a single party majority, comfortable majority in both times, the second largest party has been one sixth or one seventh of the largest party in the House of the People Lok Sabha. It's a, so when you have so much power, it's, there's no, there's no check on you, right? No real check, especially in a democracy, because power comes from the people and the people are with you. And so you, you feel that you can do anything and you can experiment, make big experiments, make, try difficult and painful things, and hopefully they'll work out and all of that. So one thing that you have to control for is the kind of power that when you have, especially when you talk about politics, and when you have power, you will behave very differently, the same person will behave very differently when you don't have power. So I don't know whether the counterfactual of Mr. Vajpayee would have done better than Mr. Modi when he had this much, these many MPs. I think we think about this in a very simplistic way. We underestimate the social setting, right? What is social setting? If you're a Prime Minister, how important is it to you for you to actually consult and take others on board? For the median person, there are lots of exceptions, but in the median person, they just want their ideas to be implemented. You know, who wants to go and take six months to create consensus and all? You do it because you need to, right? Because you need to do consensus, you need to create constituencies, because otherwise you can't get anything in. But once you get that kind of power, the chances of making a mistake are much greater, even with the best intentions. So you listen to the three or four people who are close to you, many of them may not feel like giving you negative feedback. And even if they do, I am the one who has a people's, you know, I am this, I am that. Imagine the kind of ego inflation you've gone through. Some people have waited for you twice that. So then a completely different kind of a situation emerges, social setting in which decisions are being made. And I think, I mean, much more, I mean, it's an old Actonian kind of wisdom, right? Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. And there's a version of it, power makes mistakes and absolute power makes more mistakes, you know. And that's what I think that's one part of it that you need to consider before making a judgment about the person as such, because I don't know, there was certainly a PR image of Mr. Vajpayee, which was very good. And I also hold that in my mind, I come from UP and there's a nostalgia about his kind of very, in our belt, he was very popular. I even went for his rally once and it was amazing. It was a big show, you know, because people just thronged from all over the place to actually listen to him. He had that kind of a connect. So people just loved him in my part of the world. There was that, but we don't know what he was like, right? And more importantly, we would never know what he would have done with so much power. Because see, one of the main things about politicians, they always tend to hide who they are. You know, they are always trying to play a particular kind of game in terms of where projecting a certain kind of image is more important than, I mean, being just be yourself, you know, like we saw that with President Obama also, you know, he had a very clear, I mean, he projected a certain kind of persona. We'll never know what he was like in his personal life or whatever."

But if you ask me, I have been very critical of the decisions that Mr. Modi has taken and demonetization was a big mistake that he made. He has made other decisions which I don't agree with. So I think he could have done much better with the power that he had, he has had now for eight years, we can have those discussions.

But at the same time, I would say that intellectually, Modi is a far more limited person in the sense that Vajpayee was a man of culture, he had a deeper interior life, he read a lot, he was into poetry, he was into all of that. And none of that is a guarantee for behaving well as we have seen in the past. But you also have to account for human agency and the differences between people and but who knows, perhaps everything is just how we are shaped by circumstance and everything is rationalization. Let's take a quick commercial break. And on the other side of the break, we'll continue our discussion. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com and subscribe. It is free.

Thank you. Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Suyash Rai. And, you know, being you know, one of the virtues of a podcast is that once you have embarked upon a particular narrative line, you kind of continue as far as you need to go. And we were talking about virtue while before the break. So you've also spoken a lot to me in the past about the role of virtues in professions, where your point is that in every profession, you know, it's not just about following incentives, but professionals need to think about what are the ethics of that profession. And there is sort of a deeper meaning that they have to bring to work in what they do, you know, almost in contrast, or in addition to playing the game as it were the phrase you used earlier. So can you can you elaborate a little bit on this? What sparked your interest on this? What is the kind of work you've done? And what are your thoughts on the subject?"

        "time": "02:05:50.160",
        "message": "Yeah, so the interest got sparked by just observing professionals at work. I worked with lawyers, I've gone to doctors, I have dealt with architects, I have worked with others who are not professionals, professionals, but work with researchers and civil servants and politicians and so on. And basically, it was trying to reflect on experience, you know, what, what, who was a good professional and who was not a good professional and trying to understand it in a conceptual way, but trying to basically from observation itself. And I found help in some philosophers and all of that, but primary focus was on actually trying to understand what, what does it mean to be a virtuous person in a work setting primarily, that was my kind of thing with work means anything like outside of the home sphere in some senses. So, and, and not so much in the social friendship, those domains there of course, virtue is very important for that, but my research or thinking on this has been primarily about the workspaces. So what's going on is that we have two grand kind of types of powers that are playing out in this world. One is the state power, you know, which is legitimized by in, in some places many countries now legitimized by democratic vote, but still it is a particular kind of political power, which is there to command, control, use coercion sometimes, or do some nudges or something to get some behavior out of people. It is a, there are different ways in which states imagine their role in the society for various reasons, historical reasons, but there is some degree of a top-down perspective involved, at least at the apex level. In some countries, there is much more decentralization and local liberties are still intact, there is local governments and all local, local association life really matters. But in many countries, the trend is generally towards more centralization and greater kind of trying to find the same principles that apply at the entire country and trying to impose those principles in some way or the other. And they are all done in the name of certain kind of good, nice, cute, cuddly things like rights, certain objectives, which may be utilitarian in nature, trying to maximize good for more and more people, maximum good for maximum number of people, happiness for maximum number of people. Another force that is playing out in this world is the force of markets, which at least wherever they work as markets, it is based on voluntary exchange, that you and I enter into a contract and there is some kind of an understanding of I will pay you something for a service and we will both be happy at the end of the day. But the markets also work in a way that is, I mean, there are intermediating structures, there are corporate structures, there are competition in market, different corporates are trying to compete to be able to get more of the market and those create certain incentives then in which the professionals have to operate. Now if you look at the global trend, earlier what used to happen is that you saw economies of scale in manufacturing. You have a large manufacturing company economy of scale, services were not considered to be economies of scale. There is a recent research done in the US and also now being replicated elsewhere. We show that even services now use more corporatization and more economies of scale are being seen. For various reasons, for example, there are some common things that you can provide to all professionals working in a corporate which reduces the transaction cost for that. Each professional acting on their own. For example, the famous example is dentists. Dentists are getting more corporatized, that now more and more dentists are working for larger dentistry practices than they used to earlier. It was just always one standalone dentist procuring all the products and using their clinic as a provider service. But corporatization is happening to a great extent, at least in large part of the economy, professionals operate. So lawyers work in law firms, doctors work in highly corporatized hospitals, including dentists, architects, all of those. And similarly, many of them work in state and state has its own concerns for working, for how they should operate. Now the question comes about, so these processes are playing out. The state is trying to do certain things and markets are expanding and corporates are growing. Corporatization is happening, there is economy of scale to be had. What is the role of professional thinking of the profession by itself? What is the role of a professional's own understanding of his or her own responsibility towards their clients, towards their professional, towards their professions? It is a question that I basically started by asking that these grand processes will play out, but are they just basically to be buffeted by these winds and basically land up somewhere or not? Or do they have anything to say about it? And is there anything that they can do to shape these things? Because in some ways, the question I am asking is upstream some markets or state both. In some ways, it's basically about preferences itself. What are the preferences of the professional? And then they will participate in these processes and they will probably make some compromises and do whatever is necessary to continue to practice their profession. But do they have a sense of what is right, what is the right thing to do as a professional? So that was the kind of point of departure. So I have been studying and talking to professionals across lawyers and doctors and structural engineers and social engineering in India is not a professionalized kind of a practice, but in other countries it is. Architects, urban planners and all of those and trying to understand what is the setting in which, how do they decide what a good professional conduct is? How do they see their ability to practice that conduct in their respective setting? What can be done to make it easier for professionals to do better? So I was participating in some conference and conversation where this young person, this lady spoke about particular profession of doctors where the role is to deliver children. And the statistics shows that like in the private hospitals, almost half of the children were delivered through an operation which is a C-section operation and the government hospital it's a very small percentage, I think like 14-15% or something. It's the same profession right and they are responding to different situations, acting very differently as professionals. They go through the same training, they are part of the same association, all of that. So it was, I was thinking why does this happen? This is the same question I have come across in many settings. And what does it take for a professional to navigate the landscape in which they are situated and try to do better? And how can this landscape be changed to make it easier for them to do better? And there are certainly compulsions, there are constraints, there are economic constraints, there are constraints on power. Politicians have to respond to certain kind of incentives themselves to deliver certain things which are, which have to be delivered with quickly and then there are, that play out, play down through the system. So, but you see big differences. If you just look at the same profession in different settings, behave differently. So then I actually started studying and talking to these people and then, so what I see that okay there is one role that is played by education. So what do they, what are they taught when they enter into the college to get a professional degree or whatever it may be? Or even if it is not a college based thing like a chartered accountancy, but they do get a kind of training right and an apprenticeship. So in some senses by working with a chartered accountant, all doctors, lawyers, they do at some point in education get apprentice with either they do a residency in the hospital doctor or young lawyer, usually starts with basically being a rookie for another older lawyer and a lot of their learning happens in that early stage. Then they enter into the professional field in a more, slightly more independent way. Usually it varies from profession to profession. Sometimes you have to take many years to actually then strike it on your own. Otherwise it takes some time and I mean it can be quick also and depending on you as a person also, but then the settings do differ. So and that time you actually are looking at the market and what's possible and how others are doing and what are the standards in which you can operate and in that there are actually many challenges in different professions that the standards are so low and so, so much focus on getting shortcuts and trying to find the easy least cost path instead of trying to think about what would be the right thing to do for the client and all that. And also public goods are missing. So one of the things that happens across professions is that if a young professional wants to grow as a professional, there's not that much by way of support from the larger professional bodies. Professional bodies, not all of them, I will not name any of them because it's kind of, it's impolite, but most of them in India are very self-serving bodies. They are just there to protect their professionals. They don't hold their professionals to account when they behave badly. They don't supply enough public goods to young professionals who are coming up. So for example, in some sectors, some areas there's not enough standard form contracts, legal advice, different ways in which you can reduce the cost of business for the professionals so that they can just focus on the professional practice and then transaction costs are related to virtues in some way or the other in this sense. So I mean, the method I've used is basically, as I said, observing, reflecting, interviewing lots of professionals and doing study groups. So sometimes I've done, I'm not going to details because they're all off the record conversations with taking a group of professionals and running through them for several weeks about their profession and saying what is it that shapes behavior in their profession and how do they, how do we ensure in the language that we spoke earlier that more and more professionals pursue goods internal to practice and that becomes consistent with goods external to practice, that being a good professional actually pays off. I'm not expecting professionals to compromise on everything. So the one thing is the market versus virtue thing that can, how do we ensure that markets are structured in a manner that virtuous behavior is rewarded more and more. We means, it's not for me to design, it's more something that evolves and emerges from interactions between the professionals among themselves and professionals with their corporate kind of counterparts with whom they work. And the other is on the side of the state, right, that how do you as a professional work with the state to do the right thing. So there the themes are very different. So one thing that I learned from talking to some of the professionals is that in fact virtue, the way we think about sometimes in an abstract way is an impediment to improving things in the state because you may have a simplistic notion or not simplistic, you may have the right notion, perfectly right notion of what good professional ethics are and how to implement them in this world. But you work with the state and state is a very messy creature. It's a very, it's actually far more informal than we sometimes understand. There are shortcuts taken, there are favors to be done, there are compromises to be made, you know, and many professionals feel very uncomfortable doing any of that because they feel that it would, it compromises the integrity to work with the state. But one thing that I think is very important to keep in mind is that when you are moving from one kind of a society to another kind of a society, it's a journey. You don't make a leap. You don't go to an open access order or a fully well-organized society where complete rule of law, all of that in one giant leap. So the way to think about is to make progress. How can we make the next step? So more and more professionals should engage with the state while keeping as much of their professional ethic intact and how do you make that easy? How do you make it easy for professionals to work with the state? Because state is a very important entity. If professionals don't join the state or work with the state at least, if they feel very suppressed by the state, then it's a big loss for the country. It's a big impediment to building genuine state capacity and improving one of the most, probably the most important organization in this country, which is the state. Many organizations constituted, but there is a state as such, okay. And there are government, there are judiciary, more and more professionals should join that and good, excellent professionals should join that and they should become judges, they should become civil servants, they should behave like professionals while working, they should join government colleges, medical colleges, the hospitals, they should be teachers, all of that. So how do you actually work with the state while actually being a professional who is virtuous and how do you define virtue in that context? So there again, I think the idea of, you know, what is the right dharma to follow in a particular context is very important that yes, there are professional virtues, but the main thing is that virtues are forged in the practice, right? If you're not in the game, if you're not in that field of practice, if you're not actually making things, if you're an architect, or if you're not actually serving people as a doctor, if you're just in an abstract way in some field, actually, there are NGOs or the academic types who just write critiques about their say, they're not in the game, but they are writing critiques of the game, so to speak, because they think their abstract notions are far superior to the actual practice of that thing, which is always messy, which is easy to critique. Critique is always been very easy, right? It's like, it is the easiest thing to do in a, especially in a relatively disorganized society like ours, and which is also struggling to grow. So how do you actually make that easier, but also more realistic that how do you socialize professionals about the realities of the Indian state? And that what will it take to work with the state? And what, how do you socialize them into starting working with the state and doing more with the state? And I have some friends in different professions who have been guiding me, helping me a little bit. I've never written about this at all. It's just all, as I said, most change happens one individual at a time. So I work with some professionals and individuals and trying to think better about these issues and get something started, some, some practices started, some kind of a course is started, which can be which can reflect on these issues, some thinking started on, on these issues. But I see both these, whether the state's functioning and virtues, how they interact, you know, the, the political and governance imperatives and how they can have a very suppressing world and bearing on the professionals without actually rewarding the professionals. Markets can reward you, but they can also suppress your virtues in certain contexts, especially under certain kind of a corporate setting. And because, and so there is an interplay here. So and then there's a tripartite thing, there's professional virtues, there's state and then there's market because markets and state also interact. And many times the problem in the market is because state has shooed some regulation, which actually makes it very difficult to run a good business. So those are the interplay that I'm interested in. I'm just taking a few professions and studying them. It's been just three years since I started it. So it's not too much work. I think this is a 20 year kind of a, I'll understand it maybe in 20 years to have something useful to say. But yeah, in the interim, there'll be some things that I'll hopefully write and publish. And maybe some things will come out in terms of actual change in behavior and all of that. Some new practices will come out. But that's my aspiration that something will happen on that. And ultimately, I need co-conspirators, I need virtuous senior doctors and lawyers and architects and structural engineers and chartered accountants and company secretaries and all those to engage and think about these issues so that we can do better. Because professions are sites of virtue. And they are in a way the most important, among the most important associations that we have, where not just professional but also democratic virtues can thrive. And they are participatory, they are member bodies. In theory, everybody is equal because they are all qualified professionals. And you can learn a lot by participating in these bodies and helping each other do better. There's a lot of collective common good that they can provide to each other. They can reduce transaction costs for specific members, they can help them be more virtuous on the market side. They can also try to find ways to work with the state and do better in terms of professional input into working with the state bodies. If you look at the public infrastructure in India, so much of it is going without proper architectural input. It's just ugly buildings, badly designed public spaces, so much, so much of it. The cities look so unloved, you know. So I feel that there's a lot to be gained by engaging with those professionals. Similarly, whether it's hospitals or schools or build bridges and everywhere, professional input is very important. And you need the best of the professionals to work with the state."

Now, one question that I've often come at journalists on the show with is that, how do you look at journalism in the sense that on the one hand, there is an instrumental purpose to journalism, that people want information, people want news, you're providing it to them, it is supply and demand. Therefore, the bottom line matters, you are after all running an enterprise, you have people to employ, mouths to feed, you know, you need to look at ROI for what you do. So all those standard business imperatives come into play. And on the other hand, there is also a higher notion of journalism, which without quite being able to justify why those higher notions exist, I believe they do, at least that's what I have adopted as, you know, the way I think about the profession and what I might extend into other things that I do, which is that, you know, there is a value to speaking truth to power, there is a value in trying to write that first draft to history with as much fidelity to the truth as possible, nebulous as the truth is. And so you get it. And in modern times, there are, you know, there appears to be a conflict. And this is where the state and the market comes in. Now, in an ideal world, the state would protect your rights, and you would just do what you have to do, and there would be free speech, so no interference. In an ideal world, the market would, you know, reward good behaviour on your part, because you know, you benefit in the markets by, you make money in a free market, basically by making someone else better off, it is a positive sum game, you provide something that makes them better off, they pay you for it, both of you are better off, that's the whole nature of the beast. However, what we see in India is issues on both these fronts, in the sense that the state is the oppressive predatory state, which I go on about all the time, and it is anything but a free environment. And our constitution also does not protect free speech as much as it should. So that is one problem at the level of the state. And the state can also use this power to clamp down on critics in the sense that, hey, I might own a big newspaper, but I'm a business family, I might also have a chemical factory, what am I going to do? So, you know, the incentives are messy, everybody who's of a certain size has so much to lose, that the incentives are to toe the line. And as far as the market is concerned, one, we don't really have a free market free market. But even if we did, you know, the issue that would come up there is that, what if people, you know, I might have the highest of values ki aisa hona chahiye, but what if the world today is full of narrative battles, and people want to engage in those battles, and the the demand from the market is to provide those narratives, which they already believe in, or which give them comfort or whatever, and not necessarily for a bipartisan pursuit of the truth, then do you play to those forces as well. And I would actually not be so negative about it in the sense that I think that one of the beautiful things about the market is that it's not just majority wins. And like in politics, everybody can express themselves, you know, in that sense, my podcast is not a mainstream thing. But it reaches a lot of people who crave depth, who otherwise a market does not, you know, otherwise, the mainstream players don't cater to because, you know, they want numbers and they are going, you know, a mile wide and an inch deep. And there are people who want a lot more depth. So the market has created spaces for all kinds of different voices, put the tools of production in our hands, all that is fine. But the but the question that this leads me to is that notion of journalism, as high having some higher values, where does it come from? Like when you're talking about virtues within professions, what you are in a sense implying, when you say that it is upstream of the state and upstream of society is you are implying that this is not just something instrumental, right? It is not there is each profession has a set of ethics, or maybe that's a question, does it have a sense of ethics that exists independent of all these forces, you know, and and to turn our attention on medicine, for example, doctors are taught the Hippocratic Oath, for example, you know, thou shall do no harm and all of that. And it would appear that there is a code of ethics there. But as we have seen, you also have to look at the incentives of doctors. And, you know, you could be a doctor who loves to spend 20 minutes with each patient, but your incentives are that apply fast and furious heuristics, tell them thus test karo for each of which you're getting a commission. And that's how the business runs. And you can even rationalize it at a utilitarian level, saying that I'm serving"

        "message": "But when you start serving, then you start dealing with constraints, demands, expectations, market forces, state regulation, state's own constraints, political governance constraints. And then in that you end up shaping your behavior according to, I mean, what you think is the right thing and then what are the, what is the kind of situation that you find yourself in. So let's talk about journalism. It's not, I don't know whether it can be called a profession, I mean, in a philosophical sense, but many journalists think that they are professionals and they think about what they do in terms of a profession. But so let's talk about it in terms of maybe something akin to a profession where there are certain structured practices which are there and finding truth out and reporting it is very important. And that's the core of the, I mean, speaking truth to power and all our secondary things, those are vanities, you know, truth is what really matters. And finding important truths, which are, I think, consequential and having some degree of direction of attention to things that really matter is another kind of aspect of a journalistic ethic. Having some degree of rigor and some, what you call triangulation of whatever you're trying to say is important. Then also stating it in a manner which is non-sensational. It should be clear, it should be precise, it should be saying what you know and accepting what you don't know. So as a citizen, I have expectations from citizens as well. I have expectations from journalists as well that there are some things that I expect from a good doctor, some things I expect from a good architect, some things I may expect from a good lawyer. I expect certain things from journalists as well. Now journalists say that they have a freedom of speech. That's what they want to get. And now what is the, so structurally what happens is that whenever you have any right, it each right creates some elites. Because people who are good at exercising those rights will become elites through those rights. And society confers those rights. I mean you may use the language of natural rights and whatever God given, but ultimately society has decided, it's a decision that it's taken that those rights have to be conferred on the people. And then each right creates some kind of elite. So when you have a right to property, you have property, people who either by their sheer ability to run better businesses or by their rent seeking behavior are able to get, become rich and they become the property elites. Similarly, when you freedom of speech, some people are better intellectuals claim, so they are better at becoming, at use of speech and they want to influence society. I mean perhaps the most important of those are constitutional judges and lawyers, lawyers who say that their speech is so powerful that they should transform society in some sense. It's just their views right and they think they have the philosophical confidence to say that they should transform the society. It takes quite a bit of vanity to say something like that, but they do. Journalists are also in that category. They are the elites of the speech right that society has confirmed on everybody in some sense, but some are elites in those rights. See most of us never, most of us will never use most of the rights in a manner that society would want to regulate it, most of us, most of the time. Most of us will sometime use it and only some of us use it all the time. Journalists are those who use right to speech, push the boundaries all the time because they are in the business of finding things out that are not commonly known and reporting those and so on. Now why does society confer these rights? Because it thinks it works for them. Everything is an instrumentality in that sense. When you think out from a society's point of view and why it is conferred those rights, it thinks that it will work for them. So how does a property elite which is a big business person or someone say that hey I deserve to be elite. So democracies do not like elites right. Everybody is equal and so on. Why they justify is by saying that my being rich has helped the society because voluntary exchange in invisible hand everybody has been better off and I have been a little better because I have done better for you. Same thing intellectuals, journalists, everybody also claims that I deserve this disproportionate uses of this right because my speech is helping society do better. Intellectuals say that, journalists say that. Similarly, other rights you can go to the list. Each right creates some kind of elite who are just good, better or more inclined towards using those rights in a disproportionate, I mean intensive way. Now the tensions come right because you have some right and you are the one small sliver of society which uses this rights a lot to speak the truths and so called the truths and you say that you should be listened to and you should continue to have that right. You say something about a business person. That business person says this is not true. Now there are two possibilities. Maybe it is true, maybe it is not true. Maybe it is true but you have misstated it. Maybe it is not true and but you are not accepting that it is not true and the business person has again a right to fight back against you. I mean through legal means or whatever it may be. Defamation and all is there for that. You say something about some politician, okay, which may or may not be true and even if it is true, the politician does not like it because hey, I mean it basically weakens him in some senses because it is maybe something negative. That is why it is being reported and it was not anyway in the public domain earlier. So at that point all the tensions come and then it is basically a question about this profession or this set of people who are exercising these rights versus the people who are trying to fight them out, whether it is the property elite or the political elites or the powerful and the basically or the administrative elite, the civil servants and all of those who are holding the powers so to speak and the journalists pushing back. When that situation comes and that is an unavoidable situation. All societies have to deal with it. Even the most developed society even today, you have a president who said the media are the enemy of the people because he felt aggrieved by the media, so rightly or wrongly but he felt and he is fighting the media on a daily basis. He suspended some reporter from coming to his press conferences temporarily and then it got reversed in the court or something. So there is a constant struggle. The basic point I am trying to make is that if you, the first duty of a professional and professionals as a collective in a particular domain is to try to do reasonably well as far as their own professional ethic is concerned. In terms of within the situation, I am not saying that there is infinite resources and you can do whatever, but you do whatever. I just, I mean drop on my head, set four of equality, I as a citizen think that as a journalist should at least aspire towards and then what happens when a conflict happens is that people should be with you. So we should never have an illusion that in democracy there are many sources of, the main source of power is the people, are the people. Whether it is a person who is rich or powerful in state or journalist getting legitimacy, it has to be earned and it has to be and some degree of faith in the democracy and the people is required that if I am doing the right thing, maybe sometimes there will be unfair outcomes and I will be very badly hurt. But to at least begin with the assumption that if I am doing the right thing, in some way or the other, people will say and stand with me and say, hey, you are wrongly implicating this person. But for that, it is very important to have collective unit in action within the profession. One professional can be destroyed very easily and for the, by the other elites, because they have been hurt by it and I am just talking about for journalists right now, but it is true of others as well. Because hey, I mean, nobody will pay attention also. What is an individual? It is just a, I mean, very easy to forget also. That is the tragedy of human behavior. In our minds, we are everything, but in the larger scheme of things, we do not mean that much. But when a collective, there is professional unity is there and for good reasons, not in the, I mean, self-serving way in which many professional bodies in India work. So, we have to be realistic about how professional bodies work and when do they actually stand up to bad behavior by their members, when do they stand up to defend good behavior by their members, which is under attack from others. So, the basic point I am making is that yes, these are situations that arise and there are structural good reasons why they arise. Conflict is good in society. When it is not a good versus evil thing, journalists get a lot of things wrong. I remember how some IAS officers who took decision in good faith, but got badly, I mean, implicated in cases later were completely demonized by some of our journalists a few years ago under the corruption, I mean, the moment of cacophony around corruption that happened in India. And I think many of them went overboard. I mean, whether they should have a right to say that or not, it is a different question. It is a legal question one can answer. But as a moral question, you know, did you actually exercise the thing before supporting somebody's criminalization, putting someone in jail? Literally, there are senior journalists who wrote that they should be in jail for not standing up to their political leaders. Is that a standard for which someone should go to jail? I mean, that is the kind of language that was used against some IAS officers who are in jail right now for basically not having taken any money, but they did not stand up to some wrong decision by senior politicians who themselves are not in jail, by the way. So, there are many examples of this type. And all I am saying is that when the conflicts happen, the most important thing is to appeal to the public, you know, in some ways and as a collective stand up for what is good and punish what is bad. So, I do not know. I am not an expert on journalism in India. One has to think and these are very hard questions. And they require practical judgment, a lot of detailed situational awareness of what is the state of journalism in India, what are the conditions in this practice. But my big picture is that the question that we should ask is, are journalists as a community behaving in a way that a good professional should behave? Are they punishing the bad or are they censoring their own bad behavior of the journalists at a corporate level, at the level of the professional bodies and all? Are they standing up for the good behavior of the journalists? And then the conflicts will happen. Everybody has a legitimate right to fight the other person. This abstract invocation of rights as something magical, as if it is some kind of fetishized power, which will just suddenly have an impact on you while we have abandoned it, is meaningless. It has to be, each right has to be sustained through political, I mean, activity, you know, and ultimately it comes on to the people. And whether it is journalists or any other professional, it has to earn that kind of a legitimacy and hopefully people will have a good sense to side with them and support more virtuous journalism than less. And they will also get things wrong sometimes. I mean, all of us get things wrong, sometimes injustices happen, but that is the structural reality in which this thing has to play out."

But I think they act as incentives for everybody. You know, the right to property is important as an incentive for everyone to work hard because they can accumulate wealth and they can keep it and that's how you rise in life. And it's a positive sum game, it's not a zero sum game. So that's an essential right, which actually is no longer a fundamental right. Episode 26 of my show with Shruti Rajgopalan deals on that. And also, the right to free speech is essential to democracy. It might be the case that, you know, some people exercise it more in an overt way, but that's neither"

And if their expectations are to have more of yellow journalism and all of that, then there will be consequences for them and their society itself. But ultimately, we are a self governing society.

I used to go out to play with kids every day. That's that was a routine. It was just something that was fun also. But whenever I would get time, I was reading something, you know. So, the first time I came across like a library was, I think, when I was in sixth standard or something. I went with a friend into this, we were living in Gorakhpur and there was an office, government office. And we entered and then there was a library inside that office. It's an office of basically where engineers in government railway used to work. And you go inside and there's a library. And there I found all the children's classics, you know. So, till that time, I only had access to mostly, I mean, Hindi literature books, but like children's literature. So, at that time, someone like Premchand, you can read as a kid or as a grown up, you know, that's the greatness of Premchand. And I was reading Hindi stories and poems and all and whatever was available at home, I would read. But that having the access to the first library, completely open, so many books can be found at the same place. It was a complete sense of wonder because the idea of library wasn't really so much there in my mind. And then I started picking up and one by one, I remember I read Adventures of Robin Hood, I read Ivanhoe, I read Swiss Family Robinson, Treasure Island, which later also I got my school to read Treasure Island as part of my coursework in school. So, and it kind of most of my reading when I was in school was basically fiction, more or less. I hardly read anything else. And I used to love reading novels as I grew older, I started enjoying in my teens, serious, I mean, literature a little bit, and cultivated some taste for it automatically. I mean, just snowballing right from one to another, start spending a little bit time in bookshops and libraries and pick up. And I actually, the first time I actually started reading serious nonfiction was in college only like when I started picking up books from different disciplines and reading them. I also got a little bit more money in my hand. I was doing internships and making some money and spending all of that on books. I remember doing an internship where I got 8000 rupees. I went to this bookshop in Baroda, Baroda Book Center, where the owner actually knew the books very well. I said, I've got this full money, all of it is to be spent on books, you tell me which ones would be good. He gave me a nice set that all discounted, like new books on decent discount, because he saw that a student should be given a discount. And he gave me really good books. 8000 bucks you spent on books. Yes. And that was many, many years ago. So, this was I think about 20 years ago. So, all of the money was spent on books he gave me. And he was very gentle and kind enough. It took a couple of hours and then he gave me suggestions, which all I accepted. I was in no position to. So, it was eclectic, like the book collection was pretty and but it basically tripled my book collection one day, because I put all my money into the books. Then I so basically, I now read very little literature. I mean, I still read a few books every year of literature, but mostly I read, I mean, nonfiction, but at that time, it was still substantially reading literature. I really enjoyed that kind of experience of literature, you know, I mean, literary critics have a lot of words for it, but I actually felt it opened up the whole world for me in some senses, you know, and as a person who didn't really enjoy too much social interaction and going out and spending too much time in large gatherings and all, it was like I'm sitting in a room and reading a book and this is my kind of, you know, I'm participating in something. Initially, it was so I the first great book I read was 100 years of solitude. I think I was 19 or something when I read it and it just amazing level of, I mean, it was just magical, you know, literally, I mean, I think the genre itself is called magical realism. But what you can achieve in a book, you know, in terms of the quality of writing the story, the unfettered imagination, put everything even something as, you know, bad as I mean, insist and all looks magical in that book. It's a stunning achievement. So I started reading a lot of that genre. And one key point came when I read my first Saul Bellow, who continues to be my favorite writer and his first book I read was this at a very strange time in my life in my early 20s. I was going through some difficult time when this book really spoke to me directly, which was this basically a thin volume that he read. It was his second book, I think. The dangling man I think, yeah, the dangling man it's called. And I was like, wow, I mean, literature can be written in this way also, because it is completely different from the magical realism and all that I was reading until then and before that children's classic and all of that. And it, so I went into this whole, which then I actually branched out to other writers of that genre. I was still reading a lot of magical realism, Salman Rushdie, who I mean, recently has been in a lot of trouble, great writer. And then I mean, basically branched out into different types of literature. So, you know, Philip Roth, I like Isaac Singer, Malamud, all of those. And I mean, it was just a part of my, so in a day one or two hours you spend reading a nice novel and it's just a very nice part of the day, generally. And it's whatever may have happened in the day, that's the couple of hours nobody can take away from you. And then I started actually reading more of non-fictions books and I didn't have any sense of, so I was, my education was in computer science and I did my MBA later. So I didn't have any, I mean, I was studying other things and formally, but because I had this kind of a routine of reading regularly, but it was more like chance, you know, what I read. If you think back, there was no community of readers with me. There were some elders, my father's friends who helped me pick a few books here and there, who were kind enough, who had gone through experiences in their life, who had seen some bit of the world. So they gave me some hints about what to read and all, but still it was mostly chance what I read. Like for example, my first philosophy book I read was actually Aristotle. I literally, and Plato. So I actually read the dialogues directly. I didn't know that there were commentaries to be read before all of that. I straight away went to the source and started reading Plato. I remember specifically Plato's Gorgias was my first serious philosophy book. It's a short dialogue, but a very, I mean, it raises permanent questions. So, and I kind of snowballed from there and went, first I read the ancient, I had no clue about the modern, but then immediately soon I got into some of this modern existential philosophy and all of that and started reading that. Our home always had Mahabharata, Ramayana and all those. So those I read when I was young. We also used to have these Amar Chitra Kathas, you know, which is, and one of my neighbors had these bound volumes, which each volume had five of these comics. And you just go through them and it's amazing, each one of the standalone story. And so I was seeped in that throughout. But this literature, which is modern and also the, I mean, nonfiction writing and philosophy, I read a little bit of psychology, I read a little bit of sociology, I read a little bit of economics at that time. It was just, I mean, why was I doing it? I couldn't really put a, more like a routine, you know, that almost like that character of our autodidact from nausea, who just goes from one, but a little better than that, because you're trying to understand some things and you are actually, you have some reasons for understanding them. But still, there was a kind of a routine. And then because you read, you have more questions, right? And you want to read more. And you want to think more about those questions. And then you branch out. It was just, I mean, kind of a serendipity that I ended up chancing about some of these great books. And then I developed a taste for great books. And what I have a category of great books, I have never defined it formally, but I know what a great book is when I see one. So we spent a few months ago, right? Looking at 6000 books in a day, you and I. And when I look at a book, I have a sense of where it belongs, or how much to read and how much importance to give to it. And that cultivation of that habit in the early 20s, I think was a very important, I mean, point in my life. And it's been a part of my life. I've really just because we come very late in the history, there's so much has happened before us. I have to give dues to those who have come before us. And there's really, I mean, the questions that we are wrestling with, others have also wrestled with. And I think reading really helps in many ways to, you will not get answers by reading, but you will certainly get better at asking the right questions. And that's what I think, especially if you read like fundamental works on philosophy, psychoanalysis, social systems, sociology, even some of the great works of anthropology. So you get politics, of course, political theory. So, and it's a law, it's a vast word out there, right. And more recently, like just a few years ago, or five, six years ago, I got back to our own kind of reading our own scriptures and trying to see, trying to put them in conversation with other traditions and saying, what do we have? Our main concerns have always been consciousness. Our main concerns have always been the human consciousness and its kind of liberation. And there, I think, our own traditions have a lot to offer. And because those questions are now more urgent for me as I'm growing older. So I've gone back to more of those and I read, still read the Western philosophy and all, but I read more of the ancients there, again, going back then the moderns. And I mean, those that journey continues. But yes, this habit of reading regularly, and trying to find great books, and trying to have is a background, which is just there every day of my life for the last 25 years or so, pretty much. And it's just there. I mean, if there are good days and bad days, there are times I'm traveling and all, but I still find at least two hours"

        "message": "to read every day. And I should tell my listeners that when you speak about going through 6000 books, my dad had died last year. So in December, I had to go to the house which we were selling off and decide what to do with his books. And he had more than 6000 books, 6000-7000 books. And I had figured out a community library in Delhi to donate them to. But I thought, let's, let me go with three of my friends, Suyash being one of them, and ask them to pick out whatever they wanted. And I would pick out whatever I wanted. And then we'd give the rest of it away. And as kind of heartbreaking for me in the sense all his collections of modern library books, and everyone's classics and all of that and, and, you know, me making the choice to kind of give it away and not keep it because I just want to, you know, the only physical books I took from there was stuff that I wouldn't actually find anywhere otherwise which are out of print or something. I can't even, you know, read it on a Kindle or something. So that was kind of I mean, I mean, there was a life of the mind happening there as well. Bunch of questions. First of those is that, how did you begin to form frames through which you could look at the world and explain the world? Because in my case, I read voraciously when it came to fiction, again came to nonfiction a bit more slowly and a bit later. But you know, today everyone today young people are so full of certainties and the internet is there and there are ideological tribes that are so appealing to join and all of that. But in those pre internet days in the 80s, in the early 90s, you know, it took a long time for me to be formed. I think I arrived broadly to where I am in terms of values and beliefs and all well into my adulthood, really well into my mid 20s, where I could even look at the country and say, Oh, these are the things that have gone wrong. This is what is wrong with our economics. This is wrong. What is wrong with our politics? I suspect if when I was 22, if you asked me what is left, what is right, I would I wouldn't know. Right? So tell me a little bit about how, what are the different frames that you began to adapt to look at the world and to, you know, begin to understand it? What was that process like? I mean, we are always constantly evolving, obviously. But in in the major ways, what are the sort of frames that were useful to you? Who were the writers who influenced you? Were there any phases where you felt that scales have fallen off your eyes that you see something with a clarity with which you hadn't seen it before, whether it is in the personal domain or the economic domain or the social domain?"

        "message": "Yeah, it's a, I wish you had sent me this question a few days in advance and I had thought more deeply about it. But I mean, just reflecting on something you said, is that there are many disadvantages of being socially shy. But one of the advantages that you don't feel the need to belong to a tribe and signal anything to anyone to, to feel that you're part of a particular tribe and you're not going out on, I mean, whether it's in physical setting or a virtual setting to, to signal things to feel complete person, you feel pretty, I mean, comfortable being a little away from any tribe and doing your own thing to the extent you're doing those things. And I think that because I've always had that, so I've never really needed to belong to any tribe. So I never had to, I mean, it's a good thing or a bad thing. Sometimes it's a good thing that you belong to a tribe and you join and you take their views. And then hopefully, if you are independent minded enough, then you outgrow those, you know, there are many people who get mugged by realities and different types of transformations happen. So it's a good thing, but can also be a bad thing because it can end, stop thinking because you get comfortable. So I never had that. So I mean, one had to find one own way. And so there are two types of beliefs. One is that where you actually something very serious for you to act upon, you know, there you have to take it very, very, you know, it excites a lot of due diligence because you're acting upon something right. But many of the, I mean, so our act, word of action, because we're not in, we're not prime ministers and we're not doing those kind of things is a limited sphere right. For that you need to have a few things, you have a little bit of excellence in some things and that you need to be good at. The other types of beliefs are held in a different way, right. We don't act upon them. We just we hold them, we revise them. It's just trying to understand, make sense of the word, you know, because the old mythological understandings have broken down. The word is not so self-contained in our, in a particular cosmology and we need to now remake the meanings in many ways. So we need to understand to some extent or we just say it doesn't matter. It's fine. I'm just going to do what, take what comes to me and move on. But if you have a longing to understand then you need to keep engaging with the word and trying to have some kind of working hypothesis about, you know, what's going on, you know. And there I think it's a, I don't know, it's just my memories doesn't work in this way. How much of it is reading, how much is observation, how much is reflection, how much was it influence of others, how much was it reflection, I mean, just habit, you know, it's very hard to say. But I think it was a mix of these things. So one thing that you learn from the ancients in any tradition is to look at things directly and observe them and comment on them and analyze them directly. Some of the moderns also do that, like Tocqueville does that very well on democracy. Don't get too impressed by frames and ideologies and clever turn of phrase, you know. You're a human being, you're talking about human life and human society, you can look at it directly and observe and by the power of your observation and careful thinking you can make sense of some of these things. Books, other people's views are useful and interesting and important to kind of reflect what you are seeing and sometimes even you can adapt some of those. But you need to have your own thinking, there is no substitute for that. And I think that one of the things that has always helped me is an intuition that I, when I look at something, I have an intuitive sense of what's going on. And then I keep revising it over a long period of time. Because whatever I'm studying, I start with something with like a, so I'm a rationalist, not empiricist. So I have a kind of a rational view of where I'm coming from, you know, and what's going on. And then I look at data, look at trying to figure out what's going on. So that's the method that I apply. And it sometimes works, sometimes doesn't work, and it keeps evolving, right? It's not a, there's never a permanent thing, because descriptions are not reality. Map is not the directory, you know, and you're making man remapping the map. But in what I'm working on, I try to be as careful as possible so that I get it right and have some, for the rest, it's more like a hobby and habit and hopefully someday in some work becomes useful. But otherwise, it's just a kind of a need to understand things and have a view on things like human consciousness, social processes, workings of democracy, all those things which I don't directly work upon. But it's something that you need to have a view on, right? Like you need to have a sense of what's going on here, you know, because we are part of that reality. And you can have a nuanced and reasonably complex understanding of something or you can have a very simple and simplistic understanding also sometimes. And one cannot understand everything, as Saul Bellows says, there's simply too much to think about, you know. And, but there are some areas, some issues on which I do try to, I have tried long standing themes to understand, for example, how literature works on our consciousness, the question of moral philosophy. We've already discussed some of that here. Working of democracy in societies, we've touched upon it a little bit. And of course, our professional life, working on political economy and all. So we're, and I mean, one always lives and learns. I have actually abandoned more of my views than I have now. I have been completely wrong on many, many things. In fact, in my even professional work, there are so many issues on which my views are completely different from what they were eight years ago, seven years ago. And that's a kind of a humbling experience, because you know, you're so sure, I haven't figured it out. But then you think about it, or you see new data, and you read something, or you go through an experience, and you say, oh, I was completely wrong about this. I think that is something which, in fact, I've become more open now than I was 15 years ago, or even 10 years ago, about how much I know, and how much I know. And one of the things that one actually doesn't know much, you know, that is the most fundamental humbling realization that really one doesn't really know much. It's really difficult to understand even your own consciousness. Forget about social, political systems, the extreme complexity, and we should be humble and modest. That's why I mean, in my work, I generally suggest light touch approaches, less coercion, less political economy work also, because and that's why I was so upset with decision like demonetization or something will be more modest about how much you know about the word and don't do something so drastic and so path breaking that you because you think you know, so I and that that is something actually, it's more as I said, more recent realization that these frames are very, very fragile. And when it comes to them, and when one revises them, and when one gets upset, and then one has to move on and try to do better in the future, you know."

So that rich imaginative interior life that reading a lot of literature and fiction gives you is often not there and and you can sometimes be hobbled by it.

And I just liked it. And I really enjoyed it in terms of what it was doing to me into my inner life, you know, and it put me in touch with I mean, my own kind of, you know, like you go through a, it's, it sounds like a cliche, but you go through some suffering and you read Gutter's Sorrow of Young Worth. Actually, it may sound like a cliche, but really it works. You know, it's a comforting thing to learn about what do they say, afflict the comforted and comfort the afflicted, you know, that kind of a thing. But even I mean, one is not always comforted or afflicted. Usually it's somewhere in the middle. And even at that time, it's just something that takes you in a different territory as far as a human possibility of thought and understanding a concern, right? It's a very empathetic exercise, writing literature, it comes from a place, which is not quite available to us, you and me, when we talk about or talk to each other. Proust has this kind of, you know, he wrote this essay against leading critic, literary critic of his time, about where literature comes from, you know, and it's not the kind of self that you and I have direct access to. And it just opens up so much possibility and literature, great writers know that it's more like a gift that they perfect the form, obviously, they perfect the language and all of that. They work very hard on it. But the source of imagination is in the subconscious. And it's kind of comes from a place which is not directly accessible to them. It just comes to them, you know, like, when you write like Proust, certainly, it sounds like it comes from a different kind of place. And it's magic, right? It's magical. It's like some of the religious scriptures you read, and they immediately hit you. And, and it just, it has that magical feeling is yeah, wow. I mean, it speaks to me as if it's my personal conversation with someone that's happening and great philosophers also do that. Like that's the greatness of the dramatic way in which Plato writes, right? That it's drama. And of course, you can make the mistake of associating with one side or the other without, I mean, understanding that you should try to look at both all sides. But, but it just immediately hits you. It's not going into a extreme level of qualifications. And, I mean, explaining each term in so much detail that it becomes meaningless to read something like that, like some of the, I've tried to wrestle with those also, but much more of a direct thing, which immediately hits you. And then you have to critically think about what it is doing to you also. And, you know, and yeah, so yeah, and I think it is a interesting path that to take to read broadly, widely if you're so inclined and read great literature and great philosophers and great thinkers in psychology and society and religious scriptures, I think are very, very powerful. I mean, I wish more people read them regularly across traditions. You don't have to be narrow-minded about it. There's wisdom to be had wherever there is."

And that's how they kind of sort of think about it. But you've been speaking and our previous episode, of course, was on the role of religion in Indian society as well and that was very illuminating. But what you're sort of saying is that that's a wrong way to think of religion, that religion plays a central role in our society and in our existence and that if we are open to it, there is a lot of value to be had from religious scriptures. In fact, Pratap Bhanu Mehta once while speaking about his own religiosity spoke about the purest form of religion, what he got from the elders in his family as being a form of deep skepticism, right? So, I forget the exact terms he used, but it was a very sort of, it gave me a different picture into what an engagement with religion can be like, which was quite different from the normal, you know, one that is full of blind faith and superstition and idolatry and all of that.

I don't, I mean, I pray sometimes, but it's not something which is a, but I'm more, I mean, philosophically religious in that sense. So, it's much more like, so as I said that to understand the nature of our consciousness to begin with and we have an unconscious and the language of the unconscious is symbolic and it doesn't speak to us in the language that we speak of. And I think that's the level at which religious, I mean, whether it's mythology or even the more abstract texts speak to that level within us. And therefore, it's a very humbling experience because the experience of religion is basically the experience of the numinous, right? It's a sense of numinous and it can be represented as some God that transcends the world or it's something can be represented more psychologically, some people represent it or it can be represented in the sense of the Brahman that exists and we are basically, I mean, our Atman is a part, it is the same as that or differently, you know, there are different ways in which this has been, I mean, put in different traditions. But the core common point, I think, is the experience of this numinosity, which basically the religion is supposed to give you and that's a humbling experience. That's a very humbling experience because you are, I mean, if you start associating with your gods, I mean, psychologically, then you can have a huge ego inflation and you can actually be the worst kind of religious person, you know, because while if you actually think about it as one consciousness experiencing the presence of numinous, then it's a much more humbling experience actually. It's much more about your journey as an individual soul or consciousness or whatever you may call it, towards a particular kind of spiritual experience or like, one of the things that I've always, I mean, remember whenever I think about religion, I don't think about it all the time, but is that when I was like 12 or 13 years old, my family has a guru, he passed away a few years ago, he was, he had an ashram in Mathura. And I asked my uncle, just like a naive kid, but how do you know somebody is a guru? So, he said something very interesting that the way to tell is that the guru will always or the person who's enlightened will always treat everybody alike, whether it's a prime minister of the country, or somebody who's completely under destitution or powerless, so to speak, he will treat everybody alike. That's the one test he gave me, that if you want to know who's a real guru, he's not going to treat the prime minister in a special way because of some ceremony or something, we'll treat him the same way as anybody else. And that was, as a kid, it didn't mean anything"

So, as a kid, I said, well, what does it even mean? How can you treat everybody alike? But as you grow older, you realize that's the truth of it, right? When you when you're truly religious or truly, I mean, spiritual in that sense, then you actually see some very humbling experience. It's experience of equality in some ways, you know, that we are all in the most important ways equal, you know, all the surface level differences, intelligence, wealth, all that alike, in the most important ways, we're equal. And that's represented in different ways. For example, in some Western traditions and Abrahamic traditions, there's some God and against that you're equal. So, there's one. And in our tradition, it's different, represented differently. And the experience and past are different. I'm not saying they're the same thing. They're offering different paths, whether they're leading to the same thing or not, I don't know. I'll experience that hopefully later in my life. I haven't, I don't have the kind of religious experience that is required to comment on that. But these are the things that I think are, as you actually practice this thing and think about it and engage with it seriously, that this is what it is. And I mean, one doesn't have to, but I link it to democracy also in some senses that, you know, these are the kind of values in some ways that democracy could use more of, you know, that a guru who teaches, who treats everybody alike, a citizen who genuinely and deeply experiences equality, you know, and not pays too much attention to the surface level differences that exist between us. And that's something actually. So, I've also gone through many phases. I had a very naive belief early on, which was as a kid, you know, like literally every day pray, there's Lord Shiva, there's this, you know, there was deities to bow in front of and it's a ritual, much more of a ritual. It still comforts and calms me very much. But that I kind of outgrew in my 20s itself. Like I didn't have that kind of a naive belief anymore. So then I had a long march back. That march is too long to talk about here. Hopefully, once the march is complete, I'll have something to say about it. But it's been a long, long march."

So, you know, earlier, I'd asked about whether your background set you apart from the other sort of people you worked with in the policy space or the quote unquote, intellectual circles of Delhi. Let me come at that question from another angle, where one fixes the lens on the intellectual elites of Delhi, as it were. You've written this lovely essay on Tocqueville, which of course I'll link from the show notes, where you quote Blaise Pascal as saying early on quote, what a great advantage to be of noble birth, since it gives a man of 18, the standing recognition and respect that another man might not earn before he was 50. That means winning 30 years start with no effort, stop quote. And this, of course, is a comment on privilege of sorts that we should be aware of. But it's also a comment on how so many of these intellectual elites and policy elites and all of that, everything kind of just fell into the lap, they were born in a particular place in a particular time, perhaps in a particular family. And this was an easy sort of route to take, you do your PhD in a foreign university, perhaps, in the course of things, you come back a quote unquote, expert in a particular subject with a particular kind of lens, which is the fashionable lens at the time, which might have been acquired from wherever you studied and all of that. And you're on a groove, and it's a set groove, and it's a set path. And it is natural when one is on that path to not gain epistemic humility, or, you know, not to use fancy terms, but to not gain the humility to recognize that you're often wrong, that maybe the lens that you were indoctrinated with might be the wrong lens might be simplistic, might be looking at the wrong things, that there is more to the world that you have to, you know, first engage in good faith, and with respect, different points of view, that, you know, you can't just sit back and pass judgment on people all the time, you have to make that effort to get down and dirty and really understand what's going on. And everything that I'm saying sounds incredibly harsh, but it's certainly my view of a lot of the so called Latins elite that I see around me. And that is one thing that I think Modi is absolutely right on. I think, you know, as everybody knows, I've opposed Modi so strongly that I've been mobbed, I've faced threats, all that shit has happened, you know, especially after I opposed him on from day one. So I'm like, at one level, the biggest opponent in the policy sphere, but he's right about this. And this is perhaps one reason that, you know, there are a lot of people instinctively support him on this issue, because there is that sort of understanding that our data clueless elites led us down the wrong path, tried to reshape our country in a way that, you know, wasn't in consonance with what the country really was. And what is happening today is pushback. So give me a sense of these elites because and I don't want to sort of make it sound as if every individual who works with you is a scoundrel or something like that. You know, I know many of these individuals, I am in a sense one of the privileged elites, many of these people are my friends. But there is a systemic problem that we keep going on and on about an idea of India that has nothing to do with India. And that we never did the hard work of trying to shape this country and shape it from within the culture and from within society instead top down bat gay humne socha ki bus, you know, hum apne high ideal se sab kuch badal denge like the, you know, like like earlier, you were speaking of hypothetical constitution law or lawyers who don't really want to engage in the dirty work of politics, but just change it from their pedestals and ivory towers.

It's a very unnatural thing to do to be done at scale. You know, when you think about large society, complex adaptive systems, which are kind of evolving and emerging, and you try to describe them in a way which is not sufficiently complex in representing that reality and is much more of a top down perspective of it, then it's impossible to get it right. I mean, for the most part, unless you completely reorient yourself and talk in a language which is respecting of the complexity of that reality, and whether it's a social reality or economic or political, different spheres, and all of them are overlapping, all of that.

There was not a, it was the recommendations based on things that one thought one knew, and then later one thought that maybe one was not right about it. So it's, the fundamental thing is that it's very hard to do this, you know, that think tanks, and working in bringing intellectualism to this is, is to begin with very difficult to get it right. But, I mean, there are obviously, as you said, many shades of this, like if you work closely with people who have a sense of constraints, you're working on specific problems that you're trying to solve in a democratic way, the role of the intellectual or expert in democracy is a very small role, you know, it's a very limited role. Democratic processes are basically, there is a system which has been put in place constitutionally. And that system has its own internal logic to working. And even if you forget about the constitutional system, and the words that are put in the constitution, that's not so important. The important thing is the reality of the way societies work. And the society will support certain kinds of constitutional practices and oppose certain constitutional and nothing you can do about it because the people are sovereign, you know, that's the fundamental thing. Everything else is just language games on top of that. So, so you have, you have that and so you have to define your role in a manner which is more modest and you're trying to frame issues, you're trying to bring out facts for people's attention for the experts and for the policy makers' attentions. Policy makers have legitimacy, right? Because politicians get elected, they are empowered to take decisions, they don't have to go and do a referendum every time. There are some limited amount of power for which they have some power, limited amount of time for which they have some power. And they can take a decision, you can give them all some alternatives about these are different ways, pros and cons. It's they still have to go and figure out what will politically be feasible or not. They have to ask their constituents sometimes, at least some stakeholders about what would work, what would not. So, there is a role, you know, on shedding lights on facts, analyzing facts, but that is, you stop there and then you start, I mean, you accept that there is a democratic process through which things will happen. And you will often be disappointed. I worked on one particular reform for three years. Three years I've devoted to that one issue in my previous job. It was to reform a particular kind of do a particular financial sector reform on bankruptcy of financial firms. And after three years, it was withdrawn. I mean, in fact, from the parliament, the bill was withdrawn. And that's it. I mean, there was a democratic process. There was some opposition. And I believe there was some wisdom in the government's decision to withdraw it. It wasn't the right time perhaps. My intellectual vanity was certainly hurt that, hey, I have worked on this and I was a very small part of it. I'm not elected. I'm not even an IAS officer. I'm working inside a system which has its own kind of ways of working. I have some bit of expertise. I've done research in that area for many years and I've worked on it for at least six, seven years even previously. So I had some ideas, but that's, I mean, a very, I mean, those ideas are not there for, nobody's waiting for those ideas to come. Oh, wow, you've now saved me, you know. So that I think is, is very important. The most important thing to avoid is intellectual pride, which all of us usually fall for. And I think the best way to avoid is to accept that you don't know. You don't know anything actually pretty much. But there are also other kind of problems that emerge in the way these things are happening that there are more localized games, right, that some intellectual and some politicians are in a happy relationship like, okay, I'll give you certain ideas that look very good on surface, we'll give you some short term wins. And the politicians say, yes, it sounds something I can work with. Whether the long term impact will be good or not is something which there the intellectual actually has a duty to actually do the right kind of advice and not get too political about it that, okay, what will help this person win elections only. That's obviously a constraint that the person has to worry about, the politicians to worry about. Intellectuals worry about the general equilibrium impact, you know, about what are the common good, how and long term how it how it will be served. I think there are quite a few compromises often made. I mean, by individuals, it's not a comment on everybody. There are lots of people who are who don't do it like that. But I think if some distance is maintained, some principle distance is maintained, and you say, okay, I'm here to do research and put out analysis and ideas. And it's a privilege, right, to be paid to read and think and write and analyze things. And I'm not playing the power game so much, you know, then it's more kind of an endishing for both sides, I think, whether intellectual class can serve the political class better and political class can benefit from the from the intellectual expertise better. And also, I mean, you can be true to your fear. And these are, this is what breaks down often because everything is political, you know, there is a person is a political, this is political, that is political, everything is political, then I mean, is there anything else which is to be considered or is power, the only thing that really matters. And so, as I said, intellectual pride is one thing, but also greed, in some ways, you know, hunger for power that can can get into this and epistemic humility is then shaped by all these other things, right? Like if you are really in it for the reason of Seva, so to speak, service, then you will sooner or later figure out that you were wrong and you don't understand much. And therefore, you need to be humble and you will you need to know that you are just one citizen among 1.4 billion, all of them have the same vote, just because you read a little bit, you don't know much. In fact, reading is one way to understand the world. And data analysis is one way to understand the world. Experience is another, business people know a lot, I talked to a lot of business people, they have a lot more wisdom over in the political economy that all the political economy researchers put together, including me, some of them, not all, because those who reflect about their world and who have lived through the last 30 years of Indian economy and have thought about it deeply. Some of the civil servants have deep wisdom about, politicians generally have a lot of wisdom about how the society works and what is possible, what is not possible, most of them actually. So, I think a much more of a modesty is required from this class, I think, and a little bit more honesty about what our role is. And again, being true to the virtues of being an analyst and intellectual or a thinker, or a researcher in policy space. I think generally, quite a few people do have that. I worked with quite a few of them, I still work with some of them. And I admire them, I learn from them, I am trying to do to be like, more like them. And I mean, I need to see more role models of that type. And so, otherwise, if you are only looking for power, or a lot more attention all the time, the whole thing is going in the direction of eyeballs, the game is of eyeballs, getting more and more views, and getting access, access comes at a cost, it is not so easy. So, but that is the game, everybody, the philanthropists pay for access and impact and all of that. So, there is a complex system in which different things have to realign a little to get good practices flourishing and bad practices diminishing in this, as it is in other domains. And overall, I think the space is expanded, there are now more think tanks and universities, more things to be done, more specialized areas of work also, somebody wants to do on tech policy can do tech policy, other areas. But ultimately, I think, because you are here to serve society, you have to first understand the society a little bit, like try to make sense of, I mean, maybe all the major premises, you know, like in major premise, minor premise inclusion. So, you all the major premises do not come from you only, right? People have their own preferences, like they want to, they want certain things, why are you here to impose your values upon them to transform their lives, you know, who are you, you are one citizen. And to get that through shortcuts that I will get this one, I mean, order passed or something is really, I mean, vitiating the democratic atmosphere. And in some ways, I mean, I think Mr. Modi goes overboard in his populist rhetoric. But it is a symbol, right? Just think about it. He said Khan market, how many people in India know Khan market? Only people, it is a Delhi thing, right? But it somehow resonates in other parts also, because every place has its Khan market. You know, and there's something to be said about that kind of rhetoric working. Why with working? So, it's, and therefore, I think there is some need to understand why something like this work. I'm not, I don't think populist politics is a good thing. In democracy, it's a perversion of democracy. And but democracy is perverted in many ways, not just populism."

And now you don't want to put in the cognitive energy to modify that frame, or to engage with other ways of looking at the world, or to enter a deep, meaningful discourse where you're not lecturing someone, but you're actually engaging with them. And the second drive is a drive to sanctimony, that you know, it makes all of us feel virtuous if you're giving lectures on morality to others, if you're condemning others, if you're passing judgment, and that sort of becomes problematic."

He's alive, by the way, we are talking like he's very much alive. Shout out to Kumar. And I think we met at Khar Social, was it? And some place. And one of the things that immediately you and I were on exactly the same page was demonetization, where both of us felt equally strongly. And we both agreed that it was a litmus test for us. Key, you know, whether you're really a liberal or you're not in terms of, you know, the classical sense of the word liberal. And I later wrote a piece called the Beware of the Useful Idiots, which was an editorial for the online magazine I edited Pragati, where my argument was that any economist who supported demonetization was either a bad economist or a bad human being, because demon was just so evidently daft and dangerous. And like I keep saying, the largest attack on property rights in human history. And, and that also shows how some of our intellectual elites are not driven by what they project as a power of ideas or believing in certain principles, but rather other kinds of contingencies, like many of the people who supported demon were people who had allied themselves with the government, because they thought key TK, you know, they'll bring about the change we want, at least that was their reasoning then. But even when they saw that this government was far more status than previous ones, and we're thinking and we're doing completely daft and dangerous things like demonetization, they continued rationalizing that they continued supporting that, at one hand, of course, the government had given out this order to all its house dogs, as it were, that, you know, defend demon. But many of them did it. Many of them actually did it. Many of them wrote columns and came on TV, supporting demonetization, when you and I know that they knew that it was a disaster. And yet they, you know, willfully lied. And that makes me and there are two thoughts connected with this. And one is that a lot of what people claim to believe in is a front to themselves and to others. And people are more tribal than they are principled, by and large, with"

It doesn't mean that there is no circumstance in which I won't compromise, who knows, you know, you put me in a dungeon, and you torture me and you make me watch Shahrukh Khan movies all day, even I will bend at some point. But, but in general, we've avoided tribalism, which is something I can, you know, confidently say, whereas, and this is something I'm lamenting, I'm not, you know, I'm just lamenting that, like earlier, you said that we do things for reasons that we ourselves may not understand, you know, what is going on in our subconscious, we don't know most of it. So that's sort of one thing I saw during that, that kind of made me feel that, you know, people are more tribal than their principled, even when they appear principled. We saw this in the US with the Republican Party, where so many Republicans supported Trump, despite the fact that Trump stood against so many of the principles of the Republican Party, like on trade, for example, where his positions are identical to Bernie Sanders.

So, and it's just two sides of the same coin right now, but the times can change. And when demonetization was a very disappointing time, because many people I know who should know better, I mean, still said something different from what I, it was apparent to me, I mean, what was going on and the harm that it would do not just in terms of direct harm, but also unsettling the assumptions about the way policies are made in India and implemented the process and kind of diligence that is gone and the direction of India's policymaking in some ways was completely, it was a shock event to that, right. There was a general directionality of more openness and liberality, a little bit more policy certainty they were trying to establish. Even they, between 2014 and 16, the government had stabilized the economy in many ways, they had taken quite a few sensible decisions. And suddenly, two and a half years into the government, this thing was announced, and I wish there had been more civil society, at least among intellectual economies, there had been a little bit more skepticism about even trying something like this. And I think more than economics, economics can justify many things, because it depends on the assumptions you make about the future, right. So, future assumption of analysis of future impact, and which variables you consider. So, some people highlight the digitization and all of that. It is more full political philosophy, right. What is the political philosophy that you have that you would support a decision like this, you know, as a citizen, and that to take in such a way, you know, which was completely certain, arbitrary, and in my view, at least harmful and wrong. So, but that is the thing. Everybody has their reasons. They have their reasons to do what they do. But I agree that wherever tribalism comes in, tribalism becomes a reason. And then it substitutes many other reasons, you know, the reasoning and the rationality that should go into at least for people like us who are in that luxurious space of thinking carefully, analyzing data and having scenarios of the future and seeing what are the plausible scenarios, typical way in which you do policy analysis. If you have that, and you don't excise that, it's much more tribalism, it's harmful. That's why I think that, yes, politics is very important. It is the main way in which you organize society. Politicians are the ones who have greatest legitimacy in a democratic setting to take decisions and all of that. And democracy has rewarded that decision in some ways. They have won the election and all of that. And it's very important and that is the way in which our society settles these questions. I mean, there is nothing else. But each one of us has our duty, right, to when we think that something is going to do some harm, and we have some basis to say that and we have thought carefully about it, then we put it out and hopefully some people will listen to it, some course correction will happen and all of that. And that is our role. And whether democracy will listen to us, whether people will listen to us, whether the politicians will listen to us, is not something that we can really control. We are, I mean, our influence is a matter of more of our time than our own self, what happens with the ideas that we have. And so I humbly say that you and I, I for sure thought it was a harmful decision, not just in the short term cost, but also the long term impact on the political economy of India. It disrupted many things that were underpinning our growth, in my view. And, but reasonable people always disagree. I mean, some reasonable people can disagree about the economics of it. But the political philosophy, the kind of citizens, perspectives that came out, I thought, because the way it was presented, it was like a fight against corruption, right. It was a sacrificial kind of a process through which you fight and cleanse your body politic of corruption. And that became very difficult to oppose for many people. Politically appeared like if you are opposing demonetization, opposing corruption. You know, people like us who wrote about it in a critical way, analytically, I mean, we had to go to extra lengths to say that we are not supporting corruption, quote unquote. Corruption is a complicated business. And we can come to talk about that a little later if you want, what is corruption and what is not. But at that time, it was a pretty binary situation. And quite a few people, I mean, disappointingly, for tribal reasons or for reasons of appearing virtuous at that time, basically said that, hey, this is at least it's an experiment worth trying. Or they said that this is, this is going to work, you know, all of that, which without offering enough evidence of why it may be. And even now, there are lots of people who defend that decision. Even after these many years, they still think that it worked. So, I guess, there's a possibility that I may be wrong about it. And I have to accept that, because I don't know everything, obviously. But I still hold the view that it was the wrong decision."

I just met this person, who was at NIPFP, he was a professor at NIPFP, Ajay, you know, that we were common friends. And he had come to a conference that I'd organized in my previous job, I'd helped organize and on financial system reforms. And at that time, a commission was being set up, Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, and they were looking for researchers to work on that. And he made me an offer to come and join and work for the commission. It was two year commission, so a good amount of time to work on something. Usually policy work often gets done in very short period of time. And it's not very satisfying, because it's very short turnaround time, but this was a two year thing. So I thought it'd be interesting to do it for two years and then come back and do work, go into private sector or whatever it was, microfinance or anything that I mean, whatever the experience at that time working on. So I joined in 2011, basically, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, which is a, I mean, basically a policy research shop. But it's an autonomous body promoted by the government. So it's, you work mainly with the government, closely with the government, and you do some research also, I mean, of your own. And I stayed there for almost eight years. And the main work there was to do policy research. I worked on different, I mean, projects, I worked with different ministries and departments and government agencies. And I really enjoyed that work. So what I had thought I'd do for two years, I ended up doing for eight years."

And when I had a bit of a soft landing, because I worked for a commission, not directly with a ministry or department or agency of government work with a commission, which was an expert body, set up under a former Supreme Court judge. And we had a very good leading economist, former regulators, experts, and a good bunch of researchers working together, mostly lawyers and economists, I was an outsider, I'm neither a lawyer nor an economist, a bit of an odd one out there. But I really enjoyed working and learned a lot from these lawyers, and economists and the regulators and the civil servants and also the judge who was leading it. And it was a soft landing, because although it was work for a government policy research, I mean, reform project, it wasn't in the heart of the beast, so to speak, you know, that you're not actually changing policy immediately, it's just research and analysis and presenting a set of ideas that may work, you know, that was the thing. And it was two years, so two years is a good time to do this, you know, it's a right amount of time to think about a problem and a set of problems. And I worked on a couple of areas intensively in that collaborated with some people and learned a lot from them. And some of those people had been doing policy research for years earlier. And then actually, after that, I had a more direct interaction. So again, my role was very small, to be very, very clear, it's a research policy researcher, right? You're not a decision maker, you're not an IAS officer, you're not a politician, you didn't need to get elected, nor did you crack a difficult exam many years ago. So you are here to provide analysis. And so when the commission submitted its report, it became about implementation. So parts of it was taken and implemented in some ways, inflation targeting grew out of it in some ways. There was a reform of capital controls that was done where powers are divided between government and RBI. Some reforms have come out of that process. And it was basically done by bureaucrats. So joint secretary is a key rank and joint secretaries are the ones who drive the world because they had a division and then secretaries have to support ministers to support many things go to the cabinet for approval. And one of the main things about government is that it's a relatively low capacity organization. It really struggles. It's a very difficult thing to do things because you don't have the kind of capacity. They are smart officers inside who really know a lot or at least have the capacity to quickly pick up because they have moved from one department to another which completely unrelated subjectivity, they quickly pick up. But the below director level, I mean, bureaucracy is very, very weak. I mean, in terms of just a number of people also the kind of quality that you get in terms of training that you provide them the kind of expertise that they have. So it's a constant struggle to do anything. So they do value outsiders like us who are working in a semi-sarkari government kind of think tank and helping them out. So they did value and there was a lot of kind of interest in from secretary, joint secretary, minister to kind of get help and get some support, research support and analytical support to push things forward a little bit. And so one thing that happened when I was working in this area, I will talk more about other things that I did, is that I developed a lot of empathy for people who work in government, whether it's the ministers or the IAS officers that I really felt that it's a very difficult situation and they are taking, partly they are responsible for it because government of India has taken on too many responsibilities and for us, for our stage of development, it is trying to take on too many things and more things than it should. I mean, we should have a much smaller things of set of issues that government is trying to solve and others you should just leave to civil society and market organize markets and accept it. But some for reasons which I don't fully understand, our democracy makes many, many demands and for reasons that again, I don't understand, our political leadership is not able to raise those demands. So Ministry of Agriculture is a state subject, it has 30 joint secretaries. So why should a government of India have 30 joint secretaries working in a ministry which is a state subject because, but still they are not going to raise these demands. So, I mean, again, as I said democracy, so there are things that are done which our intellectual worldview may find a little odd or inefficient, but allocative efficiency may appear bad, but it is done. So it's very difficult because you got a small number of IAS officers and a small number of other civil servants, revenue services, audit accounts and all that who have to do a lot of these things and the bureaucracy, low bureaucracy is very, very weak. Also, I mean, in the 90s, there was a drop in the hiring of IAS officers to the UPSC process. So again, that middle bureaucracy is very, very small and same number of same officers basically going around and doing things. So that was a one big, I mean, change is becoming more empathetic and understanding of the constraints. So one of the most important things in government is to understand the constraints within which things are done. James Q. Wilson, the great political scientist has a great book on bureaucracy, it's worth reading, everybody should read it. So his whole frame is to understand government through constraints, you know, that there are things you should never compare a government organization with a private organization and don't have a simplistic thing that some private CEO will come and transform government, cannot be done because they can add value for sure, but for that they have to first be empathetic towards the situation of the government. Government cannot hire or fire, government cannot procure freely from wherever, it has to follow due process. Government cannot just decide without following a very complex set of laws, there is also jurisprudence. And there are many things that the government is held to, and the government doesn't really choose its own priorities. There is a complex democratic process through which priorities are chosen, they can change. You start working on a policy project and then government changes and suddenly the priorities have changed. These are very significant constraints and you see that when you actually work in the government, you see how things happen. So, in fact, some of the most satisfying work I did was this commission called Expenditure Management Commission. I was coordinating research for the whole commission which was again two years and we looked at the entire central government expenditure and trying to understand how its operational efficiency can be improved, not allocative. Allocative is political business, but in a way can we do a little better implementation and trying to get more bang for the buck, so to speak. The report is not public, so I can't talk anything about it at all. It's still confidential, but I am talking about the process. So, there the commission was basically led by a senior economist and also a former public servant. It had another economist as a member, it had some couple of bureaucrats, one serving, one retired as members and then the team, research team was basically, I mean the staff was mostly all civil servants and what I really enjoyed about working in that commission was that I could have a sense of where the binding constraints are. See, that's one of the most important things in policy is that you may have some abstract notion of here is a system and there it should be, but what is the next step? See, you can have some UK is doing this, US is doing thing that, but you can't go from here to some of that and maybe that is not the right path for you because your path is different and therefore you can take a different kind of optimal path, but there is a next step and that is about easing the binding constraints that are most important right now and people who are in the thick of things, these are civil servants and if they are reflective and thoughtful and if you work closely with them, they know that very well. I mean, if they get the opportunity to reflect on it and like which we did for two years, we got an opportunity to reflect and think about what can be done to improve government procurement, expenditure efficiency in health and education, expenditure efficiency, subsidies, all subsidies, all of that stuff that we looked at, public enterprise, autonomous body, everything, defence, all of that and then you actually have a sense that you are talking to something which matters now and not painting some, you know, most of the policy work is basically best practice type. Hey, look at this UK, US did it and do five countries study and then why does India do this? There are many things that these countries do that we do not do, you know, we are in the bottom third in the world in per capita income and in almost all measures we are, I mean, in the bottom half in the world. So, why compare only with Frontier? And not even compare with others, look at your own path and say, okay, where can we go next? And that is where I think this, because these civil servants, the good ones who are reflective and have opportunity to think about these things, work with researchers closely, they can identify the binding constraints and find an optimal next step, which is what matters. Ultimately, you have to evolve to the next step, then the next step after and then in a generation or two, many, many problems will get solved. If you try to say that the ultimate objective, which anyway you cannot say, right, you do not, you cannot see what would be the right institutional design, you know, it is not a, again, you will fall for the planning and top down design kind of a trap. So, yeah, the understanding of constraints, empathy for difficulty of capacity and political demands and all of that. The most disappointing was that work that I did on the reform of financial resolution, where for three years I was at it as a researcher only, it was a small role, but I was really at the thick of it, in the thick of it, working on it almost continuously. And at the last moment when it had to be passed, it got withdrawn from the parliament and it was a disappointing moment, but it was a really instructive moment on how political economy works. It was very humbling that, okay, maybe it will happen later. It is, I think it is an important reform to pursue, but it did not get pursued. I did some work on infrastructure a little bit, but most of my work was on financial sector reform and regulation and financial reform and on public finance. So, my subject matter expertise, such as it is in these areas, but there I have a lot of meta kind of insights on how to work with government and what I did, what worked and what didn't work, which I just talked about mostly. I didn't get into the subject matter as much. But yeah, I mean, government is a completely different creature from companies and it will always be, it is a permanent fact, always very different from, you can bring a little bit of so-called private sector experience into it, have a little more alignment of incentives and all of that, but not a whole lot can be done on that front."

Just kidding. And, you know, again about state capacity, I have an episode with Karthik Mulyitharan on this and I've discussed this so many times actually, completely, I mean, Fukuyama gave an interesting frame of looking at the state, which is a frame of scope and strength. And with the Indian state, it's the scope is too much, the strength is too little. We do too many things badly while we should do a few things really well, which kind of becomes a problem. So, it is simultaneously the case that the state is, you know, in too many places, but it is also incredibly weak as you pointed out. So, here's a question. It strikes me that when you are in this policy field, your mindset has to be different in two fundamental ways from anything else you did before. One is that any change, if it happens, will be incremental, it will be a tiny thing. You know, you can aim for the moon, but things move really slowly and you'll just get incremental and you won't get big moon shots working out. That's number one. And even those incremental change at scale can make a huge difference to people, but in ways that cannot be traced back to"

        "message": "credit for it. Yeah. And the second, which also ties in with the credit thing, is that your rhythm of looking at what you are doing and why you're doing has to slow down a lot because you're really playing the long game, that you may work on something for three years and nothing may happen. And sometimes you'll work on something for 15-20 years and then change will happen. And, you know, and when it does, sometimes, you know, change can happen really fast and in dramatic ways. But by and large, you're playing the long game, there's no immediate gratification, there's no payoff. If you're working in a company, for example, and you implement something, that payoff is visible. In the next quarter, sales will go up or sales will go down, shit will happen, new branches will open, you see the payoff. Here you don't see a payoff, there is no credit, there is no causality that can be kind of given to you. Your validation doesn't come from measurable results, right? So at one level, you have to sort of be internally driven. Yet, I would imagine given human nature, that most people in any field are not internally driven. They are ticking boxes going through the motions within the set group that they are. And some people in every field will be internally driven and will be dynamic. Sometimes that is just because of incentives. Like if you're the if you're the founder of a startup, you're going to be way more driven than somebody three rungs down the ladder. And sometimes that's just the kind of person you are, that whatever you do, if you're doing something you love, you're driven by it, even if you're, you know, not too high up or there isn't gratification. So you know what this change in mindset, am I sort of characterizing it accurately is are there things you'd like to add to it? And what was the experience for you coming from, you know, a private world to the world of where you're working with government and change happens at a glacial pace, and there are all these obstacles, and, and so on and so forth?"

There's been quite a bit of expenditure management reform in the last several years, a few years since we worked. I can't say anything specific, but the report is confidential. Raja Chailiah founded NIPFP, you know, he was our founder. And he was a great tax economist, public finance specialist and special expertise in tax. He worked for many years, you know, on rationalizing our tax system. It was only in the late 90s that we actually got to this 30% tax rate that we now have, right, under the third front government, the UDF government that we had. So that's the other part of it that you have to work for many years. And then there'll be a moment suddenly, when things fall in place, human beings have tried everything else before doing the right thing, so to speak, you know, or finding a optimal kind of a solution that works, at least for a particular kind of social welfare function. Social welfare function also changes, right? People have different views about what should be the social welfare function. And then you have a particular analysis, making, assuming a certain kind of social function, and then suddenly these things align and it works. Hopefully, it's a good, it's a good thing it will work because some of the reforms we did in 90s, the thinking goes back to 70s also, right?

I mean, some of them may have passed away in the process. Raja Chalaiya worked on tax reform for many years, you know, and things got better gradually. But the genuine kind of settlement of the current relatively better tax regime that we have on the direct tax side came in the late 90s. And I think that's the way it is that many of the things that we work on will not never get implemented. Some that will get implemented may have a huge impact, some will have a smaller impact, but generally you will have a significant kind of impact. And then the timing may mismatch that you may have done something and it's there in the file system. And then five years later, you are doing something else, but it gets drafted. Even now I get calls from people I worked with, okay, why was this drafted? We are now pushing it through to the system, putting up a cabinet or whatever. And then we need a clarification of this because institutional memory is required to interpret why it was done. Even now, like literally last week, so this is a part of that, the way the system works. And again, it's a democratic system. And there are many people who can say no to something and then can literally stop it from happening. And that's good because many mistakes don't get made because people like me may recommend something very bad also and harmful and then it doesn't get done. Thank God. If it hadn't been done, we would have been feeling much more guilty. So I have faith that, okay, at least now, I mean, if I was living in fifties and sixties and seventies, it would be very, very frustrating because hardly any good ideas get accepted and bad ideas are taken up very easily. But now we're in a different kind of a polity since the nineties at least. And at least the elite consensus was shifting. And now I think the shelf life is, I mean, the life from thinking about working on some analysis and bringing out something which may work and that being heard is, I mean, a shorter period of time. And whether it gets done or not is something which cannot be controlled. It's left to the democratic processes. And that's the way to think about it. And in fact, I was at eight years, I never got paid for anything. It was the best time of my life because a lot of things get got done because we were just enjoying the work, you know, it is just so much and it was a good place, a good team, a good set of people to learn from work with. Most of them were motivated intrinsically because they were enjoying that work. And we had good leaders in the team who were so kind of, who kept us motivated because they also were doing it for that reason. And I think that's what it is that, you know, it's like, why does a soldier fight? He fights for his buddies in some senses. So similarly, I mean, nation is there, but the immediate impulse comes from being a part of a particular team. So, and going through that process, we are overestimating like some of the least most dangerous professions pay very little, firemen and all, for example. But they are very dangerous. You put your life on the line. Soldiers don't get much money, but they go and put a line, overestimate the power of material incentives in human nature. I mean, people find meaning in a variety of ways. And the question is whether you find meaning or not. And it was meaningful. The work is very meaningful. Working with government and policy reform in a lower middle income country is a very meaningful thing. And they'll never have any shortage of meaning while you're doing that."

        "message": "Yeah, so I partly answered this question in terms of what I said earlier about having some empathy for people to work in a very difficult situation and with lots of constraints, and understanding of those constraints before making any recommendations and, and expecting things to change. And, and that's absolutely essential for anybody who's working on policy to understand who you're working for or with, and who you're recommending to absolutely essential, there is no substitute for that. In fact, if you, you know, there's a famous quote that all happy families are alike and all unhappy families are different, unhappy for different reasons. And it's quite true that if you're working in developed countries, there is a certain commonality in which way the state works there. There are different institutional design choices they've made, different varieties of capitalism, different varieties of separation of power, or they have, but there is a certain, more or less formality to it. And it works in a particular way, there's high capacity in most of those states. And, but developing countries are all each one is different. I mean, there's a different dynamic in terms of level capacity, how it's utilized, how whether it's democratic or not most developing, many countries are not democratic. So that makes a difference. Some of them have a permanent civil service, other ones have a much more mix and match of permanent civil service with more of when hiring from outside. So there is a, when you understand who you're working with, and Indian state is a particular kind of creature and each within that each state has its own, there's a national level dynamic and there's a state level dynamic, subnational, and different agencies, if you're working with Reserve Bank of India, it's a particular kind of agency is very different from SEBI, for example. And so you need to understand who you're working for and working with and try to add value in that sense. And as I said that, it's very important to try to figure out the next step, you know, like, how do you evolve to the next step, how to do little better than you're doing earlier, because that, that's what growth is, you know, growth is about improving from where you are, you know, and development is something grander, and you want to get there, some kind of a state you want to get towards, and you that opinion about what that state is may also change over time, but you may have some kind of a lodestar in your mind and you work towards it. But growth is about getting from here to there, and then from there to there, and you know, a step at a time. And, and that's what I think is a big change that earlier I used to think much more in terms of best practices, I think much more about abstract notions of what rights should be preserved, you know, what kind of things should be pursued, but I now have much more of a sense of what is possible. And also about what is possible now, you know, in the next, given the political economy, given the way the institutions work, what would be an improvement over from where you are, like, somebody says, well, how should we improve tax enforcement, I look at more closely at where can we make some of the improvements now to the next step. And then I will not, there's a blueprint that you can actually decide, okay, in 20 years where you should be, that next step will then in a complex kind of way, I mean, there'll be interactions with other parts of the system and stakeholders will then reveal the next binding constraints and you then you go further. And I think that's the most important kind of realization I've had. The second is that earlier I used to take the de jure as de facto. What I mean by that is, I used to assume that whatever is written in the rule book and laws are, is what happens in reality and, but that's a very, very wrong assumption. I mean, it's completely wrong, in fact, more wrong than even I have fully fathomed till now, you know, I know intellectually, but I haven't fully taken grip on this kind of realization that, in fact, in developing countries like India, in most circumstances, laws are completely not descriptive of what actually goes on. And the way the executive implements the laws is very different from what the laws have written or intended. And the reality is shaped much more by decisions by politicians and civil servants and the order in which that decisions are taken is much more important than what's written in the text of the law. And the correspondence can be very, very weak between these two. And sometimes even very counterintuitive in some senses that you've written something in the rule book, but the reality is completely different from that. You already see that sometimes when you talk about rights, do we have this right? I mean, you've read a hundred, dozens of different rights into the constitution through jurisprudence, but do you actually have that right when you go and when the reality is very different. Similarly on the regulatory side also, similarly on the side of regulation of businesses, side of different types of delivery of schemes and welfare programs, implementation of projects, procurement, all of that, there is a lot more goes on in terms of informal decision making, use of discretion, deal making, which may be actually developmental in its purpose and may actually work towards improving things overall. But it's a hidden way in which the state works. And unless you understand that, if you just work on policy in terms of just saying change this law to that law and things will get better, unless you can first establish that law actually is the real framework for governing reality in actuality and not just a potentiality, then you are actually sparking up the wrong tree, you know, because what matters then is basically how the people who are actually taking the decisions define their worldview and what are the incentives that are shaping their behavior, what are the socialization that they have gone through, those are things that become much more important. And it's not about India only, whatever I have read about this kind of things, there are other countries also in developing countries generally have this kind of a reality. And there are hard reasons for it. And there are software reasons. The hard reason is the state capacity constraint that we make many, many more laws than we can realistically implement. Everything will come to a lock jam if we start implementing all the laws, especially on the business side in the economy. And sometimes the laws are made at a time when now the current executive is not so keen to implement them. And they do have some discretion, you know, we may not like it, we want rule of law, this and that, but the political reality is that the current executive has a lot of legitimacy to exercise some discretion over how laws are to be implemented and all. And that was a big revelation when I started actually studying this literature and also talking to lots of people in different sectors like infrastructure and all about how they enter into a 30-year contract in a developing country which changes so fast and so many realities change and risks they were holding could go bad. How what were the assumptions and actually the assumptions were very informal, I mean in the sense that they expected that the contract is one thing, but there will be concessions made and some reliefs will be given if things go bad, you know. And I think that was realistic because the contracts are by definition typically incomplete and much more incomplete in a developing country context which is things are very disorganized, they change very rapidly. And it's just a completely different world, you know, when you've gone through 10 years of 5% or 6% growth or 7% growth, the country completely changed and you entered a contract for 30 years. So there are hard realities because of which our discretion, some degree of informality and implementation of rules and laws is required and then there are softer. Sometimes you actually want to exercise discretion because you have the power and you want to do certain things with that power and the law becomes a constraint for you and sometimes for good reasons, sometimes bad reasons. So those are things which are on a case-by-case basis to decide. But these were I think the main changes in my view. Basically the differences between having an idealized conception in my mind, I mean even if it's a negative conception, it's still an idealized and a stereotypical conception, from having a little better understanding of how the state actually works and like something as simple as transparency and secrecy. Earlier I had a very simplistic notion of transparency, more transparency, more transparency, move is better for accountability, you know, cliches like sunshine is the best disinfectant, all of those. But now I have kind of overcome that. I mean, in fact, a lot of my reading these days is to try to philosophically understand it. So I read a lot more on decisionism, lot more on utilitarianism, you know, what are the kind of frames in which this behavior can be understood, not just justified and rational, but understood so that you can make an informed opinion about what's going on, you know, not have some kind of an arbitrary normative commitments, which this alienates you from a reality which may actually be what it is for good reasons."

In fact, the Right to Information Act came out only in this century, after almost 55 years of independence or so, more than 55 years of independence. And what I think is that transparency is a means to ends, you know, it's not an end in itself, like I said, many things like rights and all their means to other ends. And in many contexts, transparency works quite well, because it's important for accountability, it's important to, for public debate to nudge the politicians and civil servants in the right direction. And in some context, some specific context, it can be a double edged sword and can even do harm to the ability of the decision maker to actually do the right thing. For example, quite a few areas in which even in the developed countries in which there's a lot of transparency, otherwise emphasis of transparency, they keep secrecy. For example, for quite a few meetings that are held, the minutes are released after decades, right? And so, you have to, that what does it show that you will take a decision on a case by case basis and when the transparency is beneficial and when it is not. It is not something that you can take as a slogan, is all I'm saying, that sunlight is always better than darkness and democracy always dies in darkness. It's true, it's by and large true, but there are exceptions to that. In the regulation making process, there are exceptions. In the executive decision making space, not just in national security, but also in economic governance, there are exceptions to that, in which you may need a little bit more discretion to exercise and immediate public scrutiny may actually shut out the discussion, may disincentivize genuine open discussion, difficult decisions to be taken and much more posturing. So, if you look at, for example, some of the high courts in India started streaming their hearings and it's a double-edged sword. I mean, there are some advantages to it, but I watched them and some of the judges are literally posturing, they are trying to signal their, to quote the title of a book, quoting the people in some ways, that they are trying to signal a certain kind of persona to them and appear a certain way. So, I think it's a case by case basis, you have to decide in which situation it will work and what situation it will not work. You means the people who have the legitimacy to decide or I mean, basically in the elected and custodians of a democracy, within judges and the elected representatives, they have to decide basically."

Now, my issue with utilitarianism or consequentialism is that there is a knowledge problem that you cannot possibly forecast the future or really be able to tell what happens and so on and so forth. And therefore, you can justify any decision by saying that these are the ends that we foresee. In fact, in a different context, you were talking about the jury de facto, and you pointed out that many people will come up with laws and things that solve the problem, and they will be mistaking intention for outcome, which is the most popular and lazy policy mistake that people will, you know, mistake intention for outcome and not care about the outcomes of something as long as the intentions are good. And my issue with utilitarianism is exactly that, that it can be used to justify really anything because you can forecast anything about the future, it depends on what your assumptions are. And therefore, it becomes a problematic frame. And therefore, I think that no matter I mean, obviously, when you're framing policy, you're framing policy, because you want it to end up in the right outcomes, and you are thinking of those. But at the same time, there should be a few principles, which are just normative, that they are the way they are. And we agree on some of those, for example, defending the right to life of citizens, the right to free speech, and so on and so forth, that these things should not be contextual, these things should not be case by case basis. So I understand the argument for, you know, transparency in certain cases being case by case. I'll take some time to kind of process those examples and read your work on it. But certain things I think should not be looked at in a utilitarian way, because that can lead you to terrible places like the great utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer had once argued that in certain situations, it's okay to kill an infant child, not a fetus, mind you, but an infant child, if well being of the world goes up under certain conditions, which I think is a barbaric way to think that there are certain things that should be considered sacred, we both agree the right to life is one of them.

It's not just pure repression that works for them. They're doing other things as well. But in democracy, for sure, there is a general kind of pressure towards doing, serving a large number of people and their goals and utilitarian frame actually takes you a long way in that direction. And when you think about something like pure utilitarianism, it is what direct power fit, there is full of repugnant conclusions, you know, especially when you think of population ethics and all, there are lots of repugnant conclusions that are there. And you have to, you means, I mean, we as a collective have to take a view on what would be the right approach. There is no one rule of thumb or a formula, like even something like right to life. Obviously, we all agree right to life. But there are situations in which I support the state taking a life, right? Like, there are situations of conflict in which the state will rightfully take lives, not just of invaders and people who are attacking us, but also when people who are fighting and taking up arms domestically, there are criminals who are killed in encounters and that was the only option and that they are authorized to kill somebody and the police are authorized to do that. Paramilitary are authorized to do that, you know, there are violations of privacy that for utilitarian purposes and actually for protecting life itself, because it's not just utilitarian ends, but also there is life against life, right? One terrorist can kill another person. So, you kill the terrorist before that terrorist comes and the situational awareness is required, because obviously, it is better to arrest and bring to justice than all of that. But there are situations in which they are authorized to do those things."

In a particular situation that may actually require basically protecting one life by taking another life. But that's not all that happens, right? There is a kind of a systematic repression that is done for, for example, if you want to secede, for example. Secession is in that sense, if you think about secession, I mean, it's a somebody just wants to leave the republic, for example. But even then, if for the larger good of the republic or society, citizens do authorize quite a bit of violence all over the world to be able to keep that part of the body politic from leaving it. And it cannot be life against life. But there are utilitarian gains for of having a republic of a particular kind, which may be lost if one part leaves. So, political reasoning, generally, I think, supports a lot of utilitarian thinking. And there are obviously, in our moral imaginations, in public imagination, some kind of a deontological commitments that we make that thing, okay, there are these things that we think are very worthy of preserving at the individual level, that we are not thinking only at the collective that we need to preserve life as default and there's some dignity to it. We have liberty we need to preserve and there is a degree of sanctity to that. And we have put in place some systems to be able to do that and which systems can take a decision, what is to be done, and the systems have to be approved over a period of time so that they do these things well, you know, all I'm saying is that there is no general formula that can be applied which will be universally valid. It depends on the state that the society is in. There are situations in which you have to suspend certain rights. There are situations in which you have to look the other way from these so called deeply held values, because the larger good demands it. And that's where I think this these trade-offs are made and they're done, they're made through these systems rather than because it requires certain kind of practical judgment and situational awareness which is not available a prior. So, but suppose you say there's a particular situation and what should you do? There should be a rule book about it. If you were in a situation where every situation can be can be described and you have a rule book that says okay this is what is to be done in that situation, then that's preferable because every situation has been thought about, every scenario has been thought about and you've put rules about it. But that's not possible always. So, discretion comes in. Discretion means some somebody has to legitimize the use of that discretion and that's where I think we get into the territory where these trade-offs have to be justified ex post rather than ex ante."

So, one example obviously we've brought it up a couple of times in discussion and I always try to bring it up whenever I can is to look at the constitutional you know protections that we have been given. So, guaranteed first by writing them into the constitution and secondly by reading them into the constitution through the judicial process and if you actually go to seek relief and under many of them you may be surprised that I mean it's not so easy to get relief. You know actually actual I mean de facto protections are not what is written and there are political and governance reasons for those which we can discuss. The other is on the economic regulation side. There's quite a bit of work done on economies that are governed by rules and economies that are governed by deals where basically they compare the de jure expectation of what would happen if the laws were implemented and de facto what actually happens and they say there is no correspondence at all like we spend so much time worrying about ease of doing business which is basically a measure of de jure requirements but same word bank when it did surveys it found reality is very different. So, the construction permit de jure it's supposed to take 150 days de facto it takes 30 days. People who actually do the construction say I only got the I got the permits in 30 days. How? Because some shortcuts were found or some pragmatic decisions were taken on the ground and by the frontline bureaucracy and they were they had some incentives maybe there was some corruption maybe not who knows but they got it and it's not just of India lots of the researchers who work on this and we show that this is a very common phenomenon in developing worlds. As you go to developed world this this gap narrows between de jure and de facto. There also there can be some gaps but the gap in developing country is very significant. It's the law will say one thing and the reality will be very different. So, these two examples are there and I mean they can think about any aspect of state action like one of the things about security we are talking about utilitarianism and rights and are we sure that the security agencies use their discretion when they should be using it. It's always a mystery because lots of people in the in the ground will say no no no this was excessively used. It's really difficult for us to find out as citizens who are living very far from where this kind of conflict is going on and that becomes a question of who do you go to benefit of doubt to and then of course it usually goes in one direction. So, there is the reality is very different from what the rule book says in many parts of the world mostly in developing countries and across the world in many many areas whether it's rights, whether it's regulations, whether it's use of power by the state for security purposes, intelligence and so on. So, I think there is kind of a commonality in literatures across different domains which reveals something very deep deep about the nature of developing countries and much more of a kind of a decisionist orientation that exists without we actually acknowledging it."

Second is that in a way the existence of those rules threatens to crowd out the rule making that is possible voluntarily by collective action you know so what happens practically is that communities do evolve their own rules but they're always a threat hanging right that someday the state will say no no you can't follow these rules we'll come and so the scary part of the state is still there strength is not there the scare is still there which is at the back of the mind for everybody so which in which prevents long-term investments and all done by communities so I'll give you an example that I myself experienced okay I refer to it briefly that about a year or so ago I live in a South Delhi locality which was constructed by the Delhi Development Authority it's governed by the municipality here and the I was in the second floor and the third floor is the top floor the person on the third floor top floor started took control of the rooftop which is common property which is actually common property for all the flats took control and started building a new flat there without anybody's permission it's illegal she can't do it anyway and then obviously all the neighbors got worked up and we called a meeting and we got together and we said you can't do this stop it she stopped it then we actually a week or 10 passed 10 days passed and then their construction started again then I went and asked the neighbors what's going on and all of them had backed off they had said they had basically been threatened by her that if you go after me then I'll go after you how will they should go after them because they had made minor modifications to their flats like the you have balcony you got they got covered it which is illegal in the rules you know so by making small I mean I have modifications illegal you have basically destroyed collective action what was happening earlier that this is one major violator who's taken control of a large collective common property and privatized it basically which is not a socially beneficial thing because we all we all could enjoy it earlier and we were all together in fighting that that major kind of violation of the law and also the moral norms of society but by criminalizing or illegalizing something very small the state makes everybody criminal potentially criminal right because everybody is implicated in some way or the other the laws are such that somebody wants to go after you they'll find something to say that this guy has violated this this law like he wears black t-shirt they'll find some obscure obscure law which says black t-shirts in the evenings in Delhi are banned and this is a direct attack on me yeah it was intended to be so so this is the dynamic which we should be mindful of that is it it happens in many domains that yes we say the law is saying one thing reality is different and maybe sometimes it's better but the law being bad actually is a problem the capacity being not used properly for solving the kind of problems for example in this case solving it against most blatant violation of property rights taking control of our own property is a problem and we should ideally the state should basically do what it is meant to do which is solve big problems you know certain big problems and let other people do you know the community can solve many problems markets and solve many problems because the states want to micromanage our lives urban planning in India is all level of micro management right what you can construct which direction you should have windows this and that everything is regulated under the bylaws and the big violators just get away because everybody is completely implicated so nobody comes together to fight against the small percentage to do real harm and therefore we are not able to get collective action to the extent that we could I mean we still try I mean we have fairly active when communities and all but we could be doing much better if the state said that okay this will I leave to you I have experience I've seen when the state actually leaves it how things happen I've seen my own I've studied these examples done field visits to see how it happens you know and can give you examples of how this happens go ahead give so I mean the first example many years ago I was doing an internship with government of Gujarat this is I think 2005 or something and where basically my job was to study the implementation of certain government orders and what are the government orders the government orders was very short one-page order which was handing over the minor canal to the community to manage so you know how irrigation system there's a major canal and then there are the minor canals branch off and feed the villages so they said that minor canal will now be given over to the community to manage maintain and decide how to release the water and who gets the water when so I and they were wanting to study how it's being implemented if there are any impediments and inefficiencies and all and so if any minor repair is there then the community was supposed to get it done if any major repair is there and then you call the junior engineer get it done but all the rules of basically distribution of water locally monitoring of those rules implementation of the rules were to be left to the community so I went to 12 villages in a in that period and in each of the village what I found is that at the tail of the canal and at the head of the canal the same amount of water was being given released you know which means a fair arrangement was there you know equitable arrangement and the community evolved the rules and actually implemented the rules and because literally the farmer at the tail end of the canal was happy and they said yes I'm getting and much better than I was to get earlier because earlier there was to be excessive extraction you know I had used Alinor Ostrom's framework to understand that that governance of the commons and if you leave it like this should be taken at the level at which it is you know efficient to take it at and no higher level basically you know subsidiarity is a principle and you should and that is a completely missing it's so much of this we blame it on democracy maybe it's rightly blamed but I doubt that many of these things are just vestiges you know which can be even with a little bit of I mean forethought can be cleaned up and government of Gujarat did that right it was basically they said you handle and they did it communities and this is the same thing joint forest management has been done in south some of the places tanks water tanks are maintained by communities and in whenever it's a nicely designed thing where the government doesn't micromanage doesn't put its own people on committees and all of that community is formed rules are made monitored everything is done by community there is some leader who rises to provide a little bit of public good of you know getting this started it works and it almost always was better than this what the state would do so I mean there are so many examples that I can give just from our own democracy where local liberties when given I mean literally have to give it because unfortunately we don't have have them naturally because the state is just becoming boiler of collective action in many ways and if you do it then they deliver they do because it's in their interest and they have long-term it's a repeated game so short-termism doesn't happen they're settled communities they have long-term interests and long-term equities with each other I would even bet that even in some urban areas because there's mobility you know even then it can work under certain conditions on many many problems so and there I think it's obscene I mean this we have these debates about rights and utilitarianism and all of that you know these are grand frames in which we try to put realities and make sense of it have interesting intellectual debates about where the trade-offs and all of that but the trade-offs and decisions are much more intensely taken by people who are in a particular situation who have a good sense of the common good and they they are able to come to an agreement especially if they take decisions based on consensus rarely will you actually need to go beyond consensus because only when the kind of transaction cost is very high and there is somebody who's just kind of making it very difficult then you have to go voting and all of that but otherwise it works and I think that's one community-based solution and markets a lot of this can be achieved through markets market can solve any problem and then there are things that government should do and that and those it should do and it should do them well and and there I think this is just an opinion right I mean ultimately these have to work through the democratic system in some states we have seen a little more action on this front but not much I mean we still have a very strange idea of what the state should do very strange and every day we add up new laws new demands in the state we want the state to regulate this and that it's a very strange kind of a phenomenon that reality doesn't change but we keep piling on more and more of expectations from the state you know yeah in fact this takes me back"

        "message": "many examples in fact this is a theme of my work for last few years and thinking about it so just a few examples where I have participated in some way or the other small way is one is for example when government proposed under basically pressure from supreme court that India should have a data protection law and a data protection regulator and there was a lot of noise to have a very all-encompassing data protection law and a very powerful data protection authority and about five years ago something I wrote about it a long essay why that doesn't make actually sense we should start with something more modest you know start with this narrow scope again I quoted Fukuyama's book in that essay as well the one state building book that you're referring to and I suggested what would be the first step to get things started so that for next decade or so we have some improvement on data protection regulation a little bit and modest state capacity expectation modest scope of the work and then if that works it may fail it may not work at all you know it may not get any benefit at least you would take a smaller risk right instead of giving an all-powerful authority a huge amount of power and loading it with so much expectation so that was something that I had written about later some of my colleagues also wrote about it and hopefully that will that's what will happen because the bill has been withdrawn government I think now is thinking more in pragmatic terms about what can be done in data protection rather than trying to just try to build a copy of first word frame which is very compliance heavy overarching regulatory kind of a overkill I would say so that that was one example where I think there is a different way to think about the next step and then we may get somewhere eventually you know we don't know right now similarly there is a question about for example what is to be done with public sector banks I maintained whenever I've written about it is that privatization will not work why because they are very fragile institutions the only reason they are not having a run on the banks is because there is a government implicit government guarantee so you can do privatization either by selling it to another large private bank but I don't know how many private banks in India have appetite to buy some of the larger public sector banks because it's very they're too large for them right like there are only couple of very large private sector banks in India and they are the largest bank is a public sector bank and then there are a couple of private sector banks and equally big public sector banks so it's not easy to you know just absorb another public sector bank and take a run so privatization is a sensible decision and I think in the long run but what are the next steps to get there right you need to create an order in which you privatization will hold so I said resolution for example if you have a effective and working resolution failure resolution mechanism for banks and all financial firms then it creates trust that even if the bank is fragile and is failing my money will be safe and that's the way in which quite some other countries have been able to do that get that thing corrected right and then you can give lots of bank licenses and lots of you can prioritize public sector banks also one key kind of binding constraint right now in our system for giving many more bank licenses and also killing two birds with the same stone is also for privatization of public sector banks is effective and working resolution mechanism for financial firms so otherwise I mean if you do ideologically privatize you can say but it won't work you know like it will create potentially create instability in the financial system if you have suppose runs on some of these banks and it will not even happen in the first place so you need conditions to to get to get there so similarly on government procurement there's a lot of complaint about how government procures poorly contracts poorly and makes a lot of mistakes in just going by L1 and all that there have been some action on it recently but one of the core issues is not so much the contract design but what happens before the contract design is done so how do you create conditions in which pre-contractual preparatory work is done in a more thoroughly we spent very little in pre-contractual processes than most comparable countries so we are penny wise pound foolish in that sense that because some of the pre-contractual work often doesn't lead to our actual contract procurement so then who is going to answer to the three C's where does this money go so because of that perhaps they don't do it but if you do it to get that right that indirectly you will get potentially better procurement practices so I mean there is a question there are different intuitive way of thinking about it one is what is the next step then there's obliquity that you do one thing and something else gets solved in the process right obliquity you must have read about that I actually haven't tell me yeah it's a frame of solving a problem that you where you you want to solve something but you will do something else and then indirectly that problem will get solved or example always start a virtuous cycle towards solving that problem I mean these examples that I gave you basically like bank privatization you see prime FSI resolution privatization I mean there is a I mean it's not obvious what the links are but if you get that right it creates political economy I mean incentives to then go in the direction of privatization give a direction of doing more bank licensing and all of that it creates conditions for that you know so I mean you can think about it that way as well I mean if it helps but at least it's the next step that could ease some of the binding constraints then you go further and like example when the proposal to give corporates banking license was given I mean most people around me we had supposed it but I thought key under the current constraints that we have and the way our banking is going where private sector banks are the only ones that have grown in the last few years foreign banks have not been growing their credit I mean adjusted for inflation and public sector banks have also not grown their credit because of inflation by much it's very marginal only where we need to get more give more banking licenses and right now it seems that it is not an ideal solution I agree with people who criticize it but can it be seen as a next step and then you go towards a better solution for it's a second often in life second best third best solutions are what you need to you need to be able to you know accept and then move towards better I mean from there you know similarly if you want to have less political intervention in banking I mean I don't like it but it is better to have some development banks set up separately to do that with them and let these banks be more commercial banks there are lots of such kind of ideas toward discussing and debating you know as next steps and I mean I don't know whether what the right next step is I mean in some domains I have some ideas and some specific I've worked on those areas but one doesn't really I mean it's but I think it's a frame of thinking of thinking about what the binding constraint is easing that first and then gradually kind of moving towards a better kind of a setup and also thinking in more oblique ways that that's the goal but let's just keep that aside and say where can we go now so that the goal"

        "message": "you can make a difference here what excited you about it I don't know why it would be interesting for your audience to hear why I did it but but yeah I mean I'll just I'll tell you because you asked but basically I had been doing this policy analysis work for eight years and that was an IPFE it's good in many ways but I wanted to do more of political economy research and more thinking on institutions basically and political economy that shapes institutions in the real sense you know the de facto sense and the work policy research is interesting and exciting but it's just I mean after a point it became a little repetitive for me and and also when I left at that time there was no grand project at that time like nothing like it take one or two years to work on something and you know and at that time just recently this bill that I was working on had withdrawn from the parliament so I mean I that was a bit of a setback so I wanted to and it was an experience also right because going through that process I thought that you know it is kind of naive to think that a law like this just will just go through they will be pushed back especially when public sector banks and for and also from some ideologues very significant pushback was there so I should understand this a little bit you know because I do policy analysis I do policy research and I'm okay I'm not be great at it but okay at it I need to understand the larger system in which this stuff works political economy institutions shape policies and and implementation of those policies most importantly and the way they get implemented all of that so I wanted to get more into research more into thinking and writing about these issues and Carnegie came along at the right time for that you know and me and a colleague of mine both of us moved together and so we started a small kind of a research program political economy research and we thought because this is a more pure play think tank you know they don't expect you to work with government or have projects with government and all if it happens it's fine I mean they don't they're not adverse to it we do things with government as well but it's not something which happens on a regular basis it's not something that is considered to be necessary also you need to keep some distance you keep you do your research put it out it's a small institution it's not a very large think tank it's probably the smallest think tank here and so there's a little bit more freedom to do research and thinking and writing on these issues in a more broader sense so I wanted to broaden my horizons is is the main reason I actually got into this world and I think that I've got here I mean it's a pretty good place which gives you an opportunity to think broadly and identify issues work on them take some time to work on them put out short pieces work towards long pieces you know and and that's what the think tank is supposed to do that so what is the think tank think tank is not a university but it's also not a consulting firm right so I think normatively I think the best role a think tank in play is to bring the best of academic learning to have a bearing on political and policy decisions you know that's my least framing of that's what I try to do my work try to get the best academic thinking plus I would say situational awareness awareness of what's going on in India in the state in the domains in which you're working so for that so there are two ways in which mainly I learned I learned by doing data analysis and research review of reading of other people's research bringing that consequences of that into my thinking and by talking to and meeting people in political economy whether it's government outside private sector all of those and so trying to get a awareness of what's happening and put that in a broader frame of I mean comparative political economy economics research on economics from on political economy of growth and all and so how do we make sense of what's happening right now in India in a conceptual way you know and then therefore what does that mean for what is to be done you know so so that's something you can do in a think tank which is harder to do in a university because their focus is much more on teaching and also more fundamental research journal oriented research you need to get that journal publication otherwise you will not survive in that system for long and it's harder to do that in the consulting firm business also because you're trying to solve I mean day-to-day problems with government it's much more I mean much more pressure to just do things so there's a unique place that think tanks have and at their best they can do this much more so yeah I don't think the exam should react to day-to-day events we shouldn't I mean but but we have to I mean that's just the way it goes I wish think tanks did fewer events but we have to because that's also our duty to do events and whole workshops and seminars and all of that conferences and all of that but we do that but the core of it is still research and one should try to do it and much more than original research on some one one kind of narrow topic is to make it make different types of research that is happening by others bring together review it consider what the implications of policy political economy institutions are and inform thinking on these issues you know and I think there is a value to be had for this kind of work I think and now it's like Carnegie is the world's oldest think tank 1910 so this institution form has existed for now almost 112 years and now of course there are many many think tanks and they're trying to do this thing in variety of ways some of them have different self-definitions there's no one ideal type I have my own ideal type of what the best of think tank should try to do I mean whether we live up to those is a different kind of question but but there is a value there's certainly a value in doing something like that"

facts about the economy and society and polity right now to suggest in some modest ways you know how we can think about the future that's the research dharma we also have platforms in which we bring in different voices we usually ensure diversity of opinions in those forums every single seminar that at least we have held where there's more than one speaker there's diversity of viewpoints there are people from across different views on that on that issue so that's something that we do that we do we do quite a bit of public writing it's not just trying to inform policymakers also i mean other peers political economy researchers and all to i mean to say that okay we are in conversation with you we are learning from you and we are also trying to feed back into that and then that system and so that we will continue to do i see that the social media and this kind of explosion of media as such we're much more connected much more virtually intertwined than we were ever earlier is kind of a i mean it's what you make of it right like i mean you have to harness these things towards the purpose that you see i mean i agree that if you get into the game then i'm not heideggerian but you know heideggerian enough to worry that you know that then it becomes it consumes you you know it being being instrumental becomes that being a twitter user becomes your primary identity and everything else becomes assumed under that so but but it's a choice right that you whether you get to that or not and how how does human technology relation work to use don i hides framing we still have some choice at the level of persons and families and institutions and organizations on how we define it for example i am not active on social media at all in fact i i have a twitter account where i put out whatever i write and then run away from there and no activity on facebook linkedin also nothing that kind of stuff so and but i find it useful to put out stuff there it's just a way for me to archive and some people i get it it's fine newsletter i find useful because it just gives me a rhythm to write on a fortnightly basis and put something out and it gets to some people who i whose opinion i care about and i want to engage with them and and that's something that i've enjoyed doing but the core of it continues to be our activity of research right that policy oriented research political economy research where we're trying to do what i just said we're we're supposed to be doing and we're trying to do it hopefully do better of it in the future and technologies have changed many times in human history but human nature remains that and and in different eras people have under different technologies have still maintained you know their commitment to whatever they were doing and others get got swayed by one that technology and change their way of living according to technology and all but that's a that's still a choice i see that as far as democracy is concerned it's a great thing that people have so much ways to express themselves and express their opinions and give feedback and all of that as citizens we still have a duty to be more careful when we give anybody feedback we i hope nobody withdraws anybody what people do i hope when you critique somebody you have thought about it and thought deeply about the issue those are virtues that you have to exercise because technology without some virtues that work in the world of this kind of technology can do harm than good but it can also do a lot of good so it's something which we need to decide on a at a level of individuals and families and organizational communities about what do you want to make of this and think tanks also have to do that so for example we have a youtube channel we have twitter accounts we have facebook we have linkedin all of that and we harness it to for expressing our ideas and all of that but we try to do as much i mean focus on what our work and these are just new ways for us to reach out basically you know like till now at least i have never been asked about how many views are you getting or how many uh retweets are you getting and all those are not things that really i think fortunately my organization people care about i mean hopefully in the i mean they never care about it but if they do in the future i'll have some difficulties but i mean and it's true of i think technology across the board you know like how doctors use technology they can use it to do good or it can they can do it you use it to do i mean to not do good in other domains as well think tanks because we are in the world of ideas one good thing is that we are getting challenged much more you put out something which doesn't make sense to somebody they will tell you that earlier that they couldn't it was hard very hard they have to write a letter to you you need not open the envelope you know before i mean before email or anything like that then they could write email to you you need not read the email delete it quickly whatever but now you can't everybody's in your living room basically in some some senses virtually so and it puts some pressures to be more careful i think you know in some ways and one has to be careful about whose feedback you care about what kind of feedback you take seriously but it is a i think overall for our life not yet so clear that these things are bad for what we do it's good to hear from lots of people and to have people citizens they have the opportunity to you know tear down the mighty you know because often the mighty also have clay feet and it's a good thing that anybody can be challenged and questioned immediately and only thing i say that hopefully we will use this power with great power comes great responsibility as the wise philosopher uncle ben said so and i think that's for each citizen to exercise and it's a great thing politicians have always lived like this you know even before social media if i'm an average politician you could meet 50 people in a day who tell them different things so they have taken to social media like a fish to water for others it's more kind of getting used to i you know this could also be the title of a book"

        "message": "yeah these are big questions so let me i mean offer like as usual i mean this stream of consciousness answer and see if it works so first thing is that in our milieu in the way we and you and i move around we overstate the role played by economists and understate the role played by politicians and civil servants in in the achievements that we have had as a country especially since the 90s and maybe in parts of 80s as well so there is obviously a credit very due to give credit wherever who came with a good idea pushed it had the perfect perseverance to see it through but there is a as i said there is a system in which we operate and that is a democratic system there is a permanent civil service and there is a democratic system of elections and give shifting of power based on elections and people who are in power do things so a couple of things one is that we are a political economy in which we did 91 which was a big bang reform reforms continued through the 90s in that in the 90s we had three very different orientation governments there was a Narasimha Rao government then there was a third front government under two different prime ministers UDF and then the right of center so to speak PGP led NDA government came in but the reforms continued throughout right and that was a political decision that there was some kind of a consensus you can say that was there within the political and administrative class you know and that this is important and we will continue to do this and continue to ease the binding constraints continue to push the policy in the right direction and do whatever is necessary not just policy reforms do whatever is necessary and I emphasize that because it can mean many things to keep growth going you know that's very important and so we had so I did a literature review on when did India's high growth episode start and there is a literature on this and reasonable persons have disagreed on where and when it start but I had concluded based on a recent paper that it's 93 onwards basically and then 2002 onwards we had a really high growth episode and the question is whether the high growth episode has ended or not that's the question that we need to ask we don't know it's these things are unfortunately understood only retrospectively but decisions have to be taken right and you know there's a famous quote by R.L. Stevenson that even the worst of the historians know much better about the period they study than the best of us know about the period in which we live and unfortunately or fortunately we have to think about what the current period you know the past is the past and to the extent possible and it's not easily available to us all the facts available to understand what's happening right now we need to understand what's happening have situational awareness, awareness of the state of the economy, underlying sources of dynamism the economy which are continuing which are not continuing how what can we do to you know keep the dynamism going you know there is a very important role to be played by this and I am not saying this needs to be done on a local level this is a national conversation because nations grow you know I mean obviously growth drivers are local and individuals set up businesses, local governments solve problems and all but it is we as a country we started growing in the 90s right that was our I mean it wasn't like before 90s said some states were rich and other states were poor you know obviously relatively some were better off and but it was a very narrow range you know everybody was clustered around that same small the richest state was only three times of the poorest state you know at that time. As we opened up and we started seeing growth accelerate some states just rushed forward and became I mean fairly in fact some of the richest states in India have the per capita income of China basically you know so and the poorest states are quite poor and but the most important thing is that the rate at which our poorest state Bihar namely has grown since the 90s is higher than the rate at which India Indian economy was growing previous to that. So, let's not forget that improvement even in the state which is the bottom of the pile which had a decade of almost zero real growth in the 90s has benefited from this episode. So, inequality we have emphasized too much and we don't pay enough attention to that whole you know cake is growing and everybody is getting persuasion and then constitutional mechanisms are there to make sure Bihar also gets some part of the benefits from other countries so it's able to provide some minimum level of services for its citizens as well through the finance commission mechanism and all. So, we have one country and some states marched ahead and Bihar which is remain poor UP is also poor they also their entrepreneurs went and set up businesses in Bangalore and Bombay their labor went workers went capital also flowed in fact because they didn't have enough businesses in those states so capital flowed to the richer states from these states and we have one country and being a part of this country is very beneficial for each state those states that marched ahead benefited from being a part of this country because their products could be sold in these states factors of production other than land everything can move across state boundaries easily relatively they could move and set up. So, we have benefited a lot from this period and it's been done because there was some kind of a political consensus at the national and state levels in many states there's a variation in different states how much they could make of this period and some states couldn't make as much as they could and others could make a lot more like Punjab for example is an example of a state which fell behind it was the richest state in 1990 and now it's basically very close to the national average it's a pretty bad story in that sense and it's not doing as badly in absolute terms as say Bihar or UP but it's I mean relative position has really fallen and there are states like Tamil Nadu and Telangana, Haryana and all which have really marched ahead you know since these reforms happened and overall I think lots of ways to problematize what has happened but I think it's been a pretty significant success compared to our own past and also compared to what is generally seen in comparative sense. So, one of the things is that democracies usually don't go very rapidly I mean democracies are rich so obviously you'll say why how does not rapid growth is a different form of being rich because you can get rich over 150 years which is the story of the most immature democracies in the world developed countries in west mostly but democracies usually grow at a moderate rate and generally not just democracies for any country to grow for a rapid rate for a very long period of time is very difficult it's very rare so regression to mean is the rule and these are exceptions and the longer the growth episode is going the more the chances of you regressing back to the mean so the adaptive efficiency you need which I mean using Nicholas North's language to continue with the growth episode is quite significant you know and you need to have a political economy which is very adaptive and which is very mindful of the imbalances that are getting built up across different parts of the economy what are the kind of new problems that are emerging and address those and it's a political and administrative problem you know economists researchers can play a small role in that very small and the main thing is the political settlement and political agreement and having the right incentive to solve those problems having a sense of importance of that and and some degree of I mean even though people fight elections and they are always trying to destroy each other's political legitimacy there is some true underlying agreement and development and growth are very important and there's something not to be disrupted I think that is the foundation on which this is built and I think we had that we have whether we have it now or not I have a question but we had that for a long time and especially in the 90s so one of the things that I always point out is that our private investments took off in the 2000s 90s there was no noticeable growth in private investments and because I mean we had to the polity has to establish some degree of one way to read it many ways to read these facts I'm not saying that my way is only way same facts can be reconciled with multiple narratives that's the way history works but one way to read it is that we had to establish that credible commitment that we are here to do the reforms and the direction will be one way and we will keep liberalizing and opening up and giving you more opportunities and please invest and then in the 2000s private investment took off in the early 2010s private investments have been very low private investment basically fell and private investment was the main driver of growth in the 2000s which are the best years for our economy 2002 onwards and then they have been low export was the other major driver continued from 90s to 2000s the export of the major driver that has also slowed down significantly since 2011 onwards 12 12 onwards so 12 or 13 if I'm not getting the year right so these are drivers of growth you know for an economy like India and some people can make an argument that it's the consumption that should be driving and we have done enough of the accumulation now we need to do redistribution and all I my own judgment is we're not in that stage of growth there will be a situation it could be a situation in the future like where Japan reaches the 90s where domestic consumption take off and it just stagnated you know that it just kept on the accumulation cycle Hirschman has this dynamic between accumulation and redistribution which is the dynamic has to play out for the economy to sustain itself its growth so anyway there are matters of judgment but the basic thing is that the two drivers of growth export and private investment which were driving a growth in that way basically slowed down significantly in the 2010s and they didn't really pick up before the pandemic hit at that time and there were some short periods of upswing but nothing substantial that was happening and lots of different narratives have been offered to why that happened and all of that and I mean we can go into that then the pandemic hit so but before the pandemic hit our role our growth in the previous year 2019-20 was 3.7 percent if I'm not remembering if I'm doing it right it was 3.7 percent and investment growth was very very low and I mean basically all across all the components on the demand side there was a low investment, government consumption, private consumption was actually the fastest of the lot but it wasn't the economy was not growing much then the pandemic hit and we had a obviously lockdown and all and we had a very low very big contraction in the economy and then we had a recovery in 2021-22 right and now last couple of years what has happened is our ability to make sense of the year-on-year data is you know intuitively it's not the same right because we need to track with a pre-pandemic performance so a lot of headlines look very different because hey year-on-year look will look like but the main question that I have in my mind which I'm trying to understand is that did the issues that were there in the pre-pandemic period just go away or are they still there what were those issues why was private investment not taking off for 10 years why was exports not picking up you know at that time now we've had some short-term periods of good export growth I hope it sustains I pray it sustains because it's a major driver of growth in India but that's a question that we need to answer because it's very important and very difficult to sustain long periods of rapid growth but that's what we need to do that's what China did right China did 40 years plus of rapid growth its economy has been slowing recently it's changed its political economy approach but India has had rapid growth for at least two decades perhaps longer in between the debate got a little vitiated because of the GDP numbers controversy whether the GDP is capturing the actual economic activity and growth in it but lately I mean especially just before the pandemic there was some correspondence because other indicators are looking bad and GDP indicator itself also looking very bad so I mean but apart from these these debates I think there's a substantive question about what would it take to continue a rapid growth episode by defying history you know because very few countries have been able to sustain growth for more than two decades or something they do regress to the mean and then there are periods of relatively moderate or low growth and then they go back so but because we gain a lot from this period you know so in fact growth one thing I want to just focus on growth is the most important thing to focus on economic growth is the thing everything and so if you look at all other you can pick any development indicator you care about which is material development I'm not about political and all we've been in democracy for a long time it's great all of those things are there but regional development if you talk about improvement in health education improvement in availability of material I mean things like housing you know those things the nature natural environment and all of that very highly correlated with economic I mean GDP per capita all of those not no exceptions I mean it is stunning how much growth can do for you you know so for an 11 for love some one level of income you can do a little better by spending a little more efficiently in some areas but not a whole lot ultimate binding constraint is having more resources you know which is what GDP per capita reflects that how much resource is available what is the basically the value of the goods and services you produce and that reflected in a per capita basis. So in some areas we do a little better some example primary education and all we do worse than our even our level of income in terms of the educational quality right the learning outcomes are quite poor in India so we could do better on those perhaps even for our level of income little better than some area like air quality we do worse than even countries at our level of income we could do better on those but in most areas if you want any significant improvement you need to get growth going to have more resources to be able to do more with with those because this is the main kind of underlying driver you know when everything correlates with one thing then you have to think about is it just correlation or is there some kind of causality going one way so I see that there is a complex relationship with our human capital we talked about health education there is obviously some other side I mean the two-way causality growth helps you do more of those but the more better human capital gives you growth so there is that of course but focusing on growth gets a lot done is is my world view I mean reasonable persons can disagree about how much weightage to give to it but I think it is the most important thing to get it right and it in our own history right our impact on poverty rate our impact on well-being across many many indicators has been much better since we grew it is I agree in some areas an uncertain glory we have done worse than we should even have at our level of income in some areas but if you want to get much better this is a necessary condition you know and in many cases sufficient in some cases not sufficient but it's certainly necessary to get continue to grow rapidly and then later we'll get into demographic issues as well and in the essay I think which you have cited I had shown how India has been related to the rest of the world you know and in the first three decades of our day after independence our relative position in the world may have fallen at least on the data that I am referring to may not be fully representative because all countries data were not available at that time but it was a pretty bad performance especially in 60s and 70s it's only in 80s we started growing at a moderate rate but against a very bad two decades so I mean it was more of a recovery happening at that time and in 90s we actually got embarked on a proper rapid growth episode and we need to be able to sustain it I mean and that requires I mean consensus on growth you know that this is a very important priority this is the top priority this is the thing and we are a federal polity we are a polity where power resides at multiple levels levels even in dominant party system where there is one party dominant at the national level state level there is still quite a bit of competition even at national level even though you are dominant party there are other places where power is there sometimes judges can do something others can do so you need to create consensus for these things because you can do some try to do something but it can be disrupted either way so state government is trying to do something center can disrupt it center is trying to do something state governments can disrupt it so some degree of consensus building around this these issues is very important so that at least from a developmental perspective I mean reasonable policies are made and implemented and reasonable systems are put in place to take the right decision at the local level even if the policy is not necessarily fully followed in the to the letter and I think those are important questions and I thought about in many ways so how anti-corruption strategies in the last 10 years have worked out and changed bureaucratic behavior and incentives of bureaucrats to take decisions how state capital relations have changed might have changed looking at in rising disputes between the state and private capital especially on the tax side but also in enforcement direct rate and all those so when one is trying to make sense of things which are not easy to directly study because it's a hidden aspect of a political reality what we read is the de jure and the headline but what happens on on the ground is not so easily directly so I talk to business people I try to get a sense of before after what changed what was happening earlier what has changed now I look at whatever data is available try to make sense of these things."

that we have and it's a it's it's it's a political priority should be a political priority and it should be in a way if we get focused on this hopefully some of the other stuff that we are too focused on right now or I simplistic identity politics and all will also kind of fall lower on the priority but that's just a aside I'm not saying that's going to happen I'm saying that it should be a priority it should be the top three priorities or four or five priorities and then we do other things because many things are tied to this many many other things that we want to have are tied to this and the one one thing about this world is that now many many countries are rich and you the best of your people will leave and they already were leaving earlier than we had so a country gives you two things right it gives you opportunities to build some capabilities and other is to use those capabilities well to flourish economically and materially and there are other things they do I mean I'm also economic aspects but country economics does two things we had institutions that will give you capability but not opportunities to do make more of these so the decisions were very one-sided that you get easy to take a decision to go to IIT but very difficult to take a decision to stay in India so so there you had this huge brain drain fortunately some people are now coming back they're setting up or somewhere many are not going in the first place to set up businesses here so that's a very good thing I mean all of that happened because you we did better on governance and institutions you know that's and people could and we are still a young country and there's so many people who want to do this build businesses I mean across various sectors we can do much better and I think we should continue that story and if we fall off that and if we lose that sense of consensus and we start try to thinking think more in you know Malthusian ways that hey if that state party succeeds in delivering growth then I will lose my political legitimacy and all of that which is creating a lot of this interstate I mean conflicts in some ways because politics is just overriding everything else in this kind of politics yeah we will probably compromise on this because because one of one thing is there that as I keep harping on the 90s consensus you know some consensus was there and also coalitions coalition politics literal formal politician politics that allowed that made consensus necessary where different regional parties went out and helped create consensus for specific reforms and there are a couple of good books on this worth reading and there's a I mean that's the way political economy of growth in a democracy works you know and unfortunately when a dominant party then the need for consensus goes away and you end up making more mistakes so then you have to willfully go and seek what would work what are the different interest groups who's going to lose out how do I make it good for them you know it's a democracy purely utilitarian frames may limit because even a small vocal minority can stop a reform from happening and we've seen that happening a few times so I think it's very important to think about it in through democratic and political processes and what is the how does that shape to the institutions and policies that actually deliver the conditions in which growth can happen growth is done by markets and private enterprise primarily but there are things that state has to do to be able to support it and yeah I think it's a very important question and so as I was saying earlier that it's a national question I always think about as a national question the way framed is that nations are economically consequential political units you know they're politically economically consequential because you see so much difference across nations and within nations is not that much you know like for all the inequality that we have in India if you compare inequality across India and other countries especially developed countries it's not even close the intra country inequality that we have even our richest state for example is maybe a quarter of the per capita income the poorest state in the US so it's not even close in terms of where you are and we harp so much over this inequality as an issue so I always say like I never write about inequality in that in that sense I care about it in some ways some specific ways like gender inequality for example I worry about low female participation I worry about inclusion across I mean if there are some systematic ways in which certain people are being excluded and it's a problem not just for growth but also a moral problem for society in that sense but not in this macro way of inequality that class thinking that okay this is you have to go one level below and say is there any structural kind of bias that are going for certain kind of people are not able to participate in the process that obviously we all care about because in that sense inequality actually harms your growth you know exactly that's a different kind of analysis you know and but that's not that analysis doesn't need to critique the entire growth episode that we have had and it was the kind of growth episode we actually competed with the world right we look at our export growth you know our export as a percent of GDP in 1990 was about the same as it was in 1950 and it just increased very rapidly after that even then we are a very small part of the world trade we have a very very long way to go we are punching way below our weight in many areas we have moderately complex products that we make and export we can make more complex products which are more valuable and give more GDP we can more more kind of products to export so export can be a major driver of Indian growth there's no doubt we are punching way below our weight two percent of the world trade is not where we should be you know much higher in terms of GDP you know in the world but in trade share is much smaller we should be able to do much more we need to create conditions for more private investment and that I think is a sure shot I mean more or less sure shot way to you know at least for a decade or so we need to worry I mean there will be a situation in which we need to worry too much much more on domestic consumption and all of that worry but my judgment of this situation is we are not there yet we need to get more can continue the accumulation stage and then we can say okay distribution and all the issues become very important also see for our level of income we tax more of the GDP than most countries did at this level of income or we borrow more as percent of GDP than most of our comparable countries so it's not like the state is not taxing and borrowing and we can talk about how to tax better and borrow better maybe we can do less financial depression on the borrowing side we can have more efficient tax system on the expenditure side we can talk about better allocative and operational efficiency as a democracy we can debate what is worth spending on how to spend on it all those are very important conversation but if anybody argues that we should be taxing more and borrowing more at level of GDP the onus is on them to prove why why it can be done well because I am showing you I mean evidence I mean very clear evidence that we are actually taxing pretty large part of the GDP larger than we should at this I mean we usually continue at this level of development so all those are myths obviously but so without growth how are you going to even deliver on the all the good stuff that you want to you know redistribute and do more for people you know so I think there is a and we could do so much more when since we started growing we could do more of subsidies and welfare schemes and all there is a lot of critique on how it was done how much of it went to middle class and all of that I completely agree with that I've said that's what I should study also so all that is there but I'm telling you it's a very small part of the problem much bigger problem is to how to"

Tocqueville was a big supporter of colonialism including British colonialism in India he said he was a great thinker on democracy he had strong moral commitments to democracy but he had a different view of what how colonialism in country like India but we kind of you know pushed back against those views and so we made democracy work more or less and now I mean compared to that immediate era after independence we've had much more of distribution of power in society more and more groups are getting incorporated in different ways finding representation in into society into the democratic system into through different political parties through state apparatus and all of that so the democracy is working as a social principle you should never forget that democracy is finally a fundamentally social principle it's it's some it's a quality of societies you know that you're democratic you have a certain commitment to fundamental equality of conditions and it's happening I mean we didn't have the American kind of beginning right we started with equality of conditions there wasn't any central government local liberties all of that we had a colonial state and it was the top heavy state and even though villages and communities were pushing back a little bit there was still a quite a bit of top heavy interference in life and we democratized and we started we had a it was a matter of faith for our founders that we will work as a democracy and we have live up to the expectation more or less you know we've continued our democracy there was a brief interlude of of a kind of a democratership or dictatorship you can call it and we've continued so on we had a big failing on economic side for a few decades we corrected that we corrected that in a very big way I would say we should not underestimate what we have achieved in those in these three decades we have we can do much better we have a long long way to go but we have a our own one generation of record to show that we can do quite quite well on the side of whether I mean there is a side of social kind of civic life and social life which needs to have there will be conflicts there will be I mean multicultural culture is very hard we should never compare ourselves with western multicultural discourse their multiculturalism is a very different context they are highly secularized society where religion has taken a very very small role in society and accepted that role for itself people who are religious also practice in very different ways you know from us we have a strong number of large number of people who true believers strong believers and very suspicious of other communities because they are very they're very deeply embedded in their own traditions religious traditions so multiculturalism is very hard in India and and and therefore controlling for that we've done quite well I would say because democracy itself creates you know incentives to mobilize one group against another all of that it happens but given all of that we've not done too badly if you took a long view don't get too upset about some particular events or something which which which are obviously bad in themselves so and that's a surprising thing because democracy creates incentives to do much worse on that and we've not done so badly and hopefully we'll not do worse in the near future so across I mean phase in which democracy works I think we I'm much more hopeful I mean than I would have been say even 30 I mean I I was too young at that time at 30 years ago we are going through on some aspects of our especially on the aspects of anti-politics and all some difficult patch right now and I think we cannot take it too lightly we should take it seriously and we should try to find low-cost ways to get out of this kind of a politics which is pretty I mean harmful for democracy because ultimately equality is a foundation of democracy and nobody should feel less lesser of a citizen you know than anyone else so that I think is very important but I think our democratic resilience is there and we can certainly find ways to you know moderate whatever is happening and I'm not I never put democracy up to some abstract standard and say if you don't meet my standard then you're not a much of a democracy you have to judge democracy on its own terms and given our I mean complexity of our society different identities different regional religious identities as a multicultural society given the level of poverty and all we had earlier we've come a long way you know and therefore one of the most important things I feel at least in private conversation I say is that do not give up on India you know don't give up like this is a rotten society and this and that because some events happen and somebody reacts in this way that puts the society which is the whole democracy there's one thing right that empowers the whole and parts become very weak and you can feel very small because of that sometimes if you think about it this way that hey what am I there's this large body politic is there and what who am I to I can't change it I should just give up on it and be a part of some other country's history just move but I say that I mean let's keep trying you know like to go back to Chesterton that Rome Rome would be great because Romans love it so we need to keep that faith and keep working whatever we need to do as citizens especially at local I mean everyone friends and family level to try to kind of keep doing better because I think it's the most interesting country in the world in the sense that what we are trying to do right now the journey that we have made the future I mean the stakes are just staggering then to to quote misquote Lucas that you know the consequences are simply staggering and we have to invest in this process and ultimately democracy is self-governance democracy is ruled by the people every anybody who has power has the power from the people and people it's ultimately people who will decide what will be rewarded and what will be punished what will work and what will not work and therefore we should even though the hole is much larger than us we are part of that hole as well constituent of that hole and we need to keep that democratic faith and keep working towards a perfection of"

        "message": "I don't know but what would be the low right way out of it but there is a particular dynamic that is at play which is an identarian dynamic where basically a community is reduced to its worst elements and it happens with different communities at different points of time and it happening with some communities at this point of time that you obviously all communities have some fanatics in some way but vast majority don't like that don't live like that and although I mean there is a they can do something more than they do to moderate the fanatics and maybe they can't and we don't know but when you reduce the entire community to the worst of their motivations then obviously it becomes a question of can we coexist and all of that. Those kind of questions are getting raised more and more now I think in India and democratic politics is working in a way that these questions are getting more and more raised on a regular basis and there's much more mobilization around those kind of issues. Now I believe at least my understanding of what's possible is that if you focus on I mean where the real problem is where there's actual genuine fanaticism and there's genuine kind of a threat and not make it something broader and focus on solving that problem you can find a way to kind of overcome this sense of anxiety and fear that we have kind of there's so much fear in India right now like this strange fear like if you open the television just it throws fear at you you know so many news channels just throwing fear and anxiety all the time it's really something which has become a part of our air in some ways you know Delhi air is very thick anyway and thicker because I don't have a tv at home but whenever I go somewhere I watch tv and I'm like oh my god what what is going on the level of you know over the top rhetoric and the simple oversimplification of issues like you go anecdotal when you want to avoid someone and statistically you want to defend yourself you know so yeah that guy did it that identity so it must be the entire community is like that it's it's not good for coexistence in a multicultural society you have to be more precise talk about what's going on find facts report on the facts there may be problems there may be fanaticism there may be some degree of extremism going on but attack that identify that it has to be more precise and fear anxiety that is being pervaded social media has done that to some extent mainstream media television media is contributing a lot and that fear I really worry that at a subconscious level it it is making us into something which we'll see the consequences maybe in a decade or two if we can change that if we can get I mean leadership basically it's something that we've done that level leaders not just the current leaders people who readers who rise who have the wisdom to see the problems of these ways and say okay can we do better can we can we be more precise about actual problems and not create demons of our own to destroy you know that's one the other is as I said perhaps if we focus on other things which is common good collective action cooperation for development and growth hopefully we can have a little less of a focus on these things because our psychological wounds are many you know we have been as a civilization being ruled for many many centuries and we don't even know the depth of our sufferings you know and if we if we bring those out on a regular basis and spread fear and anxiety I mean this is a tiger that you will that eat the ones who are riding it also you know so it is possible I'm not saying that we are there yet one good hope is that we are not completely modern we don't think in those clear-cut category ways many of us some are so there is still much more intertwining of lives and much more of a amorphousness to the identity in India I think so for example I still go to Dargah sometimes like this that not just me my family so there is some of that sources of resilience democracy itself has both sources of risk and also sources of resilience and we have a big hope for progress we've got a taste of progress right in three years three decades good serious taste of progress economic progress we've got some source of social progress let's wet that appetite a little more let's work together towards you know progress towards a richer more I mean more robustly multicultural society you know because I don't think we're going to secularize anytime soon and I don't know whether it's a good thing at all or not we've existed a multicultural society with different religions coexisting different regional identities all of that and it's a great advantage to be a part of India like sub-regional sub-national sentiments and all should be I mean kept under some kind of a limit because it's great to be a part of this country and there are many benefits economic and otherwise of being part of this that's another element that we shouldn't stoke too much because being a part of a whole like this you know like a country as big as India is culturally and economically and politically very beneficial for different parts even the parts that are doing"

I hope your hopes come to fruition though I also worried that the fear and the anxiety are real and we might be trapped in a vicious circle where they just spiral and take us into a very dark place. Final question which I always sort of end my episodes with which is why don't you recommend for me and my listeners books, music, films that mean a lot to you?"

        "message": "Books, music and films. Oh whatever any art. Yeah so on the book recommendations I link up to the themes that we discussed today. So one theme was democracy and I think the best book on democracy is Tocqueville's Democracy in America. It's a great book and everyone should try to read it and engage with it seriously and if you want to get a book about that book it's basically I think the best in that category in my view is Pierre Manon's Tocqueville and the Nature of Democracy. It's a short book and it's a really great well-done book. Then a lot of the books by Pierre Roseval is also very insightful but especially I really liked his latest book on populism. I think it's the best book on populism and it's important to understand our times and how democracy is getting transformed in some ways by populism and why that may have happened, how to think about it theoretically. We talked about virtues and there are many books on virtues in different traditions and I will just recommend one which we mentioned indirectly so that if one wants to go and get into it and more deeply is Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue. I think it's a great book and we mentioned it and others I'm not going to. We talked a little bit about technology also right and so I would recommend Don Ide's work on human technology relations philosophy of technology. There are a couple of recent books I enjoyed reading one was a book on technology and virtues by Shannon Valor and another one on nihilism and technology which takes a Nietzschean perspective on technology by this young philosopher Nolan Kurtz. Then we talked about political economy also that was the I mean large part of our conversation so I would suggest at least from a more comparative and I mean perspective and understanding theory of growth and political economy. A lot of new social economics work by people like Douglas North, Alina Rostrom and others is quite illuminating and gives you a good way of thinking about this thing in my view. Also the work of Albert Hirschman is very powerful even now in thinking about growth and development economic progress. Then I've benefited a lot from accessing the empirical work by people like Lan Pritchett and all and there are there's a community of people who do this kind of work and it's it's worth engaging with it gives you things about thinking about it ways to think about these issues and there's a book which is not an economics book but I found it very useful to think about political economy then on complex adaptive systems. It's a book by Robert Axelrod. It's called Harnessing Complexity. So it's one of the best books on complexity and it gives you a language to speak about complexity and move away from the language of you know top-down thinking in that sense. I mean religion there I mean basically the best way is to read scriptures and try to engage with them whether it's philosophical scripts texts or religious books holy books or mythological books but also epics. I really enjoy reading epics so Mahabharata, Odyssey also like epic poems like Divine Comedy and Rashmi Rathee and all are very interesting to me. So I would say yeah I mean that's where I would I'm linking it to themes that we discussed now. I mean music I mean I don't have much of a recommendation with the only music I really enjoy is old Hindi film music. I just listen to that only now that's all that's my musical life so to speak nothing more than that. So Kishore Kumar, Muhammad Rafi, Lata Vangeshkar's old songs that's my kind of musical life so to speak. Then movies I would say because the movies word works more through authors you know that so some directors who work I enjoy Tarkovsky for example especially movies like Andrea Rublev and all I mean perfect achievements on what you can do with cinema. Burnwell, Kurosawa, Satyajit Ray and then I enjoy good fun movies like Mission Impossible movies, good funny movies, well done funny movies like Bad News Beer and all you know or this old Hindi movies I like a lot like movies like Anand and Dilip Kumar movies. So I mean that's where my current kind of taste lies so I mean it is what it is. Great Sush, thanks so much for coming on the show this was great. Thank you Amit for having me always good to talk to you and you have a very intriguing skill to bring out get people to talk about things that they would not normally talk about. You didn't talk about many things today"
