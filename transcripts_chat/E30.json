The philosopher has an idea. He says, let's ask each other the most difficult, unanswerable question from our respective fields. Whoever asks the toughest question gets the rest of his drinks free. The other two men agree. Both of them seem confident. The physicist is the first to go. He asks, what was there before the beginning of time? The other two men nod thoughtfully and go bottoms up with their tequila shots. Then it's the philosopher's turn. He asks, what is the meaning of life? This surely has to be the winner. What could be tougher than this? What is the meaning of life? All three men look very sad. Then finally, the economist has a start. His question is this. Why don't real estate prices in Mumbai crash when demand has gone down so much? The physicist and the philosopher look at each other in bewilderment and disappointment. They know the game is over. The economist gets free drinks all the rest of that evening."

This is one of the most expensive cities in the world and usually prices are a function of supply and demand. If demand falls, prices should fall. Now, demand certainly has fallen here over the last few years. Less and less people are buying flats, inventory is lying empty, and yet the prices just won't fall. There's no straightforward answer for this. It's clearly the unseen effect of something. But what? In today's episode, we're going to try and solve this mystery by working backwards from this unseen effect. And the economic detective who is going to help me do this is my good friend Vivek Kaul, a columnist at Equity Master and the author of four very fine books. Vivek, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, Amit. So Vivek, one of the subjects in which you've written about repeatedly over the years is real estate. And it's something that baffles me. I have a lot of sort of newbie questions on it, which I'm hoping you can shed some enlightenment. Now, real estate prices in our cities, especially in Bombay, where I live, have just shot up over the last decade and a half. And the interesting thing that's happening over the last couple of years is that even though the economy isn't doing that great per se, and a lot of inventory is not selling now, you would imagine that when inventory doesn't sell, the prices come down at some point. But that's not happening. And real estate in Bombay essentially remains out of reach for middle class people like"

And even though the sales have collapsed, I mean, if you look at the last, I mean, there was one survey which was done recently, which took the data for around 42 Indian cities into account. And they said that the home sales had fallen by around 41 percent, but prices haven't. Now, recently, the National Housing Bank released the Residex Index, I mean, it's a real estate index, which they've had for some time, but they sort of updated it and re-released it. And now it has a lot more data than it had in the past. And that threw up some very interesting numbers. Now, between March 2016 and March 2017, the median return on real estate in 49 Indian cities was 2.8 percent. If you took out, there was one city, Vizag, which had given a return of 24 percent in the last one year. So if you took that out, the median return was 2.55 percent. What that tells you is, actually, I would like to highlight another point here. So the data in this index starts from June 2013. So if you look at the median return per year between June 2013 and March 2017 on investing in real estate in India across 49 cities, it was 4.3 percent."

So this is the middle point of the data. So 4.3 percent per year return over a four-year period, which isn't huge. So what that tells you is that even though the real estate prices are not falling, they haven't risen at the same rate as they were in the past. And also, you know, this also tells you that, you know, the notion that people have in their head that real estate will always go up isn't really correct. In fact, if you look at prices over the last one year, in 13 out of the 49 cities, prices have actually gone down. Also, you know, at 4.3 percent return or 2.55 percent return, I mean, it's not worth investing"

I mean, obviously, you get a tax benefit as well. The rental yields are, you know, 2 percent. I mean, so if you were to sort of use a ballpark figure, investing in real estate makes sense if the returns are at least 10 percent per year.

But the other thing that, you know, needs to be sort of taken into account here is, and I mean, I've been writing this for many years now, is that India's income tax laws up until February 1st, 2017, when Arun Jaitley made his latest budget speech, essentially encouraged people to speculate in real estate. Now what happens is when you buy your first home, which is, and you live in it, which in income tax terms is called a self-occupied house, the deduction that you get on your taxable income for paying home loan interest is limited to Rs. 2 lakhs or rather was limited to Rs. 2 lakhs, whereas if you buy a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, tenth, whatever, xth number of home and you finance it using a home loan, the entire interest that you paid on that home loan was available as a deduction against your taxable income to the condition that you added a notional rent to your taxable income if you were not renting that house out. Now, you would know that the rental yields are like abysmal, you know, 1-2 percent, whereas EMIs are huge. So that essentially ensured that a lot of corporate crowd, you know, senior level corporate crowd essentially brought down their, you know, taxable income and paid very little tax. By investing in real estate. By investing in real estate. And at the same time they created an asset, right. Now in this budget, Arun Jaitley made a very, you know, sensible sort of change and wherein he limited the tax deduction to Rs. 2 lakhs across all home loans. So this essentially takes the speculation that was happening at the corporate level in order to avoid tax out of the window. Now what happened was, for a lot of these guys, you know, who have a second, third home, it just did not make, they were not bothered about the fact whether prices went up or not. They were just bothered about the fact that their taxable income was coming down dramatically"

You know, what happens is you sort of buy your, you know, you get some black money from somewhere and you buy a house. Now when you sell that house, you get a bigger amount of black money back, right? So then what do you do with it? Then you go looking for, you know, a cheaper location where you can buy, let's say you had bought one, you know, house with that black money. Now you go buy two homes with that black money, right, in a cheaper location. So black money essentially leads to the multiplication of black money in real estate. And this is a chain which is very difficult to break. And what has also happened is, I mean, you know, to answer your specific question as to why sales have fallen and prices haven't. Now you know, look at a guy who's already, you know, invested, you know, who probably has three, four homes or whatever. And he's invested a lot of his black money in it. Now even if, let's say he were to sell those homes right now, he decides to sell them, and he sells them at whatever the market price is, and I mean, whatever the buyer is willing to pay. Even if, you know, he's even willing to take a loss, okay, loss as in he's willing to take a price which is lower than what he expected in the past, not a loss. Now he gets the money back, a lot of it is black money, now what will he do with that black money? You know, he can go buy, you know, more real estate, but that isn't giving him the kind of returns that it was in the past. So for him, the best decision is to stay put. So if, you know, he doesn't sell, so if there are no distressed sales, the prices will not come down. I mean, there need to be an enough number of distressed sales wherein people need liquidity."

Now, regardless of that, overall demand has sort of gone down and prices haven't gone down.
