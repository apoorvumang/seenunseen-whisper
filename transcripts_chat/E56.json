Sadly, art is not a constant presence in our lives, and most of us can only admire it from a distance. Until now. Our sponsors for this episode, a company called Indian Colors, has made it its mission to make the best fine art easily accessible to art lovers everywhere. Indian Colors licenses images from top Indian artists and adapts it into beautiful objects of everyday use. They have home decor, like cushion covers and table runners. They have accessories, like tote bags. And what I particularly like is their wearables. Their kaftans, shrugs and stoles. On languid summer afternoons, I recline by the lake wearing nothing but a soothing stole from Indian Colors. Artists get royalties on each product sold, just like authors do for books. And some of the artists you'll find featured are luminaries like Samir Mondal, Dhruvi Acharya, Brinda Miller, Shruti Nelson and Harin Vakil. Head on over to IndianColors.com, that's colors with an OU, to check out their offerings. Use the code IVM20, IVM for IndusVox Media 20, for a 20% discount. IVM20 is the code at IndianColors.com, colors with an OU. And now, moving on from art to money. Yes, the answer to the riddle is money, which is all around us, almost as essential as oxygen. And it's been made through the centuries of salt, butter, coconut, tea, rice, tobacco, seashells, animal skin, almonds, gold, silver and iron. And is now usually made either of paper, which is easy to print, or of bits and bytes, which are easy to replicate. That makes it easy money. And my guest today is a columnist and author, who has written an entire trilogy of books, called the Easy Money Trilogy. Vivek Kaul, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen."

        "message": "So, basically, I mean, there is, you know, it's more of a journalistic term, which was created in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which started in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers, which was the fourth largest investment bank on Wall Street, went bankrupt. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt on September 15, 2008. In and around then, many other financial institutions had to be rescued by governments. This included the American insurance group, AIG, which was bailed out by the American government on September 16, 2008, a day after Lehman Brothers went bust. Because if AIG had been allowed to fail, many other financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, which is by far the biggest investment bank on Wall Street, would have failed as well. So, to prevent that, a lot of, you know, these financial institutions were rescued. And this essentially goes against the entire idea of free market capitalism, where if something is failing, it needs to be allowed to be failed. But, I mean, that did not happen. And then, in the months, you know, after September 2008, the Federal Reserve of the United States, which is the American Central Bank, and other Western central banks, including the Bank of England, decided to print money. And the idea was to sort of flood the financial system with a lot of money, so that interest rates fall, and people and companies borrow and spend more. And because of that, the economy would recover, and everybody would live happily ever after. So, that was basically the concept of easy money. Now, what happens is, you know, when a central bank, which includes the Federal Reserve also, prints money, it cannot, like, load that money onto a helicopter, and, you know, then go out there and throw that money into the economy, right? That's not possible. So, what it does instead is the money that it prints, or rather creates digitally these days, it uses it to buy bonds, okay? And when it buys those bonds, the money gets into the financial system. And once the money, there is a lot of money going around in the financial system, then interest rates start to fall. So, what the American Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, decided to do was, it decided to print money and buy two kinds of bonds. One was the American Treasury bond, which is basically the, you know, bonds issued by the American government to finance its fiscal deficit. And the second kind of bonds were called the mortgage-backed securities. Now, mortgage-backed securities are essentially securitized financial securities, which had been derived from mortgages, which in India we call home loans. So, they bought these two securities, and the reason they did that was because a lot of these financial institutions had these bonds, but nobody was willing to buy them. Now, what happens is, you know, when any financial crisis starts, people who have cash, institutions which have cash, try and hold on to that cash. Nobody wants to, you know, go out into the market and trade. Now, in order to sort of untangle that, the Federal Reserve had to step in and they had to buy these bonds. Now, a central bank buying and selling government bonds is, you know, well-known. They do that to, you know, carry out what are known as open market operations. But a central bank buying private financial securities, like the Federal Reserve did by buying mortgage-backed securities, is not something which was very well-known till that point of time. So, as I said, the entire idea was to buy these securities, pump money into the financial system, hope that the interest rates fall, hope that people borrow more, companies borrow more, the wealth effect kicks in, so on and so forth, and, you know, the economy sort of comes out of trouble. But what happened was, you know, all of this and a lot more. And so we are sort of, you know, still seeing the effects of the easy money policy which was initiated by the American Federal Reserve nearly 10 years back."

When a company bails out banks, what it does is it creates incentive for them to continue being irresponsible in future, because they know that taxpayers' money will be there to bail them out. This is sort of a way of privatizing profits, but socializing losses. If the company does well, it keeps the profits, but if it does badly, we the taxpayers have to bail them out. And this is contrary to all principles of free market capitalism. It's a terrible thing, and cronyism is really the only acceptable term for it,"

You know, one of the economists in the 20th century who was by far, I mean, the most read economist in the sense that he used to write the most in the popular media was John Kenneth Galbraith. And Galbraith had to say this. He said, in America, there is only one kind of socialism, and that is socialism for the rich. So this is a very, you know, the bailing out of, you know, the likes of AIG and Goldman Sachs. I mean, Goldman Sachs was not technically bailed out, but, you know, the moment they bailed out AIG, they also bailed out Goldman Sachs. Was obviously, you know, a very good example of what Galbraith said. And, you know, in 2008, when the entire, you know, thing was breaking out, the American Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, was a former chairman of Goldman Sachs. So, you know, I mean, the links are between Wall Street and the American government are so deep that, you know, whenever a crisis occurs, the government by default will have to come to a rescue."

And, you know, as you said at the beginning of the show, right from everything from, you know, butter to gold and silver. Now, somewhere along the line, paper started to be used as money. And, I mean, without really getting into the details of it, this paper was always backed by some commodity. In United States, tobacco receipts in, you know, the state of Virginia, you know, Virginia tobacco, we all know about, was used as money for a very long time. In fact, it was used as money longer than gold was. So, these receipts could be used to settle, you know, accounts, and they had the backing of some other commodity. So, similarly, over a period of time, you know, I think the Bank of England, paper money was backed by gold. And the master of the mint of the Bank of England was a gentleman called Isaac Newton, who we all know, I mean, which is where he, you know, he made his money being the master of the mint of Bank of England and not doing all the science and the math that he did."

The Bank of England used to issue paper notes, and these paper notes were backed by gold.

Or there is money being used as wallpaper, and you'll get all those kind of pictures. There's a great story about, which I read many years back, in a book authored by a gentleman called Adam Smith, who wasn't the Adam Smith, but someone in the US writing under the pseudonym of Adam Smith. So, this Adam Smith writes a story about another guy called Walter Levy, who was an oil consultant or something like that. And Walter Levy's father, it seems, had bought an insurance policy in 1903, which matured in 1923, right at the point when the German hyperinflation was on. And that, the money that that policy gave out was just good enough to buy a loaf of bread or something like that.

And what happens is that because you have the ability to print money, what happens when you print more money is that the amount of money goes up, but the goods and services at that point in time remain the same. Now, it's supply and demand. When that happens, automatically everything becomes more expensive because it's a greater amount of money chasing the same number of goods. Things becoming more expensive, and I'm being kind of simplistic here, but this is broadly how it works. That when the money supply goes up and there's more money chasing the same number of goods and services, things become more expensive. That's inflation. And inflation always hurts the poor the most. Therefore, they are the people for whom a bag of rice will go from 20 rupees to 40 rupees and, you know, just making that daily meal becomes a burden, which is why libertarians often call inflation a tax on the poor and which is why it's a very dangerous thing that requires a lot of oversight when a government has its hands on the money supply because it's very tempting for the government of any day with short-term interests in mind, like the next elections, to just print their way out of trouble, just print more money, you know, forget about the consequences to the common man, especially the poor. Remember, it's not the rich, but the poor who get hurt the most. Sorry for that, you know, that typical libertarian digression I had to make. So let's get back to your story."

Now this, what this did was this gave US an exorbitant privilege, which essentially meant that the US could print all the dollars that it needed, whereas the other countries, in order to ensure that they had those dollars needed to earn them. So what the other thing that happened was that, you know, because of this, because dollar was exchangeable into gold, dollar became the international financial currency. Which it made sense for countries all over the world to hold their foreign exchange in terms of dollars, which is something which continues till this day. And before that, the British pound was the international financial currency. And so this gradually moved towards the dollar. Now, what happened in the late, you know, mid to late 1960s was that France under Charles de Gaulle started to do very well. And they started earning dollars and they started converting these dollars into gold. And gradually this caught on and a lot of other European countries started doing this. And in the end, you know, you reached a US reached a stage where it had very little dollars left in order to continue exchanging them for gold. The, you know, the final nail in the coffin came from Great Britain on August 13, 1971, when Britain also demanded that the dollars be converted into gold. On August 15, 1971, Richard Nixon, who was the then president of United States, interrupted a very famous show whose name I can't recall right now. It was in its 12th season and it was really followed quite a lot back then. And he interrupted that show, went live on television and told the world that, I mean, he said a lot of things. And within those lot of things, he also told the world that the gold window, the dollar gold window has been shut down. So suddenly what happened was that, you know, up until then, the entire currency system had some sort of, you know, commodity backing it. Now, on August 15, 1971, that, you know, sort of that arrangement broke down. And that essentially freed governments all over the world to print as much money as they wanted to. I mean, in fact, this had already started in a way after the end of the First World War. But the real break came on August 15, 1971."

So, I mean, so the first thing that, you know, a lot of people said was now that, you know, the monetary system would collapse. But nothing like that really happened. I mean, there was this chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States called Paul Volcker, who was the chairman between 1979 and 1987. And he said something to the effect of that, you know, the belief in dollar as the global financial sort of currency became even more after the, you know, gold standard was broken. So, I mean, rather ironically, this happened. But, you know, one thing that needs to be sort of also said here as to, which is something that not many people know, that the rise of the dollar as international financial currency was also thanks to Saudi Arabia, which sometime in 1945, got into a sort of an agreement with the United States, not Saudi Arabia, but the Al Saud family, got into an arrangement with Roosevelt, who was the president of the US at that point of time, that they will sell oil in terms of dollars. Now, oil is a commodity, which every country in the world needs, and not every country sort of produces it. You know, not every country has oil. I mean, like India almost imports 80% of the oil that it needs. Now, what that did was once Saudi Arabia and then the OPEC started buying and selling oil in terms of dollars, every country in the world needed dollars. So, when every country needed dollars, what they also had to do was when they sold their exports, they had to price them in dollars. So, Saudi Arabia played a very important part in ensuring the dollar became the global financial currency. In fact, if you remember a few years back, Barack Obama was, you know, had come to India and he had to suddenly leave because the Saudi Arabian king died. And, I mean, so this is all about oil."

Then China invested those dollars into American financial securities, including the treasury bonds of the United States and a lot of other private financial securities. So, when the Chinese invested in the American financial securities, the demand for those securities went up, and hence, you know, the bond yields came down. And because of that, interest rates were low in the US. So, when interest rates were low, the US consumer, American consumer could borrow at low rates, and then he could use a lot of that money to ultimately buy Chinese goods.

I mean, as long as the Chinese keep reinvesting in the US treasuries, and the interest rates stayed low, the American consumer kept borrowing and the American economy kept doing well. I mean, obviously, I'm simplifying it a lot. I mean, you know, the real world really doesn't work as, you know, simplistically as this. But, so, getting back, so this is how, you know, Alan Greenspan and the entire era of easy money sort of continued. Now, what has also happened in the US, very, very interestingly, is that since the, I think, mid 70s or early 70s, the median incomes have not really moved. So, which has led to a situation wherein, you know, the politicians like low interest rates, because that, you know, people can borrow at low interest rates, housing prices can go up. So, even though the salaries of people are not going up, because the home prices keep going up, people tend to feel a little wealthy, and which is something that politicians like. So, this is, you know, another angle to it, wherein, because the US over the years has stopped manufacturing, stopped making things, you know, the median income hasn't really gone anywhere. But that's a different debate for a different day. So, obviously, after the dotcom bubble went burst in 2000, a new bubble in the form of the housing bubble came to the fore. And in this housing bubble, there was something known as the subprime loans, which came to the fore. Now, what had happened was because, you know, the banks were ultimately running out of people to lend money to, banks and other financial institutions. So, they had to create a new level of borrowers. Now, prime borrowers were good borrowers to whom you lent money, because you felt that they were in a position to return it. The subprime borrowers basically were the borrowers below the prime borrowers who normally would not have gotten a home loan, or any other kind of loan for that matter. But given the fact that they were just, it was too much money sloshing around in the system and loans had to be given. So, a subprime category was created."

What also happened was that the American financial sector discovered something known as securitization. Now, securitization added to this entire easy money bubble. Now, what happens is typically, when a bank gives a loan, it, you know, keeps that loan on its books. And over the years, as the AMIs get paid, a part of the principal is returned, and interest is also paid on that loan. In case of securitization, what the banks and other financial institutions did was, you know, let's say they had, you know, given a home loan at the rate of 8%. Now, they issued financial securities against that home loan, which paid, let's say, an interest of 7%. And those financial securities were then sold off to other investors. So, what it did was that the bank, instead of holding the money on to its balance sheet, got the money back up front. And it could then lend the money all over again. And not just that, it bundled bunches of loans together, subprime loans. So, what also happened was because, you know, the interest in case of the investors was because a lot of these loans were subprime loans. They were essentially giving a rate of return, which was better than a lot of other loans. And, you know, these were AAA rated securities."

Because there were three, I think, government approved rating agencies in the US. So, you know, instead of going to one, you know, instead of, let's say, going to S&P, the guy could have gone to Moody's. Right. So, there is a fundamental problem in the entire rating game. So, because of that, so banks got the money back because of securitization, the bank no longer had to hold on to the loan on its books. Now, what that did was that, you know, the entire structure, which was in place in order to ensure that you give loans to only people who returned those loans. I mean, you had loan officers who did that sort of thing. That went out of the window, because the moment you did not have the loans on your book, you know, it did not matter, you know, anyone else. So, all those loan officers were fired and all that's there in the book. So, ultimately, because all this money was being lent, there was a huge bubble in the American housing market.

So, all this went along very, very fine, you know, but then as, you know, is the case with any bubble, you know, people ultimately, if you give them more money than they have the ability to repay, started to default. And once they started to default, you know, a lot of these investors who had also borrowed money to buy all these securitized financial securities started getting into trouble. And the first, you know, two hedge funds of an investment bank called Bear Stearns, which was the fifth largest investment bank on Wall Street, went bust sometime in 2007.

Number two, you had easy money flooding the system which was enabled by the US going off the gold standard and Nixon's decision in 1971. And what that easy money did was that because of low interest rates, people had access to a lot of money, banks and financial institutions, which they used to merrily make more of these loans. And number three, what also enabled them to make all of these loans was the fact that they were able to bundle them into these securities and sell them off further down the road to others.

And they started doing it sometime in October. Now, between October 3rd, 2017 and January 29th, 2018, the Federal Reserve has sort of pumped out around $40 billion, which is less than 1% of the size of the balance sheet. So, the balance sheet now is peaked at around $4.5 trillion in December 2016. When they started off in September 2008, the balance sheet size was around $905 billion. So, it went up by almost five times. So, ultimately, you know, you have to understand that any central bank does not have any money of its own. So, if the size of its balance sheet is going up, it basically means it's acquiring assets. How is it acquiring assets? By printing money. So, the balance sheet size went up from around $900 billion to $4.5 trillion. Now, this is something that the Federal Reserve is now trying to contract, and it is between October and January, it has managed to contract it by around 1%. And so, obviously, the plan is to contract the balance sheet by around $420 billion this year and $600 billion thereon. So, if everything goes as it is supposed to, then by the end of this year, the Federal Reserve balance sheet will be down by around 10%."

The other issue here is that the American government, under Donald Trump, is supposed to borrow more than $3 trillion between 2018 and 2020. So, what is happening here is that you have the Federal Reserve pulling out money, and between 2018 and 2020, they would have pulled out around $1.6 trillion, if they keep doing what they are saying right now. And at the same time, you have the U.S. government wanting to borrow $3 trillion. So, a government wanting to borrow in a financial system where the money supply is actually contracting is not, you know, the best thing that will happen, because all governments like to borrow at low interest rates. So, at some point of time, you know, I think the U.S. Federal Reserve will end up in a confrontation with Donald Trump, if it continues to do what it is saying it will do.

Now, you know, the beauty of the American system, so to say, is that they have a sense of balance. Now, even though you have a federal reserve chairman, the real decisions are essentially made by the Federal Open Market Committee, which decides on the monetary policy of the nation. Like, you know, in India also, we've recently moved towards a monetary policy committee. So, as interest rates start to go up, and if those rise in interest rates starts to hurt the American economy, then the FOMC might very well take a decision without running into a confrontation with Donald Trump that we do not need, you know, high interest rates as of now. So, they can go slow on sucking out money from the financial system. Now, why I say this is because, you know, the median income in the US started to fall from 2008 onwards, and only in 2016 has it crossed the level that it was in 2008. So, the American system, economic system, so to say, is at a very nascent stage of economic recovery. Now, whether the Federal Reserve will, you know, risk sort of sabotaging that recovery, I mean, I don't think so. Which is why I feel that, you know, somewhere towards the second half of this year, when the impact of higher interest rates becomes a little more clear than it is as of now, the Federal Reserve will have to sort of go slow on taking the money out, you know, all this money, printed money that they have put into the financial system, taking that out, they'll have to go slow on it."

But then, you know, in economics, as, you know, I mean, many years back, I had, I happened to meet Mr. Vaivi Reddy, who was the governor of RBI between 2003 and 2008. And he told me, and this was at the point when the financial crisis was just starting, and he told me something very interesting. He said, Vivek, you know, not doing anything is not something a central bank can do. They have to do something. They feel compelled to act in a crisis. Exactly. So, and this is, you know, it's, it's like, it's an example that I sort of, and I then wrote a piece around this phenomenon a few years later, which Dr. Duwari Subba Rao, you know, used in his book, and he who moved my interest rate. So, the example is very simple, you know, in football, the statistics show that, you know, when a penalty is being taken, it makes sense for the goalkeeper not to jump and stand where he is, because his chances of, based on past data, his chances of stopping the goal are best if he doesn't jump. But the problem is, if he doesn't jump, you know, for the, for every time the ball, you know, when the ball goes towards his right or towards his left, he ends up looking very, very stupid. So, he has to jump. So, if you take the same analogy and, you know, sort of plonk it onto a central bank, they have to do something. So, not doing anything is not an option."

And for more great, cutting-edge Indian shows, do download the IVM Podcasts app and follow IVM Podcasts on Twitter and Facebook. Goodbye for now. If you enjoyed listening to the seen and the unseen, check out another hit show from IndusVox Media Networks, Cyrus Says, which is hosted by my old colleague from MTV, Cyrus Brocha. You can download it on any podcasting network."

The journey, though daunting for this youngling, will have some comfort because she has downloaded her favorite podcast. You can see more of her species on IVMPodcasts.com, your one-stop destination where you can check out the coolest Indian podcasts. Happy listening."
