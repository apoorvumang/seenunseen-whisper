In the last few episodes I've taken deep dives into history and philosophy, discussing books by the likes of Ram Guha, Tyler Carvin, Stephen Pinker, Gyan Prakash, Matt Ridley and Manu Pillay. I even had an episode on cricket with Harsha Bhogle. But no matter where I go, I'll always come back to economics because hey, it's bloody important. Starting today, I'm going to have an episode every few weeks that is an economics ramble. I'll just ask a couple of economist friends to drop in and we'll chat about the economic landscape around us and try to illuminate more unseen effects of the policies of our overlords. My guests today are both good friends of mine who have appeared on the show and I hope they'll remain regular guests as time goes by. Vivek Kaur is India's most prolific economics journalist. He writes an average of 33.2 pieces every week for various publications in India. He's also written four books, the Easy Money Trilogy and India's Big Government. You can buy them all on Amazon. My second guest today is my good friend Kumar Anand with whom I have had more cups of coffee than any other person alive. So when I die of liver failure, you know who to blame. Kumar is an economist who currently works with Naidisha and he also put together the Indian Liberals Project. Before I begin my conversation with Vivek and Kumar though, let's take a quick commercial break.

You'll hear that when the episode comes out and for that reason also we won't have a particularly long episode today, maybe an hour or so. And we won't go into some of the reader questions that we asked people to submit on Twitter. Those are for next time. This is going to be a regular feature. Hopefully, you guys will kind of keep returning but that's enough of me rambling and let's get to the economics ramble part of it. Vivek, we are recording this on Feb 7th and the union budget was just out last week. What were your views on it? I know you've written some 83 pieces on it already. No, I just wrote around 8. Just 8? Are you serious?"

So, before we get to that, do you repeat yourself in these 8 pieces or do you find different pieces to sell? Of course, it can't be. So, in an interim budget it would be difficult to write 8 new pieces but in a fresh, in a normal budget, 10-11 pieces is pretty okay. There's nothing great about it. You can easily write 10-11 new pieces."

Kumar and I are suppressing our laughter. Like 10 pieces is nothing. Also because of what you said in the intro. So, basically see, what happens is in many pieces, like I wrote 3 pieces for Equity Master this week on the budget and they were all, so basically I wrote one piece on how the fiscal deficit should not be taken seriously. Then I wrote another piece, while writing that piece, the second idea on how FCI, Food Corporation of India is used to sort of manipulate fiscal deficit numbers. And then I wrote another piece on how FCI is used during election years to sort of benefit the political party which is in power. So, if you look at the core idea at the heart of these 3 pieces, it was basically the same. But given that, if I had figured everything out at the very beginning of writing the first piece, I would have written only one piece. But what happened was, when writing the first piece, I figured out the second one and when I wrote the second one, I figured out the third one."

And if you are curious enough, I don't think writing 6-7 pieces is a big deal. Because ultimately it takes around what, 2 hours to write a 1000 word piece, not more than that. So, on that, and given that a lot of it is basically you are building on something that you have already written. So, you are essentially, it's all there in your head, you are just rewriting. Like if you were to ask me to write on the fiscal deficit, so 300, the basic 300 words on what is fiscal deficit, why is it important, I mean all that is already there. So, you are not like reinventing the wheel in the strictest sense of the term. So, basically most columns that one writes are not written from scratch."

        "message": "I just thought, it was an out and out election budget, I mean like interim budgets tend to be. And what was disappointing was the fact that some good schemes were launched without any preparation. So, take the biggest thing in the budget which was PM Kisan, essentially an income support scheme for farmers, small and marginal farmers with land holding of around 2 hectares, which is nearly 5 acres. So, now the basic problem here is that the government wants to give them 6000 rupees per year, 2000 rupees in 3 installments, and in order to ensure that they do it before elections, the scheme has essentially been initiated with a retrospective effect from December 1st. So, basically by March 31st, before March 31st, the first installment of 2000 rupees should have reached these farmers. Now the problem is how will you identify these farmers, I mean who are these farmers who have, you know, 2 hectares or less or households, farming households basically. Now, for that you need digital land records, which are not available through the length and breadth of the country, you know, a state like Karnataka has land records, but a state like Bihar which actually needs this support, you know, there is nothing there. So, or even Uttar Pradesh, so you know, these are the states which actually need, you know, need the support. The second thing is a lot of people have pointed out is that many of these people who own this land are no longer farmers, you know, I mean, they're probably living in cities and it's someone else who's farming on their behalf. So, what happens to them? Then there is the other, there is a pension scheme, which has been launched for people in the informal sector."

Now, in a state like Bihar, which has a per capita income of around 38,000, a 6000 rupee payment per month will definitely make a lot of difference. You're saying it will make a difference in Bihar, maybe not in Kerala. But Kerala also has a lot of, you know, marginal farmers, because if you look at plot sizes in Kerala, agriculture plot sizes, they're very, very small. In fact, they're smaller than that, those in Bihar. So, Bihar, I think the average plot size is around 0.5, 0.5 hectares. In Kerala, it's around 0.3, 0.33, something like that."

States which have better land records actually do not need these schemes as much as states which do not have land records. So, in an ideal world, this should have been done in July 2014, when the first budget was presented. And the next two years, or whatever time it would have taken, should have been spent in building these records, in building these databases. Like the government went around, you know, building the Aadhaar database or opening Jan Dhan accounts. This should also have been done on a similar war footing.

I think it will make a big difference, a huge difference, because the money in your pocket that you receive from the government or when you earn, always makes a difference to you on the margin. So, for someone who does not have anything, 500 or 2000 rupees on the margin is, it could be a big, big amount. You know, imagine if you don't have anything, those first 100 rupees is what will get you your lunch or breakfast, you know, not on the margin."

So, per capita is essentially the mean that we are talking about. The median income would be even lower. So, the income of an average Bihari would be much lower than the per capita income in the state. Right. So, let's say someone who's making 20,000 rupees a year or 15,000 rupees a year, I mean, 6,000 rupees is a huge, huge amount of difference. So, it just depends on which part of, and there are large parts of India where this is needed."

So, before we go back to the budget, this is actually a good time to sort of take a diversion for a moment and talk about the Congress's promise of the minimum guaranteed income for the poor. Because that again appears to be a similar way of not actually caring about fixing structural problems. But here's a handout and we'll bribe you and get your votes and whatever.

So, both Congress's proposal a week before the budget came out, and now the BJP's proposal. Congress's proposal, I would say on the margin is worse than BJP's proposal because what they are saying is that they will identify a poverty line and anyone falling short of that, they will provide the bridge. So, suppose if I have said that one lakh rupees per annum income is the one where everyone should get, if you are falling short by 50,000, I'll give you 50,000. If you're falling short by 80,000, I'll give you 80,000. Now, what that means, the guy who is deciding how much money you are falling short of. Tremendous discretion. So, in fact, the next job that I will be looking for is that if I can be the person who decides how much you are making and you know, therefore the bridge."

As part of the research when I was doing on UBI, I learned that Hillary Clinton very seriously considered running on the platform of UBI and abandoned it because the numbers didn't add up. They certainly don't add up for India. And once you start, every budget you will see more and more, you know, promises in terms of numbers."

So, once you start reading all the other sentences, you realize that how a lot more attention has been given to the provision of private goods, which you would assume that people who take care on their own will provide, you know, work for it or you know, whatever and provide for themselves. And the things that the government should be doing, you know, our public goods, national defense, law and order, etc. You know, making sure that contacts are enforced, etc. Those are the job of the government and they will do it. Budget is entirely looks to me is focused on provision of private goods. Some of the things that are LED bulbs, of course, 6 crore LPG cylinders. You'd assume that is a classic case of a private good building houses, building toilets as part of such a Bharat mission, which you would assume that if you really want to take care of sanitation and cleanliness. The way to fix it would be rather look at the root cause of it, whether it's property rights or devolution of power to the local governments, but rather than running a national mission on it, electricity connection and of course, food grain, etc. So, look at it. It looks like you are engaged more and more increasing every year in the provision of private goods. The budget looks like to me that and which brings to your point, which is again the classic case of redistribution, you know. So, almost all of this is financed by taxes one way or the other, whether it's inflation tax, deficit financing or through, you know, just tax revenues, which are collected."

See, basically, Narendra Modi, the way I look at him, you know, he is essentially a narrative builder. Sure. People call him a nation builder, but he's basically a narrative builder. And he has been losing track of the narrative for the last four, five months. I mean, there is no denying that. I mean, you may one may not like Rahul Gandhi, but he's come back forcefully over the last few months. So this speech by Piyush Goyal and to his credit, he did a much better job than Arun Jaitley possibly would have was essentially a attempt to get control of the narrative again. And which is why he sort of went back, you know, went to, you know, if you look at the speech, it's essentially a summary of what Modi has supposedly done. How he projects himself. I mean, it's just that there's nothing more to it. You know, he's talked about all, you know, all the talking points are there. Beyond that, it has talking points, which Modi can go and sell to the audience in the next three to four months, which not four months, but two to three months, which he will definitely be on the road and will be communicating with the people of the country directly. So it has given him these talking points, you know, you have the income scheme, then you have the pension scheme and everything else that he is supposedly done. So I think it was nothing more than, it is good politics. I mean, it was nothing more than, you know, a good pre-election speech, which the finance minister did a commendable job of, you know, executing. So, you know, even look at, I'll give you a very simple example. Now, let's, you know, he talked about how the defense budget for the first time was crossing three lakh crore and everybody clapped. But then what was the defense budget up until now? You know, I mean, and if you look at the numbers, the increase is just, you know, a couple of percentage points, which is lesser than the prevailing rate of inflation, right? Where is this money going to? A lot of this money in the so-called defense budget now goes towards salaries and pensions. It is not going towards, you know, what is, you know, actually\u2026"

The other point is, you know, in an interim budget, you don't make, you know, big changes like this, you know, like the income support scheme, but the BJP did it. And in fact, I was on TV on the budget day and the BJP spokesperson, in fact, two BJP spokespersons at different points of time justified it by saying, but the Congress did this in 2014 and did this in 2009. And, you know, there is a line which I like to sort of repeat and it's a line from the movie Diwaar, which is like, auron ke paap ginane se apne paap kam nahi ho jata hai."

In fact, if you watch TV on the budget day, you'd realize that all BJP spokesperson were basically saying the same thing. They were not answering the questions. They had these three, four points, which they were just going and building the narrative. Yes, so it was essentially nothing more, you know, just another exercise in narrative building. Also to sort of, you know, the limerick you sort of talked about, you know, politics, there is a very nice line, there was a Shahrukh Khan movie many years back called Oh Darling Yeh Hai India.

You know, Oh Darling Yeh Hai India, so what we haven't even saved, we have already distributed or at least planned to. So, yeah, there's another point I wanted to make. So, the Congress, you know, minimum income guarantee scheme, Big 19, you know, which makes 10 billion."

You know, if you know, if Bihar grows at 11%, I mean, it will, if Karnataka stops growing today, Bihar will probably get there in another 15 years.

I would just look at the absolute numbers and you're right, the absolute numbers are abysmal. But to talk about it in terms of the divide is completely pointless. That's a wrong metric.

Now, the Congress minimum income guarantee scheme, even though very, you know, the details available are very sketchy, but from the way they've been talking, it would definitely cost more than 75,000 crores. Obviously, there are problems with this scheme as to how do you identify, you know, let's say the cutoff is 50,000 points. How do you figure out, you know, the person eligible is making that kind of money, especially in the informal sector where payments are in cash and also payments tend to vary. It's not like you get the same amount of money every day or every week. So how do you figure all that out? You know, it's easy if all the money is coming into a bank account and then you can, you know, do some 180 day average or something like that. But having said that, you know, I think it's also one if the country were to look at a bigger income support scheme, I think it's sort of makes sense because, and you know, we obviously have to fund it properly because that bill there would run into lakhs of, you know, it would easily run into 9, 10, 11 lakh crore. So how do you fund something like that? And if, you know, in order to fund something like that, the only way is to, for the government is to sell all the assets that it has been sitting on what Mr. Anand's current employer, Mr. Jain's been talking for a while. So I think it's a reasonably good idea, but obviously it will not happen because no politician worth his salt will do anything like that. So if someone were to do it and do it properly, it would be an excellent way of curtailing, you know, India's big government, which is in places which it shouldn't be. I mean, the government should basically be concentrating on five, six basic things, defense, external affairs, railways, roads."

And what will essentially happen is we'll have all these half-baked income support schemes, which will operate on top of all the schemes that we already have. Now, you know, this is a point I made in my Mint article. So basically what, you know, Praveen Chakravartty has been saying is that, you know, they'll be rational about the entire thing. So obviously it means that, you know, they'll look at new ways of raising taxes and they'll also look at ways of cutting down on current expenditure. Now, if you look at current expenditure, you will have to cut down on things like food subsidies. Now, it's easy to talk about cutting down food subsidies, but the moment you start getting into it, there are too many problems that crop up. Now, the first thing that will happen is that, you know, how is food subsidy offered? It is offered through Food Corporation of India, which buys rice and wheat directly from farmers at a minimum support price, which the government announces. This is then distributed through the public distribution system at a very low price to meet the needs of the National Food Security Act and other, you know, welfare measures of the government. The government then compensates the Food Corporation of India for this subsidy that it offers. And now, if the food subsidy were to be cut down, then, you know, by its very definition, FCA would also have to cut down on procuring, you know, rice and wheat that it does. If it procures less, then what happens to all the, you know, infrastructure that it has built? What happens to the public distribution system that is in place?"

So since independence, we pursued the central planning model and the five-year plan. And what we did that to do the Soviet model planning, the big difference between Soviet Union and India, of course, is that India was a democracy while Soviet Union was not. We had private property as a fundamental right, property rights are fundamental right, but they did not. Every resource there belonged to the state. So to pursue planning, the only way you could do those planning if resources are available to you. So over a period of time, this Indian state has continued to accumulate more and more resources. So you'll remember the recent piece that I did for Pragati with my colleague Reshu, which is about how the number of CPSCs has grown over the years. In 50-51, it was 5. In 2013-14, when the current government came to power, it was 290. And as of 31st March 2018, the number stood at 339. So they have added more than about one CPSC every month that they have in power. So the state has continued to amass more and more resources in case of CPSCs, land, minerals, etc. So you nationalized all that. 70% of the banking business is not accounted for here. So if you take all that into account, then the ballpark figure that we have is that at the rate of 1 lakh rupees per Indian household, you'll be able to finance the return of this wealth. Remember, I'm calling it return of wealth. It's called the term NVAPSI and not a universal basic income, which is financed out of taxes or some sort of redistribution. It is redistribution, but taking away from the state itself, which over many, many years has continued to amass and currently which is lying either unused and what's still misused or abused. So you monetize it, put them into a fund, which is different from consolidated funds of India and use that fund only for the purpose of returning it back to people. No other purpose. So it's not used for government's current consumption purposes, but money directly hands. So I call it the right way of doing UBI. Just to get into the conversation on UBI, because people are talking about it. And as we discussed earlier that how India absolutely does not have the fiscal bandwidth. This is one way that you can do it. So all the resources which are lying idle. But as Vivek rightly said, you know, politically, it looks quite improbable. But at the same time, if enough people talk about it, and if people start looking at it and demanding it, then I don't think it will be, you know, an impossible thing anymore."

But the moment you need to execute it, the lower bureaucracy is already very, very burdened. So like, you know, in the 2016-17 economic survey, Arvind Subramaniam had said that there are 950 centrally sponsored schemes. So how is anyone supposed to keep track of that? So launching one more scheme on top of that is remarkably stupid. So take the, you know, the pension scheme that's been launched for the informal sector. Now, it's not like India doesn't have pension schemes. You know, there are enough, there is public provident fund has been around since the late 60s. And it is available to anyone and everyone. So, you know, you could have easily played around, you know, had an option in within that scheme, where the same scheme could have been implemented without, you know, going, you know, starting one more new scheme.

So the My Bab Sarkar, the notion, the centralization. So for me, that one bad idea, which all policymakers want is centralization, no matter what government there is, they all pursue amassing greater and greater power at the center. The reason I say this is there's a lot of merit in decentralization. Of course, you devolve power to the local government, but somehow that agenda, the narrative is not there at all from politicians. If there are local politicians, no one is saying that why not devolve power to the local governments. We did those 73rd and 74th amendment way back in 1992. It has been more than 25 years, but they have not been implemented at least in the spirit. So I would say it is the continued centralization of power in the hands of central government."

The Overton window essentially is a definition of essentially indicates the window of acceptable discourse on a linear scale, which is normally organized around freedom. And what happens is that over time that window shifts and things that were not acceptable 20 years ago may suddenly become acceptable today. For example, at a social level, I've seen the Overton window shift in my own lifetime, where if 377 had been abolished in the 1980s, it would not have got the kind of response it has today, where today the response largely is that yes, it needed to be abolished. And of course, there are widespread celebrations and all that. There may be that selection bias in play because I follow those circles. But regardless of that, I think in the 1980s, it would not have been like that at all. And a lot of people just wouldn't have gotten it and a lot of conservatives would have been more outspoken in the opposition of outlawing 377. And similarly, in an economic sense, I think there was a time where, you know, high taxes were considered good and nobody would be talking about low taxation and blah, blah, blah. And I think I agree with you that it's a positive sign that they're talking about it. But my sense is they're talking about it for, you know, optical reasons for one small part of the intelligence here. And they don't really care about it at all. But I hope I'm wrong. And I hope the Overton window keeps shifting because rhetoric does matter, Vivek."

It doesn't really matter who wins the next elections. We are screwed anyway. There's not much we can do about them, partly because none of the parties shows the mindset that you need to solve these particular problems.

What I find very, very funny is that, you know, when you tell them there is a crisis, they'll point out to, you know, data points like Uber and Ola have been recruiting, you know, drivers. But when you tell them that CMI survey shows that 1.1 crore Indians lost their jobs in 2018, then they'll come around and tell you, but that's private. Uber-Ola is also private. The, you know, the recent NSSO data, which the Business Standard published, I mean, the way they went around trying to deny that data was very, very disturbing, because, you know, a huge\u2026 NSSO is by far the largest survey that the government carries out. I mean, obviously, you know, the census would be much bigger, but census is not a survey. And a lot of things that the NSSO collects ultimately are, you know, go in as inputs into the GDP calculation. So, if the NSSO data is also not kosher, then what is kosher?

I mean, it's happened to the US, UK, large parts of Europe, China, you name a country and that is how it is. That is something that is not happening in India.

So, many Indian states have reached, you know, premature non-industrialization where the industry in the state has simply stopped growing.

I think the one lesson that politicians have learned from Narendra Modi is, I mean, whether it's the right one or the wrong one, we don't know, is that, you know, irrespective of what you do at the ground level, whether you deliver or you don't deliver, what is more important is to create and spread the right narrative.

We'll definitely take all of those and any more that you provide. Next time, let's just end on a note of hope. All of us sitting and you know, to use your brilliant Bollywood analogy from Kamine, all of us are basically looking at a kabootar and saying to ourselves, ye dil mange more."

We don't dwell on just the stuff that is now but rather the wider stuff about advertising, media content and the whole goddamn circus surrounding it. Tune in every Tuesday for a weekly unboxing of the mystery box we used to call advertising. I'm Varun Duggirala, co-founder and content chief at The Glitch. And this is my new podcast. Advertising is dead."
