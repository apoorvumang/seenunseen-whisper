        "message": "During this episode, I was moved by something that my guest said. He spoke about how awkward he felt when his father tried to hug him. And that reminded me of my own father. In his last years before he died, I felt that he was opening up in ways that neither of us were used to. Once when I visited him in Chandigarh, as I was leaving, about to get into my taxi outside the house, he opened his arms for a hug. It was an awkward moment. I was both happy and moved, but I hid the emotion. On one trip home, he even thanked me for coming, which was also out of character because he was always so blase about it. When episode 200 of the show came out, which is basically a long interview of me by my guest, he actually said he was proud of me, which was stunningly expressive, given his past record of reticence of being a hard man. It's a regret I have that I didn't peel back past all those layers, both his layers and mine, while he was still here. Maybe if I had heard this episode, I would have. Here's the thing. I have done many episodes where I have discussed feminism and the lives that women lead. Indeed, the title of this episode follows on from episode 259, The Loneliness of the Indian Women. At this point in time, in 2022, anyone listening to this show understands the many layers of oppression that women live with and normalize and that we must fight against. We have language for what happens to them, phrases like mansplaining and gaslighting and so on and on. We have frames to explain it. But the thing is, it isn't just women who are victims of patriarchy. Men are also diminished by it. They are trapped in roles, in grooves laid out for them. Here's what it means to be a man, to be a provider, to be a father, to be a son. You play that role, you get the job done, you don't cry at movies, don't show emotion, don't be a wuss. And many of us often get with the program and don't question what being male does to us. We have no language to describe this. We keep our emotions bottled up inside us, not expressing them to others, not even expressing them to ourselves. So what my guest speaks at length about in this episode should not be a surprise. The loneliness of the Indian man, the mental health problems that young people throughout this country are having to confront, and what this does to our society. This is all unseen. And there's a big lesson here. Men who call themselves feminists like me, need to not only think about how they look at women, but also how they look at themselves. Their kindness has to go in that direction as well. Only kindness"

        "message": "science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma. Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Nikhil Taneja, who trained as an engineer, began working life as a journalist at Hindustan Times, went on to MTV and to Yash Raj Films, where he was a general manager at the age of 30. Then he was crippled by anxiety and decided to confront his mental health issues. And he realized that many of the problems he faced came straight out of his being a man. He quit his job, did therapy, and later started Yuva, an organization that makes content, builds communities, and carries out research that's meant to understand and empower young Indians everywhere. Now, I think of my episodes as being stimulating conversations, deep dives akin to oral histories. And this episode is all of them. But it's also an episode that can change lives. Something I felt about my episode with Shrayana as well. We discuss a growing loneliness in our connected world. We discuss anxiety and mental health. We discuss the immense power of storytelling. What Nikhil has done with it is so unique and inspiring. We talk about the kindness project and initiative of Nikhil's and why most of all, we need to be kind to ourselves. So do listen and do share it with anyone you think may be interested. I know it's a long episode, but it contains multitudes. Before we get there, though, let's take a quick commercial break even though what the commercials are me only. That's how it is. Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students. We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community interaction. In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 per GST or about $150 and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiancut.com slash clear writing. That's indiancut.com slash clear writing. Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you. Nikhil, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Thank you for having me Amit. Yeah, I've been thinking of inviting you for a long time though, got down to it fairly recently, but I'm actually glad that I didn't invite you say two years ago, because the show was much shorter than and I just feel that you're a guest who's tailor made for this longer format where one can kind of go deep into oneself and introspect about the world. And that's that's one thing I've also really enjoyed about the talks you've given in your columns with HT, where, you know, there are various places where it feels like you're almost thinking aloud in the same way that I do about the same things I care about. So I really enjoyed that. One of the interesting things you mentioned in your column is that you are the last generation to grow up before the internet and also the the first generation to actually grow up with the internet in the sense that a transitional point and this is actually a question I've asked guests of my own age. I'm 48 now at the time of recording. And what I have noticed in my life is that I became an adult before the internet was there. So I was well into my 20s before the internet came. And it was interesting because I had to kind of learn about the world again, learn about myself again, you know, you just do that whole process from scratch, even something and it's a very clear demarcation and in my generation and also, you know, just in terms of earlier before the internet, you are restricted by communities of circumstance, whereas now we can form communities of choice. And in just so many ways, life is completely different. I want to hear from you what it was like, you know, growing up before the internet, because you can contrast it in a much better with in a sense growing up with it because it came when you were young enough. And, you know, earlier, when we were having lunch before this, we were speaking about the importance of finding that quiet it you don't have where you can just sit and, you know, not let sensations knock you from thing to thing. Tell me a bit about your growing up years before the internet, like, where were you born? Where did you grow"

        "message": "Amazing. No, but thank you for having me. Honestly, I'm really look, as I said, I think another thing that I'm really looking forward to over here is, you know, learning something about myself also, which I think like that's the every time I hear your podcast, as you yourself said, I think you learn not just about the person, but something about yourself. So where do I begin? So I was born in Karnal in Haryana. And my family, we were living in Lucknow at that time. My father was a banker. My mother tells me about the time when we were, you know, in Lucknow, we were not very well off. So she would always she has these, you know, when you see three idiots and you have that scene of black and white scene where you show people being, you know, not very well off. She kind of always talks about it in that way that, you know, papa ke ka coat phat jata tha. So then there was a choice. Should we get you an ice cream or should we get you should we get his coat repaired? So that's that's the context that I have, you know, of of growing up at that time where we were. There was a lot my father was doing to try and break out of his circumstance. And that was visible to everybody in the family. But he was constantly I don't think I spent time with my father, you know, growing up at all, you know, because he was constantly just trying to make it. He was just constantly trying to get more money, get a better house, get to a better life. And so, yeah, I don't, unfortunately, have too many memories of spending any time with my father. So I was very much raised by my mother in that sense. And two things started happening. Of course, I started, you know, finding a lot of love and empathy for my mother for the sacrifices that she's done and kind of always wanting to grow up to be the kind of the opposite kind of a man as my father because as like I would see my mother doing it all alone, right? And my father just so much, you know, I just wish I knew him more, which I still do right now. But yeah, that there was a lot of my early years, you know, we from Lucknow, we went to Delhi, my father moved out, he was in Bangalore. From there, we were there for about a year and a half. And then we went to the Middle East, Dubai, in Delhi. You know, my memories of, I feel Amit, I've always somewhere been like this outsider looking in. I was talking to Hitesh Kevalia, who's, you know, is a writer and director, he's done Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, Zyada Saavdhan. He used this fantastic term called border wale log. He said that, you know, kuch log hote hain, border wale log hote hain, jo, jo, they're always on the borders, they're never like inside or outside. I feel like as someone who, you know, grew up in a manner where I was definitely not, I won't say I was, you know, quote unquote poor, but we're definitely not very well off. And, and suddenly in Delhi, when lifestyle started improving, I was put into, for example, Rhein International. And I remember my memories of that time has been just me feeling really like, where am I fitting in here, you know, as somebody who was not, you know, as as rich as any of the other people over there, the way they spoke the English that they had, the clothes that they wore, the chocolates they would bring every day. And those are my early memories of like growing up. And then we went to Dubai, where, you know, my, again, upwardly mobile. So, you know, got a slightly better lifestyle. Again, I felt at home when I was in a school over there called our own English high school, where which was basically the one place where I think every middle class Indian kid over there was put in. But there was a better school there, which called modern high school, where, which was for the upper class, so to speak, where my parents ultimately put me. So my parents had made this choice when I was in when I was in Delhi, my younger brother was put in a place, put in not a very good school or a very rich school in that sense. And he was put in a government school and I was put in Rhein International. And so when we went to Dubai, they switched it and said, you know what, and now our younger son gets to go to a better school and you know, Nikhil gets to go to our own. No offense to anybody from our own. But eventually when I went into modern high, again, the same, I feel like so much of my life was just trying to kind of figure out how, who, what are these people? And you know, what is this? Where am I stand? Where do I stand with these people? Right? And for me, again, I think I just took it in with my mother also constantly telling me as his mother was raising me pretty much on our own, constantly telling me things like, you know, you need to obviously do better. You need to get a certain amount of marks and you need to make me proud. You need to go with every young boy is told, you know, you have to be an engineer and do an MBA. All of those things were always there, you know, I was constantly being told. So my ambition initially just became that I have to make my mother proud. That is all I want to do in my life. And no matter what place I was in, no matter what role I was in, I was always just overworking, you know, putting my everything into it just to make sure that when I go back, my mother is just like seeing all the work that she's done in raising me and my brother. She's proud of us. And in that, I think I just imbibed a mindset of like, you know, work is everything, you know, making it is everything. Aspiration is everything, which somehow started conflicting with I think who I was as a person, which I've now realized many, many, many years later, which was a person who used to really like writing, who used to really like art, who used to really like watching movies growing up. And, you know, stories were my comfort zone as someone again, as I said, someone who didn't really fit in or did not know where to fit in. I would always watch movies as you know, in a way for me to feel less alone. I remember one of the, you know, many years ago, I was just trying to teach and I'm sure we'll come to that. When I was teaching my students, I used to always ask them, you know, tell me your story. And then one day when they asked me, what's my story, and I'd always tell them to go deeper, deeper, deeper. And then I said something very superficial. And then I started thinking like, you know, everyone I asked them to go deep, but what is my and then one of the and why do I do what I do? And I was in Yash Raj films at that time, I was, you know, filmmaker. And the deeper that I went, I kind of recognized this one thing, which came to me as an epiphany that, you know, one of the reasons why I even interested in stories was because so my father was a big Dev Anand fan. And the only time that my father would ever call me was when he put on would come home and put on a Dev Anand movie. And then he'd be like, do you want to watch it? And then I would sit with him and I would watch these movies. That's what I remember growing up. And I suppose, in that moment with my father, I started recognizing the power of stories and storytelling and the fact that, you know, they actually bring you together in some way or the other. And that's my connection that I made with stories. You know, the only time I would ever have with my father was because of movies, because, you know, we got to sit together and spend three hours while we didn't may not have spoken. My father would be very excited about the facts of that film. And that's all I know, but he would never talk about me about feelings and emotions. But like, well, Dev Anand has done these many films and Adi Varman has done this and Kishore Kumar has done this and you know, but I was getting to spend time with my father, which meant a lot to me. But and that was my life. And I started really falling in love with the written word with stories started writing when I was very young, when I was about 14. And, and that's where the internet came into my life. So from Dubai, we went to Bahrain. And there was a magazine in the Middle East called Young Times, which was a part of the Khaleesh Times group over there. And Young Times was for young writers. And they used to have an arts column in it where people used to make paintings and drawings and send them. So my brother was a natural artist, you know, so he would draw these beautiful, you know, drawings and whatnot and send them and they'd get published. And I would constantly also try to do the same, but they would never publish my story. And I mean, my drawings are used to get so irritated, you know, like, and I was very bad at it. And I would also then, you know, use like a transparent paper and copy, you know, a drawing and I clearly they found out that I'm actually it's a plagiarism, which I now understand. But, but you know, I was just getting so frustrated that my brother keeps getting published. I don't keep getting published. I've sent far more entries than my brother. So one day I wrote a letter to them, you know, saying that, you know, like, I have a grievance with you all, you know, as a 12, 13, 14 year old, you, you know, I've sent so many different, you know, entries and you never publish it. And they publish that letter. And then I was like, well, clearly there's something in my writing that they wanted to publish. So, so I started writing more letters to them and they started publishing those letters. And eventually, because it was a youth magazine, I kind of, and because we had access to the internet, they just had like this email ID. We had got our first computer at that time. This is when I was 13. And, and we just got an internet dial up internet connection. So I just, I don't know why, but again, sense of ambition, constantly wanting to do better. I was like, what if I asked these folks that, uh, what if I could do something in Bahrain as a young writer? Can I be their correspondent? Can I, you know, because there's a lot of Indian celebrities to come to Bahrain. I was like, what if I interview them? And I don't even know where these ideas are. I didn't even know where these ideas came from, but I was just, I gave it a shot because of the internet and the road back saying, yes, go for it. And I said, what? And, and that's where my writing career pretty much began at, at 13, 14, you know, I got published. I've, I interviewed like from Junoon to, you know, Shankar Mahadevan to, you know, to Michael Schumacher. I have interviewed all of them before I was 18 during school years. And actually like spending time with those folks, Mohan Lal, I've sat with him. And the internet was the way for me to get to know these people. To know them as well. I just do intense research on everybody. So when I'd go there, you know, because I was like, age is against me in that sense, they'd be like, Oh, who's this 13, 14 year old coming? But like my, I need to make sure that when I ask questions, nobody, you know, looks down on me. So I just research the hell out of everybody and then go into that and, and start asking these questions. So before the internet, I feel like I kind of did not, as I think, did not know where to fit in. And when the internet happened, I suddenly kind of found my voice, you know, as somebody who just in the offline world, because of a certain, I don't know, class hierarchy, a social hierarchy, I was just always lost, always trying to find, you know, companionship, or true friendship, or authentic relationships, which I was just not able to as a young boy. And, and which is where movies became important to me. I think because of the internet, then I started finding like, a reason or an entire world on the internet. That was meant for me that was like, this is my community, this is going to be my world. This is where I fit in."

        "message": "Wow, that's very resonant and many things I want to double click on. But first I was you just before you told me that you were born in Karnal, I thought of Karnal during lunch. And the reason is that I was born in Chandigarh. But so I kind of know Karnal from a distance. But the reason is that you were talking about the film you're kind of working on, you're talking about one of your projects. And a project that I once abandoned came to mind, which was about 12-13 years ago, I decided that I'm going to write the series of three really bad pulpy novels, much like Roger Corman films, you know, that kind of feel. And I'm going to write each of them in one week. So it's going to be really hurried and bad. And one of those was called Karnal in Karnal. And it was about this bunch of boys, bunch of guys who want to have a party in this farmhouse in Karnal. And they get a bunch of sex workers or a bunch of girls to have it with. And then it quickly becomes a horror film, as these women turn on them and eventually murder all of them. And, you know, so it was very gory and very whatever I never ended up doing this, because, you know, one thinks of a million projects and all that. But, you know, now when you mentioned Karnal, for some reason, I thought of that. And it's again, women striking back against a patriarchy, right? There's a certain kind of oppression you're hitting at, which is also the theme of so much of your work. The first of the things I want to double click on is your what you told me the memories you shared with your mother, and even your father, like I did this recent episode with Samarth Bansal, you know, very beautiful, deep conversation and where he spoke about the expectations he had from his mother. And, you know, he spoke about how the day he got his first job, she said that I feel like I have become independent. Because, you know, and, and it was very interesting. And I'm interested in not just that aspect of it, but that aspect that in the sense, when we grow up, we often don't think of our parents a way we would do later, right? They are playing roles, we are also playing a role, they are playing roles, they are stuck in that role. We take them for granted. For us, a mother is a particular role that is being played by someone, a father is a particular role. We don't even think of them as real people. You know, recently, my father passed last year. So I was looking through old photographs. And I came across a photograph of my parents when they were in their early 40s. Right? And it's, it's like, a huge sort of mental shift you have to make. Because in that photograph, they're younger than I am now. And they're actual, they look like actual real people. And at the same time, I have a memory of them as that little boy in the picture, you know, looking at them as people who are in these roles, you never really see them as people. And later on, when you you know, you go through life, you look back, you kind of understand a little bit more, I think some people may go through their whole lives, just playing out roles, never seeing never understanding that my mother is someone who might have felt restrained by her circumstances that God knows what kind of quiet grief she hid within her as she did as she played her roles, you know, and ditto for fathers, as you've pointed out, you know, both men and women in different ways are victims of patriarchy. But I want to ask about sort of this memory aspect that, you know, were you clear as a kid at what was happening? Or is this stuff you're beginning to figure out in hindsight? And how do you look back on them and post all of that? You know, how did your how did your relationship with them evolve? Like, is this stuff that"

        "message": "you can talk about now at a distance? Absolutely. When I was much younger, I obviously did not have an understanding or perspective of the roles my parents were playing. I just had a lot of love for my mother, because I would see how hard she tries. And not just because of me, and I don't want to I don't want to dive too deeply into this part of my life, because it's about my brother. And I don't think I'm the right person to talk about his life. But my brother went through a really long phase of mental health issues, and younger brother, so just really like a 10 year period where he was depressed. And my mother's worked day and night to, you know, help him. You know, even even when you were in Dubai Bahrain, you know, again, we were not now I think we're in a place where we can easily say that we have privilege. But, you know, we were, we didn't have enough money to travel through taxi. So my mother would enroll us in every, you know, extracurricular activity possible. And then just walk us there, you know, like, so we like 40-45 minutes in the 45-50 degree heat, we would be walking from after school from our home to like, you know, tuition that she wanted us to be at a karate class, a tennis class, a swimming lesson, which most of which we gave up on you're like terrible kids in that sense, you know, but I was very aware that there is an effort going into, you know, raising us and, and, and that became even more apparent when my brother started going through his issues. And my mother really like just her entire life became about making sure my brother is, you know, able to get out of it. We did not know at that time it was depression. You know, at that time, we thought that there was, it was just, I mean, he's some problem as a child, he's not a problematic child in some way. And much later, we found out that this is mental health related, because those terms did not exist then, you know, so, so, so yeah, I think growing up and then my I was also very close to my Maasi, you know, who was like this ray of light who would come like again, she's a teacher, she has had a very hard life, she lost her husband, lost her parents, single handedly, like took care of her parents after losing her husband very early, lost her brother, both my mother, they've lost his elder brother. And she would just come in and you know, give us like this. So these gifts she'll bring in, you know, just a lot of love, a lot of, you know, care every time she'd come in to meet us. And these two women I would, and my Maasi was someone who would, you know, teach at a school. So she was a teacher, English teacher at a convent school in Karnal. And one of the most respected women in Karnal, even today, like sometimes you go for holidays, and you meet a student of hers who comes in, ma'am, you've, you've changed my life and whatnot. It's so beautiful to see. So these two strong women, you know, who are doing everything that was that was my understanding, like, you know, of of my parents in that sense, or my elders. On the other hand, with my father, it was mostly resentment. I was just really angry with him that he was not there for me. I'd see some of my other friends, you know, playing cricket with their fathers, etc, etc, or hanging out with them, you know, my father had no time for us. And, and my father also went through his own issues, used to be very angry, which I feel like most fathers are, I suppose, now that I've found or now that I've spoken to hundreds of 1000s of kids in India, I think that's the pattern, father is equal to angry. But what he would also go through something which I much later realized was anxiety. So he was his he would his again, I feel he would there's a sense of violence, but that was to himself versus that anger was taken out on us as well. But never as much as on himself, you know, if I can put it as nicely as possible. So I just did not really like I was just angry with my father, you know, like I think all young men in our country are. And I wanted to be the kind of husband. I mean, everything my father's like, I was always like, here's my profile of my father, I'm going to be absolute opposite of him in every possible way. I'm going to be the best husband, I'm going to be the best son, I'm going to be the best, you know, brother, I'm going to be the best, you know, caretaker of a home, I'm going to,"

You know, in that sense, like he was, he was not again, with my mother, he was I think he was just as patriarchal as every Indian man is, let me put it that way, you know, which used to get me even angrier, because I'd be like, why are you, you raise us, you do all this work in home, why do you still have to like, work for him? You're not you don't have to work for him. You can you work for the you're working for your home. I get it, but you have to work for him as well. But, but he was, you know, while and and for for whatever it's worth, he's never like, while he's been angry at us, and he's might have raised his hands at me and my brother, but he's never like, you know, with my mother, he's never really been violent in a domestic violence way, you know, and, but he as I said, he just had a lot of, you know, anxiety issues, which I much later found out and and seeing him, I had a sense of, you know, and I feel very now that I look back, I feel really bad about that I used to have a sense of a weak man. It's not a very strong man, you know, whereas I feel like it does take a lot of strength for him to break out of the family that he came from, you know, and go on to his whole family, you know, nobody else has been, so to speak successful in his family, you know, he was from Panipat and his parents and I mean, both our parents are from, you know, what is now Pakistan, Punjab in Pakistan, you know, crossed over, grandparents crossed over, one settled in, you know, Karnal eventually and one settled in Panipat eventually. And, but he broke out of his, you know, he and he did it on his own. There was no support system. He did like the, you know, the clerk exam or, you know, whichever the banking exam is, and then rose his ranks. And now he is, you know, chairman at ICC in Bahrain. And, you know, he's spoken at United Nations on him. He's one of the biggest names in trade finance, even though he's still like thinks he's nothing, you know, but it has, it's been very, I mean, much later, I've looked back and thought that, you know, I mean, he was much stronger man without the support system. You know, my, my mother was the biggest support system, but he'd grown up without a system which, which then made him so angry at his own life, that all the things that he would do or, you know, he just didn't have the emotional quotient that my mother had. And I, earlier I used to blame him for him for it. And then after a lot of therapy, I realized that, you know, it's not his fault either, is it? So growing up, I had very, you know, clear rules of, you know, what my mother's supposed to, my mother is what my father is. But much later in life, I have, I was very angry with my father for many, many, many, many years. Now I'm not, now I empathize, now I understand, now I feel bad for the way that I've treated him as a son, even though, you know, I'm still angry at the way he treated my mother. But at the same time, I recognize it's not, it's, it's conditioning. And it's, you know, he had anxiety, he had conditioning, he tried so hard to, he's the reason why I have whatever privilege I have today. He's the reason why our family has whatever privilege we have today. That, you know, and we were good children. And that's a, let me be honest, like my brother and I, we never, you know, we recognize that our parents have worked hard to get their money. We've never spent up like, never, we didn't even ask for a gift on our birthdays. We were just happy, like being with each other, you know, and, and it's only like in my 30s, my father has started gifting me things, which has been like a, like, okay, what do I do with this now? I have an iPad. Thank you. But, but, you know, so yeah, I just, I just, and on the other hand, when I, my anger with my father also translated to anger with my mother during my 20s, because, because she wanted me to again, break out of our circumstances in some way, she just put a lot of pressure on me, which again, I don't begrudge her for anymore. But at that time, it just, it drove me into a certain kind of, again, depression, if I can say so, where I was trying after my, I mean, I'm sure we'll get into that. But I did after, even though I was someone who was writing such, such an early age, you know, I remember this very distinct conversation, which is not even a conversation that my parents would remember. But we were at our first ever family holiday in life, you know, so after I finished 12th, my father took us for this SOTC Europe tour, you know, and there was, and my father is always this person, which I'm saying he's always also been like, anytime I had interviews, he'd drive me to those interviews. So he's also been like, I always looked at him in such such a sharply negative point of view that I could never see the efforts he made in different ways. But I remember like, again, my father showing off to everyone saying my son has written in these magazines, he's interviewed these people, look at this, look at that, he was 17 at that time. And there's this old couple that he was talking to, and the couple said, that sounds so fantastic. So is he going to now, I was in 12th, right? Is he going to an arts college? Is he, are you putting him in like Delhi in like something interesting? And my mother immediately said, no, no, that's a hobby. You know, that's not what he will do. He will, you know, be an engineer. And, and he's going to, you know, and do MBA. And, you know, and I was, it wasn't like, it's such a distinct memory for me. And much later, I remember that it's still something that hits me that I just never had an opinion or a decision in what I was ever going to do. It was just decided for me, right? Ki yehi karega. Aur maine bhi uss time socha nahi, main ka, main bhi maan gaya tha, yehi karna hai. I am going to be an engineer, you know. But I mean, I was this, whatever, bright kid who used to love writing. And I wish somebody had pointed me in the direction and said, you know what, do this. But I had to find a different path. I had to finish engineering. Then I had to leave. I mean, like after that, I got jobs. Told my parents, dekho main, I'm capable of getting jobs. After that, I came to Bombay and then started working with Hindustan Times at a very, you know, like a terrible, terrible salary for like two, two and a half years. Even during that time, my mother would keep telling me and she would say it in the, again, from a place of, you know, you're not earning money, you should really like do something where you're going to be comfortable. But for me, it was always like, you know, have some faith in me. I know there's no money right now, but I'm trying to do something of my own. You're the one person who's always given me love. Why can't you today show me that love and that trust and that support and, and, and just let me be. And that just drove like a wedge into our relationship. So for a very long time, you know, I kind of have this thing where I feel like when you are younger, your parents are always forgiving you for like being an idiot. You know, in the middle, there's a time when you grew up and your parents stop forgiving you because you're like, now you can't be needed because you are, you know, not young anymore. But because your parents have always had a certain way of behaving with you, you start, you know, also getting angry. You've always like, why not now? I'm so what I'm still your child or whatever. You still say I'm a child, but why are you getting angry? So you also get angry back, right? And then you kind of get older and then you become the opposite. You become a parent in that sense to your parents where you're just like, yeah, they're old and they don't get it as much as we do now. We need to start forgiving, right? And that's what I think happened after in my thirties where I've just like, let it all go. And I've really, you know, try to listen to my parents, try to understand them. As you very nicely said, I've tried to look at them not as parents, but as human beings and just really felt bad for the way that I was just so angry in my twenties with them. I mean, we still, my mother is still very hurt about the way that I talk about these years because she obviously has done her best to be a fantastic mother, even though it ended up pressurizing me and driving me into a sense of like real despair that my mother doesn't believe in me, you know, but I can now keep telling her that it's okay, you know, it's not your fault as well. And you need to be comfortable with that, you know, that there was a period that maybe both of us, I mean, all of us are victims of patriarchy and none of us knows any better. You know, you can get angry with your parents as much as you want, but they've been conditioned to behave in the same way from their parents and so on and so forth. You know, everybody has come from the societal conditioning. And if you are aware today, you need to have the empathy and it's empathy is not easy. It is a responsibility. It is, it's tough. It's a burden sometimes, but if you don't have it, then you know, you're never going to have, you're never going to go beyond anger into love, into compassion, into togetherness, you know. So I'm just, I'm really glad that now I see my parents differently. And I'm just a lot more grateful for what they've given me. My father for the long hours, you know, where he just, when I think about it right now, I mean, he never got to hang with his son. I, I've always felt like he didn't, my father didn't hang with me. But now I also feel like, well, he as a person, as a human being, as a man did not get to hang out with his son. You know, my mother, I would always be like, she always wanted me to be this way. And now I'm, I'm looking at it in a different way that she wanted some, she expected something from her son, which her son was pushing back on. So, so even their anger was valid or, you know, their efforts were valid, you know, in whatever they were doing. So, yeah, I feel a little, I feel like a tinge of regret in the way that I was in my 20s. But I recognize that, you know, obviously, this is just the way life is. And we got to do better now."

And what I'm also interested in is that you were able to after a period of time, shrug off that layer where, you know, they're human beings for you, they're not playing a role anymore. So you can see them in that new light and can evaluate them in that new light. Were they able to shrug off those layers, not just with regard to you, but perhaps with regard to yourself?

        "message": "Great question. With my father, not so much. Because my father, he's still like, you know, I don't know if he'll ever hear this. He totally hears most of the things I do. So I'm also now a little worried that he's going to hear this. But, you know, I'd love to have a conversation with my father someday, you know, and I want to, I want to just have an honest conversation with him, just get to know him better. Now, the thing about him, he also talks a lot. OK, so he's also someone who's very absent minded in how much he speaks. So he speaks a lot about his life anyway, but not in a meaningful way. Right. So I may know, I know every story of his life a hundred times over, because that's anytime he meets anybody at any party, he will repeat those stories. At the same time, I just feel like there's nothing I know beyond the surface of these stories. So I'd love to have like a meaningful conversation with my father someday where, you know, we can be friends and we can talk about each other. But, you know, I just feel like he never matured into the EQ that you should have to be able to have a compassionate conversation with someone you love, someone who loves you. So he just has just been, distance has been his, and I feel like that's true for all fathers, right? Distance becomes their thing. I don't know what to say, but that's what they're, that's the way of life, you know, being distant from each other. You work, I have to work on my thing, you work on your thing. And every once in a while we will call each other and then I will hand the phone to your mother, which is, you know, like every time my father calls me, the first reaction is I get scared. Like, why is my father calling me? Kuch ho toh nahi hain, you know, dar la jata hai mujhe. And if he calls me and he's just like, how are you? I'm like, why? Like, what happened? That's my question. I don't like, I'm fine. What? I'm like, what happened? You know, that thing he might sometimes just, so I, I've still had that place with my father now after retirement has also wanted to like, give me a hug. And I'm just like, what? When do you want hugs? When he gives me a hug, when I give him a hug, even with somebody who kind of now talks a lot about things like empathy, I get so uncomfortable. I don't know, you know, when my father gives me a hug, I'm still like, I don't know what to do about it. I'm just like closed. I'm like, this is weird. This is not natural. Even though it should be the most natural thing ever, right? For a child to be hugged by their parent. So I feel bad about that. I want, I would love to change that. I don't know how to, I'm still struggling with it. On the other hand, with my mother, I'm really fortunate that, you know, we have gone through every cycle of our relationship where we've gotten really angry with each other. I stopped talking to her almost for a year in between. And I was so angry with her not supporting me and not seeing me go down a path where I was very, and despaired that she wanted me to do an MBA. I remember like, this one time when I was at MTV, I had, my show was announced at 25. I had become the creator and producer, the youngest creator and producer at MTV to create a fiction show. I was going to be given that those credits, you know, and for anybody who's 25 to get that was just an insane thing in India, you know, and I called my mother and I said, you know what, they've announced my show. I'm only producing it. I'm also going to be credited as created by, you know, and she heard me out and she's just like, I can't forget that. She's just like, that's so good to hear. That's so great to hear. Does that, but does that mean you will not do an MBA? And I'm like, I just told you that at 25, I am going to be making a show of my own on national television. And your thing is still stuck on. But I mean, that's parents, right? Like, and because that's the only way that she knows that people become successful, because that's the only she's, she just didn't have, you know, she didn't have the internet to begin with. And she did not have, you know, enough resources would tell her that, you know, there are possibilities outside of engineering and MBA for a young man to be able to still find his voice and his career and make it. And until I joined Yashraj, I remember like the, for me, the, my greatest moment in life so to speak is when my mother came to Bombay and I started working in Yashraj and I had done pretty well over there. So I'd gotten a cabin and I'd been promoted to GM. So I'd got a double promotion, got, became GM at YRF and my mother had come down to Bombay. So I just asked her to come to the Yashraj office. I took her through, I showed her around the whole Yashraj campus, took her then to my floor, you know, got her to come to my cabin and said, this is my cabin. And then she entered and I got her to sit down to a picture with it. I'm like, are you feeling happy now? And she said, yes, I'm feeling very happy. And then I was like, okay, now it's like achieved, tick mark, you know, just the fact that my mother is now finally like happy with where I am in life. But at that time it was tough, you know, but we went through a lot, you know, we, we, you know, and, and I mean, that was how that happened in the marriage, which is a whole other thing that has happened, you know, we, there was a lot of misunderstanding between me and my mother and I, you know, and, but eventually I just started. And again, I think anxiety and therapy have been like God given gifts to me where I could tap into, you know, a lot more of my, you know, empathy or my emotions to be able to look at my family in different lights, you know, and go beyond the anger, you know, and over the last six, seven years, I have had such a beautiful, friendly relation with my mother. She's my closest, one of my closest friends, I would say, if not my closest friend, my wife is my closest friend. If she hears that I said something, otherwise she'll get angry."

And I've not seen other people of her age or of her generation try that hard. She has tried so hard. I am so inspired. And I, I look up to her so much. She has done everything. She realized that her relationship with both her children was getting stuck at a place. We were not, wasn't going beyond that. And she did everything. She said, tell me what I have to do. And she did it. She's like, you know, I mean, all, all parents, I feel after a certain point, you know, because of the patriarchal conditioning and everything, they have these certain, you know, whether they're homophobic, Islamophobic, all of these, you know, issues, just conditioned into them. She's gone beyond them. She's like tried when you would tell her that this is wrong, she would hear it. We'll say that, you know, this is misogynist. She will fight back a little bit, but then she would be like, okay, explain why. And she's heard it. And she's been, she's, I mean, it's incredible the way she has carried herself, the grace, the, she's the light of my life. I'll be very honest. She's like, you know, I'm my biggest fear in life, honestly, is that I don't know who I'll be when she's gone. I just don't know. I don't know. Like she's, she's really carried the family. She's carried, you know, yeah, she's even with all the pressure she put on me, I can't, you know, I can't, I'm just far more grateful about the kind of values she's inculcated in me. There are still a lot of things in me that I, I do get angry that, you know, it came from mother, but like, it's, you know, she's done everything to, you know, compensate for any time she has not been, you know, kind to us or not been like understanding or a good friend and just a parent in that sense. So, yeah, I'm, you know, as I said, in that, during my wedding, like, it was one of those things where, you know, we had many things happen, but like, long story short, we had reached that place where my parents and my wife's parents were just at loggerhead, so to speak, because they're from Assam, we're from the Punjabis, just ridiculous things started coming up, you know, like, why are we having this in the, they wanted to do it in the daytime, because that's how they do it, and we want to do it in the night time, because that's how we do it, you know, they wanted non-veg, my parents were like, suddenly, my mother, who's been, while my family is now vegetarian and whatnot, but my mother, who would encourage my younger brother to eat chicken, because it gives strength, even though I'm not going to eat it, suddenly I was like, no, we will never have non-veg on our wedding, like, what is this, like ridiculous things, so, you know, and I remember, like, things came to such a head that I was just again getting really, like, I was very frustrated in my wedding, because I feel like I was, I was getting myself married, like, because my parents anyway live, they don't live in the country, so I was just very, again, just my father is just, doesn't know what to do, he's just like a tourist to my marriage, he's come as a guest, no idea, what's happening, what's not happening, the whole wedding, the whole location, I got everything done, my mother's tried her best, but she also doesn't live in India, beyond a point, what can she do, so I was also very, I was like, I'm getting married now, you need to just, you know, I know that you have more sense and more love than this, you've been a good mother to me, why are you making such a big thing out of such a small stupid thing, and then she said during that time, the first time I think we've had an honest conversation, where she told me that, you know, you've always done what you wanted, you've always, and I didn't say anything, which is lies, she told me lots of things, but she's like, you finish engineering and then you decide to go to Hindustan Times, you've said that you're gonna marry a Punjabi girl and then you went and married an Aziz girl, you said you'll not do media, you did that, everything has been like against what we wanted, but we didn't say anything, but like this is the, and then she said this thing that, you know, again, just has remained in my head where she said that, you know, but when it comes to the marriage, right, that's the last time your parents get to have a say in your life, after that it's your life, after that where will we come, you know, but this is the thing that we get to do, and this is the last thing we get to do, so, you know, if you're not letting us do this, then like, you know, I just feel like I don't have a stake in your life, and I don't know what to do as a mother, and I just, that honest thing that happened, and I was just like, man, if you had said this earlier, all this wouldn't have happened, so I just said, we will do what you want, and then we did everything, I mean, we did everything, we said like what functions do you want, I convinced her parents, I just made sure, we did like three versions of the marriage, we went to Assam to kind of, you know, to be with Daisy's parents and appease her family, went to Bahrain again, did a whole function for my family, in the wedding, we said what all we have to do, we will do everything, you just, you know, you want to do this, we will do it your way, you know, don't feel like, it means so much to me, everything that you have done for me, so, that is the moment I think where I started looking at her not as my mother, but like as a human being, and I feel like that's one of the first times that I realized that, you know, where I have been, you know, I just realized that, you know, this person's son is getting married, you know, my mother's son is getting married, and she should also have a stake in that, right? Why am I making such a big deal out of it? So yeah, I think it's been a journey to understanding my parents, but I'm, yeah, I'm more grateful than, you know, regretful of the things that have happened so far."

And in general, the great human tragedy has been that the illusion never lifts, the layers never go, which is why I was interested if you, you know, managed to speak about them later about all of this, because I think most of us who get on these grooves and live out that quiet desperation, we can't express it, we can't acknowledge it even to ourselves. And we are passing it on. Like one of my favorite poems by Philip Larkin has these great lines, man hands on misery to man, it deepens like a coastal shelf. And that's such a lovely poetic image, it deepens like a coastal shelf, right. And of course, the poem is trying to convince people not to have children. For just this reason, man hands on misery to man, it deepens like a coastal shelf. And one of the things that you've written eloquently about is firstly, these traps of getting trapped in these roles. And also the fact that this might be the one generation, you know, especially Gen Z digital natives exposed to the world growing up on the internet, who have access to other truths, who don't have to, you know, follow these lanes that are laid out for them by patriarchy or by conservative Indian society or any of that. And you've spoken about this a lot, and I'll put all those links in the show notes also. But I'd also like you to talk about how your realization of this evolved about these strict roles, these lanes that are laid out, tell me a little bit about how your realization of this evolved and then going through time, you know, like, because once you realize it, you can't unsee it, you know, it's absolutely, it's never unseen again. And you will see it in every face that you look into, you will see it, right, you will, you will hear it in their stories."

She should. My mother used to be a professor of economics, even she had an MA in economics at Kurukshetra University, and then she had taught it to students over there when she was 23, 24. She's a wonderful painter. She's I mean, she's one of the smartest I'm telling you, she's like, it's insane how multifaceted she is. You know, tell her anything and she'll do it, you know, I remember this one moment, you know, where we were at this really random place called workshop called born to excel, where these folks had come to kind of give young people how to the methods of excelling or whatever is a summer course that you are getting enrolled in. And you know, the first time he asked the question, the man over the workshop, and he was like, Well, I have a question that if there is a let's see which young person answers, you know, and there is a bucket, and in that bucket, there is, you know, a ball, how do you take it out without your hand, you know, and, and, and then everybody was like, giving all kinds of answers. Nobody's like, you know, you can't turn it over, or you have to keep it in etc. And then a mother was the one who's like, when you put water into it, and then it'll come up on its own. And, you know, in this case, like, yes, that's the right answer. Never got this answer. My mother is so sharp, you know, so she's, she's very creative. She writes poems at now also, she's like at 66 now. And she has these wonderful poems for my birthday, she will write a poem and narrate it by my wife's birthday. So beautiful, you know, and so yeah, I kind of knew always that, you know, there is, it's not right. But, you know, and I just wanted to be the opposite of that didn't realize that genders. If anybody would ask me, what is identity? You know, it's a question that now, I think a lot about, especially in the world we live in right now, how identity has become so, you know, become such a big issue. And how we have now reframed every, you know, our identities into nationalism, right? But when you ask, you know, when we were growing up and you ask, what's your identity? You wouldn't I mean, I don't know, Indian was maybe one thing you would say, you know, I would say engineer, because all the boys are engineers, you know, be taken in computer engineering. That's my identity. You know, somebody would say a writer, somebody say artist, you know, those were the ways that you would define yourself, right? I would never think of gender as an identity that like, like when you ask a woman this, what's your identity, she will say woman, because every day of her life, she's reminded that you're a woman through the way our systems are structured, but men are not, would never say, although now they are saying because of I think, in a post-media world, every man suddenly has become more aware of their identity, which is a whole thing, but, but before that, it was never the thing that, you know, I'm a man that was never it, it was always designation when I'm a CEO, or I'm a, you know, again, engineer, I'm the owner of these houses, or you know, I have this much property, your numbers would define your identity, as a young as a man, and you think about it, it all comes down to your reduced your worth is reduced to numbers. It's, it's about how many marks you got, how many trophies you won, how many extracurriculars you participated in, you know, everything, everything is monetizable, everything is, you know, has to have a worth attached to it. You can't even have as a hobby, I remember like when you're going up, and I'd read like a lot and you know, and then sometimes we like instead of reading this, why don't you read your school textbooks, because that's the way you will get more marks, you know, you'd play something, you know, if you're, if instead of doing this, why don't you do this thing and take part in this competition. So even a hobby needed to be something that is a is in service of a victory or an achievement you needed to have, you know, and then how many of these achievements did you have was what would define you as a man, then salaries became a thing, then you know, then packages, CTCs, then the number of houses that you have the number of cars, you have everything, everything. It's all been like a, you know, we've just been reduced to numbers as identities, right? And we don't think about that. That's just how it is. That's just normalized. And and but somewhere I kind of subconsciously or unconsciously started recognizing or started feeling that, you know, everything that I'm going through, as somebody who was fighting this idea that after engineering, I don't want to do this. I'd gotten jobs in, you know, I was in NID Gurukshetra, like Mahima, and, you know, I was also taking part in all that. So I realized in the first six months that I can't do this. And that's a very big thing for someone who used to be a really like, I was a good student in school, like I cared about computing, computer science, I used to code, I used to enjoy coding. And then six months of NID Gurukshetra and while it is somewhat also a reflection of the college, while I don't think it's entirely that, I just feel it's just engineering as a setup, you know, and you go in there and six months, you're just like, what the hell is going on. And when you realize that you can't do this, then you have three and a half years to figure out what to do. You know, I feel like that's like a, I always joke and say this that, you know, in the US, you'd have people would give after 12th standard, you know, to their children, a gap year. You go and have a gap year, travel the world, find out who you are. In India, there is a gap year for boys, engineering college, go for engineering, then you do what you want to do in life, right? So I was, it was that on me, I went there and then I was like, okay, now I have this time and I don't want to quit because again, I'm a man, so I can't just quit. So I will go through this. I will somehow, I'll do what it needs to pass and I'll do what it needs to get exams. I know that I'm not interested in this anymore, but what can I do with my time over here? So I started, you know, again, doing more writing work, I start, you know, there's a magazine that I got to be a part of that I created a magazine, a college magazine out of the last entity and last version of what it was. It used to be a paper, you know, like two papers on a wall stuck as that was the college magazine culture. I created a whole, you know, 30-40 pager proper magazine. I got into Vishwanathan Anand with Ranbir Kapoor and said like, this is your magazine now, like, here's what it can be. I used to, I mean, again, with the official college magazine, became the editor like Mahima as the one after so, you know, and all of and at college, I kind of just did everything I could. I took part in every extracurricular thing. Now it's reverse because I talk about identity also, as I said earlier, you know, I used to be someone who is to always be the outside looking in. Suddenly, as somebody who had a little bit of, I mean, I became aware of my privilege at that time. So it is a digression. I'll go back into your question. But NIT Gurushetra is when I immediately, instantly became aware of my privilege. It is a and anybody who knows the way NITs function, you have 50% quota from the same state and 50% of the rest of the country. So there was everybody from every place. And most people were, you know, were not, so to speak, that privileged or, you know, that came, came from a certain kind of, and I recognize this on the very first conversation I had in a mess, which, you know, I had no idea what is caste, you know, and as they say that, you know, if you're upper caste, you don't know what it is, right. But I never knew and, and I remember the first conversation I had with, you know, someone in the mess and the boy said, I asked him, like, what do you do, I mean, which, which, you know, where are you from, he said, Panipat, oh great, I'm from Karnal, great, something in common. Then like, what are you doing over here? I'm doing engineering, computers, he's doing whatever electric, electronics, mechanical, okay, fine, you know, we'll not the same thing, not the same course, but whatever. And then I'd asked him, and this is my always my regular normal follow up question, what does your father do? That's just the question that everybody asks, you know, or at least I assumed that, because I was always asked to me. And you know, when I was in Dubai and Bahrain, and that's how we kind of like, what does your father do? You buy my father is working here, my father's working there, whatever it is. And here the answer was that, well, he's works, he works in a garage. In my, you know, my upper caste mind, I was just like, oh, he owns the garage. He's like, no, no works in it. And then I was like, in my again, I can't fathom I'm just like, so, like, does he have like this car, big cars, and he works with big cars and because he's like, no, he repairs bicycles. And I was suddenly I was like, wait, what? Like, you know, I mean, it was such a big that everything I used to feel about class, you know, before I came, because I was the one outsider looking in into these rich folks in these schools, where everybody where they would talk about like, what do you do after class? So I have like a, you know, I have an instructor who comes in to play the, you know, piano and teach me the piano. Whereas I had like this one keyboard, you know, I was like, yeah, I play basketball with my friend. At that time, whatever we didn't have that many courts, you know, it was like, you know, and even the reference point they would have of English films, I started watching English films much later. I was always Bollywood, I was like, what are these reference points I just didn't fit in. And suddenly I realized now my reference points were suddenly like, not the same as the ones and most people in NID Kurukshetra. And that privilege that that sense of that understanding immediately, you know, it was now like, suddenly I was the guy in NID Kurukshetra who was who was from the outside, whereas like people would look at it and again, that's, I mean, it's sad or I don't know what it is, but a lot of kids would just kind of, you know, give me respect purely because I knew English well, or they would talk to me with a certain sense of like, I didn't get bullied as much. I mean, when I say bullied, I didn't get ragged as much, you know, in college, well, I got bullied in school. It's a different story. But in college, I didn't get ragged because people were just like, this guy's an NRI and he's well spoken. And I would dance and I would take part in cultural activities. And suddenly I was like, oh, he's a cool kid. And because I was nice and just I'm able to talk to people were just like, you know, affable to talk to people were just like, you know, okay, let's let him go, let's not say anything to him, whatever. So my privilege also saved me from where all the other kids from my batch would get beaten up. They'd have, you know, half their faces, you know, with blue marks and whatnot. I was so I just started recognizing. So I've had this really bizarre incidents in NID Kurukshetra where, you know, I'll tell you a funny one. And, you know, it'll also give context to some of the conversations that, you know, we're having on gender. The first and this is a true story, okay. The first day I was in a classroom in NID Kurukshetra and people were asking where all teachers would ask you, tell your roll number, where you from, etc, etc. So I said, like, you know, whatever roll number 20, 25 and I was from Bahrain and somebody said little later, a girl said they're from Dubai. I said, oh, cool. So after the class, I went to the girl, I said, you're from Dubai, I'm from Bahrain, we should like, you know, exchange numbers or whatnot, right? She was sitting next to a girl, you know, who was from Faridabad. And I said, where are you from? She said, I'm from Faridabad. I said, great. So can we have like, can I have your number also, we'll just keep in touch. And now she gave the number, but I thought that she was a little hesitant. Now in my head, you know, like, in Bahrain, all the boys and girls, we all used to talk, there was never like a whole thing, which I never realized that NID is like a big thing for a guy to ask a girl a number and like, take it and whatnot. I didn't realize all of this, okay? At night, I have to go, I'm in my room. And there's a knock. We used to live it to first year, live it to roommates, there's a knock on my door. I open the door and there's this big Haryanvi Jat guy, you know, with his four or five other all well built, strong, good looking folks. And then he just aggressively asked me, look, what do you think he is? I'm like, who are you? What happened? I'd never seen him before. Maybe I've seen him before, but I don't know his context. He's like, do you think he's Bond? I'm just like Bond, I'm thinking chemistry, covalent bond, you know, I'm like Bond? And he's like, do you think you're James Bond? I was like, no, bro, what are you talking about? He's like, will you take a girl's number? And I'm just like, first of all, I didn't even recognize, he's like, how did you take her number? I was like, okay, what happened? He's like, do you know that the girl from Faridabad, one of the guys said the girl from Faridabad is his girlfriend. Do you know that? I was like, I had no clue, you know, how would I know? And I'm okay, delete the number, man, I was just being friendly, I'm not like pursuing her or whatever. So he's like, delete number, delete the number, delete it, you know, he's like, don't you don't mess with the girl from Faridabad, I'll come and beat you up. That was his whole thing. And all these guys gave me like, this is your last first and last warning, you know, and I was like, dude, sorry. And I was like, I'm a coward, no, I'm from Bahrain, I have a whole cushioned life, suddenly in Bahrain, etc, etc. I was a big fat kid, you know, who also wore these loose clothes, I was like fully like, what's happening to me? So I said, sorry, sorry, please delete the number, I'm not a hero, please go away. So he went away. And then sometime and I was just like, my roommates were like, my roommates were also from the Middle East. So we kind of had figured out, okay, let's live together. And they were also looking at me like, you know, do you not realize that, you know, in this place, etc, etc, you can't be so open with girls, you know, people like, you have to be really smart about it, I was like, okay, I'll try and be like really smart about it. And then sometime later, this guy comes back. And this time he's alone. So I was like, bro, forgive me, I didn't know, I did not realize that. He's like, you tell me, how did you get your number? And I'm like, I mean, how did you get it, I said, sorry, he's like, no, no, I'm asking how did you get it? Explain it to me. How do you get a girl's number? I said, what do you want to do, you know, he's like, I want her number, but she's your girlfriend. And his actual words were, but don't tell her, she's my girlfriend. I'm like, what is going on in this college? So I said, well, I just asked her, man, you have to just be like polite and like, she gave it. He's like, explain it to me. And somehow during then, I mean, this was the first such incident. And from that point, for whatever it's for, whatever reasons, the Haryanvi kids who would not very well fit in with all the other kids from different states. And there was a lot of rivalry and I mean, you know, a lot of anger, a lot of fights that have happened in our college, etc. For whatever reasons, I got a little bit of respect because I, again, maybe polished or whatever in Polish, when I say again, not in a, in just the way that I would speak a certain way, I was like a, which was, which was this understanding of what, what it meant to be, what, what your Indian society needs you to be after a certain point of time. So I was a prototype of like, this is what happens after four years of engineering college. And somebody who is already knows English, already has, quote unquote, self confidence, already can talk to girls, already can like write, you know, so and, and for whatever it's worth, I was not an asshole, you know, and that was something that, you know, everybody found like a very unique thing about me, whereas other NRE kids typically were seem to be as assholes. I mean, no offense, but that's just how it was. And so suddenly, all the boys, Haryanvi boys kind of also gave me the liberty and the respect to kind of talk to them, whenever there was something that they were doing wrong, they would come to me to ask me about like, you know, aise kaise karte hain, aise kaise karte hain, very generously. And I really like respect that, that, you know, there were people who would ask ki jana, ab mujhe ladki saath, I need to ask her out, how do I do it? And you know, and I'm just like, I've had one girlfriend before this, I'm not like a, I'm not hitch, you know, mujhe ithara bhi nahi bata, I'm right now, I was, you know, going through a heartbreak, theek hai, but whatever, I'm helping. On the other hand, whenever there was somebody who would be rude, obnoxious, inappropriate, which I saw a lot of, I saw so many young boys, just be filthy with girls. And in their heads, that's just how they thought. You know, you flirt, unko lagta tha, flirt karna hota hai ki ladki attitude rakhti hain na, to as a boy, what you need to do is you need to call and give them gaalis. To gaali deke na, to usko, apne aap jo na, wo bole ki usko samajh aata hai ki ladka bhi na, uske andar te se zyada attitude hai. Aur jab baat chal jayega ki you have more attitudes, wo pighal jayegi, and then she'll be like, okay, this is the guy I want. Because this is the guy who'll protect me, because he has more attitude than me. This is the way they used to think. Girls would change their phone numbers, they would find a new phone number, leak it, and then everybody would have, everybody would call in, everybody would send these insanely dirty messages, and I would watch this with horror. I'm like, how are you doing this, right? And again, none of this right now coming from a place where I didn't know what feminism is or whatever it is. Just, I thought it's just human decency, right? Like, don't be such an asshole. And I'd go up to, like, these kids. And again, I'm not just saying that they are only from Haryana, they're all kinds of places that people would become, who would giving me that respect of like, ki theek hai, tum mujhe bol sakte ho. I remember this one time where, like, this guy said, in, in a, in a truth or dare game, among a classroom, in a canteen, asked a girl to say, what is your bra size? And I was like, how? And I just got so, I was so irritated, I was like, shut up. That's not what you say. And then it became awkward and like, whatever, you know, and then later also, he didn't say anything to me at that time. Raat ka again, he came to me, he's a different guy, came to me in the night, he says, dekh mai teri aizad karta hu, tu jo bolega, main sununga. Tu mujhe samjhayega na, ki yeh nahi karna chahiye, main nahi karunga."

        "message": "So I've come very close to getting beaten up by these guys, but just somehow just been let off. But I understood like there is, you know, and in that college is where I got the first sense of like, the deep, deep patriarchal conditioning that happens. And you know, again, they were not, these are not evil people, right? They were not, it's not that they were bad human beings. It's just that that's how they were conditioned. Most young boys that I've met at that time, from whichever part of the country, unfortunately had a certain idea of what women are and what women should be and, you know, what we should be doing with them and how we should be thinking of them. And again, I'm not saying that I was not, as a, you know, young horny teenager, even I used to objectify girls as a teenager, etc. But at the same time, I was not like, I just felt like this was way too extreme, ki theek hai tum, you're thinking about them and talking about them with your best friend, like, oh, I like this girl and whatever. That's one thing. But like, you know, getting as part of a community, people used to watch porn together, yaar. That was the weirdest for me, like, poor community, 6 log, 10 log na saath mein aate na porn saath mein dekh rahe hain, ek kamadi ke andar hai, I'd just be like, kaise kar rahe ho tum, yeh kya chal raha hai? So I was just, I was an alien in that world. I would just be like, this is, this is weird. But I realized that there are certain gender dynamics, you know, and again, the understanding of privilege that I had, that clearly there is, you know, something that I seem to have an understanding of that others don't. And maybe, you know, I can try in whatever manner to help, you know, without looking down, without having judgment, without shaming anybody who thinks like this, just try to talk them, talk to them and help them understand what, why, what they're doing and why they're doing it is wrong. I again did not know what this is conditioning the society, yeh sab mujhe nahi pata tha. Just as a, you know, again, just as a, I would say a decent person, a decent human being who later when I realized was, had that, like empathy is also privilege, you know, I genuinely feel that. I feel like, you know, having that awareness of, of, you are not born quote unquote, you know, with again, I, I, I'm using this word again and I, and I want to use it in those setting of those quotes, sophisticated, you know, that there's an idea that every, you know, parent has for their young Indian child that, you know, if you wear a certain kind of clothes, if you have a certain kind of a way of speaking, if you know English in a certain way, if you, you know, your hair is done in a certain way, if you, if the, that's what a sophisticated young Indian boy should be like, you know, and it was, and I started recognizing that this is where earlier I used to look at maybe other kids like that, that he is more sophisticated than me, now I understand that people are looking at me and saying that I am more than them, so where I was feeling misfit there, I was feeling misfit here too, but in a very different way, where I was fully aware of the class and caste privilege that I had without knowing these terms at that time, and that's where I think in many ways my, you know, understanding of gender really started from, and then, I mean, I started dating a girl over there and the kind of shit that, you know, we've gone through in college, I can't get too much into it beyond the point again, because it is my wife's story, I don't want to, but we went through some really horrible times in college where, you know, there were rumors spread about us and whatever it is, just really nasty stuff, and I was just, I just couldn't understand why would, you know, why would society behave in this manner, you know, what have we done to any of you, like, where is this coming from, why would you say something so shameful and so hurtful about other people, you know, when it comes and break it down into, well, this is what a man does, this is what a woman does, so clearly there is something here, like, where is this, what is happening, so the culture only, I just kind of, so where I was fitting in from a lens of, you know, where I was finding myself at ease in a bunch of people who are definitely who I seemed closer to, in terms of like, if I would have never gone to the Middle East, these are the kind of kids I would have exactly been like, right, so I was a little bit more comfortable and at ease with my friends over there than I've ever been with anybody in the Middle East. At the same time, after a point of time, because of the cultural differences, you know, that because I'd spent that time there, I still started realizing there's a big vast difference in the way everybody's been conditioned, where my conditioning allowed me to have the privilege of looking at, you know, people beyond the lenses of gender and as human beings, and as stories, and versus as like, you know, this is a boy, this is a girl, this is what they do, you know, I just, with everybody else, there was a very clear divide, and in that divide, boys behaved in a certain way and girls behaved in a certain way, and it was, it was a divide. So I went through some really tough times, again, there's just some stuff that I'd rather not get into, but, you know, in college, and then when I got into Bombay, again, it was like a whole shift, Bombay, now, I've been in Kurukshetra for 4 years now, and if a girl is sitting at a place, where a guy comes and sits next to her, they'd be like, oh, that guy likes that girl, literally, you like her, you've sat in the same seat as she's at, like, what is this, what, what are you talking about, Mahima spoke about like the, the hostile time, you know, times, right, like, I used to feel so terrible about the fact that, you know, like, I get to be in that college, and at the very minimum, I mean, I didn't go to the library much, let me be honest, but you know, the fact that there are people who had access to the library throughout the night, you know, till 12 o'clock, and girls had to 5.30, 6 o'clock, go back to the, never had, like, you know, the liberty or the freedom to explore, you know, outside of just the X number of hours they were, you know, in college, and it was just so unfair, you know, the whole system I had to drop and I was also coming from a place, I like this girl, why do I have to drop her at 6 o'clock, I want to spend more time with her. But yeah, but and then I came to Bombay, and then suddenly, like my, I was in an HT, where I was one of two guys and in a, in a team where everybody else was a woman. And suddenly, like where I had been fighting a certain kind of patriarchal conditioning and misogyny and in the way that things were structured in Kurukshetra, it was the absolute opposite over here. And then I had to, again, rewire and kind of be like, Acha, now I can't think like that. I need to think in a different way, again, I need to like, you know, be more comfortable, I was not comfortable for the longest time, I couldn't hug girls, it was such a it became such a big issue for me, like, it became so awkward, I just did not. I don't I just don't know, like people girls would come and hug every, you know, everyone in like, in Bombay, this is very cool, and your friends and doesn't matter, right. But I was just at freeze, I'd be like, wait, you know, someone's guilty, someone give me a kiss, I just be like, what the hell happened? Because four years of Kurukshetra conditioned me that deeply to like, look at it as like a problem, you know, and if you have your own girlfriend, you have your own partner, that's one thing. But the moment you are in a, you know, system of people, you have to have boundaries. So all of this really ultimately came down to two things. It's a long winded answer, but two things have happened. One is, as I said, and again, I think we might get deeper into it was mental health, you know, which is at 30, I got I was diagnosed with clinical anxiety. And a lot of my therapy ultimately ended up being about gender, you know, my till that point, I had never thought of my identity as a man ever. You should ask me what I said, I could have given you x number of answers, but the answer would never be a man. And in my in my therapy sessions, I realized that everything that had happened in my life, every decision that I had made was because I was a man. Every decision I'd made wasn't for no other reason. The reason that I had to go to engineering college was because I'm a man. The reason that I had to, you know, it was such a big fight with me and my parents, when I had to, you know, be when I had to take up something else outside of engineering when I had to take up Hindustan Times MTV, you know, my parents wouldn't understand because I was a man because they had a certain and I had to do MBA, I've studied, I've given CAT, I've given GMATS, you know, I used to get up at four o'clock every morning after point in time while I was studying, working at Hindustan Times to go to and to do mock tests and whatnot. Because I was just like, I don't know, I was in despair. I didn't know what else to do. I was like, I'll do my work. And in that work for that matter, just to tell you again, at 22, 23, I've interviewed everyone Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, A. R. Rahman, you name it, all the big folks at 22, 23, I've done it. So I was outperforming everywhere. But there was never enough. It was never enough. It was always about the fact that if you do MBA, you'll get this much money. So I realized that so much, even though now I was, I'd come to Yashraj and I'd got a bunch of, you know, touchwood success at YRF, where I was in a very comfortable position. I'd gotten everything that, you know, there's a middle class checklist, you know, you shouldn't have a designation, you shouldn't have a cabin, you know, you shouldn't have so much money in the bank, you shouldn't have a car, etc. I'd got all of that and that was by 30. And then when I reached there, the question then came to be like, now I've done it. Now what? And I couldn't, I didn't have an answer. Because what happens when you hit those milestones that you've been trying to hit all your life? There is no answer. There are, there's just more milestones to go to. And then I was just like, is that it? There's this quote, I think, I don't know who it is by, right, like, I hope, say it's by Jim Carrey that, I don't know if it's by him, but that I hope everyone gets the fame and money, all the fame and money that they want so that they know it's not the answer, you know. So I did get whatever, you know, level of what I wanted, the middle class checklist. And then I realized that I'm unhappy still. I'm not happy. In fact, my unhappiness, after all the legitimate success that I was seeing with my work at Yash Raj, I was just, I felt like I was in a machine, in a simulation where I'm every morning getting up, going to work, you know, in this traffic, you know, sitting in my desk, working on something that somebody else, a corporation, even if it was Yash Raj films that I have the best time working there, I was still working on something that somebody else might want from me. There is, I was doing it in the service of getting somebody else a certain amount of money for an ambition that somebody else may have had somewhere. What was I doing for myself? What was I doing? You know, did I even know what myself is? You know, do I even know, like, if I didn't have, if I didn't just run from one milestone to another, if I didn't just go from one day to the next without ever having, I don't think Amit in my entire life, I have quote unquote chilled on a weekend in my entire life so far. I used to fill my Sundays and Saturdays up. I'd go teach on the weekends, you know, in Jai Hind, in Churchgate, you know, because I was like, weekends are for, you know, I mean, I have time, what am I going to do with this time? I need to fill it up with more work. I was at one point when I was working at Yash Raj, I was writing an open magazine, I was writing a Sunday Guardian, I was teaching at Jai Hind, I was hosting a show from Film Companion, I was programming from Mumbai Film Festival, I was writing something for Scholastic every year, 80 things I was doing and still I continue doing even though now I have a better sense of it, but it's so hard, I'm scaling back now Sundays I don't work at all, but it's so hard, I still get anxiety on Sundays because I don't know, you know, I feel like am I, what am I doing in that time, I need to make it productive, productivity has to be the most important thing for me, you know, why, why can't I just relax? I realized every one of these things came down to being a man, you know, every one of these things came down to gender and that just really frustrated me because I was like, I just, because the one thing that I didn't want to be was a man because of my father and you know, again, I'd grown up all these years angry at him because he was quote-unquote a man who was, you know, not a good, who's not a father, who was not a husband, who's not a, was just a man, just earning for his and just constantly and I was doing the same thing. When I was making my first show, I remember like, I, for two years, I did not speak to my friends. I did not spend time with my family. You know, my brother and I stopped talking because I was just so, it was like, if the show fails, where will I land? What will my life be? It had become such a big thing that this cannot fail and it failed very spectacularly, which was again, and I realized much later that what I went through after that a year after that was also anxiety. I just didn't have the terms for it. But at 30, when I started going through anxiety, when I was doing well, which was the next new thing, right, like I, my understanding of mental health was that when you are going through, it happens when you're going through a low phase, I was going through the best, best phase of my entire life and I was unhappy and I was empty and I was sad and I just, and I was anxious as I used to have panic attacks. I used to, you know, I got the opportunity like the, to go for, I mean, started then there was, there's a event called goalkeepers that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosts in New York in 2017. I got the opportunity to go as an India delegate, they call 300 emerging leaders from across the world. In that first year, Barack Obama was the keynote speaker, Justin Trudeau was there, Malala was there. It was insane. I was invited as a gathering of that people as, as far as you and I are sitting, I was that far, you know, just a little further from Barack Obama and, and I had so much anxiety. I was, I was shaking every day, I couldn't wake up in the mornings because I was like, they will find out that I don't know shit. They will find out that, you know, I'm an, you know, I'm, I'm not as, I don't deserve to be here. I had, I had to go to, I had to go to therapy like three times a week in the week that I was going to, I would have anxiety about everything. I remember the day this event was happening, I was in New York for the second, I mean, the first time I'd done it with my brother, with the second time ever, and I was, I was in a hotel and I was, and I couldn't get up in the morning. I just, I had such a massive, the first time I realized that this is what a panic attack, I mean, later much later I realized, I thought I was having a heart attack. I was in the bed, I couldn't get up. My heart was, it, it was all over. I just, I thought this is it, this is, I'm, this is it for me. Like it was so bad. And my first thoughts always just come down to, I wish I'd told my mother my e-banking"

        "message": "But those are the thoughts that used to come to my, my head. But it was just, I was like, this is it for me. I'm going to die in a hotel room in New York. You know, it's a nice room, but like, I'm going to die here. And then somehow after like 15, 20 minutes of trying to deal with it, I caught up and then it's like, okay, I'm still alive somehow, went there. But like the questions that started at that time was just like, what is the point of this? Why am I doing this? Why does any of this matter? And these are larger existential questions that I think everyone at some point goes through for, but for me, it really came down to the fact that my entire life was just me leading a story that was given to me by somebody else that was given to me by society, not even my parents and society and parents were given to a society, right? So I was just following the society's narrative of what a life should be like. And every fight that I had, every, every day I was angry, my relationship with my father, my relationship with my work, my relationship with my mother, my relationship with my wife, everything, every single thing was, you know, colored with patriarchy. And I tried my best to be the best possible husband to my wife. I was like, you know, so if the only time I started having weekends or caring was in Yashraj, people were like, you're the only person in Bollywood who doesn't pick up phones on Saturdays and Sundays. I was like, I'm married, I'm with my wife, I don't want to do it. Because I wanted to be the opposite of my father. So I was just like, I'm not going to be him. So I'm going to constantly just give myself that, you know, that space to be a good husband. But in trying to balance being a great person at work and being a good husband, again, it was just I was giving anxiety to myself, because I was just trying to fight the narrative throughout without realizing I'm fighting it. And then therapy and clinical anxiety when I broke, so to speak, and it got really bad. And again, it was so much stigma, because again, when in 2015, 16, who knows who was pocket speaking on mental health, you know, especially among men. So I just didn't have so much stigma, but finally, my brother, because he had gone through his own mental health issues, recommended and said, like, you should try a therapist. It's okay. It's not a big deal. Give it a shot. What's the worst that can happen? And I did go and and then yeah, my life changed after that. Because after that, I every session, I mean, it took me a few sessions. But like the the the defining session for me happened when one day after three to four months of therapy, my therapist said, I know you want to I figured your problem, I said, what is wrong as I figured it out, finally, all the and my head was like, if I need to pass it, that's how you're thinking all this money, money, number number. So I said, Okay, tell me what's my problem. She's like, you're not very emotional. And I got so offended in that sense, I was like, I am not emotional as in my head as like, what a waste of money the last three months has been, do you not know who I am? I write long posts, you know, on empathy, and I am like, I cry when I watch movies, you know, I'm the most emotional person that I know, how could you say this? I was so offended. And she's like, I knew you're going to react like this, you know, but let me explain what I mean. And she gave me this example. She's like, what happens when your wife has a bad day at work? And she comes home after that. I said, she comes and rants about it, talks to me about it, and then we might just, you know, go and unwind by watching a movie or whatever. She says, what happens when you have a bad day at work and you go home? I said, I'm different from my wife. I don't like talking about, I want to keep my work life and my home life separate. I don't like talking about or ranting about, I don't want to burden her with all of this. And she looked at me and smiled and she's like, you and every man in India. I said, and she's just like, every man does this. Every man thinks that, you know, emotions are for a woman to express, but a man should just take that burden on himself and keep his work and private life separately. And because burdening someone, the burdens are only for us to take. By telling, giving it to somebody else would be burdening them and we just keep it inside. And one day, you know, we burst, whether it's through panic attacks and anxiety or through heart attacks and, you know, just death, right? And he's like, that's what I said, what I meant, you know, you can write about emotion, you can intellectualize emotion, which I still do, but you don't, you don't allow yourself to feel it. You don't allow yourself to express it. And I was like, oh shit, what has she said? And she's just, and in that moment when she said, this is what men do, I was like, I'm a man. Oh shit. I thought till this point, I just didn't know. And from that time, every single thing that I have done, you know, I have seen gender in it. I have not been able to unsee gender after that. It's been my whole life after that. You know, every space I'm in, I'm so aware of gender, every space I'm in. I can't be in a room where there are too many men and not see that there is no woman here. Or there's only one woman here. I can't see it. And, and which is why also in my company, for example, in you are right now, 26 people about 69 women. So it is, it was my most, I mean, at first I wanted to make sure that let's have like equality and let's have equal gender. And then after that, honestly, like the most talented people he found for the vision of women only, which is great. But you know, but it was, but I can't like, now I just, I know like how, how badly, there's this beautiful line that I read, there was a Angelina, Angelica Abraham, I forget her name. I'm so sorry. She's a, she's, she's, I mean, she's a politician now, which is also she writes about gender and she works on gender and she's Angelica, I think her name is. And she hosted a workshop on gender and, and I just joined it. I wanted to, and again, I was one of two men out of 50 women over there. And in that there's this wonderful thing that, you know, it's a great course, if you guys find it, please, you know, go and be part of it. It was gender leadership and gender. So there's a great quote that, that I found there and that I cannot ever forget now, which is that patriarchy oppresses every gender, but benefits and benefits the men, but it also oppresses the boys that they once were. And this learning that when you were a boy, you've never ever thought that you could be oppressed, right? I don't think like it's wrong as, as someone who claims to be a feminist, I can't, I would never say that boys have been oppressed as, as, uh, you know, when they were younger, how are you oppressed? We are benefited from gender, right? We've benefited from patriarchy, except the fact that, was it right for me to not go into arts and go into engineering, isn't that also a certain kind of oppression when you put this idea that, you know, it is benefiting them later. But in their minds, the toxicity that comes from thinking that there is, you know, uh, that's the only way to be the narcissism is the only way to be being the king is the only way to be. Every man should be the man of the house is the only way to be, you know, I think that's also, and it's fairly, it's correct, right? Like that's also patriarchal. It is, it is, it is a patriarchal oppression, oppression where, where every boy has to be a certain version of a man as, as early as possible, otherwise their life is pointless. You know, because I work so much with education also, and with, you know, I was shocked to learn and find, and this happened in my roadshow, which I'll also talk about at some point, I'm sure, but it, I was shocked to find that the students who said rates among boys in our country is like three times the rate of girls and, and it's earlier, it was shocking to me. Now it's not surprising after I've been on the roadshow, met all the young people across, you know, because every boy seems to be just lonely because they don't know the, the one big and then again, it's been a very long answer, but I'll try and end it here. But one of the biggest things that I've learned over the last few years about gender is that here's what has happened, right? For a certain kind of a young urban woman, and I'm not saying across, you know, I know intersectionally it's not been that case, but for a certain kind of a young urban woman or an upper class woman or an upper caste woman, feminism has been a, has been introduced into their lives, whether it is through the internet, whether it is through friends, whether it is through communities online, whether it is through mentors, whatever, which has created these wonderful positive spaces that they have, where they get encouraged. This is also what I learned on the roadshow, right? On the roadshow, every young woman would come and talk about gender, you know, what they were going through because of the gender. But at the end of it, they would always point out, look at that, because of that girl, I've survived. Look at my friend over there. I just want to give her a shout out because of her today I'm here. Every young woman, you know, because of, sorry, because of feminism, because of like the girl tribes that they have, have found these safe spaces where they are not alone anymore. They are learning from each other. It's not easy to be a woman in any way, but there is a community today that is helping any woman who wants to beat the patriarchal system and break out of it. You know, there is lots of resources, feminism overall, and it's again very difficult. I'm in no way saying that it's easy, but there is support while this is happening. And while suddenly women have started recognizing that, you know, they don't need to be, and again, no offense to anybody who still chooses to be a homemaker, but they don't need to be homemakers. They have a choice now. They can go and work. They can go and, you know, they can choose not to have children. They can choose to do whatever they want with their bodies, which is obviously the, which should have always been the case. But now they realize that it's a choice. It's not a necessity. It's not the, this is the story they were given. The story that every young woman in our country has been given is that your life's mission statement is to get married. You have to get married. And because you get married, you are, all your life has to be in the service of that goal. When you don't get a good guy, your life has no meaning. Marriage is your life's purpose. And having a kid is your life's purpose. And food is your life's purpose because the mission statement is only about getting settled. And Kanyadaan happens, one man hands you over to another man. And that's your, you know, life, you know, it's in the service of men. You're never a woman. You're always a daughter, a wife, you know, a sister, but you're never a woman or an identity or a human being. On the other hand, but now that feminism has happened and women have kind of found out about this, they are supporting each other and getting, you know, and recognizing these setups and these traps. On the other hand, during the same time where girls are now saying, I don't want to get married at an early age. I don't want to, you know, sit at home and cook and, you know, just have children, which is again for those who choose to do it short, but it's a choice as I said, they are choosing to go against every patriarchal conditioning, etc. But at the same time, no boy has been told that what you have been doing all your life is also patriarchal. There is no tribe for boys. There is no positive community for boys. Every avenue that exists for men is toxic. Every community on the internet for boys, 99% of them, I would say are toxic communities. They're not about empathy for men having empathy for themselves or having empathy for others, but about why women is your enemy, because today women is more quote unquote woke. So you know, the power is going away from men. So it's all toxic communities that are conditioning into men that women are the problem or feminism is the problem when it's not the problem. Feminism is actually for everyone. But unfortunately, again, it's been weaponized by a lot of online communities to say that it is only for women and men don't benefit from it. But then actually, if women are, if women are choosing to work, what that means for men is that you don't have to earn as much. You don't have to, you know, work that hard. You can also spend your life and have an actual work life balance. You can spend time with your son. You can spend time with your parents. You can have hobbies, which you were probably not allowed to have when you were younger, because you were told your entire life has to be just about work. But in every way that a woman benefits, a man also benefits, you know, by the burden becoming lesser. But men don't know this because no one's talking about it and no community is there to support men to a positive safe space community saying that, you know what, it's okay if you wanted to be a writer or an artist or a, you know, guitar player or a chef or a stand-up comedian or an Instagram model, whatever. It's okay. Even if that doesn't lead to the same amount of money you get after engineering an MBA because guess what? You will have now a partner who will and both of you will equally contribute in your household. You need to learn cooking, not because it's a woman's duty or in not a man's, but it's a great skill to have a life skill to have for anybody. Everyone should learn to cook. What is it's a great thing you when you go to host when you when boys go to hostels, they're completely like, I don't know what to do in my life, you know, because mothers think that boys don't need to be. And again, unfortunately, it is mothers because fathers are never at home. So again, that's so much patriarchy, so much gender conditioning and all the largest problem now is that girls have understood and have found a community and they're, you know, getting smarter, evolving into better versions of, you know, what they could be, whereas boys have not been told this and nobody's creating any positive spaces for boys. Nobody's having empathetic conversations with boys. So boys are getting angrier because they are just thinking that because of feminism, girls have gone the other side. But what about us? I did everything. You told me to do engineering. I did it. You told me to do MBA. I did it. But now that I want a girl who wants to marry and sit at home, she's saying I won't. Why not? Why did I do all of this? Then I could have just at 14 decided to be a writer and not having to do all of this. So that resentment and anger now, unfortunately, is being taken out on women. And that is why they have so much toxicity on the internet. That is why you have so much anger in the streets. That is why you have so much, I mean, everything that women go to a country which seems to be even more right now is actually happening because, you know, boys are just absolutely clueless. They've been lonely. And now that loneliness has turned into anger and resentment because nobody is trying to have sensitive conversations about gender with them, saying that now we live in a world where it's also okay for you not to be the version of a boy or a man that Petra K tells you to be. It is okay to not hustle as hard. It is okay not to work as hard. It is okay to have hobbies. It is okay to have work-life balance. It is okay to cry. It is okay to, you know, just spend time, you know, without being productive. It is okay to, you know, not want to, you know, harm yourself because you're failing in an exam. It is okay to fail in exams and do something else apart from engineering and MBA. Every one of these things is okay. It is absolutely okay. You don't have to try so hard. You don't have to be so hard on yourself. And that anger is also the anger historically we see with all our parents. Why are most of our fathers angry or violent or alcoholic? Because for the same reason, they've just buried it all inside without having any avenues to express. Anytime they were expressed, anytime they would express, they would be looked down upon. I told you that I thought my father was weak because he used to, you know, I thought he was weak because he was going through anxiety. And I used to look at it as, you know, whenever he would talk about it, complain about it or go through something, I would just, I would look, you know, what kind of a man is he? Because that was what was conditioned into me that boys can't, every time I would have a scrape, you know, somebody would come and tell me, you're crying like a girl. You know, now if girls cry and boys don't cry, and now I can't cry and I can't have an healthy outburst of emotion, and I'm always going to be looked down upon as a sensitive boy just because I'm crying, then I'd much rather not cry. And that becomes toxic. And that becomes, that turns into anger. And that turns into, you know, whatever you see in the world right now. So it is, we need to have these conversations. I'm so grateful to therapy. I'm so grateful to anxiety. I'm so grateful to my own mental health issues for leading me to a place where today I can I recognize these patterns in my own life. I'm trying as hard as possible to overcome any of the toxicity inside of me that still remains as a product of patriarchy. And I am dedicating a lot of my life to having these conversations about gender with all genders, you know, with women, men, and other genders to kind of tell them that you don't have to be defined by a single story that patriarchy gives you. You can have any story you want. You know, you need to fight back against patriarchy, you need to fight back against it."

        "message": "These are such incredibly insightful and inspiring points. And I want to read out this lovely para from one of your pieces, where you wrote, quote, it is tragic that we live in a world where even as patriarchy benefits men, it first oppresses the boys they once were, the boys who could have grown up not necessarily to be engineers or doctors or MBAs, but perhaps poets and artists and dancers if they were allowed to be the boys who could have grown up, not necessarily to constantly and continually work for money, but perhaps be present fathers and husbands, the boys who could have grown up without a stigma against feeling vulnerable, punishing any perceived weakness through violence, but perhaps be kinder and gentler to the world around and to themselves, stop quote, and the story from your engineering college about you know, you asking for that girl's number and all of that, that reminded me of a story, a friend of mine told me in Hyderabad recently, which ends in a great line. So I've always remembered it, which is that basically, he was in an athletic delegation, so he had gone for some sports event to Haryana, one of these Haryana towns, perhaps even Karnal. So there, there was also a local girls team or whatever, he got talking to one of the girls and they were friendly and they hung out and all. And that evening in the place where they were staying, a bunch of Haryanvi boys came and they beat him up, because one of those guys had been trying to put out the girl and the girl wasn't giving him line of day. So they beat him up. And they beat him up and they go. And then like in your case, that boy comes back. And this guy is like, what you've already beaten me up. And the guy just looks very sad and you know, and then he looks at him. And he brings his face close to him and whispers, daagi toh laal hai, right? And just the way it was said, daagi toh laal hai, I remember it for that reason. But it's also very poignant, because the boys who beat up this boy, like you pointed out, they are also trapped. They're also victims. But the thing is, that like you so wisely said, women now have the tools and the language and the frames to understand this. You know, they may not always have the privilege or the circumstances to act upon it. But the language is there, the frames are there, they can understand it, they can understand what's happening to them. And they can, you know, even if they can't always fight it effectively. It's there out there. But for men, it is not there. Men have no clue. I did an episode with Sringda Poonam many years back when this was a shorter show on"

        "message": "What is your sense of this? So I again talk a lot about this in my talks, you know, I have for a very long time, I wondered why does India not have like superhero universes, right? Superhero kyu nahi hai India gandhar, mallabh you had one Krrish and you had like one, you know, Drona and you know, you had two three like Ravan, but like you've never had that culture which is so prevalent in Hollywood, right? Why is that the case? And I've been, you know, kyu nahi banti itni, kyu nahi banti itni? And then at some point it struck me that the reason we don't have superheroes in India is because every man in every film plays a superhero because he's an Indian man. You don't need superheroes in India, you have Salman Khan, you don't need superheroes in India, you have Rajinikanth, you don't need superheroes in India, you have Tiger Shroff. What do you need? They are what super, what RRR, why is the world flipping over it because you know where you have to put a, you know, X amount of VFX logic into why Captain America can take a, you know, has a super strength and has a backstory where he's become so strong that he can now, you know, hold a, you know, or Spiderman has to go through a spider like a whole thing of becoming strong and then can stop a train. Here, you know, in RRR, you just have to be an Indian man and you can take a tank and throw it to somebody. You can take a motorcycle and throw it in someone's head. And that's just something that people are flipping out, but that's been the narrative always that Indian men don't need to be, you know, you don't need to have a spider biting you or a secret serum that turns you into a super soldier or like having gadgets like Iron Man to become, you know, strong and, you know, inhumanly powerful. You are inhumanly powerful anyway because you have an Indian man. And the problem in front of you is that somebody has taken the girl that you like away, you know, and that's what an Indian woman is supposed to do. She's the damsel in distress where an Indian man has to, Indian man has to save the girl, save the day, save the world. The Indian woman has to be saved. And during this entire time, you know, her trajectory is just waiting to be saved. And then in the middle, for some reason, dancing like that's the ways that, you know, Hindi films have been constructed for the longest time. So, you know, and we are the only society, again, can you imagine, like we call hero, like the lead actor in a movie, a hero, right? It's nowhere in the world do you call the lead actor, the hero of the film, he's a hero of the film because he's a hero and, and, and he's a superhero. That is why you're calling him a hero. And then, and you know, why do you have, you know, films which are called as female led films in our country now, that this film is a female led film, Tapsee leads this film, Bhoomi Pednekar leads this film, Anushka Sharma leads the film, it's a female led film. Because the premise of Indian films is that there will be a hero. And the moment you don't have a hero, you have to warn the audience that there is no hero in this film. In this film, women are leading it and women are not heroes in the minds of like filmmakers or the Bollywood or the industry at large, right? A woman who is fighting a circumstance, but a man is a hero. So heroine means someone who's going to dance and be saved, but otherwise you are a women led film. So can you imagine like the even the nomenclature of how we talk about, you know, the vocabulary we use when we talk about, you know, cinema and we talk about are the people who act in films, item numbers as an example. Even now, man, can you imagine that you have, you call it that, you call a dance number with a girl in a skimpy dress as first of all, that is the number one way to promote any film. Just now another film has come out Bhediya, which is about, you know, a man turning into a wolf. What does that have to do with an actress, you know, dressing in, you know, and again, nothing, but that's the way to promote that. You need to have quote-unquote as, you know, item number where a girl is quote-unquote an item. Imagine the derogatory language you're using to even refer to a woman over here and she's performing a number. And while of course some people, you know, actresses were smart and, you know, filmmakers were smart, turn it into an art form. As an example, BD Jalaila in, you know, in Omkara, which is Vishal Bhardwaj's way of like. So there are actresses and there are filmmakers who try to reclaim that idea, that if we have to do it, we will do it smartly. If the producer or the studio says that we have to put it, this is the only way to promote, we will do our own thing from it, etc. But at the same time, you can think whatever you want for the most widest audiences in our country, it is still like a provocative number for men to lust after, right? And you know, to see women in less clothing. So that's been historically the way we look at it. Now when you, and again, this was something else that I speak in my talks also with young people like when you look at the history of the way Bollywood has, you know, gone in terms of heroes. And if I just go back, not, you know, there's a Dilip Uma Dev Anand, but if I start from Amitabh Bachchan for as an example, in the 70s, there was one character that everybody knew of. What is the name of the character? Amitabh Bachchan used to play it, Vijay. Everyone knows that, right? Vijay is the angry young man. Why is he angry? Because society is not fair. Society is, you know, oppressing, you know, poor and the people from underprivileged sections and you want food, you want clothes, you want a house, for that, either you're going to be a coolie and fight for the rights or you're going to be a don or you're going to be a, you know, as a mafia in Zanjeer and whatever it takes, you will fight back as an angry young man. You are Vijay and it is, and because society is oppressive, you are going to, you know, get angry and fight back. Once the economic boom came after, you know, Amitabh Bachchan playing this till Agneepath in the late 80s, you know, still Vijay Dhiranath Chauhan, you know, a whole 10-15 year period of him playing that. In the 90s, the economic boom happened, right? So now people were not as angry because you're just like, okay, now we have a food house. They're still entitled themselves. Yeah, exactly, you know, but you get, you know, it's not as difficult right now to fight for a food house because there's far more jobs being introduced into the economy, right, Manmohan Singh? You know, and now you, what happens then? Then you find, once you have roti, kapda, makka, then what do you need in life? You need love. So then you have another kind of a hero that comes up. And that hero is Shah Rukh Khan. And he also has a name. What is the name?"

        "message": "Rahul. He's Rahul. He's Rahul and he's in every film and he's, you know, spreading his arms and he's looking for the love of his life and because that's what he needs right now. And then Rahul went on for, again, another 10-15 years, K3G, till then, 2000s, later late 2000s, Rahul kept going, Raj kept going, Rahul kept going, Shah Rukh Khan's romance period. After that got over, you had a third kind of a hero, you know, that now that you found love also and you had dating apps coming in, you had like all kinds of different ways of people became more, you know, brave and courageous to talk about love with their families. You don't really need to kind of fight for love. You didn't need to like, it was an open conversation. Shah Rukh Khan normalized it. So now when you have all of this, you have Roti, Kapda, Makaan and you have love, what do you now need? Then the answer came to like, you know, you need to find who you are, you need to now go internal. Everything was external till now, now it's about to become yours. And then there came a new kind of a hero, Ranbir Kapoor, who is your man-child, who is, who's got everything. He's got tons of girls after him. He's, he might be going after one girl, but ultimately his every film is a coming of age film where he's trying to come to terms with who he is and trying to find out who he is. At the end of the film, whether it is through a girl, whether it is through a, you know, a job, whether it is through any other thing, whether it's a drama or whatever, he, he has a revelation at the end of it. And then he realizes this is who I am. I'm not, you know, I'm not a child anymore. I'm a man. And you know, and that process through that process, whether it's in Yeh Jawani, Yeh Diwani, wherever you see it, ultimately, I don't want to fall, I want to fly. I want to walk, I want to run, I don't want to fall. That's the whole generation of young men where Ranbir Kapoor came in and you had another hero. He was called Sid and Sid is now Ranbir Kapoor, right? This is that for three decades of cinema, literally as a character. And it's a man, that character is a man and he represents what men at that time are going through. Immediately after that came like the Ayushman era. And that Ayushman era is basically, now what happens? Now you start caring about society around you because now you have found all of these four things. You also realize like thinking about yourself is important. Self-introspection is important. You know, being quote unquote with Ranbir Kapoor, being a fuckboy is also important. Then what, what really happens in life, then you maybe start looking at society. So Rajkumar, Ayushman, they have started like their own, you know, journeys of like showing the world a prism of, you know, here's the issues with society. You should care about it, etc, etc. Here at this point, also the female led film, as I said, started coming in as well. And you know why it really happened when you kind of go into the history as someone who's again worked in Bollywood for a bit. The history of female led films in India is that these are the, these are the films that men refuse to do. Most of these films were written for men and then men were like, this is too small. I'm not looking like a hero in this. I'm not a big, you know, I don't have much of an action scene. I don't think my arc is great. So then the directors and producers would be like, okay, what are you doing? So then you have to, you rewrite it and say, what if it was a woman? Examples, example, I mean, NH7 as an example, you know, again, I'm not, I'm not referring to this film as a very specific film about which would have happened here, but the general trend, you know, I mean, there are so many films that, you know, I also know that have changed from being, and I can't, because I was at Yansradha, I can't name them."

        "message": "So, so, okay, as an example, you know, and again, no disrespect to, you know, the, to my alma mater, you know, again, one of the best times I've ever had, I must say it, and I'm not saying it for any other reason, because I genuinely loved working there. Hichki, which was, which Rani Mukherjee ultimately, you know, did, was written for a man. It was written and they took it to different men, and different men, like, just weren't, you know, like, I don't know if I want to be a teacher or whatever it is. And ultimately, then they rethought it and said, what if we attach a bigger actor, but it's a female. And suddenly the film became monetizable, because when it's a female, you also pay her lab because of the gender parity in our country and in all industries. So the budget of the film doesn't exceed a certain amount. So it's easy to recover the money also. So everything then became business wise, it became, you're putting low cost, but low investment. And then the return can be in certain cases can be a lot more, right? So it's, this is the way that, you know, female women in our country have gotten their own films. It's only happened after men refused to do those films. And women, when you look at any female led film in our country, now, again, I'm using that term, because that's the easiest way of identifying them, right? If you look at any of these films led by women actors, you will have a film which Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, anybody, no matter who it is, will lead. And you will have any actor between a Deepika to an Anushka, all the big actors of our times who are female will act in them opposite, even if their role is like five scenes. And in fact, and it's like a, it's a trial by fire. It's almost a coming of age for every Akshay Kumar film ki andar, Kiara Advani aagi for five scenes, then you know, that's when you get noticed. And then you can maybe someday lead your own film. That's the way people get to know you when you are opposite, or this is the way unfortunately things are structured, right? But when you see a female, a film which has a big female star, you have a Deepika, you know, in Chhapaak, you have a, you name it, you name it, you have Anushka in NH7, in NH40, I forget what the title was. You have Bhumi's films, Tapsee's films, you know, Rocket, Rashmi, any of these films, the male actors are always going to be folks who are either from a different industry, because they're not as big in Bollywood cinema. So they're okay with coming in like Punjabi cinema, I work in South, so I'm happy Dulukar Salman will come in. He's comfortable, while of course, I think South films and South actors have their own mind and they're really smart about taking good scripts versus actually some of them, at least some of them today don't fall into that trap. But but you have, you know, you will see that, you know, otherwise it is supporting actors or indie actors or web series actors who start playing opposite them. And no one, you will never see like in America, as an example, you will have a Ghostbusters, a female Ghostbusters, which has four women playing Ghostbusters and a Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor will come and play a cameo for like, you know, and play a secretary and have 10 jokes on him. And it's crazy. You will have, you know, Brad Pitt doing in Lost City doing like a small role because Sandra Bullock said to me that, you know, will you come in, you know, do Channing Tatum and I are doing a film and will you come and do a five minute cameo? And he said, sure, I will do it. So you have all of these big Hollywood blockbusters and you have all of these big actors are okay with doing smaller roles if it's like a female that they love, etc, etc. But in it's not the case in India, it's almost seen as, you know, I can't, I remember again without wanting to name the actors, I really respect them, I remember one of the, you know, so I was having a conversation with Rajkumar Rao. This was, I was interviewing him at a film festival in, in IIT and Queen had just come and I said, like, you know, Rajkumar, your work in Queen was just incredible. It's so great to see you in like that role where you are going, you know, you're not really playing like you're okay with playing a comfortable with being a negative character, etc. And he said it publicly only, which is why I guess I can quote it, where he said that I'm never going to play a character like that again, not because it's negative, but because it was Queen, it was Kangana's film. And why am I, you know, playing such a lesser part in that film, I want to be seen as a lead hero. And if I continue playing those films, I will never be seen as a hero, I will always be seen as a actor who is, I won't be seen as a hero, again, quote unquote, I will always be seen as like this actor who's playing opposite a female in a female led film. So and now Rajkumar is never going to be seen in a film like if Kangana does a film, you will never have a Rajkumar in a film like that, you'll always have somebody who is who's from an indie scene or a web series scene. So it is Bollywood main itne issues hain, itne issues hain, and, and even with people who have good intentions, these issues, because now they've created a vicious cycle of this, and a vicious cycle that gives the people the same thing over and over again, after which people are thinking this is what they want, which is not true. Because when you have like, because Aamir Khan, until recently has been a very successful example of showing that you can give them a good script, and they will take it, a three idiots has nothing to do with like Dangal for that matter, even with all of its problems when it came to its feminism, Dangal was a film where Aamir Khan played a 40 40 50 year old father, and you had two new actresses, there were no songs, you know, which were quote unquote, again, item numbers, there was no female, there was no romantic, there was one of the rare films without a romantic angle and made 350 crores, it was the highest grossing film, Hindi film outside of Bhavbali of all time, you know, so it's, if you and Rajkumar Hirani, again, you know, while with everything that's happened with him, like, he was a great example of showcasing that you can have a film on any subject. And if you do it right, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, now he's done a period of films for whatever it's worth. Anand Raidh until again, while his again films have some of them have been very problematic. Most of these films, when you do something, if you have a good script, and you have a good narrative, and you have good actors in it, Ayushman's first few films, which were just absolutely fresh, did nobody could have thought that Ayushman and Rajkumar will become you know, 100 150 crore actors, but they just started choosing subjects over everything else. And the subjects were so good that people just started being like, hey, you know, this is a we want to see this film not because of who's in it, but which also became his style then, but because of what's in it, Badhai Ho Ke Andar, the film was Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta's film. And Ayushman was one of them. I mean, I really respect him for being brave enough to do a role where he's not the hero in that film. And Sania Malhotra is actually not the quote unquote heroine in that film. Both of them are the supporting cast of Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta. But they were okay with doing something like that because it's a great script. And you know, when you do a script and you do it with a director that they respect, the film ends up becoming a hit. But again, now we have pandemic has happened now again, we have gone back to the space where now a certain kind of South film, which has a certain kind of misogyny, a certain kind of same angry young man, the 70s are back in in, you know, in some somehow in the 2020s. And now we are seeing I mean, I saw Kantara and everyone's been hyping it up. And I full respect to the, you know, the acting of Rishabh Shetty. And you know, there was something very interesting there. But like, I just couldn't, there was a point in the film where the girl he likes, he goes and gives, you know, touches her waist in this inappropriate manner, gives her a, I don't know, twists her belly, and laughs about it. And his friends say, why did you do that? That's romance or whatever it is. It's one of the biggest hits and nobody is even talking, I mean, reviewers are, but I didn't see any of the reviews or any of the general people opinion that, okay, I like Kantara, but this scene, I couldn't, the movie for me after that, just after I saw that scene, I was just like, you know, how can I be comfortable with anything that happens in the movie that if there's such a rampant, misogynistic, you know, idea over here, right then and there and the way the woman's character has been treated in the whole film, again, it's just like a woman who's in service of a man. So gender is a, I don't think enough people recognize it, you know, if filmmakers in our country are now making films about which show gender in a new light or show for that matter sexuality in a new light or anything, I think they're also coming from a sense of business now that a story like this, because nothing else is working, this might work, so let's give it a shot. I don't think there's enough people who are passionate about it, or who care about it or who and anytime, you know, like as somebody who's also tried very hard to have these conversations, you if you pitch it that this is about gender, people are just going to be like, I don't care. But if you pitch it as entertainment, and then they're like, Oh, but I like what you've done in gender, they themselves will say interesting. But if I say that I'll tell you a story, but I'll tell you a story that it's a great story, then you might be interested in it. But the moment I start by saying, you know, I think we're trying to reverse, we're looking at misogyny in this way, I don't want to care, I don't care about message or whatever it is, because they think that there is a stench that comes with social issues, that the moment you talk about social issues, you know, there is your your film and your idea and your thought and your story has a stink to it, that that people try to rub off like it cannot be seen. As an example, Aamir Khan, again, no disrespect to anybody over here. I'm just trying to like, when when thugs of Hindustan came, and this is just something I noticed, right, again, I really respect him, I just talked about how Dangal was, you know, whatever. But when thugs of Hindustan came, he went on coffee with Karan. And Karan Johar said that, you know, you've been, you know, you have been such an impactful person, you know, you've done, what do you say, Satyamev Jayate, all your films have social issues at the core of it, it's so incredible, etc. And Aamir Khan said, no, no, no, I don't make films for social issues, I make good films, it's a good thing that I got a social message, but my social issue, he was so terrified, as one of India's biggest actors, to be seen as somebody who's supporting a film with a social cause. He's just like, no, no, no, no, no, please don't, you have to look at the like, immediate fear on his face, that please don't bracket me as a socially responsible actor, I'm not one, sorry. I am a hero and I'm an actor, I'm waiting for a thug, I'm killing people there, I'm doing violence, I've done Ghazni also, look, I do everything. So don't bracket me in that. I'm just doing good, good cinema, if they resonate and great, if not, they don't. And anybody who tries to do talk about social issue, Enraak Kashyap, you will have a separate fan base, but no one go for his films beyond a point of time, you know, you will have people just it's, it's sad. And I just I don't think that you know, when you look at international cinema, and you look at foreign cinema, you know, you know, as a foreign cinema, non English cinema, you have something like Parasite, which is about class. And that's why it won the Oscar. And they're the people they're aware, they're all coming together to make that commentary. You have most of the incredible films that are made internationally, have that team, you know, Asghar Farhadi, any of these people that you have internationally, and they're proud of the fact that they're exploring an insight or a theme into a social, social and all art is political, all art is about social issues only. You may realize it or you may not realize it. If you realize it, then you are then you're making it consciously if you don't realize it, you're just, you know, perpetuating stereotypes of a certain social understanding of the world you have and a certain political understanding of the world, you may not know that you have done misogyny, but you have done misogyny, and that is your point of view. I'm not even talking about Kabir Singh right now. I'm talking about like most of Indian Bollywood like history, which is had casual misogyny as you very well said, most Akshay Kumar films have had like, you know, just the hero like a girl by constantly stalking her by constantly like, you know, and that is the way that most men think. I know friends of mine, you know, who are women who have gotten into relationships after men followed them, because they were just like, okay, and this is I'm talking about maybe 10-15 years ago, because Imran Hashmi made it cool. And they thought that this is romantic, that if he saw me on this place, and then he followed me to somewhere, you know, maybe he really likes me. And because again, and there is a class element to that also, he seems like a person in a caste element to this also, it seems like he's from upper class, upper caste, so I don't mind like going out on a date for them. I don't feel unsafe. So there is, I mean, so many, so many issues that have been perpetuated consciously, unconsciously, subconsciously by Bollywood, will it change? I don't know. I think the web world is trying some very interesting things. You have a Delhi, you're seeing folks like Shefali Shah, who was an iconic actor, you know, being able to now have, you know, lead her own shows like a Delhi crime and, you know, and kick ass at it. You know, you have like now, now, a little bit of the internet, fortunately, is giving the web space is giving a little bit more respect to actors beyond age, beyond genders, you know, and just good storytelling, you know, but again, I mean, it's a clutter after a point of time, you know, this when there's too much, ultimately, when everybody wants to make 20,000 of one thing, then you look at the formula. And then you don't look at what is the out, you don't look at what is that biggest success, because that's always going to be difficult to make. Not everybody can make a family man, not everybody can make a Delhi crime, but everybody can make a true crime show where a girl gets kidnapped and there's a man who's trying to, you know, whatever, who's at the hem of it, another man who's trying to save that's the easiest thing to do. You get any director, get any writer, get any kind of actor, and you know, people will watch it because that's what they've always been watching. So I know I still I feel like I have hope I always have hope that just unfortunately the kind of person I have, but at this point, I don't see where I don't I don't know where Bollywood is leading or where Indian cinema at large is leading, especially with the rise of these hyper masculine South films."

        "message": "I am with you. So never mind that. No, I all of this is extremely insightful in terms of, you know, little things like how we normalize all of this, either term like item number, term like female led film at one on one hand, it's a description accurate to her. But on another hand, the fact that the description is necessary, is telling you something, you know, just calling someone a hero in a film, sort of telling you something and just the fact that, you know, Kiara Advani can act in a film led by Akshay Kumar, but Akshay Kumar will never act in a film led by any woman, obviously. So you know, earlier at lunch, we were both raving about TikTok. And I'll, you know, I'll sort of talk about that to get to my next question. And I had even for a month, I had taught one course called TikTok and Indian society I had, in fact, taught it on WhatsApp. So it was like WhatsApp University. And the reason I taught it on WhatsApp was to support my chapters, I had like hundreds of TikTok videos I wanted to send. So if you think of the vertical format, WhatsApp was actually the best place to send it sequentially with my comments and all that, but that was a time TikTok was banned. So I just did it once. Now, what I loved about TikTok is that TikTok broke through all the structures that existed. And obviously, that happened at the same time as you know, Jio was making broadband almost ubiquitous. So, you know, a person in a village who might otherwise have felt that no one was making entertainment for them, that no one was speaking to them, could turn on their mobile phone and no matter what they were, maybe alternate sexuality or whatever, they might have felt that they are all alone. And you can suddenly see people like yourself, creating art and entertainment for you. And then there is that magic moment where you can turn the camera around, and you can make something yourself. And initially, obviously, you would find TikTokers initially doing, you know, those standard memes with a lip sync to something or whatever. But then going beyond that, I just saw such an outpouring of great original art coming out of that. And it blew my mind. And it was bottom up, which I just loved. And that way, unfortunately, TikTok was banned. And my sense has been over the last few years, whenever I look around me across domains, you know, whether it is in the media, or just across domains, that the mainstream is crumbling, right, that the mainstream is crumbling, everything is getting decentralized. And while there is a lag in the transition, mainstream players have no clue what's happening out there. Right? Would you say that that's also the case with Bollywood in the sense that the way the industry works and things is really a bit of an artifact. They have a notion of what works, right? And then what you beautifully called a vicious circle kicks into play, where they'll produce more and more of that, and some of that will work, and then they'll double down on that. And they'll say, huh, this works. But they cannot think outside that particular box, that TikTokers were thinking outside all boxes. And so do you feel that that's a problem with mainstream industry in the sense that in another place you spoke about how you did not want to be a filmmaker sitting in a glass cabin and Andheri saying this is what the youth wants, this is what the country wants. And we'll talk about that phase of your life also. But do you think that we are stuck in that space, where we are probably ready for a kind of content and a kind of art, which people aren't producing because of this lag because entertainment is still so top down?"

        "message": "Lots to say on this, honestly, where do I begin? So I feel like fundamentally now we as an audience don't understand the film industry. It's called an industry to begin with, the industry, Bollywood in one hand, even Hollywood, most film industries. Let's just leave some of the European kind of cinema out of it for now, but it's a business and it's like it's worse than gambling because there's no science to it, right? When you think about it, every other industry in the world has a structure of what works. If I am a computer engineer, if I would have gone into the same line, I would be given a certain kind of code. I would have a certain problem statement, solve this problem statement, do this coding and then maybe we'll reach the solution. There are ideas, innovations you have and obviously still you don't know whether it will work or not, but there is a structure you can follow to reach there and a lot of people have reached there. There's a lot of technological innovation that happens because of structure. There is nothing that can guarantee a hit film, nothing in the world because if that was true, then every film would be a hit, nothing. So there are sometimes films like, you know, suddenly there are films that come out like an Ayushman film, as I said, can come out and make 150 crores because it was just a fresh topic, Vicky Doonar came out of nowhere, then from till Badhaay Do, everything kind of worked like that. You will have a suddenly you will have an RRR that will come out and blow Hollywood away. It is 100% going to be nominated to the Oscars because every American filmmaker has gone nuts watching it like what is happening over here, right? But I mean and not everybody can be Raja Mouli, not everybody can be Ayushman, but not anybody can be like Salim Javed at that time at the height of their, you know, success. So there is no formula. And yet, when you crack something that works, the kind of return on investment you can have, it's pretty crazy. And you can have it instantly, right? When you have a business, you have to build a business for 10 years, and then you get a valuation then you whatever, you know, you put a lot of hard work for a very long time, and something happens. You have one and a half years that you put a film in if you kind of put it together in a smart way. If it works, you know, you have 300-400 crores that you make, you know, in like, over a period of two months or three months. So the return on investment is so great that people are happy to do this gamble, but it is gambling. Like you're up as a as a poker player, you said luck plays a chance so often right and you know, you can have skill, but the same thing in Bollywood, you can have some skill, but a lot of it is just pure luck, right and and and that's Bollywood, but fundamentally people think and misunderstand that you know, it is it is it is a place that is out to make things that the audience would love or enjoy. That is the secondary object is never the primary objective. On the other hand, there are fools, the fools like me, there are fools like many other writers, directors, filmmakers who watch some of these movies that could be made for any reason possible, you know, and in some way somewhere these films made them feel less alone. I have grown. I came to India. This is a true story because of DDLJ, I grew up, you know, I had got I did my GMAT, so I did my SATs and I got a great score and all my friends in my circle of friends in Bahrain went to America. I was the one who said no, I want to go to India for two reasons. One I wanted to go to I wanted to go to Bombay and be a and and make it in Bombay. I was very clear and all of it started with DDLJ and I was like what is this? I am like I have my favorite thing ever and and the funniest part of this is that I it's not the thing that worked for me DDLJ is not Shah Rukh Khan, not Kajol, but Amrish Buri repeatedly saying my country's soil and you know my soil's fragrance and and and I was like inspired by him to say that yes, my country, my soil, my soil's fragrance, Punjab, I want to go there, I want to do something there, but like the film also in itself, Aditya Chopra, I ended up working at Yash Raj, got to work with Aditya Chopra and it's just insane like you know, but as a young boy, I saw those films and I was like this crazy and when Hrithik Roshan came, I was just like I was obsessed with Hrithik, obsessed. I was I have I bought like some 30,000 posters of Hrithik Roshan. I had created a website, embarrassing but I had created a Geocities website, a fan website of Hrithik Roshan when I was like 13, you know, so there was something in films, you know, that spoke to young people who did not and especially I feel like young boys who just did not know where to fit in, you know, I would see a Bollywood film and you would speak to any writer, any filmmaker in Lokhandwala Andheri and they will have a story about like the film that corrupted them, the film that made them realize that this is what they want to do and it really comes down to an insight that I felt a little less alone. As an NRI kid growing up outside of India, films were my connect with my country. It was my connect with my language while of course, you know, Middle East beyond a point of time has tons and tons of Indians anyway, so it's not like I was in a very foreign place. Still, you know, there was something that I would see Punjabi culture in particular is like super resonant in like, you know, YRF and Dharma films and whatnot. So I'd watch those films and I was like, you know, as somebody who still struggles to be Punjabi and is very embarrassed by it because it's the language of my, you know, parents and my grandparents, you know, I would hear Punjabi music and I would see films, you know, DDLJ and there's all these Malhotras and Khannas and Kapoors and whatnot like, you know, this is these are my people, right? But when you enter Bombay and you come to Bollywood, so to speak, you realize that these are all of this is these are power centers, there are art is elitist, you know, and it's always been when people look down and say, okay, you've not seen Gone with the Wind, you're not seeing classics, you're not seeing European cinema, you're not seeing like, you know, Ingrid Bergman, you've not seen any of these like big filmmakers, big names, you know, and people look down on you and say that, you know, because it is it was a language of first a language of intellectuals, then a language of rich people, then a language of business. It was never something that anybody can, it was not a democratic system. Why is there this whole anger about demotivism, but you fundamentally misunderstood what this industry is. If you're angry about nepotism, it's I can't even now said no offense, but you know, you've called me out on it, but people get angry about nepotism, I'm just like, do you not recognize you think that this is an industry that was made on merit, it wasn't, it was made on it was business deals. Everybody's the same family. 80% of Bollywood is one family, yes, Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar are cousins, you know, and like in most people don't know that they're literal cousins, you know, and and so and there were four or five families, you know, in the 50s 60s that started it, and they've been like, they've grown their empires and businesses, few new people have definitely come in and whatnot, tried to create Anurag Kashyap as an example to try to create an alternate culture and alternate industry along with it. But still it is it is about people who have money, and they will do with the money whatever the hell they want. And why would they give them, you know, money to outsider quote unquote, because if I give it to my son, or my daughter, at least if I fail, you know, I'm putting it I'm feeling because I pointed on my children, but if I put it on an outsider, and that feels I'm just like I'm an idiot or what, because it's a gamble. There is no structure, there's no formula, you can have the best actors, you know, from outside of Bollywood, but ultimately, you know, it's a risk. And why would someone take a 30 crore 20 crore 10 crore 5 crore risk on somebody else, when you can take that 5 crore risk on your family, right and it's the same. So everybody is in cohort with each other. It's an incestuous industry. Everybody is like, you know, you work with each other, that's those have been the power centers for the longest time, the internet broke it, YouTube broke it, we come to TikTok. But that's what happened in the and I was fortunate as being someone who was started off as a, you know, culture writer in Hindustan Times, you know, and was writing about quote unquote, the seed, you know, I was I was seeing stand up comedy happen. I've also done open mics at the beginning, I've seen the independent music culture, I was reporting on it. I was seeing channel V and MTV transforming into something interesting. You know, what were they doing for culture at that point of time, this alternate season Anurag Kashyap and that became my entry in Dev D I saw in 2008-9 ki baat thi, paagal ho gaya tha. I was like, what is this? What I've seen that film in theatres like four times, I was like, how is this like, what is happening? Udaan I saw, Vikram Aditya Motwani, Oye Lucky Lucky Boys, I think it's one of the greatest films ever made of all time, Dibakar Banshee, I went and met them, you know, because I was I had the, you know, I was in a place I was in Hindustan Times and, you know, after a point of time, I realised paise toh mil nahi rahe hai, so I made a list of people I wanted to meet. I was like, I'm just going to go and interview these people. So I met all of the people I used to love and, you know, like, I love this guy, I want to meet him. I would love this, you know, woman and, you know, as a director or whatever. And I just have these, you know, lists and just go after these people and they're not just India lists internationally. I interviewed Richard Linklater, I interviewed Aaron Sorkin, all the people that I considered my heroes, I just go after them and interview them, right. And I would be inspired by how these people are not your, they are not from these power centres and it's not even easy for them. They have struggled epically, they have struggled publicly, but they have done it. They have broken the system. And that was always something that I kind of always had the back of my hand. So even when I got into MTV, I was, I joined the digital team at that time. I was the editor of the MTV website. As editor of the MTV website, there was one website, nobody gave a shit about it. I was suddenly this 24 year old who's like, you're free say, you gave a little bit of a budget. And I just, I wrote all kinds of articles on it. And suddenly those articles started going viral, started. And then there was a team that I was given and a team that I was part of suddenly. And Koch studio, the first time was coming and then they gave it to me and said, you know, you are the whatever digital in charge of making it happen. And I was just trying all kinds of things. We did like a, at that time, like a video interview pod and we didn't even have the terms podcast, but we did like a video with all the Shankar, all the people who were performing at Koch studio. We did like this video gathering. We did a tweet, tweet meetup. So all the Koch studio fans and got them to go to the sets and watch it live. And these are all experiment. Nobody was doing this. It was just fun. I was there when the internet was, you know, making things happen. And that's where I made the series on, on, on air after that. And I made six films at MTV actually, and that's where I got to get into Bollywood. I made six films with Anurag Kashyap, Anurag Basu, Sujit Sarkar, Nikhil Adwani, Rohan Sippy, Abhinay Deo. And I was producing all of them. I mean, there's a whole, again, other story around that. But when I got into, it was at that time in 2014, 2015, where TVF, that video, Rohdi's video went viral. And I was at MTV at that time. And this video and everybody in MTV was talking about how this internet video is like, what is this? And that was the first, you know, in that sense to break through, you know, and, and one of the first viral, viral videos, because they made fun of Rohdi's, right? The show that I was making the disaster of a show that I made was called Reality Stars, which was a fiction show about reality shows. We had a, is my whole idea of making a parody or like a satirical show, a comedy about these bunch of people who want to be part of a show called MTV rejects. So, so, but I saw that there was, you know, a scene, a literal counterculture happening alongside where the power centers did not matter anymore. If you were earlier, and again, I go a little bit into like can, but earlier to become famous, you know, fame, the idea of fame has always been associated with, you know, being in front of the camera, being in front of the screen at one point to become famous. And you see this in old Bollywood films, and you see this in films of your, where you see like somebody coming to VT station, and Bombay is the city of dreams, right? And that's where city of dreams, and you know, you will, you come to Bombay, you stand in a line somewhere, and like, you know, you do an audition, and maybe you become an actor and Amitabh Bachchan's story is this, someone else's story is that, everyone has come to the station, went there, stood in this line, and one day he became a superstar. Then they go to bandstand and talk about the fact that I am now the king of the world, right? That's the story. But you had to come to Bombay, you had to struggle in those lines, and many, many, many did not make it, right? And then reality TV happened. But reality TV, whether it was Indian Idol, Sarekama, and then of course, you know, roadies and all of these other shows, they said that you don't have to come to Bombay, we will come to you. So we will come to your city, you still have to stand in line, but there'll be judges, and immediately they'll look at you and say, this person has the potential to be a star. And then you can be in front of the television and suddenly you'll be a star one day. So suddenly, like it became closer home, I had that opportunity of becoming a star. And when the internet happened, even that, you didn't have to stand in line, you didn't have to even go to a city somewhere, you could be sitting in any part of the country, the world. If you had an internet connection, which after, you know, Jio and after, you know, 4G happened in our country, everybody kind of got one. If you have a phone, this is a new generation, which is, there is no generation before the present Gen Z generation that have anything in common. No two Indians are the same. Everybody has a different circumstance, different story, there's nothing unites us, nothing, not one thing, colour, caste, creed, religion, everything is different, right? But for a new generation, the Gen Z of young people, everybody, no matter what social hierarchy you were in also had like a mobile phone, because of 4G and because of like just that became your life, right, like you, everybody had to have a mobile phone, if you wanted to do anything, any kind of work, any kind of like, so even the poorest of the poor would have like some sort of a cell phone with which they would operate, right? And that phone in your hand became democracy in your hand, it became freedom in your hand, it became, you know, freedom of speech, freedom of expression in your hand, you know, YouTube happened, YouTube still required a little bit of, YouTube is where you saw the first, you know, batch of folks who broke through and said, I don't have to worry about whether it was TVF, you know, whether it was AIB, we did Vifilm, we of course had a little bit of a lot of money, I mean, a lot of money and privilege in that sense, and access in that sense, but we made our first web shows at that point of time, there was all the bunch of comedians who came from different places. And then you also had individual YouTubers, you had your Bhawanbhams of the world, you have your Prajakta Kohli's of the world, these people who are, who not really from any of the power centers historically, they have not come from the richest of backgrounds, they're not from like a quote unquote elite, you know, upbringing, they have broken through just because their talent and they had consistently and they had passion and they wanted to do it. They would not wait for, they wouldn't knock on a door, wait for someone to open it, they'd create, you know, doors, they would create the opportunities that stormed through it because the YouTube equalized everybody. At the same time, YouTube still required you to have like at least a certain sense of editing, you would still need to have editing, you'd still need to have, you know, either a camera or a phone or, you know, a phone with like a good camera. So there was still a little bit of privilege required, still a little bit of like, class, certain kind of class for you to belong to, to be able to make something for YouTube, which was long form, which was, which required a certain kind of skill that not, and not everyone with privilege had, right? And then TikTok came and TikTok even broke through that. You did not need anything apart from like any kind of a phone with a basic camera, nothing else, nothing, nothing, nothing else, one 5G connection, one phone with a camera and you can be, you can do whatever the hell you want. You can, you can record yourself doing anything. You can instantly become famous. You can instantly go viral, you know, it, it, it was the most democratic of any mediums of any art form we've ever had in India. No one before that, and you know, people would look down on it and say cringy and you know what, but that's a very classist way of looking at it. You know, look at these people, you people would look at it to laugh at it. On the other hand, you look at it to see the, the talent, the, the ambition, the aspiration, the passion, the excitement, enthusiasm that no matter which background and circumstance you have from India and, and it had people from marginalized communities speaking up. You were seeing videos of like, you know, trans kids from like smaller towns in India, you know, expressing themselves. You had most of TikTok and some of the biggest early stars of TikTok were Muslim young kids, you know, and, and you can judge them for, you know, the content they were making. But before that, no one, they were not allowed to express because where would they do it? You would require a certain amount of power and money. And that's the only way expression was always, always, always, they were gatekeepers to expression in our country and in the world. And that's why I'm saying art has always been you, people, film snobs, people who call them the film snobbish because you have a certain privilege and access to art in the first place. And if you look down on people who don't have that access or who did not have that access, that's nothing but classism, you know, so TikTok broke through that classism. And of course, invited a certain kind of judgment, which also came from classism, but it was the first and only democratic medium. And when TikTok happened, and you know, when YouTube happened, and when you know, people started coming on the internet and expressing themselves as authentically as possible. You see the correlation because I was there. I can tell you the correlation at that time was that and I've been I've been on those panels. I've had those conversations 2014-15 with filmmakers saying that, you know, looking at what is working on the internet and saying that, you know, maybe we should start talking about the things that they're talking about, you know, and suddenly you had those stories that were suddenly socially conscious, they didn't just come out of the blue. Every filmmaker and producer who punted on those things, they punted on it because they realized that the internet is making those, you know, conversations happen and they were happening very actively and it was engaging conversations. People were watching YouTube videos on body positivity. So let we can do Dhamaka Ayesha, when you're watching films on, you know, a web show on man's world that I had done, which was which had which as I said, has like some 90 million views right now, across all its episodes, it is on gender inequality. And it's a and people watch that and you see the comments on that people are saying for the first time we are having this conversation. So when you do that, a Ki and Ka becomes possible and I'm not saying there's a direct. It's not like R. Balki saw that and said, let me make a Ki and Ka, but it would not have happened. Arjun Kapoor would not have, you know, five years ago, someone who's launched himself with Ishaq Zadeh would not have done a Ki and Ka where, you know, he's the house home house husband, so to speak and homemaker and the woman is going and earning, but those conversations are happening because of the internet and because of YouTube and because of Tik Tok. If Tik Tok weren't banned, I feel like we would have seen a different and you saw you saw a different kind of a young superstar that was rising, you know, who like the idea of Vijay and Amitabh Bachchan and and the angry young man, you had a different kind of actual young boy with an identity who would you would not associate with a certain class or a certain community or a certain idea of what should be a success successful name. Maybe those names were not people think names that you would know how to pronounce because they would come from any different part of the country, you know, but the ban unfortunately like stopped it in its tracks and today again you have all these kind of platforms and it's still still people are still people who go viral, they're still stars that kind of have overnight successes, you know, so to speak, but it's not you still it still comes from a certain class background. You kind of see that very obviously, you know, you you people who get internet culture people who have the wherewithal the the access again the privilege the the education the in jokes, you know to understand that this is what is going to work on the internet and doing it you still have people, you know, and Amit Bhadana kind of, you know, in Haryanvi will do something you have like this really interesting platform by the folks who were actually, you know, started, I forget the name of the organization, but we're in dreamers as well who started"

I don't know, you know, the power structures are still very much based out of Bombay, Delhi, you know, the money flows through there. So but there is, you know, money that is also coming in and I'm sure that at some point they will notice. I saw that when I think either Praveen or Vinay, we're having a conversation online. I saw that they had come to Bombay too and they went to the sets of Nikhil Advani's show Mumbai Diaries. So clearly like filmmakers also taking note and saying like who are these interesting, you know, young people who are doing something in regional using the internet and ultimately they have access to communities and audiences that we may not have. So in the need to find those audiences, which they can obviously monetize, maybe our films will change. But my big worry is that they're only going to change because South films are the biggest hits right now. So our films will also start again replicating the success formula of South films and South films and big blockbusters, unfortunately have never, you know, gotten, have never had an evolved understanding of gender. That's my worry that again, that'll make a big comeback again in Bollywood because that's what's working. That's the formula. Everyone's right, right. And then we're going to go backward."

        "message": "So in the very fascinating episode I did with Vinay, he pointed out one interesting thing. He said that stage is doing so well that there's now a reverse migration. Ki Haryana se ya Rajasthan se jo bachche aate the Bombay mein film banane ke liye, ab wapal ja rahe hai because they can make it in their language. And not just a language, their dialect, like I'd encourage all listeners who haven't already heard it to listen to my episode with Vinay because the profound point there was about how it was of a kind of localization, like I was always worried about homogenization happening in our society. One point that Vinay made really well was ki shaher mein bhasha hoti hai, shaher ke bahar boli hoti hai. You know, a city will have a language and outside a city you'll have dialects. And the typical pressure used to be that a small kid will, like Vinay, born in a Haryanvi village, he'll speak a particular dialect, but he'll go to the city and he'll feel inferior because you know, everybody else seems more sophisticated outside and looking in border wale like that beautiful term. And the incentive will be to speak to Hindi and so all the dialects die out and that these main languages Hindi, Bengali and all of those remain. But what is happening here is kind of the opposite, which is incredibly inspiring that, you know, so many people tell him that they feel so empowered. You know, people will go and tell him ki are all my life has spoken Haryanvi, but I was embarrassed about it. But now I'm feeling ki theek hai, no, I can take pride in my culture. And it's an incredibly inspiring story. And I completely agree so much with what you said about snobs, like no disrespect to snobs"

        "message": "But you know, one thing, one thing I tell my writing students also is that read whatever you enjoy reading. You know, koi hierarchy nahi hai, ki is bookne yeh prize jeeta hai, yeh toh somehow you got to struggle through it. No, everything that captures your attention is doing something right. You will learn from it, you will internalize that stuff by osmosis, you'll pick up those tricks and all that. I want to ask you a question about structure in the context of actual filmmaking, right? Now, to take a step back in the creator economy, one of the really heartening things that I've seen happening over the last decade or so, is what Kevin Kelly wrote about in his famous essay, 1000 true fans has kind of happened, like Kevin Kelly wrote this cult essay around 2009 2010, called 1000 true fans. And his point was that creators will not have to scale anymore. In the past, your model always has been ki aapko scale karna hai, right? So your top 1% of people make a lot of money, everybody else is struggling and you know, having cutting chai in the tapris or varsova. But his point was that now you don't have to scale a creator. If you can find 1000 fans who pay you $100 a year, that's $100,000, right? And when he wrote that, it wasn't happening. But he was very prescient, because it is happening today. It is definitely happening today, like on Substack, for example, that $100 a year is your standard, this thing and all kinds of people who haven't been heard of before are literally making millions doing that. So it has completely become possible. And in the audiovisual medium, the tools of production have become superbly democratized. Really, anybody I think today, if they have the will, can actually make a film, right? Like a one great example is a Japanese film, One Cut of the Dead, amazing film, which was made for the equivalent of 20 lakhs and made the equivalent of 200 crores, something like that. And, you know, no film has really filled me with the joy of cinema, as that did. So the thing is, you know, if you have the will, you can make a film for 20 lakhs now. But the bottleneck is the distribution. And part of the problem there is, the model through which we consume cinema is this very weird model, where a lot of people congregate in a big hall and watch a film together, right? And if you think about it in isolation, we've normalized that model. But if you think about it in isolation, or if an alien had to come to this planet and think about how do we entertain people, this would seem like a very stupid model, because this requires you to scale, right? Now, what we have seen creators doing in the audiovisual medium is you don't have to scale, you had TikTok, which you still have elsewhere, you have YouTube, YouTube creators don't need to scale anymore, you know, but in terms of actual cinematic storytelling, this still seems like a fundamental bottleneck, ki aise kyu hai? Maybe there's there are intermediate models, like you have small halls, which people can just book online, pachas log kuch dekhna chahate hain, bees log kuch dekhna chahate hain, you have a room somewhere. What is also another trend that seems to be happening is that the kind of films which succeed in big theatres are now the spectacle films which require the big theatres. So your Marvel Cinematic Universe and RRR and all that, and the intimate cinema, you expect that to move to OTT and all of that, toh Ingmar Bergman OTT pe aap dekho, aur you know, Steven Spielberg aap hall pe jaake dekho. You know, so what is your thought of this structurally? Because again, it seems that, you know, I feel like 15 years later, everything will be different. But we can't imagine how because it's unknown unknowns. But right now what we have is an artefact of the past that we are somehow kind of, you know, still struggling with. So my question is structurally, how do you think we can get past this? The fact that the means of production are in everybody's hand, aap aur main agar ek idea karte hain, bana sakte hain in very little money, you know, but it will not find a thousand true fans even if they exist. The bottleneck is there."

        "message": "See, you are talking about structure purely because you're talking about film in the long form medium, right? But that is not the only way of making film now. What people are doing with one and a half minutes right now is also filmmaking, you know, and you can consume for one hour, you know, 30 of those, 40 of those videos or you can spend that one hour in watching one episode of a web show or you can spend, you know, James Gunn said this brilliant thing where he said that, you know, I mean, some of it I'm going to add to it, but because I'm going to Indianize it, but like when you watch a film in India, let's say, let's say an example, you have to spend half a day of your time to go and watch that film. There's half a day of your life that you have to take away. It's a community experience because India mein films again, to go into the history, logic, et cetera, the highest crossing film in India at a 500, 700 crores, which is RRR or Bahubali has been watched by 4% of Indians in theaters. That's how many people it takes to watch the highest crossing 4% of film people going to theaters. Some of them are going for the second time, people, families in India go for films at a, on a Diwali or an Eid or one of those, because it's an expensive medium. So it is community viewing because of that. It isn't family outing. You go to the park every day, which is free. And then when you have a little bit of money for the middle class or, you know, upwardly mobile, you know, then you go and kind of, uh, go and watch a film, take your whole family and say, which is why the stars also happen because you go and watch the film of that one person that you kind of know historically, you will not go and watch the film of a younger person. And when nationalistic or patriotic films happened, they kind of, uh, you know, said you don't need to know who's in it as, because it is about your country or the issue that you care about. You're going as a community to watch that and say, okay, I want to know what happened to my community. So that is an example. So theaters in India and films that many people anyway don't watch very, very, very few people watch films, but because they're so big and there's so much money that is thrown at them and they're so visible. You have this, the reason in India that people are supersized because of satellite and now because of the internet. But before it was satellite, when we film would come to TV, TV rights for films go up to 50, 60, 70 crores because that is because TV was in every home theater is not. Everybody cannot afford the theater because and there's a half a day. Think about it, right? Like, you know, you are going from one place to another place and traffic you are signing, you know, I mean, okay, you buy a ticket online, but you, if you have to buy popcorn, that's another, this money also gone thousand rupees for this popcorn, but if you're not buying it, you go sit inside the theater, you have to wait for 15 minutes by the rides, you know, and then finally after like one and a half hours of you just waiting or two hours, maybe sometimes you just kind of get to watch the film, then you see, you know, the first time and then you're like, oh my God, I've just wasted my entire day because I've spent this money and this is a bad film. So you lose and you don't just lose time and money. Yes, you don't just lose money, you lose almost a half a day of your life, after which you have to go finish it because you're paid for it. You don't even leave midway. So at the end of it, you go back and then six hours of your life gone. You know, on the other hand, on the internet, you have the privilege and the power that if you just sample something on Netflix, on Amazon, on any of these platforms, if you lose, it's okay. You're watching three, four minutes. I don't like this. I'll go to watch something else. So you're not really losing that much time, just three to four minutes. But if you win, which is like if you see something that you love, then you suddenly win 10 hours of it. You have like 10 episodes. You're like, oh great. Now my whole weekend is sorted. Now I can watch this and binge it and do like one, two, three, four. So it's a victory or defeat that people psychologically feel when, you know, and why right now people are much more comfortable with watching films, you know, at home versus in theater. So as an idea also, I just, I think I, I don't, I don't think that it's a, I don't believe that films have ever been structurally, the long form has been that important. It has been a means of entertainment for people, you know, and entertainment today is people are competing for time. They are not competing for, you know, entertainment as an example, right? A theater is competing with Facebook, which is competing with TikTok, which is competing with, I mean, I'm talking about obsolete mediums now, but it is completely Insta Reels, which is competing with a standup show, which is competing with a, with a, you know, a music live performance, which is competing with a spoken word, which is competing with cat videos on YouTube that you're just scrolling through mindlessly or Insta stories that you're going through. Your time is the commodity that everybody's after, right? And, and, and the idea of entertainment also for most people now has been because especially after the pandemic is now this, we are so conditioned to need and consume and inhale this entertainment that us, you, if you get up right now and walk out, I will immediately have my phone, not just to see, like, maybe I'll see my messages and what, then that's the first 30 seconds. But after that, I'm immediately going and seeing Insta stories or going through Twitter."

Immediate reaction, anybody's instant reaction, the moment, like you're in a deep conversation and somebody has, wait, I have a, you know, I have one second of work, the phone comes out and the phone, you're not, as I said, you're not just checking it for information or somebody's reaching or am I reachable or not reachable? That might be the first instance. The second instance, what can I see in like nibbles of entertainment? So we do a lot of research at you also, we do a, we have a whole research vertical. So we kind of divide it into, you know, food into, so we divided entertainment, you know, categories for young people into how they consume. So this nibble content, nibble content is the kind of content that you are mindlessly consuming in between conversations. Sometimes I might be talking to you and I might just kind of open the, while you said something and I'm just like, okay, I might open a phone, just see three stories and keep that's nibble content. Then you have, you have your, you know, snacks, snacky content, where you have, where you go to, instead of Insta story, you might go to YouTube because you have a 10 minute windows somewhere in between. You might be traveling, you might be, you know, in a college, in a class, etc. And then you have 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, you might see a YouTube video, you might see 5-6 Insta Reels today, you might have any other form of entertainment. Then you have your full meal content, which is the time you actually with your, at the time when you are having food, when you are with your family, you see, you decide to say that I will watch a series now or like a long form, you know, piece of fiction or whatever it is. And every bit of our life now is filled with entertainment. Structures don't matter anymore. And to your point about why we why there is this stupid idea of, you know, going to theaters. I mean, I already told you that it was a community experience, because that's how you, you know, families would go and families have historically gone and you know, it's an outing for the whole family when you go and watch a film. But outside of that, it is one of the last few places now to I think it's become even more important. One of the last few places where you have a collective experience, where else are you having collective human experiences and when you are watching a film in theater, why is it so important? How do you feel? I feel it's important. I don't think it is. I don't think it is necessary. I don't think that I think it is. It is becoming obsolete and and I hope it doesn't die. But I think it is very important because that collective experience of laughing, crying, the thrill of a horror film, everybody collectively gasping when you're watching something makes you again feel less alone. You're kind of you realize that you're part of a human race, you are part of it's beautiful. I think it's just so beautiful when you are, you know, when there's an emotional scene and you have tears in your eyes and you hear another person sniffing and you're like, okay, I'm not alone in like feeling sad or emotional at this point. I think that's a very important part of a human experience that we can only get while watching live, either watching a music performance or watching a sports match or, you know, in a theater, but there's no other place where you can have a collective human experience like that. So it is important only for that reason. No other reason. Necessary? No, I don't think anymore. I don't think it doesn't matter anymore. You know, even a 30 second Instagram reel is a film. And if anybody says it's not film, again, I think it's coming from place of elitism. If you're saying that, oh, it's too easy. It's not easy. I, I tried making it difficult. It is. And young people are inherently recognizing the power and potential of these 30 seconders to and saying such interesting things, they're doing it in such interesting ways. They're I mean, the talent on like these short form mediums is incredible. Who are we to say this is not a film? It is a film. It is very much a film. So, I mean, yeah, I feel like, I feel like, you know, we the future of overall film is, is, is these broken down things, you know, I feel which is and while we need those larger experiences when it comes to I think, I think in the internet and particularly now places like stage, as you said, you know, are going to fill those needs where again, you're talking about indie films, you know, coming on or the Bergman films, you know, coming on the internet that's actually stopped happening already. So you don't have more indie films anymore on these mediums, you actually have far more masala films because because and this is another thing that I've kind of realized that people what people don't go to people don't watch these films because they're great content on YouTube on by paying subscription, they watch these films because they're bad films and you don't when you have and you watch it because they're mindless. You watch it because you don't, you know, you're, you're not wasting money. It's almost free and you're watching free, mindless, stupid content. You don't, it's very rare now to have intimate and experiences with cinema. Again those are, those are art and I would love, I would love for us to have more of those experiences. I miss those experiences. I grew up in the nineties on indie films and indie expression and clerks, you know, to Steven Soderbergh to Kevin Smith and all the folks, you know, Sofia Coppola, all the folks and their beautiful, beautiful films as an indie Richard Linklater, of course, one of my heroes, you know, but but those films now, you know, maybe need to be self-distributed. Platforms are not going to pick those films anymore because platforms are going to offer the thing that is going to make you stay there and what makes you stay on most of these platforms after your tired day where you have worked your ass off, you're sitting with your family and you're not trying to just have a good time is mindless, stupid films, you're throwing"

So that is your Bergman films, Fellini films, so on and so forth. And I'm big fans of those guys. The bad, good film is a film that is trying to do something like that, but is basically boring the pants out of you, which I would say is like money call on, you know, that then a good, bad film is a film that technically you're not supposed to watch guilty pleasure, but it's mind blowing.

I can't cry otherwise. I mean, I can't cry. If I want to cry right now, I will try my best when I can't cry. And when I feel really, and this is just, I mean, so sad when I even say it out loud, but when I feel really like sad, and I want to cry, I didn't go and watch an emotional film so that I will have tears. So I'm like, at least this is the way that I'm able to, that is the level of toxic that masculinity is in me, conditioned in me, that I am unable to cry otherwise. When my grandfather passed away, and I was as close to him, I, and in fact, the reason that I came to NID Kurukshetra was because it's next to Karnal. And my grandfather and my maasi lived in Karnal. And I wanted to spend, I'd never, I loved my grandfather, but never spent any time with him. So I wanted to live close to him. And then weekends I would spend with him. So I was like, very fortunate to have gotten some time with him. When he died, for two days, I couldn't cry, just could not cry. Why? Because I was, my maasi was crying nonstop, just consoling her. I was just like, suddenly I fell into the duty of my man. Okay, my manly duty is that I have to take care of all the guests. My maasi is in no condition. So I will take care of all the arrangements. I'll tell you, tell me what she's, it's not that she wasn't doing, she was doing a lot of stuff herself, but she was broken. And her, my uncle hadn't reached yet. My mother from Barain hadn't reached yet. Nobody had been able to reach at that time. So a whole day, day and a half, I was just taking care of all the duties of the, of a household where someone's passed away without, when my friends came to be like, we're sorry from Kurukshetra, you know, how are you feeling, et cetera. And I'm like, sad, didn't have tears. It's only when one and a half days later, when my mother and I got a quiet moment and my mother just asked me, how are you feeling that I burst into tears. I was, and then I was inconsolable because just that moment of her reaching out and actually caring about my own emotion and being like, how are you feeling? I was just like, that's it. I just had tears. But I can't cry otherwise. It's very difficult for me to cry. I yeah, and, and, and films have, and that is also why I am, I, I love film so much because as a man, I'm able to feel things and feel emotions or give space to those emotions that I'm otherwise hiding away or I'm otherwise suppressing. So, so films have been the most important friend that I've had growing up. It has, it has, it has been, yeah, films and shows and, you know, art, cinema, whatever you want to call it, have been like a lifesaver for me. It made me in a world where I was struggling to fit in, it helped me like find a space for a man who was trying to cry, but not able to."

In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009, and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day, and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now, I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast, and about much else. So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com and subscribe. It is free. And once you sign up, each new installment that I write will land up in your email inbox. You don't need to go anywhere. So subscribe now for free. The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you. Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Nikhil Taneja about his fascinating life and work and so on. And let's now come back to sort of the chronological narrative. You pointed out key engineering was basically your gap years, where you were figuring out what to do with your life. Tell me a little bit about this process. Because you know, when I look back on my college years, and when I speak to others as well who've come on the show, what I find is key, there are two kinds of pulls and pressures happening. And one is you want to fit in with your peers, you want to fit in with the cool boys or you want to, you know, so you're molding yourself to kind of fit in or to whatever, you know, similar to the pressure of being a man in a sense. And the other is you're trying to figure yourself out, find yourself and very often you're constructing for yourself a self image of what you want to be seen as rather than trying to actually understand who you really are. Now I'm guessing that since you landed up there as the NRI cool boy, I guess that pressure would not have been so intense, the first pressure of fitting in and so on. But through your life, how has that process been of getting to understand yourself a little better? You've already spoken about how the therapy you did later on in dealing with anxiety kind of helped with an aspect of that. But in general, take me through this process of understanding who you are and what you are and coming to terms with it."

And as I said, I started writing, I started furiously, you know, there's this incident that happened much later, which was actually quite like sweet when I met a college friend many years later. And, you know, I was in Hindustan three, four years after college, I was still in Hindustan and I was earning a lot of, not earning too much again, you know, 14 and a half thousand for two and a half years in Bombay, you know, it's just tough. I met like a friend who had gone to US after that. And he came back from the US and just came for a visit or something. And I just met him and I was just, he's like, how's life, I was like, I'm not really happy right now. Because he's like, because I'm not earning the money, you know, I don't know if I'll be successful or not. And he's not someone I kind of was very close with, you know, he's just someone like I was friends with, but not very close friends with. So he just said, he's like, are you mad? You're going, you know, it's like, why, what happened? He's like, he's like, I haven't, you were the only person in our college where all of us were, you know, we used to drink and study, so we sat in our room, you were churning out issues of your magazine, you know, you were the only one who was, who was late till three o'clock in the, in the night, trying to make something out of your life, while the rest of us were, you know, just doing nonsense. And there is, even if you're not successful right now, there's no chance you won't be in the future. So I feel like, as I said, I still have some, you know, until like someone else tells me, I never look at myself as like, you know, I'm doing enough for whatever reasons.

But, but yeah, like, you know, I just, beyond a point, I didn't have enough things, you know, times or reasons to hang out with, you know, you hang out with your friends until they start drinking, because after they're drinking, then it's just a drunken conversation where you are the sober person, you're like, what am I doing here? So you don't have those conversations. I did. Although, on the other hand, I think while I didn't learn much about myself, I learned a lot about India, you know, because, again, fortunately, unfortunately, there's no LAN in our, this is 2004 to 2008. That's where I studied. 2000, there was no LAN in our college. And there was only like one computer center where you had internet. So in your hostel, and because Haryana and North India, and there's always power cuts. So every night for one and a half hours, the electricity would just go off. And then what do you do? Your phone at that time, again, was expensive. So you can't call people until I think my third year things became inexpensive and you had free calling and free messaging, or whatever. And that's the year I made a girlfriend. So clearly, thank you Airtel. But before that, you didn't even know enough, I mean, while you had that one number after that incident, I was like, I'm never calling a woman in my life now. But so what did you do? And I kind of started after like getting really bored and, you know, talking to my roommates and my roommates, I didn't really get along within the first couple of I mean, decent people just didn't have much in common. I started recognizing that, you know, well, I'm in this campus where there are these people from all over the country, from every state of India. I have every day there's a power cut, I have nothing to do, nobody can do anything in first year. So maybe I'll just go and like, find the stories of others, right? And it wasn't like a conscious, like, I'm going to find the stories of others. It was more like, let me just go and chat with other people, right? So I just go up to somebody's room and like, I've never met and just knock on their door and be like, you know, we stayed the same, you know, yeah, same hostel or the same floor or whatever it is. And we've never spoken. So yeah, I'm Nikhil and this is where I'm from, I'd love to know a little bit about you. And then suddenly, like some of those conversations would go nowhere, people were just also not very open. And then some of them would just turn into like really deep conversations. And and sometimes I would have it only once in like, I've spoken to some people during power cuts once and never spoken to them again, beyond hi, hello for the rest of my college life. But that one conversation was deep enough for me to kind of, you know, like if I if we ever see each other in public, we hug the hell out of each other and just be like, Oh, my God, like, so great to see you after all these years. So because of that, I kind of got a sense and understanding of, you know, the stories of others. And I think that helped me recognize a little bit of our own story as well. I didn't know what stories were, I didn't know that, you know, like, again, self awareness neither you didn't have the internet, I, you didn't, as even though I was writing for a newspaper, you know, or a magazine at that time, even at that time, I did not have like Chetan Bhagat did not exist at that time. Even at that time, there was no example, a public example of, you know, people who could have stories like mine. And most of the stories I would hear of people who kind of did the other thing, right? So you kind of also connected with that somebody who's a lovely singer, I would find out, you know, who's come from this. But the reason that I'm like, why don't you go into one of these reality shows and like, you know, try singing, just be like, I'm the only child of my family. And or I'm the, you know, elder son of my family. And my aim is to make it to Microsoft. Because that's the way I mean, I need to my parents have put so much money, you know, I need to be the return on investment for them. And for whatever it was that boy is in Microsoft now. And you know, he's made it but he's a beautiful singing voice, which I don't know if anybody will ever get to listen to beyond like, the close circle of friends that he may have, which is also okay, you know, I mean, sure. But I'm just saying like, so many stories that I would hear from so many people from all these different parts of India, there's a boy from like, Jammu and Kashmir. That I was, it just helped me recognize that, there are so many stories, you know, and every story kind of has a, you know, starts with, you know, I mean, nobody really knows where it's leading. Nobody is aware that, you know, which act of our stories are we are in. But there is something there, you know, that, that somewhere makes you recognize that you are also a story, you know, where I feel like all of us look at each, I mean, so NID Gurushekhar also how we call each other, you know, after a point of time, either we make boys by surname, but in our culture, you know, you start calling from wherever you are, so the boy from Bareta, you know, is called Bareta. The boy from Jammu is called Jammu, you know, Jammu, come here, Bareta, come here."

There's a backbencher, there's a frontbencher, there's a gissu kid, there's a frustu kid, all these terms that we used to give each other, you know. But beyond that, they all had like this really deep stories that even they wouldn't ever think about. But that's all I could think about. I can't get out of my mind that there is a boy who has such a beautiful singing voice, but who's, you know, because he's the eldest son of the family has to only, you know, study and do engineering because he has to get into a certain place and he has to make his family circumstance better. Now that's because I have the privilege to not think at that time, I'd found myself having the privilege to not think about and yet I was not living my own story. I was also doing engineering, even though I liked writing and I was writing in newspapers and magazines and I created my own magazine. I've done everything, but I was not doing and you know, funnily what happened and such a funny random thing sometimes that happens to you that like puts you on a different path. One of my first roommates in my second year, actually first year only afterwards, the second roommate I ever had, who I became very good friends with in year one. I had met him. I mean, we had not spoken for a bit. We had become decent friends, but never for a, we just kind of lost touch in the middle. We were in different sections and different batches. One day again, power cut happened, fourth year, final year of college. I've already got two jobs. I've got Accenture, CSE, bit of sort in that sense and you know, I'm like, now I'm chilling as a senior, nothing to do, two jobs, you can't get more, like to cap at two. This guy meets me in a power cut, he's like, how's your life going, kaise chal rahi hai zindagi? I'm just like, yaar, accha chal raha hai, got two jobs, etc. He's like, acha, tu bhi yeh hi karega, tu ne toh bola tha ki, I mean, tere uska kya hua writing, writing ga, tu bahut likhta tha us time par bhi, young times, old times, four years ago. I was like, haan, main soch raha hun ki, and this was my plan at that time, ki main, you know, one of the jobs, CSE, will give me Bombay as the, which is the place you want to be located. They give you the option. I will go to Bombay and, you know, main din mein yeh karunga, side mein na main, you know, writing karunga, and that's how, like, it's my plan right now. Aur jab wo chalne lag jayega, then I will leave it and do this. And this guy is just very nonchalantly, in the complete nonchalance, said like, he's like, haan, sahi idea hai, tu aisa karna, tu pehle Bombay jaana, side mein yeh karna, phir tu MBA karna, side mein writing karna, phir shadi karna, side mein writing karna, phir bache karna, side mein writing karna, phir tu ek din mar jayega na, tu writing side mein rehgi. You know, aur bolte bolte bol gaya, and you know, chal bhai, what, I mean, you do just like, I, suddenly my life flashed in my entire, in front of my eyes, and I was like, that is so true. I could just be doing this, and that's what I'd been doing till then, since 14 to now, I was 20 at that time, 6 years, all of this were, these were side pursuits for me. They were never the, because, again, arts nahi kar sakte hai, toh hobby hai, this cannot be your live stream. And then I realized, like, I have, I now already had two jobs, and one of them was in, you know, July, I had to join in July, and one I have to join in August. My college finished in April. So then I was like, from the time this conversation happened, which I think would have been in the end of first semester, beginning of second semester, I said, I have now 6 to 8 months. He's absolutely right. Let me give it a shot. Let me try. Why am I saying that ki side mein karenge? If I get a job, I will go for it. If I get a good job. I already have like a safety net now. I need to give it a shot. I did everything possible. I reached out to like, anybody, you know, I used to blog a lot at that time on a website called on a forum called Zanga. So Zanga pe na logon ko, do you know anybody like, you know, in Bombay who would want to, you know, hire me and here's my resume or whatever. And my resume was like a lot of writing, of course, engineering college student, but a lot of writing that I'd done. I'd also started writing for Jam, which I think again is a rite of passage for most people at that time, you know, so, and kahi na kahi after like hundreds of attempts and hundreds of people, do you know, do you have a cousin in Bombay? Do you have somebody who knows somebody, etc, etc. Itne emails bheje maine, puri list mein, I remember like sabko, jiten logon jana tha ki Bombay kuch ko jante ho, media ke andar, I tried in NDTV, I tried in MTV, I tried everywhere. And then some, one of my junior's sister was working in Hindustan Times. She passed on my resume to Khalid Muhammad, who was the editor at HD Cafe. And yeah, I got a call and said, you know, very interesting CV, you guys want, you want to come over to Bombay? Can you come tomorrow for an interview? I was like, I'm in Karnal. So sure. Immediately, shyaam ko maine, subhe aagle din flight pagdi, Bombay mein mohacha, I'd add a folder of all the articles that I'd done. So it's like, what all have you done? I was like, yeh lo mera folder. So it was young times, you know, this, that, etc. So he's like, okay, great, you seem to be like young and smart, etc. This is what we can pay you. Yeah, you want to join? I said, oh yeah, so easily. And yeah, I never had to intern for whatever it's worth. And next day, I joined HD. And I mean, they told me literally that giving me some, you know, one week ka time diya tha, the one week I'd taken. Next day, I went back, came back a week later, 2008 July and joined HD. But it is, it is, it is through somebody else that I realized that this should be, this is what I should be doing. But and I had asked my mother for that. I mean, I didn't tell my mother, you know, at that time that I'm going to be applying to other places. I said, job mili viye hai. And then when I got this job, then I said, listen, so I have these two jobs, but I also have Hindustan Times now. And it's since it's HD, you know, and I'd also gotten jobs in two other, I'd got a job in OML, I'd got a job in a PR agency called Pink Relations, I remember. And so I'd got three jobs, and then I had to choose now, OML was paying me a little bit more than HD. Pink Relations was also paying me a little bit more. But HD was HD. So I was like, I mean, I can't now, Khalid Mohammed was somebody again, I read his newspaper, you know, reviews. I was like, if he's going to be my boss, I mean, I want to do this. Yeah, I came to Bombay, and you know, it's, and it's taken me until from that time on. But I think that's the first thing where again, an external circumstance and the second part would be my teaching. Hearing the stories of my students, you know, made me recognize that I need to introspect deeper into what is my own. Of course, anxiety and therapy were the big, ultimate points of transition in me recognizing became like Imtiaz Ali movie character, I took a sabbatical after, you know, so one of the things in therapy that after this whole conversation that I had, where she told me like, I had to figure out what do I want to do after I came back from goalkeepers from after that panic attack, I just came back and I decided that I realized what I want to do in life. I first want to quit. I don't think I can do my job, you know, and I need to give myself time. I need to take time to find out what is my story. And I and I and I decided to just and I told this, I remember I told this to my therapist, I was like, I decided I'm going to quit YRF and she's like, that's not what I told you. I told you to introspect. I didn't tell you to quit your job. I was like, no, no, I'm quitting. How can you quit YRF? She was like shocked. My parents, everybody was like, you are doing really well at YRF, don't quit. And and I was just but I was sure that I needed to give myself some time to figure out what is my story. And in those six and I took and I quit and I ultimately they were very kind, YRF was super kind. They've always been so kind to me, but they said like, you know, you take to you instead of like quitting, just take three months. And after three months, you tell us, do you want to continue or don't want to continue? That's fine. So after two months only, I knew that I didn't want to continue, but I so I kind of scrubbed off everything, left everything, left my teaching, left film companion, left YRF, left everything, switched off my phone, went to Bahrain, you know, with my parents for a few months. And to just and then I traveled a little bit, I kind of put a post online. And that's where I think even the Yuva's idea really started. I put a post online where I just told, you know, that I want to, I have quit my job. I have some time. I want to meet students across the country. If you are in a college in somewhere, please call me. I'd love to come over. So college in Indore called me, a college in Bangalore called me, a college in Bhubaneshwar called me. And I just went in all these different places and just met students for two to three days and speaking to them. And after all the work, I mean, all my teaching, and I know I've not spoken much about it, but teaching was the most transformative thing that has happened to me. You know, it is, yeah, because I think I entered teaching. I entered teaching with this idea with like that I am going to change people's lives, you know, and the reason for that was also because of my time at NID Kurukshetra. After a point of time when I had a full sense of my privilege, I just wanted to, for whatever it's worth, I just wanted to do whatever I can to give back. When I got a job, again, I'll tell you privilege ka kaise realization ho, when I got my job in CSC. CSC is a big company, right? Like, you know, when for computer and computer students, it's a big deal. And I got it very easily, like, in you know, how are these first whatever I was technically proficient enough to clear technical, I was not like the best student, I was like seven point something I'd gotten a seven pointer, but but it was technically decent enough and smart enough to crack their test or whatever it is. And then the big challenge would come in the HR round for most people, because you have to be comfortable with comfortable in speaking to English and you have to comfortable in the corporate structure. And English to mujhe aati di and I can talk to people. So the HR round was never an issue. So I'd go into HR and immediately I'd get a job. So two places I applied to two places I got a job in, right and CSC. So I got a job and I was like, Oh, no big deal, kitti aasani se mil gayi. And I remember that I'd come to my room after getting the CSC job and I was like, what, you know, theek hai, I told my parents ki mil gayi job agara. And I remember, there's this other guy who'd also got, you know, this job in CSC, who had never really interacted with much beyond, he was in a different section, a different course also. And he just came to my room and he's like, tujhe CSC mil gayi, maine ka haan, he's like meri bhi aayi and he burst into tears. He was so emotional. He's like, matlab kap se sapna dekh raha tha yeh job mil jaye CSC and he was like a nine pointer and he's like mujhe itni mushkil hui thi mujhe jana hai, matlab main toh dar gaya tha JD mein, PI mein, kya hoga, kya nahi hoga and I was like, what is a cakewalk for me? This boy's like, gotten so emotional and I just felt like, man, you know, this shouldn't be that easy for me, like, or whatever, you know, you kind of have this and I was also, you know, just so you also know right now, I'd come from NRI Kota, okay, so I'm not like, so I was also, I constantly aware that, you know, I am here on a seat where I'm paying and all of these people have worked much harder than me to be here, whether I deserve it or not is, I was always thinking, do I deserve it or not deserve it? And what am I doing to make use of this seat? And then I was just like, I need to give back. So I started a club in my college called Aspire, where I was like, now I'm going to dedicate the rest of my, after I've gotten these jobs, I'm going to dedicate the rest of my time at NID Kurukshetra to teaching public speaking to, you know, or GDPI to get, you know, my juniors to clear them. So that's, and I, I think for six months, I just did that, like, in fact, it was so sweet, like, then professors that coming to me saying, can you also involve me, I would also learn to love like to learn. And I'd done post masters in Bahrain and whatnot. So I kind of created a structure basis that but I, that's really also where I kind of realized that the joy of, of sharing, or teaching or, you know, helping out in whatever way possible and using a privilege in a, in a manner where it's where someone else is benefiting off of what you got so easily. And even though, as I've said, it wasn't like my whole life has been a piece of cake with my parents and whatnot in Bahrain and I said, a lot of bullying had also happened. And at the same time, after that, it just stuck to me that, you know, this is something that I want to continue doing. So when I joined HT, I used to have interns, like nobody, no one knew what they were doing in BMM. So I just asked one of my friends, who was also a professor at Jain, who had become a professor at Jain, I also want to teach because I want to teach like journalism to, you know, these young people because they clearly like don't know the structure of writing or whatever they come in. You know, I don't want people to, I can help them. So I came with this, this, this messiah severe complex that I had helped people in NID Kurukshetra and now it become like, now I'm going to change the lives of the kids. And because there, anybody like, when you got a job, you will get emotional calls from people. Sir, I got a job. Because we used to call seniors, sir, you know, all like, thank you for like that course and that changed my life, I was hearing this and I was, my heart was getting full and I was like, man, I made a difference. And then I went to college in Jain college in Mumbai, and no one gives a shit about the professors over there. No one cares. You can have like this notions and narcissistic notions of like giving back. They don't want to receive. They're like, screw you. You are anyway three years older than us and you want to change our lives, please, bro, think about yourself. I used to have students come to me after my first batch, it was such a big disaster. My first batch students would like message me on Facebook messages saying, like, this is maybe how you should go about teaching students are advising me how to be a better teacher. I was like, this is and I was so like disappointed with the way the first batch went, because I'd come with these really wrong notions that I want to give back that in the second batch, I wanted to teach one more batch, even the teacher was, you know, like the coordinator recognized I failed a little bit in the first batch, although I taught a lot of, you know, which nobody cared about also, because like in a BMM batch of 30-40 students, only three want to be journalists. The rest of them anyway want to do other things. So why am I doing news reporting to people, how do they write, what is the structure. So second time, I just wanted to kind of, I was like, I'm a little bit more humility and go into it with the intent of not just teaching, but also learning, not just talking, but also listening. And that I did not recognize at that time, but it became a it was a radical thing I ended up doing without recognizing or realizing it. Because what started happening is because I was so curious and eager to listen to them and kind of non-judgmentally learn from them, I came off my high horse and being like, I'm, you know, I'm not a teacher here, I mean, while I'm a teacher, but I'm really here to listen to you. I want to hear your thoughts, your opinions on, I mean, from journalism topics or what's happening in the world, but like, let's chat, let's talk, here's a topic I want everyone to have their voice. And I'd reach out to people and say, you know, this is your voice, tell me, tell me, tell me. And then slowly students outside of class hours would start coming to me and saying, you know, thank you for just like asking me to speak up or it was tough for me, but like you made it really comfortable and then would tell me other problems of their life. You know, I have this issue with my parents, what do I do? And I'm just like, I don't know, like, you know, so I would still give them whatever little bit of advice that I could, you know, in whatever more experience I had in life. But I also had a recognizing that every one of these kids would come in and talk about these things that they cared about. And somehow they were not talking to each other. I'm like, you said a problem, you said a problem, Sonu's problem is the same, but you're not talking to each other. This person sits, you know, I mean, Bombay, just again, there's an ecosystem of like hierarchies we've spoken about, right? There's a hierarchy of how people sit in a Bombay classroom. So there is a, there is a Bandra club of people who sit in, in one bunch, you know, who were, who would always sit in a, and again, you know, this is, this is, this is just what I saw in my classroom. Also the kids from Bandra was just not interested in like, you know, journalism or news reporting, you know, they were always like, in fact, I've had one of the Bandra students come to me and again, I'm not stereotyping, this is just how it was in my class. No disrespect. No disrespect. But Bandra kids have come to me and said, would you like to smoke weed? I'm like, I'm your professor, please can you not ask me that question, bro, do you want to smoke? I'm like, what are you saying? First of all, you shouldn't be smoking up a second, you should not be telling me to smoke up. If you want to do it, do it outside the class, please don't come in the middle of the class at the time of college school. They were, they were, they were kids from, for example, Navi Mumbai, who would all sit on the further benches, you know, Navi Mumbai and beyond. And one of the reasons I started realizing, why do they, why? Because they would always be late because the trains used to miss, etc. etc. And they would form their own little community, which was a community of people who would miss trains and then be late together, that if both of them miss, let's become friends because we are from the same, they could be, one could be a Bhandar, one could be a Vashi, but one couldn't be from Thane, but they would just be like, we are from the back and beyond of Bombay. So now this is one community. There was a South Bombay community always, you know, and these were the richest kids from like really rich families, they would have a language only that I wouldn't understand. You know, I was like, what language is this, what vocabulary is this, what's going on? They talk in ways that I would just be like, confused, like, what did you just say? What does that word mean?"

        "message": "Like, for example, like internet language now that has happened, right? They were like the originate OGs of that language. These languages have started from these subcultures of like, you know, kids who, you know, baby, I don't know, man. When you see whatever you're seeing in like all of these Bollywood, young Bollywood actresses talk in the language, that was a language that they would communicate in. And then you would have the kids from, there were always the kids from Delhi, who would hate everyone from Bombay. And then you would have the kids of rest of India, who would hate everyone from Delhi and Bombay, and they all had their own batches. And I would see it. I would see it. You know, that there is which are the front benchers who are just kind of like, you know, the first people to try and like fit in and be like, mujhe zindagi mein jana, aagey badna hai, toh mujhe pata nahi, main aagey badunga nahi badunga, but aagey baith toh sakta hoon. You know, so that is their intent, whether they're topping or not topping is beyond the point. At least they're first somewhere. Then you had your backbenchers, who are there only for attendance, you know, or like, attendance de do, mein soh jaata hoon. That was my favorite people because they were at least they were so, you know, casual about what they wanted. Their ambition was, I want to just please give me attendance and don't disturb me. And then the middle benchers would always be people with existential crisis, like, you know, like people who just did not know where to fit, like, I don't know which group I'm in. So I'm going to sit on the middle bench. And you know, they're always there will be like four individuals sitting on the middle bench, who are always like, just don't know which group. So I'd see all these groups, I'll see all these communities, I'll see all these labels and I'm like, kya chal raha hai yahan par na, and individual come to me and you'll talk about like, this is what I'm going through, this is what I'm going through, but you're not talking to each other. So one day, randomly, absolutely, I remember it was it was it was raining on that it was a Sunday. And I used to teach on Saturday, Sundays because I was a weekend, weekdays par padha nahi sakta tha. Sunday ko aaye the sab log, kaafi bali shod thi us din par. So I saw that nobody's like, what 75% of the class was there. But I realized that not anybody's in the mood to study. So I was trying to talk and then they were all talking to each other. And then you know what, I was like, you know what, today, let's not pretend, you know, to study or whatever. I actually just wanted to, and it came out of curiosity also I said, I just want to kind of know because and let's just have an honest chat. I want to know that I speak to so many of you individually. And then you are able to tell me all the things that you're going through. But for whatever reason, I found out that you guys really judge each other, right? Like you don't, you all sit in your own subgroups and your own sub, you know, sections and just mingle with each other as if that's the only world that you can ever be in. I mean, you have that, like what I was doing in NID Gurukshetra, I was also like, you have the, you have the possibility and the opportunity to interact with people from all kinds of parts of like Bombay and the rest of India. Why are you not getting to know each other? Why are you not, why are you creating these cliques and like talking to each other? You know, people give you labels. You don't have to believe them, you know, and again, I, at this time, again, I don't have that understanding of gender. I don't have that understanding. I just have a little bit of experience from NID Gurukshetra, but I just found it very irritating that, you know, that and, and, and sad that, you know, that there are all of these human made ideas of who should be talking to whom people in the same class circles should stay with each other, same like interest should stay with each other. In fact, all my learning and all the, I mean, my favorite, my closest friend, my wife is from Assam. I would never have, till I was in Bahrain, I did not know, I'll be as honest in saying I did not even know where Assam was on the map of India. And now I'm married to a girl from Assam because of NID Gurukshetra. My closest friend is from, you know, a small village in, near Chennai in Tamil Nadu. And he's now in the US and working in Amazon and, and I mean, just all kinds of friends that I've had from that time have come from all kinds of different places of, you know, the country. It's like, it's made me richer as a person. And but I just feel like, you know, you guys are not using this opportunity. So I just said, like, you know, for today, let's just for one minute, I want you to just stop talking to each other. And for some reason, they stopped, which is just like, wait, what is happening? Why did you stop talking? I just said, and I wanted to think for a second, who are you beyond these labels that you have given yourself and what the society has given you? And then come and like, talk about it. What is your story beyond these labels? I said very casually, I had never thought that this is a big thing. And then, and then after this one minute, they all looked up, I was like, was there quiet for one minute? Clearly, they were introspective. So I said, who wants to talk? So one person first came up and like said something very like, well, I want to be a, you know, even things like I just chill over here, but I want to, I'm very, I want to, I used to be a cricketer. But then I had some injury, couldn't play, but I want to now get into sports broadcasting, you know, that's my ambition. I was like, well, sure, that's not what I went by Louisville stories, but thank you for coming and speaking up. For whatever it's worth, that boy is a sports broadcaster today. So you know, full marks for him. The second boy who came, he changed my life, man, like, he came and he's this lovely, lovely boy. And he happened to be gay. So he came and spoke to everyone and said he was very openly gay. He was like someone who would, you know, be very open and comfortable with his identity in college. So he came and said to everyone, he's like, well, you know me as someone who's like open about his sexuality and you're all like, I'm very comfortable. But what you don't know about me and the story that I have beyond this label is that every evening after college, on the way to home, I stop at a petrol pump. He has a bike. I used to go on the bike and stop at a petrol pump. And then I take out different clothes that I change into so that when I go home, I have to hide who I am in front of my parents. Because my one truth is that I'm gay. The second truth is my parents and I belong to a very religious family. And in my family, it is not okay for homosexuality is not okay. And in my religion, homosexuality is not okay. So while here I get to be who I am in front of the people I love the most, I have to hide a part of me. And and then he just burst into tears when he said this. And then suddenly that moment, that day, that boy changed the trajectory of my life. I think I wouldn't be overstating that. Because immediately after that, a wave of empathy happened in the classroom and somebody becomes vulnerable. And this is the thing about stories. And stories lead to other stories. Vulnerability is actually strength. If you are if you are sharing something, it allows people to to also let their guards down and share back, you know, human connection, human bonding, human friendships all happen because of this beautiful thing called empathy that comes after you share your stories. And this boy shared his story and everyone was like, you know, maybe I should do it too. So then there is a girl who came up and she's like, she's already crying. She's like, everyone thinks of me as a topper. And I've topped I've topped everywhere, you know, all know me. But I've topped in the college, I've topped in this district, I've been a school topper. But you don't know why I top. Her story is heartbreaking. She's like, when I was born, I very soon found out that my parents wanted a boy and but they got a girl. So for some reason, my parents and especially my father has never really given me love. She's like, I grew up not knowing what love is, but then kind of started recognizing that with other students in school, they would get a lot of love from the parents when they would do well in their exams. So I was like, what if I start doing well in my exams and I'll get love from my parents. She's like, from that time onwards, I'm in primary school, I've been topping everywhere. I've topped school, I've topped district, I've topped college. And every time I take my report card or my marks back to my father in the hope that he says I love you to me, but he still hasn't. And she's just in tears. And as all of us are listening, and we're like, man, what is going on? And just really beautiful, powerful stories started coming out. Very emotionally speaking about what the world thinks of them as and who they really are. And I realize at this point, man, there is there is something here that you know, something happened that that day and that evening that kind of totally it started as like a 12 o'clock session. And then it went on to like six o'clock, like six hours, we were just talking. Everybody and everybody heard everybody else. Everybody gave everybody the respect of like, time and emotion and empathy and hugs. There were so many hugs that day. And I was like, man, what has happened? And then you know, like your WhatsApp, I mean, I think the WhatsApp group after that gets lit and there's so many like, emojis and like hearts and whatnot and hugs. And I was like, there's something here, you know. And all the people who missed it then suddenly were like, man, you know, something happened yesterday, like everybody's talking about. And I realized that maybe there's something that I need to do with every batch, you know, this happened by mistake. But it just made me so it made me realize the power of stories, power of empathy. And I started I then called it started calling it the kindness project. And I said, like, this is a project, the next batch I gave from the very beginning, but here it happened by, you know, accident. I said that at the end of the semester, I'm going to give you a project. And it's called the kindness project, where I will ask you to do this exercise. You have the whole semester to think about it, you can start thinking from now. But I want you to tell me the story you have beyond the label that you have. And I will, I'd start my class by asking how many of you want to be journalists and like actually four of them would be like, I was like, great. Now, all of the rest of you also have a story, why are you here? And I want to know that story, but I will talk about it in the last class. And I said, I'd say that it's a marked project, but I give everybody full marks. And then every year, year on year on year, I mean, the kind of stories that came out, it is, it became, I mean, at that time, I did not know the terms for it, but became a safe space. It became a space where I'm so proud to say a student of mine decided that he's going to come out to the world in that space, because he didn't have an opportunity. And he just came, I remember, he's just the sweetest boy. And he came and he's like, said a few lines about himself and what he likes and how he's as a human being, what he likes, what he doesn't like, and he ended by saying, so I just want to say that I'm a boy who has brown hair, black eyes, crooked tooth. And I have, you know, and I like boys, and he just said something so beautiful. Everybody was like, wait, what did he just come out? And it was just hugs, hugs, hugs after the other was so beautiful. One of the most powerful, and I because I want to is just some one of my most inspiring I think stories, one of the most powerful stories happened with this boy who, who came to me and said, Sir, I don't know what to say in this, you know, class because I don't have a story. Everybody has a story. I don't have a story. So I don't know what to say. So now this boy, I'll tell you what this was, he's like the brightest, one of the brightest smartest kids I'd met. He was so bright, he would correct me in class, he'd just be like, that's wrong. This is the right thing. And I was just after one time I realized that you know a lot more than me. So he would ask me questions and say, you know, that you said this, but this happened in 1852. I said, I didn't know. I have not, I have not done, you know, not studied history or, or, or even for that matter, journalism or engineering, but I work in history. That's why I'm teaching you, you know, so, but if you have something, I want you to talk about it. So why don't you come and tell like what happened? So be my co-professor once is like asking me because I don't know, I'm very comfortable with saying, I don't know. So he started, so I just told him, I said, the only thing I know about you is that you're very well read, crazily well read. It is insane how I 2021, you know, so many things about like the world. Maybe there's a reason behind it. Maybe there's a story that I don't know. What is the story? And then his eyes just widened and he's like, Oh shit, I think I know what my story is. I said, great, then come and tell it in that class. So and I'd workshop with most of the kids, I would workshop these stories, then I'd be like, tell me what it is, and then we'll try to get you to dig deep and say something authentic. So he said, I said, he said, can I tell you, I was like, whatever you prefer, he's like, can I say it in the class directly? I said, sure, came to the class, he's like, so his story was, he's like, I've grown up in a very misogynistic setup, very patriarchal setup, he's like, my father is a patriarch of the house. And he's so patriarchal that when there is that I have a sister and my mother, even when he's watching TV, and the remote control is on the table in front of him, he will not pick it up himself. He will call my mother or my sister to come and pick it up for him. He's like, it used to be so irritating to me to see and so and I used to get so angry at the way he treats me and the way he treats my mother and there were different rules for all of us. My sister would not get to God, I'd get to God, my sister would not get a certain kind of money, I'd get a certain kind of money. If there's some work to be done, my sister, my mother were the ones who are being asked to do the work, whereas I wouldn't be asked to do it at all. And he's like, my anger turned into resentment. And when sometimes my father would hit me or hit any of us, there was a day where I almost hit him back. And then I realized that what am I doing? How can I do this? I'm turning into him. He's like that realization happened and I just got very scared. And I was like, there has to be a better way of, you know, giving back to my father without getting angry like him, because that's his thing, I don't want to be that boy. So he's like, every time I would fight with him and say that, you know, you can't do this, he would say, but this is the way the world works. This is the way the world works. This is the position of girls, boys do this, girls do that, women do this, men do that. Don't fight, you know, the way the world works. So he started, he just, he had Google. So he went online and he's just like, is this the way the world works? And then he discovered feminism and then he discovered feminist movements, then he discovered communities in different parts of the world, which did not have patriarchy, but matriarchy. So the next time his father would get angry and say, this is the way the world works, he would hit back with a fact and say, you know what, in Northeast India, the kids take the names of their mothers, you know, because it's not patriarchy, it's matriarchy, so it is not the way the world works. It might work in this household, but not everywhere. And his father would suddenly be stumped, he'd be like, wait, what? The next time he'd say, this is the way the world works, he'd be like, do you know about the feminist movement over here? And this is what happened here. In Africa, there's a tribe, there is. And he would always come back with facts. And the father would just be like, I don't know what to say to this, because he was not, you know, getting angry back at him, but talking in like, facts. And he's like, he's like, I started doing this so much that my father, instead of getting angry, would just like, go away, because he didn't know how to respond. And he's like, now it's reached a place where it's not that my father has suddenly become like a feminist, or, you know, is not patriarchal anymore. But when he wants the remote, he picks it himself. He's like, that's how much of a change it is. He doesn't ask my mother and my sister to, you know, get it. And I was like, man, he's like, that's my story. And I'm like, insane, like, just the fact that this boy has so many facts in him. Can you imagine the deep story behind that? And through these stories of these young people, I started recognising that I too have a story. Now, what I used to think, I used to understand, and that man thing, I never could unlock. But I unlocked like, why I care about films, I told you, it's my father and stuff. You know, a lot of it really, yeah, I just struggled, I knew there was something there, but I just did not know what it was. And then it was anxiety. And then it was therapy. And actually, how I also realised it is anxiety is one of my students, by the way, like, one of my students has spoken about anxiety in her session. So I called her one day and said, can I meet? You know, and you're very close, we're very thick. So I met her, you know, for lunch or something. And I said that, so you said you got anxiety, just tell me like, what all happens? What are the symptoms? Because she was taking therapy at that time. And then she told me like, this happens, this happens, this happens, this happens, this happens. And I was like, shit, all of this happens to me. So is this is what I have also anxiety. And she said, maybe it is, you should get it checked, and maybe you should go to a therapist. And that's where I was like, oh, shit, I can't go to a therapist, I'm a man. But yeah, I mean, it's in my students, it's in the conversations that I had. It's in the stories of others that I found my own, you know, so and then, of course, in clinical anxiety."

        "message": "It's such a powerful thought and such a powerful frame, just, you know, just thinking about what your story is, like what your roommate, in fact, said to you that you should be writing on the side, writing on the side, writing on the side, and just taking that step back and forcing you to think of it in terms of stories can, you know, at least make you self reflect. And I was struck by this talk that you gave, where there's this lovely line where you say, stories unite us, labels divide us, right, and I'll link it from the show notes, of course. But this is, you know, so particularly pertinent today, because, you know, I keep saying, it's almost a cliche on my show where I quote Whitman and talk about how we contain multitudes. But the thing is that a lot of the way, a lot of the discourse around us is so reductive, where we'll reduce people down to labels and to narratives, that so and so is a liberal and anti-national, this is so and so, that is so and so, everywhere you're putting narratives of victimhood or narratives of oppression, looking at people only through that lens. And that is just offensive to reduce people to one particular thing over which they had no control, because it's often just an identity of birth. Another theme I often talk about on the show is the difference between the abstract and the concrete. I did an episode with Anshul Malhotra, and she wrote a book on the memories of partition. Yeah, and in her episode, she spoke about how while collecting material for the book, she was sitting with a family in Pakistan, who had come over after partition, and they had suffered a lot. And obviously, they were just full of rage when those memories came and they were saying, Hindus are like this, Hindus are like that, Hindus are like this, Hindus are like that. But then they suddenly noticed that they're talking to a Hindu and they said, lekin tum nahi beti, tum achhi ho. And that's the difference between an abstract notion in the head and a concrete person with a story who's actually sitting in front of you. And when I think about what divides us today, it is abstract things like all these labels we pin on people. And it is abstract notions like nationalism and purity and culture and all of this crap. And but what can unite us is in the concrete, once you know somebody's story, as you've pointed out, it is difficult to hate them. It is difficult because you and that's one of the things that literature and reading literature really helps because when you live the lives of others through, you know, getting inside their heads, it just gives you so much more empathy, where and it gives you so much more insight into yourself, where you say ki mera bhi to story hai, you know, the strength that I'm showing, ye bhi kisi majboori se aayi hai, kisi frustration se aayi hai, you know, tum itna kyu muskura rahe ho, you know, exactly that kind of thing. So and I'll dive into the anxiety later also, because I want to do a little bit of a dive into that with you as well. But on the point of stories, your kindness project seems to me to be so powerful, because suddenly everybody in the classroom is a real person to every other person in the classroom. And that is mind blowing. And that is what our society needs. Because today, even when we talk with friends, we are looking inside our smartphones, and we are lost in the abstractions on the on the in the black mirror. But we are not actually, you know, looking into each other's eyes and making that real human connection. And you found a device to unlock that in a particular setting, which is a particular setting of a classroom. And since then with you, you are you've, you know, found other sort of devices like that. Tell me a little bit about your thinking on this, because the world needs more of this."

        "message": "You know, it's only in hindsight that I started recognizing why this idea of storytelling and narrative became so important. So again, one of the first things was my mother only, right? Like I told you, I joked with you. And I mean, not it wasn't a joke, but I told you about the fact that when you know, when I had my first show, my mother said, like, to the MBA. And one day, you know, I had a very big fight with my mother, you know, where I, where I asked her, I said, okay, if I do MBA, then what will happen? And she's like, then you'll be successful. I said, then what will happen? Because I was trying to see where, what is this idea in her head, then what will happen? She is like, then you'll earn money, you'll have a lot of money. I said, then what will happen? Then you'll buy a household. Then what will happen? Then you'll buy a car. Then what will happen? Then you'll get married. Then what will happen? Then you'll settle down. Then what will happen? Then you'll have kids. Then what will happen? Then you'll bring up the kids. Then what will happen? Then the kids will go to college. Then what happens? Then what happens? Then you retire. I want to know what will happen? And she's like, what happens after that? To khush hone ke liye mujhe retire hona badega And she's just like very honestly and earnestly was like haan I said aur agar mujhe abhi khush hona hai phir And she's like aisa nahi hota I'm like aisa nahi hota matlak kya hota hai I want to be happy right now She's like nahi happy nahi hota abhi tumhara bhi duties hoti hai And it just and again in that moment I realized yaar Not in that moment much later I think Retrospective mein I kind of recognized But this is what our parents were given duties And that's what they thought all of us have to perform duties You're not living for yourself You're living for the next for the child you will birth You're living for the partner you will have You will live for the How does how can in our country in our society Anyone even find their story When you are constantly told that you have to live Your entire story is about somebody else There is no such thing And you know it's another Such a random you know insight to this Like when I'd gone on this SOTC tour with my family There's a lot of old couples over there And I was really like I was like are we not I mean again 17 year old I was like where are the young people in this tour Why are there so many old people etc And one of them we became close to a couple That's the couple that actually even asked my parents So I asked them uncle aunty aap log jana You know you are like well in your 60s or whatever How are you why are you doing this tour It's just a curious question ki kya kar rahe ho He's like bete humare bachon ki shadiya hogi hai You know toh humne ka chalo ab enjoy karte thoda And I was like and it's the same thing my mother said right Like ab shadiya hogi hai duty khatam hogi hai Settle kar di hai ab hum enjoy kar sakte hai So till then till your 60s you can't enjoy life That is the idea that we are given to people Your story is not your own You are not allowed to think that you have you know It's selfish, it's considered selfish to say that you know Tum apne ware sochta hai, tum apne ware mein kitna sochta hai If you are not sacrificing for your family Then you are selfish, you are self-centered, you are egoistic Tu apne ware mein hi sochta hai, tu sab ke ware mein hi sochta hai Sehb apne ware mein sochta hai This is why so many people who wanted to be other things Now this is across gender Who wanted to break out of their circumstance Or break out of their narratives Were just constantly told, shamed in society And shamed in family structures Saying that you don't care about us You only care about yourself Whereas this idea of a Shravan Kumar This boy who took his parents on a pilgrimage And did it on his own That's the ideal son that everybody should have And the ideal daughter is the one Who finds that best Shravan Kumar Kind of a boy and then serves him He will serve the parents, she will serve him Who is living for themselves? Everybody is living for somebody else The parents will live for these kids Parents live for the kids, the boy has to live for the parents The wife has to live for the husband Then they have to live for the children It's a chakra view Nobody is living for themselves And that is half our society's problem Why is everybody angry in our society? Because nobody does anything for themselves They try to do it Stop worrying about what everybody else wants Now maybe I should think about it Because my only focus in life was work It was just work Because I needed to make my mother proud Because she raised me I need to pay her back In some way And paying her back in my case was not money Because of privilege But it was in terms of pride In terms of getting her to have Where she could go and tell somebody else Look what my son is doing Look how successful my son is For the community to call herself Like my mother It's just All of us are living These narratives for others And nobody is actually living For themselves And I have always I have just found this Such a terrible thing Such a tragic thing Such a sad way In which we look at our culture I am not saying We need to push each other away And not care about our families and communities Of course we must But it's okay to also care about yourself Self care as a concept Does not exist In Indian society People who do self care Today are called influencers It's not a It's not a thing that you practice It's not a thing that you care about Even the idea of self care Right now Amit when you think about it Now it comes down to Going to spas or like Getting a manicure pedicure Or having a pool day Or whatever you know Even those are commodified And capitalist ideas of what self care is Self care is you know Actually being able to spend a Sunday Without having to worry about productivity Self care is actually having a day Only for yourself without worrying like What will my you know Partner, husband, son Wife, family Want to do or think of I can't plan It's been so tough for me to plan a solo trip Because I have My brother lives in the US My parents live in Bahrain My wife obviously lives with me But anytime I have free time I need to find a way of dividing it with the three people My aunt lives in Karnal I'm close to all of them Whatever free time I have I'm always like You know I need to divide it My therapist tells me Where is the time that you are living for yourself"

particular My father doesn't even like When he comes and meets me Although again as I said he is trying now But my mom and aunt have been super supportive And of course They also sacrifice in sending their children away They say one day you go away They want you to Get out of and go to a different place And study and work there etc Even if they want They don't ask their children now Because sacrifice has become the whole thing So there is just tons and tons of Problems in the way We think of all of this And it's become So difficult for us It also comes From again two other things One thing again Is this idea of How we have constantly been Compared growing up Always So you are Again your life is a shadow of that Cousin that you are competing with It is always about that Neighbors son or daughter that you need to beat It is always about You know in the group of people Your parents, in a group of people You have to be the most intelligent So when you have these When you are constantly Where is the empathy lacking right now The empathy is lacking In our society because we have been Forced to be To think about our better good For our Families So we have turned into We have been Pushed into individual narratives So that we can Make our families proud So we can make our systems Proud but in the pursuit of That we are supposed to not care About the community And that's just the paradox and Irony of it all You are constantly told that If you have to go ahead you have to go on your own You have to beat it You have to defeat it And when you go ahead And someone is left behind You can't go back You can't go back, fools go back Fools are the ones who stop Or pause or rest Or who kind of, you have to constantly Every bit of your time Has to be commodified, you have to Constantly go to the next milestone In life and that's just the middle Class overall thinking And I am not saying that right now I am middle class At all but I am just saying that that's the culture That has become the middle Class culture and in that culture If you, and you are doing all of this so someday You can also pay back to your parents So for the idea of, but you are resenting everybody And you are only, after a point of time You become so conditioned and just moving forward Moving forward, moving forward that you are not even looking left and right And most people ultimately Also stop talking to their parents or stop like caring For their parents because they have pushed them into these narratives They have become so individual They are like why should I care about you now While it's not true for most of the country Again sacrifice is the large word Which is also given as a word to burden us And burden everybody with this idea That you can't do something for yourself So you have to do for the family You know But in a society you have to do it for yourself So you are not And that's where you chip away every sense of Empathy you have for anybody else Or for that matter for yourself And that's the largest thing, while you don't have Empathy for others, you also don't have any empathy for yourself You are not compassionate to yourself, you are not Kind to yourself, you don't slow down, you don't think Why are we, where is the question About why we are doing what we are doing That question is not asked in education systems And when we ask questions, all in our country No one is able to ask questions If someone asks a question, you are shocked How are you asking a question Don't ask questions, keep your head down Respect your elders, one other thing that I have Like always had this massive Why respect your elders And not respect everyone I am not saying don't respect your elders I am just saying why is the saying not that Respect everyone, it's respect your elders Because of patriarchal system where you know You have to respect those in power who are older to you And the only Allegiance you have Is to be with the people in power Anybody who is not in power, you can say anything to them You can do anything to them, which is what we are seeing right now Anybody who is marginalized Is not respected, is not Kind of given any bit of love and empathy Because they are not elders And elder is not just about older In terms of experience, it's just Bade, bada insaan Bado ki izzat karo Sabki izzat karo, kabhi zingi mein If that was a society we would be living in Empathetic, not divided Not polarized kind society Sabse pyaar rakho, izzat bhi kya hota hai Izzat kya hai, respect kya hai Respect itself is a, you know, why are we Reducing all the emotion we need to have As a society to respect Pyaar ki baat karo, sabse pyaar karo Wo toh hota nahi hai, izzat karo And particularly for young people Why is it so difficult for people to find their stories Because you are constantly told that you are Look at the stories of success Amit, that are out there in the world, right IIT mein tumh log Top karte ho, ya phir jo na coaching centres Mein top karte ho, tumhari hoarding lag jati hai And that's how people identify, look at these Four faces, and those faces will Look like they are, they have been All their Life has been, you know, taken Out of their faces, it's just miserable Faces of these young people who have Top 10 coaching centres, and that's how you become famous Anytime you are Asked, mainna TEDx's, you've seen The TEDx's, I've gone and given all these TEDx's And every TEDx ke baad mainna ek question Poochta ho, ki jo na, I've come to your Campus now, how many People in your campus have been on this stage They'll be like nobody, I'm saying Do you, are you saying that there is not A single person in your campus Whose story is worthy of being told On a stage like this, because That's not true, every person Has Had a battle that they fight to reach where They are, no matter what age it is You can be 12, you can be 15, and you'll Be fighting battles in your life And sometimes, you know, especially with your family And especially with your community and society There are much bigger battles, the Gen Z and Young people in India, they are fighting like X number of battles Of identity, where they are not Know what their identity is, but they are not allowed To live it, because we live in a conservative society How can, how dare you have an identity And not follow the identity we have for you Because that's the narrative as parents we have, that's the narrative As society we have for you, so it's a And every young person thinks, maybe If that is, I'm sorry I'm moving From like one thing to another But this idea of settle This idea of settle for me Is always like I mean settle is also a word we are using for stable But it is also a word we use for compromise And I've When people say settle karlo, settle karlo Settle karlo, actually It's not about stability, it is about compromise Ki tumne na apne mission statement pura kar liye Ab tum settle ho jao, settle ho jao matlab After a point of time, you need to You can have whatever idea you have of independence But after a point of time, you have to give in You have to compromise, and you have to be one in society And that's called settling I'm now settled, I'm One of society, and now my life is The same life that society And culture and patriarchy has asked me to live And that's the story of everybody You ultimately become a Large, one Some nobody In everybody Versus having an identity of your own And why is there so much anger? Why has there been so much toxicity Against, you know, on the internet All of this, it is coming from a place Where most of these people were always told That your identity is like A part of a collective So whenever a marginalized community wants to Assert their identity as an individual You can't have that, how can you have that? You don't get to have an identity today You are not going to You are not going to be able to Assert your individuality When I never got to do You're a feminist, you can't be a feminist How can you say you're a woman when we're all supposed to be Part of a collective, and a collective Which cannot question, which has to settle And which has to follow the rules given by society How can you be How can you say as a Muslim You require rights Well, you can't have that right Because, you know, as a society we have decided This is the way things are going to work So any right in our country Is not given Based on the fact that Our empathy is over Because our empathy Was already over The day we start being Compassionate to ourselves And recognizing that every one of us Also had a story of an obstacle we've overcome And give ourselves That leeway, that love, that compassion And say, you know what We don't have to be angry about this In fact, we can lean into some of these things Who said that even if you're 35 You're 40, you're 45, you can't Start your life, or do something that you've Always wanted to do, who said, you'll be happier right now Do it now If you've never done it, do it now I've never gone to, I've never exercised I can get angry about like the system That forced me to do this, but I'm trying now Failing at it, but trying I've never cared about, I mean so many Different things, I've so many different things At this age that I'm now trying To kind of You know, incorporate Or inculcate, and just see how it works So what if I Lost, or I won't even say lost So what if there's a whole time of mine That I didn't do any of these things, life is very long You can still do it, you can Still have that Sunday that you want only for yourself You can still do whatever version Of self-care you call it You know, whatever it is You call self-care, you can still go for it, you don't Have to constantly Be burdened by, and Shamed, and judged by Society, for what your life Should be like, and what your story should be like It is your story, no matter what age you are I say this to young people, but I'm also now Saying it to anybody who's listening right now It is your story, it is your narrative You take back control You don't have to cede that Control, that you may have ceded For all your life right now, and you're Going to be happier for it, you're going to be less toxic You're going to be less angry, you're going to hate The world a little less, if you start being compassionate"

You know, so tell me A little bit about your Thinking in this, because We think of many qualities In our lives. We think that We have to be intelligent This has to happen, that has to happen We don't often think of kindness, or if we do We think of kindness in a context Of pity, where, you know You can feel virtuous because you are Helping someone by being kind, that kind of A self-centered kindness But, you have thought Much more deeply about it, so Tell me a little bit about when You started thinking about it, what The spurs were, and what other Directions it took you into"

You didn't know me He was like, I just had an assumption After I read your articles, I thought you were this narcissist This pompous a**hole I was like Because you used to write 14 years old I was like, why do you need to tell your age Why do you need to tell everybody Show off that you are 14 And on the basis of that You thought that I deserved hate I'm sorry man, I mean I've come to know you You are a really nice guy Now that I know you, I really wanted to say sorry So just the fact at that time That this boy actually decided He could have never told me But the fact that he decided to tell me And apologize to me Just in that moment I kind of I think my understanding of kindness happened That you know Stories bring empathy Stories make you kind If you hate each other There is no chance that you can hate each other And that kindness Is Again I said For whatever reasons from childhood I was always like, I'm going to be the opposite of what Has hurt me I'm going to be the opposite of what has pained me So if I got bullied I'm going to be kinder to everybody around me If I got hate I'm going to give as much love as possible If there are people who have looked down on me I'm not going to judge anybody And In my early years, in my job Even when I was at MTV I was the youngest person in almost every team At that time And it was very hard People would I told you I was making a show At 24, 25 Now they gave me the title of producer At 25 Created by 25 And said that you make it now, you do it on your own I had never done this I said I need help, and then they got help for me But the help That came Were people who were just like If I would tell them that this is what I want to do You are 24, what do you know We have spent 15 years in the industry, you don't tell us what to do So I would see the show that I had written That they had asked me to produce Or asked me to lead I'm supposed to be the boss of that show The creator of that show, the showrunner of that show But at every situation Between the ages of 24 to 20 It took 2 years for the show to be back and forth Back and forth At the end of it, I had become Like a really angry version of myself Because anytime I would try to put my point of view People would just say shut up You are too young to have a say And again I went through anxiety Again at that time without realizing what it is I was really angry, I was really unhappy And then when I got the opportunity to make these 6 films And now that I decided that Now if I am going to be with Work in any situation I am only going to work with good people if I can And I am only going to be kind Whatever anybody has given to me, I am going to be the opposite of that And every time I tried that It was just absolutely amazing As an experience We are making a film, we are making content We have come away, we have already fought All of these battles To get here And now why are we making this medium also toxic Just be nice to each other, how difficult is that It just became One of the most important tenets for me Kindness There is no And I just don't Buy into this idea that you have to be an asshole To be successful and I was always like I am going to prove it, no matter what happens I am going to be kind, I am going to be empathetic And I am going to be successful, now you tell me what you are going to do You know You say that I can't And Yuva is a for profit, it's not a non-profit We work on like social impact But I wanted to say, I was like I am going to make Make something on social impact To tell that you know social impact People look down They call NGO A vibe When I first started talking about it, people looked down As if NGOs are bad things, I am like NGOs are saving the world out there You know but If you start an NGO, there is nothing we can do with you I am like First of all, NGOs are not bad, second of all Why are you looking down on anything that has to do with social impact Who says that it is going to be The most boring, we are the most vibrant 26 people, all the average Of 25, the most vibrant office Till 7 7.30 people work Weekends we have off, Saturday Sunday We don't work, we have work life Balance and we are a team of 26 people And we are hitting like X number of crores"

You mentioned this right When I started UR and this is after my Sabbatical, my 6 month thing that I took Off after YRF and I was just like Okay I need to find out what my story is And at that point of time I I knew that You know I wanted to work with young people Because I really, that was my safe space Honestly working with students, beautiful And my skill set and my understanding My passion is storytelling and A skill is also that How do I bring together My care and You know for young people My passion of like Storytelling and empathy And my skill set of you know Media and entertainment and bring it all together And UR really was born out of that With the two intents, one was Can we make important things interesting for young people That's like our core You know goal and the second thing is how can How can we make young people Feel less alone, which is my hypothesis After my you know Kindness project I realized every young person Has a lot to say but there's very few people Willing to listen, every young Person has so much inside of that The kind of stories I've heard during the Kindness project you know about I mean about attempted Suicide, about domestic violence, about And not just negative like You know the really positive stories Someone who's you know overcome drug addiction You know someone who's and every story In fact would end up with hope you know So I saw that there is a young generation Of young people, a generation of young people That's lonely and I want to go A little bit deeper into the loneliness actually Just for a second before I go into the roadshow When We were growing up you know With all of us you know every generation I think before this current generation Grew up in a time where we were Told, as I said we've discussed that you know there's stories That were given to us, structures that were given to us and we Believed these structures because How else, what else Would we do, how would we, what is the reason for us To not believe, even if we had an inkling That these structures don't work for us We just didn't know better right There was, you were a certain Community, your identity was You know me My people, my community My gender, whatever it is And you know just structures that you were told That you have to live in this There is only straight as a sexuality There is only your religion As a religion, that's important And that means everything to you There is, you can only marry this kind of a person You know Sorry, you can only Study in a certain kind of a You know, certain kind of a course you have to And certain milestones that you have to Achieve after which you settle and whatever right Those were the communities that Everyone without having A choice in found themselves, now the good The tough part About that was these communities were Always unhappy in some ways Purely because you know not Everybody was leading a narrative that was given to them But at the same time they were Communities, so you still had That you know bubble And that you know where you can If soft landing was there Even if you felt there was people to catch you Now what the internet did You know Was first and foremost And for this generation, let me come to this generation First and foremost because of You know If for me as a millennial growing up I did not know what my, I am trying to find My identity in a world before the internet And a world post the internet, before the internet I have told that this is life And after the internet I just go and google And I have just been told that life is not like that Life can be lived in many ways First I have to choose What do I believe more, do I believe what my parents told me And my society told me or do I have to believe the internet And then lots of people have made different choices I chose to believe that the internet Should be somewhere in the middle That my parents are also half right and the internet also has the other half But there are choices I believed in like Pre-internet Karan Johar You know Karan Johar once said You know in kuch kuch hota hai hum ek baar jeete hain Ek baar marte hain, shadi bhi ek baar hoti hain, pyaar bhi ek baar hoti hain Mere maan liya tha Mere zindagi mein yeh hi tha, ek baar jeenge, ek baar marte hain, ek baar shadi karenge, ek baar pyaar karenge I had one girlfriend in college If she wouldn't have left me I would have married her Then in college I made another girlfriend She is now with me for 16 years We have been together Since 16 years Because I genuinely believed that Now at some point in time tinder happened And then like a lot of people who may be married I mean I must have I have already gotten married when dating happened But I am saying for a lot of people it would have just become a choice I could have been with a partner for 8 years Not married and suddenly I get This plethora of options And all these choices that I have And now with these choices I have to choose Do I want to now with all these options available Do I want to swipe right constantly I choose and say This is my life, I understand why these options exist I understand they can be helpful But I have made my decision, I love this person And I am going to stay with this person And I don't want to look out or do anything My choice that I have made But with Gen Z, there are multitudes of choices That you get at a very early age So what that also means is Good thing wise, you can choose an identity immediately There are 20 identities And you are just like, you know what My parents say straight but I have googled And there is LGBTQ and I think I belong there And that's a community for me And I am going to belong to that community Parents might say that you have to only become an engineer And then you say, you know what I have seen a YouTuber becoming very successful So ok let them say what they want to Maybe I negotiate a little bit and I will on the side Start becoming a YouTuber Putting up vlogs etc and suddenly if I hit 1 million Go and tell, look at the money I am making 100 times more than an engineer will get in their first job So then my parents won't say anything So suddenly all of these choices have given power Suddenly all of these choices have given like you know A lot of, but at the same time on the other end Of it, these choices have also been very Have become It's become a paralysis when you have too much choice When there is, when you have If you choose one person With a dating app Swipe right, you are matched Suddenly you have another choice of another While the first sign of a problem In your relationship in that person In your back of your head you are like But I have more choices, I have I can swipe right again, so Where I have in 16 years had Thousands of ups and downs in my own Relationship with the one person that I have been in There are thousands of relationships That you know, one day Two day or whatever, I am just as an example Exaggerating, but thousands of options Of relationships that you have, you can have Different bad days with different people But you are not going to stick to anyone because There is always another option and then If you choose somebody It has to be, it's a choice that you maybe make After like 20 failures and you are just like I have to choose somebody and whatever and then maybe again You settle for a different reason, so it's a Choice has been a really tough thing Identity, finding an identity And finding communities For that identity has been a little bit of an obstacle Because again, internet gives you Identity but in your offline world your parents are Telling you this identity doesn't work If you want to be whatever Even let's talk about feminism only Let's talk about a girl who Now knows that when her Mother says that I don't want to I want you to cook and the girl says Well I am not going to cook And as I said I think everyone should"

loneliness is Eating everybody, where there was a generation Gap that always existed in every generation And this generation has become a communication Gap because of the different vocabularies These people have My parents and I for whatever it was Spoke in Hindi She would speak in Punjabi and I would speak in Hindi And there is one language Of communication, even anger is the same Language, the language of communication For this entire generation is emojis It is memes It is you know DMs It is Internet lingo which is And you can say that you know that's just words And that's just internet culture but that is their life That's how they communicate with each other When you are sad right now And again I am not saying this as like a I am not making fun of this But when a young person today is sad It's more likely that they will take a picture of themselves With tears and send it to a friend And say I am sad like this Versus earlier when I would you know Either call my friend and I don't know I mean I haven't cried too much, I have not done that As a man but I would call my friend and just Talk for some time or I meet someone And say I am feeling bad, let's go for a walk Let's go for

now but it doesn't happen as much And the way that most people communicate Even their deepest darkest Emotions or the toughest emotions They have is through this internet Language so you don't even They don't have a vocabulary to express how they are feeling Because of the internet today And that is but anytime They would express themselves why am I Sad because my mother is You know my parents are patriarchal and I am not Allowed to you know Live the life that I want to, your parents will not understand That language, that's another language You are talking the language of labels which is Important for you to understand And be aware of but your parents will not Understand that, you are talking to them in a very It's alien to them So when this divide keeps getting bigger You are not able to talk to The people who are closest to you Who mean the most to you, who have Raised you and given you love And that's not the primary community Which was your parents Is getting more and more distant because of this Because of the internet in good and bad Ways, you look for this community online And when you go online You either find positive community sometimes Or you find other communities And when you are lonely you just want anyone Who will accept you and that's what's happening Right now, there are people out there Who recognize this or people out there Who are channelizing the loneliness In xyz ways and that Anger and that Need to find something That gives me, you know Where I feel less lonely And now for a lot of Again, now coming to the Yuva Roadshow When I So as I said, with Yuva When I started, one of the most important things I wanted to do Was create a platform that listens to young people And when you are listening to And I said this Before and I will say this again that you know I want to be a company that sits in Bombay And says we listen to young people Because I have taught 8 people in Whatever, x number of 100 people In Jai Hind College I want to, I can't say I represent India I am calling it Yuva, I am calling it a Hindi name I am calling it like When Yuva was named because Yuva has Pretty much been co-opted as an angry word By most political parties Yuva Sena and Fist and what not And I wanted to say that Yuva can also be heart You know and that is what I saw in my students And so we thought that we are not going to Sit in Bombay and decide like And say that we know young people, we are going to go across the country So between 2019 and 2020 I went to over 120 colleges, I went to I went to 35 cities I went to IITs IIMs, AIIMs, NIFTs, NITs You know all kinds of colleges Government colleges, you know English speaking Hindi speaking, regional speaking colleges And just I spoke About gender, mental health and Stories and then I just Created these spaces where I ask people now I have told, I was vulnerable With them, I said this is what I This is my story, now I want to hear yours And here is what happens I mean it was the same kindness project Except that when kindness project I had 6 months to Earn the trust of my students for them To open up in the safe space that I have Whereas over here I had like 1 hour You know and in 1 hour I had to Say certain things for them to want to open Up in front of me and again I was doing it You know now when I look back also Sometimes I just feel like I know as a teacher that I have I have an understanding of young people I think I have the empathy to be able to hear them But I am not a trained professional And maybe the next time I do it I would want a trained Professional with me and you know Because yeah I just feel like maybe I should I didn't think of it at that time But having said that My intent was always to kind of just have These people open up because I felt like Not everyone has Even therapy is a privilege, you don't have access Everybody doesn't have access to therapy You tell a young person go and take therapy At the very least 250,000 rupees for a session And if you are doing 4 sessions You know 1000 rupees that's not affordable for In a month not affordable for most Indian students So in that situation What do they, where do they If they have to express what do they do And my thing to them was Talk to each other and listen to each other Lead with listening Care about the stories of the people around you But like let's create that safe space first And then you guys create it among yourselves Which has happened and I'll come to that But when you give young people a safe space So same kind of kindness project stories Beautiful stories I'll love to kind of tell you one But The larger thing That came out was As I said with Girls it was when given a safe space To talk about anything they choose to talk about sexual harassment Because that's the most pervasive Thing in their life unfortunately that's a Tragedy of a country at the same time As I said before they would Immediately after that story they would talk about Well that's the girl because of Which you know I'm here Today and I've survived and who's been my comfort It's a tribe it's a sisterhood It's the support group That girls have formed with each other They would talk about harassment they would talk about body issues They would talk about everything like you know girls have been Shamed into being a certain way You have to be fair you have to be thin you have to whatever Fit into an ideal for a boy that you will Ultimately marry but there are other Girls who are helping them cope with this And that's how they survive right With boys which I initially found Shocking but now unsurprising The biggest thing they would talk about When given a free space and a Safe space was loneliness Boys in engineering colleges Non-engineering colleges coming up to me Coming up in among 150 students and talking about how They are doctors Boys coming up which Scared the hell out of me Young boys coming up and saying I didn't want to be a doctor But my family forced me and now I'm here But everyday I'm depressed I don't want to do this But I will have to because my parents are doctors Their parents are doctors so now I have to be one You know and I'm hearing This across I don't know who to Talk to I feel sad But when I tell it to my friends they judge me They say are you a girl You know or if I told There's a boy who said you know in one of the cities Said that well I had a girlfriend who dumped me Because I used to cry and she said I want A man I don't want Like someone like you who's cry baby They were There's a boy who spoke about the fact that You know well I I don't want to objectify women But I have a group where they all do it And then the moment I speak about This they say that Then you f**k off from this group And then I ultimately did f**k off and I lost my Friends and I don't know now You know how do I What do I do I just Maybe I have My moral is intact But I've lost my friends so there is And so many boys You know the thing that In 2019 especially In the second roadshow I did two In the second roadshow The thing that just kind of Shocked me by surprise was the number of young people And young boys would come up to me To ask for a hug So many boys would come up to me and just say Can I have a hug And when I'd ask them sure I'd say sure And give them a hug and then say why did you ask Their answer was well I have never got one My parents have never Given me a hug No one has said I love you to me in my life Before I don't know where to find You know love or acceptance These were the answers that I was getting And that's what's Happening Offline Now these same people and this is where I will tell you over the next two years when I followed I followed back a lot of these kids A lot of these kids I saw that a bunch of the boys that I spoke to Who were lonely were moving Towards anti-feminist And right-wing Groups on the internet Especially with all the protests that happened They started commenting on I remember this one really I wrote a post about this Fake news organization on Instagram And this one boy who used to follow me Who I met in Gujarat or somewhere I don't know Maharashtra only I think somewhere Very sweet kid Told about loneliness Gave a hug etc At the end of this To talk against me The group, the fake news Organization wrote Against me and said this guy is an idiot And this guy who I was Still following wrote on that post Saying that well this guy Nikhil Is a snake and when he came to my College I thought as much But I didn't say it At that time You were in front of me Crying and asking me for a hug And this is what you are saying On the internet. Now I of course did not You know say screw you or like I don't You know whatever But I was just, this is what's happening These kids are lonely There is no way to address their loneliness There is no safe space created for them And In the worst impulses You know especially when They don't have anywhere to go to and anywhere to fit in They are finding these identities And that's what's happening to the world You have been constantly asked You know you are so lonely Because there are narratives that you have to follow When you try to fight those narratives You are pushed back against a wall So with the internet At least you don't have to worry about Finding someone offline because you are like I am not getting community offline, I don't want your community But online I am going to find The folks who are Who give me The respect Of being heard You know whatever I may say And a lot of these communities Are just angry communities There is a Someone who is very close to me Very very close to me, who I have lost In fact I made a film called Tasali Se You know on this But Who I think I have lost to Someone who I was very close to because Who has blocked me on all platforms because he said You have become too liberal Because this kid, he is my age But he has gone the other way And he is just constantly sharing hateful Posts and when I kind of Commented and said you know why are you doing this And just after a point He blocked me and said like Stop your liberal bullshit And I was just asking why you are being so hateful But I know his background And I know he has been lonely all his life He has been a single child, he has never Fit in, he had a lot of problems growing up You know and In different ways, lot of issues Which I don't want to get into but I know that this guy never fit in Anywhere and now he has found a Community, he is friends with The lot of the right wing You know, influencer people He is in a very big position right now And he is friends with a lot of these people I see him following them, they are following him back But he has found a community that now gives him that Respect Which is what everybody in our country Is ultimately looking for Respect the elders, how will I grow up? By joining the biggest Most loud, most vocal Most angry Community online And social media has Incentivized this And there is this book that I was telling you about Chaos Machine that I am reading right now It's just Max Fischer Fascinating, fascinating, fascinating book About how It's like the movie Social Dilemma But like a book but much much worse and much much more Detailed and he is given like a report A reportage of how Social media Systems in trying to In trying to maximize Their profits created Self Self coding Algorithms, AI algorithms That ultimately Started pushing people to extremes I stopped, I used to be Very active on Twitter I have stopped being very active, I have stopped giving my opinions I used to give a lot of opinions, a lot of threads A lot of people on Twitter know me through my thread I don't do it anymore because I realized that I was also Just honestly only seeing negativity Everywhere, ever since I Stopped doing that, you know And I started like retweeting like Wholesome stuff, started retweeting Movie stuff, the only suggestions that I get Now are all related to stuff Which is fun and passion, but the moment I was Talking about opinion, my opinion would be out of empathy But the suggested posts, the suggested People are all angry, angry, angry Angry, angry Because that is the thing that emotional Responses are what The algorithms figured Are the way to get people To retweet or share or stay There for the longest time And the algorithms have now Pulled our world in different directions Where even if, and there was this Incredible, one of the big Parts of the book which is just incredible Learning was, so these Researchers did this Whole study, bunch of researchers On YouTube, where they did this study Where they said like, if I just Start A trending, I click on a trending video On YouTube, and then just Let it autoplay, how much How many videos before I Get a conspiracy video or an extremist Video, and the answer was 5 After 5 Autoplay videos, even if you are If you have scrubbed clean, you are on a New YouTube channel, you have just seen a Trending YouTube video, it's the 6th video is an extremist Or conspiracy video, and after that Every video is a, which you Dive deeper and deeper and deeper into conspiracy And when you've created AIs and you've created, you know Not man-made Platforms, that And people have figured this, you know Amit, you would know This, having spent so much of your time Online, all the people who are You know, opinion Generators and you know On the internet, they figured it How is giving an opinion your Entire identity, and How is that every opinion, you have an opinion On every topic in the world, and every Time you have something nasty to say about it Because that is how you get engagement That is how you get more views, that is how You stay relevant, and that becomes your identity You are not getting Any bigger, you know one of the I had gone to the Such a random thing, I had gone to The partition Museum in Amritsar It was, it's a deeply Like emotional place, and again As someone whose family is shifted In the partition, I was always like What are my roots, and that's also maybe one of the Reasons my misfit thing has Always been there, but I was shocked to see That two or three of the Gifts to that museum Came from The The nastiest Angriest People on Twitter, I'm not going to name Them, but like Everyone knows them, and The moment you go there, you are just like It's almost two and two together It's almost like, oh now I get why She's so, I've said it's a Woman, but now you get why it's This person is so angry All the time, especially against Marginalized folks, because there's clearly A, there's a letter there, there's All the things that were robbed of this person During the partition from their grandparents, and that's Generational hate that she's carried Through it now, so you see That starting point, and now you see What it has become, but Earlier where for the longest time this person Wasn't speaking about it, the moment the internet Started incentivizing this Everyone says that We were always like this, we were always all hateful, I Don't agree, I Disagree very strongly We are not even Realizing how we are being gamed by Online system, when you go offline And you meet the same people in offline Settings, you could have the You can have the Absolute, and this happened in the second Roadshow for me, lot of kids who later would Troll me, I've met them offline They are the sweetest kids who have Genuine problems, and I don't hold it against Them, what their online identities have become Right now, and I know when I Go back and meet them the next time, they were still going to be Nice and kind to me, but on the internet They're incentivized to be You know, assholes Because, you know, the moment You do that, there are many other people Who laugh, who say ha ha ha Who might retweet, and then suddenly you realize This is my identity, I can, through this I can get more clout But ultimately it comes down to loneliness We are all extremely lonely Because of everything that's happening In our society, our country, our Gender, our, you know The narratives that we have been told And we are all trying to find ways Of feeling less alone And unfortunately The internet and social media has Incentivized Anger as the way to do that And find communities of anger That help you feel less alone And that toxicity Is now turning threatening And, you know, dividing countries, dividing Families, dividing people Apart, but I don't Because I have a little bit of self-awareness I'm still going to try And not judge the person who's Hating me, I'm not saying that I'm going to take that hit Because now after a lot of times, I mean for a very long time I was also trying to talk back But you realize the conditioning now has gone so Extreme, this Talking doesn't help at all, so now I restrict people, I don't want to block them Because again that gives them a certain satisfaction, they might Come back again, because that's also Incentivization, I got to this person So instead of blocking I might just restrict, the people might just Constantly keep commenting, I don't bother On that, I might mute People, I may not bother on that But I don't judge them and I don't look down On them, I just feel sad for You know, what is Our communities and what our society"

Are you comfortable with that? Until they gave a go-ahead We would not put it up, and Only 2 people overall in our entire Roadshow have said no, everybody has said yes Because that's also power, I think, to be able To express, and it's a catharsis, and it's a Owning your story is a very important Thing, so Mohit's story was, he came and said Really sweet boy, 18 year old Came to the open mic, and he was Trembling, you know, and he first started reading A poem, and The poem was about bisexuality, so in the Middle of the poem, he just stops and says, I don't know If anybody caught that, but I'm bisexual And that's the poem, so we cheered for him He immediately said, woohoo And Mohit was Suddenly very surprised, he's like, wait, what?

        "message": "And what was it like? So, the way that I've now Found You know, to explain anxiety To someone, and now I've also realized it's a little Privileged, so to speak, but The easiest reference point for me was that If you've ever been on a plane You know, and you've had turbulence And then your heart sinks for a second You know Anxiety is like that sinking feeling But all the time It's your heart not stopping From sinking You know, it is What in Hindi sometimes, you know, we kind of Say it as ghavrat But, you know, because we don't have Vocabulary for what is anxiety So ghavrat bolte, which can also be nervousness But a lot of the times when people Say it, I think it is coming from a sense of Your heart sinking It is feeling Too overwhelmed Because you're not Able to feel The emotions you want to It is, you feel too much because You feel too little It is And it has a Reaction to your body also So for me To give you, you know, examples Anxiety Had turned into a way where It had turned so bad for me that If I would get up Let's assume at 7.30 And I have to Get out of my house by 8.30 To get to my office and I was living in Kandivali At that time my office was like an hour away Or something in Andheri So at 9.30 I have to get there But for that my Uber needs to arrive At a certain point and then I will get to office at 9.30 And from 9.30 to 10 I had time For myself before the office Hour started and that was a very important time For me that I will organize myself and then This work will start. So this was the routine that I had When anxiety took over me If my Uber instead of Coming at 8.30 Sometimes would just cancel 8.40 8.45 it came late I would not be able to You know Go to work that day because I would You know so There is a book Where I think one of the Green Brothers Called it Thought Spirals You know that your thoughts start Spiraling in such a huge way Where I am now in my head I am like ok now before the Uber has come I just see that ok it's going to be late by 5 minutes In my head I am like Ok so 5 minutes it's going to be late I am going to not be able to reach my office because the traffic Will increase. I will reach only by 9.45 And you know before I can even You know get organized or whatever it is The meetings will start. So I would actually not get time To prep for those meetings and once the meetings Start then you know I am Anyway going to be unprepared and people Will find out that I am not good at what I do At the end of it you know they will come and tell me Because I have also been happening for so long And I am you know And maybe it will turn into A conversation about whether I deserve this job or not And I will probably get fired And this is How big you think when it comes to literally Uber Getting late and if it's going to get Fired what is the point of going What is the point of going on this job right now There is no point. I would much rather stay home And just like instead of facing the world I would much rather just sleep in my You know Bed today and just avoid Putting myself in the situation where I will Get fired And that's how badly it That's where it goes And it could start with just as simple as Uber getting late. Anxiety is when You have when somebody sends A message saying hi But doesn't say anything more than that And you start panicking What does this hi mean This person has said hey before But not hi before. Does this mean That there is some bad news Does this mean that I have offended this person Does this mean that There is something they want to say to me That they can't say and until I say it back You start. There is just so many Scenarios. Your head is Filled with scenarios of all The terrible things that Can happen to you because of Because of this one little thing That might go wrong and you are It's Unbearable. I mean it's not Something that I mean I went the one Year the first year. I still have anxiety But I don't. I mean it's not clinical now So there is of course it's a spectrum also Right. So you Sometimes when you have an exam the night before You get very. That's also anxiety But that's you know that will happen on You know you have a tough day at work. You have an appraisal Coming up. You are tense about it Those are all also anxieties But then when it becomes persistent When it becomes you know Relentless in many ways And it goes on for months and days And end. That can sometimes Be clinical. So And it's called generalized anxiety Disorder and so I was Diagnosed with that at some point But Before that it was just for me like my Just overthinking that's what I would think Of it. Why am I overthinking you know It wasn't overthinking. It was just my brain like Just absolutely Not pausing for breath You know it would just I would have to. I was telling you I was going to US for that event Goalkeepers and I was In. I was so Tense because I was just like Man I am going to. My Bag will not reach. It just Became a thing in me that you know and I have gone To. You know I have travelled internationally a lot I have grown up in of course in Bahrain so But I just said that I am going You know I will take a lot of my Clothes. I have you know bought New clothes for this but my bag Will get misplaced and if it get misplaced Then I will not have anything to wear And because I am overweight I will not find the right fit So when I go to the event I will not have clothes To wear so people maybe they won't Let me enter because it's a black tie event or whatever It is etc etc. So that is my I would have these conversations with my therapist And she just be like you know Of course she will get me to do breathing Exercises and then say you know What is so one of the things Then the exercises she would give me was like Think of the worst that could Happen and I would say okay this is the Worst that could happen. I will be It won't come and I will have to fly back Okay so if that is The worst that could happen is it really that bad And then when you start thinking okay Maybe it's not that bad Then you start getting a little calmer you know So I mean there are so many different things that Would work for different people but it was Unbearable for me I would have trouble breathing I would have trouble Getting off my bed you know on certain days I would have what I realized Later were panic attacks where Just you are frozen For like 20 minutes you feel like you are having a heart Attack and it's just your body Refusing to like give you the Your brain refusing To give signals to your body that it's okay to get up And you know because you are just like what is the Point everything sucks and everything is Terrible terrible terrible So it was it was I would sweat a lot I would constantly be sweating I was constantly be like you know I am not able to Things are going to go wrong so yeah Even now I know when I know I am getting anxious I know because when sweat happens You know my body my heart would start pacing So So these were the symbols And you know which I again a lot of my My wife you know Daisy Used to think That again it might have something to do with my heart Because again you know she is like You get it checked or whatever it is maybe it's a Cholesterol issue whatever it is She noticed it I wasn't even able to Notice it you know when you are in it you are not able To have that perspective She was the first person to notice and say I think something Going on with you why are you so like Tense all the time why are you sweating so much And sweating was the thing you should go to a doctor When I went to a doctor about this And she is like you don't have your heart is fine You have anxiety What does that mean You know so first they gave pills but I was like Okay let me just you know I also wanted To figure before I take pills Is there another alternate Or whatever it is you know And I mean Pills work for a lot of people I just Someone who wants to first see that if there is An either way and then kind of okay with pills Also so that's when therapy Was suggested to me and then it took me I think two more months after that point to actually Go to therapy because I was like I can't go to therapy If I am a man does that If I go to therapy that means I have to Admit that something is broken in me And can I You know and can I I am not comfortable with the idea That I am broken and need to be Fixed you know I am fine so what So many you know people go through All kinds of shit what is this I can't overcome like this little thing but it wasn't Little it was unbearable it was Unbearable I literally had to quit my job Take six months off Leave everything Take a sabbatical in my life Before I was able to feel you know Better and it's only when I started Working on something I cared about Working on like mental health And you know that I got a little bit of strength Back but it was It's hard it's very Very hard and there's not enough resources that You know so Unfortunately we don't even have Again as I said we don't have a vocabulary of mental Health in our country right In regional languages or even in Hindi What when you have Depression or anxiety what do you say There is no colloquial terms for it There is Which is mental health You know but no one Says That's not something you talk about right Depression is Dukh There is no word for it in that sense right There are clinical terms maybe But no colloquial terms so when you When you are sad You are sad but then Sadness, upset, depression Spectrum there is no Way of communicating how I am very sad but it's still Sad right you can be sad when You know you are you have a Heartbreak and you can also be sad When you know you are depressed for six months but How do you compare so And because of that it's been so Difficult to have conversations about mental health In our homes and our families Because your parents don't have terms for it And they think of it as a foreign thing We don't have it here It's a mental The moment you hear mental first thing people think is Like psycho the second thing Is like mental hospital Those are the I mean can you imagine It's so tragic that you know Last year You know last year When Sushant Singh Rajput Passed away you know Our country Concocted a narrative Of a conspiracy In his death Because we were unwilling to accept That he could have Died by suicide Because how can someone successful Want to do that there has to be Something nasty behind it But Robin Williams Has also done that unfortunately And there are a lot of other folks Who have spoken about it And attempted it and done it Because it's mental health can happen To anybody Issues can happen to anybody It does not discriminate It doesn't matter If you are at a low in your life It doesn't matter if you are high in your life You can have depression you can have anxiety And it's okay And you can go and get it treated You can go to a doctor Same thing that you know you go You go to a doctor when you have a cold Now you might go to Find out if it's a cold or it's a covid It could be a cold spectrum Right in the same way When you are having trouble With your mind sometimes you just Have to get a checkup to see that is it just You know a little tension A little stress Is it burnout or is it You know clinical depression Clinical anxiety and there are Ways of overcoming it But you need to be comfortable with having The conversation first which in our country In our society in our families We are so afraid of Anybody says it and it's Seen as like again in the roadshow So many kids have said that you know I harm myself because I told my parents I want therapy but They are saying you are not mental So then I need my pain to go away so I harm Myself these are the kind of things you are hearing In this country It's tough but as I Said you know I mean the more we talk About it the more normal it will be the more Normal it will be the more Unafraid we will be there are Statistics that say that mental health issues Have increased I don't think that They have increased I think we are just Talking about them more I think they are always There you know It's just that it's also how there are Statistics that say that there are more You know lgbtq people in the world right now No they have always been there they just started Coming out more right because Now it's a little bit normal to do that and In the same way it's a little bit normal to talk about mental health We have always been struggling mental health Our parents have struggled from mental health I have seen my Parents go through it as I said my father Used to go through something which I realized my father had anxiety when I got it All my life Growing up I used to get so angry At the way he would behave And then I had emotional breakdowns and I had I told you I can't Cry I had breakdowns where I was crying For three four days I just it was Crying there were times that I couldn't stop I would Want to stop but I just Couldn't it was so bad And And you know and Then I kind of recognized that well my father Has gone through things And I did not know and none of us were aware And we were Resented him for the way he was behaving But we didn't have The instruments or the Language to talk About what our parents have gone through So many old people Today are going through it In my family again there are people who Are because they are lonely in their Old age they are going Through it but we don't Talk about it and there are Very few support systems The mental health professionals That we have per person is just Such an abysmal number And again it's so still The point of entry is so expensive That I don't know I mean again so I still have hope I still again I feel like this generation is making it Normal to talk about these issues They are putting it out there Making it a conversation And through that I think like even Families now you know are Comfortable with I know Now some people who are older in the Parents age group who Have now expressed to the children saying that Yeah I'm okay with trying it More parents are joining it and I think Like we need to look out for the not only Our mental health or the mental health of younger folks But also the mental health of our older You know of older folks you know They are probably going through the toughest Transition since the pandemic imagine Having to stay Alone without your children not Being able to have that Love or hugs from them You know being able to touch them because of The danger that they might give you something How tough it must have been"

of thought Which sometimes you do with medicines And say you know it's both But the second one is more about Well it is suicidal it is coming from You know Deep seated Issues that could even have started in childhood That are now acting up So sometimes it is one or the other Sometimes it is both again And that's what I have been told and that's what I have found out I think that a lot of Mental health issues today Are not Just because of chemical imbalance Which is one extreme You know which is one in the spectrum There is that but that is when You it's really you know and sometimes it Borders then on mental illness You know where you do need medication To Help and that's completely okay right On the other hand what Depression anxiety in a lot of people today And these words are being thrown around a lot Without full context to them But They come from the lies This whole conversation that we have had Has been about that only I found out as I said in my therapy That it happened because I am a man Because I was I had Burdened myself to live The story That was told to me by society To such a large extent That I started getting anxiety About Where do I even go from here I have nothing left to do I have ticked off all the You know Check boxes that I was given as a Young kid as a man To fulfill by a certain age and I fulfilled It but now what Where do I go from here I am already At Yashraj I am 30 I have Become GM at Yashraj What next Maybe I become AVP maybe I become President or whatever I make more films I make more shows And that's it I just keep doing that Over and over again and sometimes that's enough right For a lot of people and that's enough But I was just like I had this idea that again Are you happy after retirement If you accomplish milestones there will be some Like joy at the end of it But there was no particular Joy after making those web shows Or making those things it was a Great thing But I had put all the burden Of my joy Linked to my success Because as a man that is what I was Told you hit these milestones And that is success and that success Is equal to happiness But I found out that to be patently false You know success and Happiness have nothing to do with each other And what is success This idea of success is flawed It's the stupidest idea in the world What is success It is It's so ridiculous That we have put we have Quantified success As Things you something You achieve if you do one two three Four steps you know And I can tell you Any person who becomes successful Is unhappy because there is always Another more successful person out there That he or she then compares themselves to And that's the And that's what it is Once you hit a milestone there are more milestones Once you hit your goals there are more goals Once you hit a certain kind of success There is more success Shahrukh Khan has had Many flops and he is Shahrukh Khan Amitabh Bachchan went through this Entire phase where he was He didn't have money and he was Amitabh Bachchan You know and I am giving you References from Bollywood but I am saying that Tell me one person who has always been successful And that's it he has made it And Khatam there is no such thing once you make it It's not over you still have to do Continue staying relevant I have to do more To continue being in that position So it's a never ending cycle It's a trap this idea Of success is a trap and the more You chase that idea the more you chase This thought that you know once I hit These X Y Z milestones Then I can be happy then you are Never going to be happy I am so sorry to say That but that's just how it is because You are always something else It happened with me when I was in School when I was told That you know well I mean everybody is told Right if you do 10th then You will be set for 12th But it also happens when You know if you are an overachiever Or whatever it is First your parents tell you to top in class Very good And then you top in class then you top in school Then you top in school Now you have to top in the district Now you have topped there but you have topped in India You have topped in India but Where are you when it comes to Harvard and international students You know who in the world Are you There is always going to be someone You will either compare yourself with Or others people will compare you with And it will never be enough It will never ever ever be enough And that is 99% Of the issues because of which we have mental health Issues in our country because we have this Conditioned idea Of what success should look like This will be the designation, this much money should be there Whatever it is but none Of that is success in my opinion And in my belief system I feel like success is Being able to You know live a day in which When you wake up in the morning you are happy to do whatever the hell You are doing that's success That's as it's as simple As that are you you call it Monday morning Monday blues or whatever it is I am not saying that you can't have them you can have them But you dislike your life because You have broken it into Like you know okay I go to Work and then I come to home and work Is bad and home is good and At the end of work if I am getting money then it's fine If the appraisal is good then it's fine But 80% of the you know Everybody is on autopilot Just living this hoping that you know Someday when I get this appraisal when I get this When I unlock this level of My career that's when happiness will come But that's none of that is How it is going to work out You need to Be at peace with the idea That Success is a notion That has been again put by a system That wants to Capitalist system that wants To continue running on the On your hamster wheel That is what success is If you have a family That you love and loves about you That loves you back that's success also If you have Something that you love doing that you find joy in That's success also If you you know and it could be anything If you have 1 lakh rupees but you are Happy in that 1 lakh rupees or you don't But you are Content in that 1 lakh rupees that's success There is no other thing And that's also happiness Happiness I feel again in my Personal opinion I just feel like you know We look for happiness in the big things but happiness Always in the smaller things It is in the joy of the present Versus the Idea of the future Versus the It's so hard for us to find it And some of this again coming back to how Internet you know the internet Today is all about what's next You are consuming things in a way Where You are making that victory It's like I am now watching One reel but this is fun I like it but I have to go to the next one Because that can be better Then I have to go to the next one that's better So you have also been conditioned to think that whatever is coming next is going to be Much better than the one How do you survive in the system Obviously everybody has anxiety And depression everybody is going through it Without even recognizing it because this is A system that is made to You know screw with your mental health You are not allowed to live in the present Imagine you are on twitter right now and you see that Okay there is you know unfortunately a A tragedy that has happened in an estate And you are seeing that Video of that tragedy and you are just feeling really Bad about it And before you can think or process The next tweet is about A film you love and a really funny Visual from that film and you are like oh Haha and before you can Think about that or stay on that There is someone that You know who has said something which has offended You and you are just like I am angry now And then again you are you see a cat Video and you are like oh so cute What you are your mind is Constantly In so many different Places because at the Same time you are constantly Chasing the next high That you are now conditioned Now we are society conditioned in a larger Way it is about you know After one year of hard work there is going To be appraisal where you will get the money And that's when if you are successful you will be Happy if you are unsuccessful you will be Unhappy that was society telling Us now social media apps are telling Us well in the same moment You know until you go to the next Video you will not be happy because the next video has Unlocked the happiness for you So it's a It's very tough I am just I get very like This is one of those areas that I get very worried about Because I feel like there is a Epidemic of You know Mental health you know Problems that a country And the world at this point is going through And we are not Talking about it enough We are not We are not even recognizing that This is mental health Our attention spans have gone For a toss We are constantly chasing The next high you know Relationships have been reduced to swipe right Swipe left you know Victory and defeat has been you know victory And like whatever you know and Dopamine is about scrolling up and Scrolling down how do you deal With this system and where are the support For this who is talking about it enough for us To kind of be like okay I am also going through this"

I was going through anxiety The things that started helping me So anxiety also happens When you feel like you are losing control There is no Like the pandemic Why did the pandemic make so many people anxious Because suddenly you had lost control Of the way You lost control of your reality A life that you were leading till then Was taken away from you You don't have any control anymore The government has control And you have to just stay in your Because that's just how it is We don't even know how long And you have to cede control It's very tough to kind of Constantly trying to control every truth of your life To kind of have that taken away So what My therapist would tell me And what I started kind of doing was How do you find little things in your routine That you can control So that becomes your thing I have this Everything else might be out of my control But this I have So reading for me became like a really big I really picked up reading again Because I have read over the last two and a half years In the pandemic particularly That in the morning I'd get up and just read I started waking up really early And looking at I have a Fortunately a view of the sunrise Live opposite RA So I can see the sun come up from my window So I just started waking up in the morning And every morning I just see the sunrise Because it was just for me it was Like no matter what happens With the pandemic this is going to happen every day This is the truth that will No matter what You know it will continue You know I I did not speak I used to speak to my mother Once in a week or twice in a week at that time I used to think of myself as that busy In the pandemic I have spoken Since the pandemic I have spoken to my mother On video call every single day In the last three years because I was so anxious about the fact that They live in Bahrain and suddenly You know the flights were Cancelled and you didn't Know when your air travel was gone And my parents were staying separately in Bahrain And I am staying in Bombay And I was in Such a bad place Such a bad place that I couldn't Like for the first month of the Pandemic I am not joking I couldn't get up from my bed I was just anxious So badly because I was like what is going to happen to my parents They are in Bahrain I am not there to help them I am not there to you know quote unquote protect them What choices have I made In my life that have led to this moment where The world has stopped and I am away from my parents It was so tough for me So tough for me and then I just You know thought that maybe I should just Talk to my parents everyday And then I started having like these video calls with her I have never done video calls before And then just seeing my mother's face everyday My father and I also became closer actually during the pandemic Just looked at each other And my brother was in the US All four of us would get on these video calls and then just There was so much I don't know just felt Peaceful and calm just looking at each other's faces Doing that you know we are okay And that's something we could control We could call each other everyday Look at each other's faces and feel peaceful So walking Was something that I told you Actually I want to say this on record also Your episodes really I am not joking about this Your episodes really helped me during some Tough days on the pandemic because I did not have the I did not have The will to Even go for that walk because I was so in such Bad shape and then you know I restarted When Prem Banekar came on your podcast And I was like well here is a man I admire Here is another man I admire and they are going to be talking and it's a long conversation Maybe this is the reason for me to get out of bed And I remember that day I went For this really long walk And then I came back and I sat in the garden Of my building where I had never done before My building had a garden and I just never sat there And I sat, they have a swing And I just sat for the swing and till like I think till the Episode had ended I just sat there And I was just breathed a little more And I was like okay There is something to do, something to look forward to Something to break the monotony of the pandemic During that time so you have to Find what works for you you know And everybody like my wife She also got very anxious during the pandemic And I can say this because she is so comfortable Talking about it But she took to painting And she was She has become a master painter She started an Instagram page and she put a painting People are like please sell this to us and she is like I don't want to sell this I am just doing it for you know We are just saying anxiety journaling she was saying anxiety painting And it was just Gorgeous paintings of flowers and what not I am like how are you, what My pandemic is We are just struggling to reach 4 pages Your pandemic is you making this Turn your passion into this high art What is going on so it is That was also like How great you are dealing with your Anxiety and look like how tough it is For me but as I said everybody has different ways Of dealing with it and we just need to Allow ourselves to find what it is that Can help us the most"

back to The office saw Parks and Rec I had finished I had not seen Parks and Rec End to end I used to I had seen a lot of episodes In between I saw all of it For first 6 months every I was just finishing sitcoms Because I just needed to And it was the opposite in the beginning you know in the beginning I had to make sense of what was happening I just I needed my Mind to make sense of like What is happening and I am somebody who needed Who had kind of So I am someone who was very Active on Twitter and then when China thing happened I had Already my anxiety so my Anxiety now works in a way where it is A warning to me the moment I started getting anxious I am just Like okay there is why Why am I getting anxious what is going to happen and it Is almost like a prediction for me that there is something Whether in my life and in this case The world that there is something so I started getting Anxiety after reading like I was like And I started going deep into like Okay what is this going to mean and I knew At that time that covid is So I am actually making my anxiety work for me Like become very smart with it like I knew that covid is going to come to India Also I realized that the way it is shaping Up it is not far away people were Like still not okay whatever whatever I had given my team Work from home My team was bunch of 10 People at that time now we are 26 but at that time Just 10 young people but most of them Are from different parts of the country so Because of my anxiety because of what I was going Through you know I kind of told My team to go from work from home And that also happened because Parents of one those kids were also getting Very anxious I said okay let's just start work from home When at a time when nobody Was at that time kind of doing it The decision I am really proud Of is the fact that I just asked The kids who were from different parts of the country To go back to their homes I was just like I think the flights I don't know when this will Hit us when if it hits Us and we get into lockdowns in India also Flights will stop and you will not be able to go To your homes so I didn't go to my own Home which I then later Really regretted but I You know send my kids to you Know their homes and I am so glad That you know the anxiety worked for me in that sense But yeah so I feel like Everybody Has you know a Different way of Dealing with it I have Found you know again as you Said reading for me was I would Get lost in the I picked up fiction so And I was not reading fiction I was reading A lot of non-fiction for a very long time I also made a really stupid tweet about that once you Start reading fiction you can never read non-fiction I got really Trolled for it during the pandemic Really trolled Shiv Ramdas was the first one who said You are an idiot But But I Picked up fiction and it just helped me get lost In the lives of others I also you know sorry I also said I forgot to tell about that when the pandemic Started because I needed to make sense of it I was like what other Event has happened in the world that was Unprecedented and my head was world war I was like I have while You know there is there were people Who also lived through the world war World war 1 and world war 2 and while I had seen I mean of course everybody knows about it In whatever way I knew There was a documentary on Netflix and I was like let me Just go watch this whole documentary so I saw 10 hour documentary on the world wars And it gave me So much context in feeling better Later because what it did was it helped Me understand well you think Of the world war as this one event right But it was also from You know x Year to x year it was A period of 5 to 6 years Where people were living In war in war Time and I was just thinking You know because I need to make sense I Immediately realized that there is going to be This pandemic is not getting over in 3 weeks or 3 months It is going to go on So a lot of people had anxiety later When it didn't stop I had anxiety initial To prepare for the fact that 2-3 years Is going to go on and I was reading Some of the top science writers Zainab Tufekhi This New Yorker writer I forgot his name Fantastic writer from New Yorker Writing a book just incredible Incredible You know writer so just reading their things And preparing myself and then just needed to make Sense of the world that you know people Have in the past also gone through Historically it is really Troubled times and they made it to the other side We are also going through these troubled times I am sure We are going to make it that was my way of dealing With it content storytelling filmmaking Always becomes my go to You know reading became again Stories just getting lost in the stories Became a whole thing journalism Journaling for me I when I started journaling It is just a lot of negative emotion that I put out So while it is cathartic For a lot of people to be able to let it all out I see for me it just becomes a little bit More like I feel like I go deeper Into it so I just you know I did this Another one lovely thing which Really helped me I my mother I would tell my mother to My mother would also From the Guru Granth Sahib she kind of You know read From and I Just say that you know why don't you send me every morning A voice note because I really needed help I didn't Know what to do I was like can you send me a voice note Every morning from something from the Guru Granth Sahib And just explain it in your own words She does that quite a lot you know So then yeah I have this bunch of voice Notes from my mother during the pandemic for like Two weeks three weeks three weeks when a very tough Time every morning I'd wake up I'd see the Sun I'd hear my mother's voice note I would read a book and then I would feel a little bit more prepared about the day So it's Creative I mean again I think that I Wouldn't want to say as if It's everybody can you Know creativity can help everyone because honestly I don't know you know It is it is said that it helps everyone I have seen it help me in My own life I've seen it help My wife but at the same time not Everybody needs to have that Pressure of kind of being creative If you have Cooking is such a thing that A lot of people took to During the pandemic to really get Over the anxieties and I'm not talking about like Banana bread and you know or whatever But genuinely so many Friends that I know so many Men that I know were like you know washing utensils Became like a peaceful Activity for so many of us you know So many people I was for me So I just I just started enjoying Washing dishes as I just like the Routine of doing it the thing that you can control That there's a stain you finish it and Go away it just helps you the anxiety So it could be different things You have to you know find what works for you But of course you know take that Advice from a trained professional And you know When it comes to lived experience it's you Will always have a different experience from somebody"

Why? He's also 23 He's also a young person like us and he's part of our company Why are we not Calling him for the picture? Now again I don't want to Make this again I don't want to make it sound like right now I'm like You know It's not about I mean right now I'm not even talking about class or you know Cast I'm talking while of course that plays a part In it. I'm just Talking about the roles That we are conditioned To you know Play right? In all these systems. As an example The Accounts team you will not call for a picture Right? So it's also the same thing It's just like they work in accounts They're not like as fun as we are or whatever It is and it is in different ways Sometimes ageism is a thing that you know you kind of have And you don't call the You know people who are actually older as part Of whatever it is right? But overall I just see these Why is it that And I don't want to be I don't want to sound like a bleeding heart Or you know whatever. I don't want to sound like I am Even when I sound it It just sounds like I don't know What do I think of myself but I just don't. But it's true I just don't like it when The watchman or the In any of my societies calls me sir I am like why are you calling me sir? My name is this I know your name. You will call me by my name right? So you know they get awkward about it And I feel so bad And again I am not It just sounds like This whatever bleeding heart savior Kind of a. No that's not the narrative I just find in any Situation just it to be horrible That we have these social Structures, these social Constructs that We believe in and that we You know put. Why Is it I mean of course these are Casteist things but you know Why do we have separate utensils for people Who come from outside and you know So it is The same person in your family Can be the sweetest to everyone But suddenly when there is a worker who comes from outside You will you know be a Certain way with that person because you have an idea These people And it's not Just as I said casteism it is anything It can be just power. I think power dynamics Overall everywhere is just the reason While some of it is classism Casteism you know different different things"

What are you going to do with this idea of power? What do you get in a situation where you Feel yourself as the bigger person You show someone Smaller than you What is the joy that you get? There is no joy in that In fact it is just a stupid thing That you kind of do because it is a role that you think you have to play Because somebody played that role With you when you were in that place I didn't bully Anybody because Even if I got bullied I didn't bully someone On the other hand there are people who bully When ragging used to happen in college Even people who I used to really respect You know suddenly would rag and hit Juniors. I would be like why do you do this? This is the system Everyone ragged us So we have to do the same. I am like why? Why doesn't it stop with you?

I hope not But the fact that there was a person Who fought back and you know It was a close bunch of 5-6 people from Bangalore GT who just decided they will not do it Karnataka GT. We will not do it And so much respect So it is The buck has to stop somewhere The pretence has to stop somewhere Why are we pretending? What are you getting out of it? What do you get out of these Power structures which make you feel better Instead of that just spend your time With people you love Spend your time doing things that you care about Instead of these false senses Of like What will make you feel Superior in some way or the other So all of these places All of these structures where there is A hierarchy. I just Reject them. And again I don't feel Like. I don't say this. I feel Like you know We still have Designations in Yuva. It's not like we don't have that I also recognize that Everybody is so conditioned to believe that okay this is How we are unlocking the next level Of our career if there is a designation shift So great. I told you like I mean Again I can't talk about it on the podcast but The way I think of leadership In terms of I don't want to stay you know In Yuva as a leader for very long and I Want to continue. Pass it on to the next Young person. Why should I be CEO of a company Called Yuva for x amount of years What is the power in calling yourself CEO I'm still going to be founder. I'm still going to. It's still my company But someone else can Genuinely run it as a Young thought maybe much better than I Could. And I need to pass the baton On because if I have the privilege What am I you know doing with it if not Passing it on you know and It is If I'm stupid enough to think that I'm only here because of my own work That is actually Just that's just nothing But narcissism. There is Nobody makes it on Their own You could have systems you can say That have been against you but at the Same time there are also been places which have been For you. There have been that few people who Give you that you Know in small Different ways. I can't you know I just can't Forget the kind Kindness of people At different places in my life and could be Something really small. I told you what One of my friends told me just such a kind Thing that I needed at a tough time That you know somebody just said something And I just felt like okay. Thank you for saying that You didn't need to say that to me, but you've done It and I feel so much gratitude that there Are people like that who could you know There was a time where my brother Was in Bombay and he was looking for a job and he Had come from And he was going through a lot. I told you it's not in a good Place you know mental health wise and And I just didn't know because he Was in a he wanted in a different industry. I Don't know how to get him a job. I was in just Two or three years. I put out like a post and they Just people who Because of whatever they kind of thought about Me just I don't consider like even friends but just Some acquaintances that I've been polite And kind with who just Said give it to us and we'll pass it on and I just did it and someone somewhere Found him a job and I was like I don't even Know you that well, but you've just really Gone out there and I when it's you know, I'd be like thank you for Being and they're just like no you're a decent person And so I've also seen it, you know Just coming back that Decency or whatever and a very basic And this is not something to It's sad that this is the Bar the bar is that it's just Decent that is this so much gratitude That people have you know It's so sad. There's so many times, you know, I've had Like on my sets or something, you know people coming up And say, you know key Producers don't behave in This way, you know you Thank you for like being nice and I'm like that's just It is sad that this these words Are being said because I'm just being a decent Human being. I'm not doing anything extra You know, but I used to have so much gratitude For people who who in this World, which is so toxic You know would would be Mind in different ways that I used to I mean I Stopped it now and I wish I had More time to do it but for about 7 years In my life between 2000 And I think 11 to 2018 or 19 I mean after you I had to stop everything is so Much work that I was going and making Putting it together, but I used to send this Annual letter of thank you And I started with like I started By thanking I think what 25 30 people You know in that year where I was feeling grateful You know, I'm in Bombay. I think I'm in a good place And thank you for all the people who have like been There so far and who've kind of been nice to me And I'd give my you know Life lessons or whatever to people This is what I learned in the year. Thank you. And And then by the by the End of it it was some you know, like I think 400 500 people Who were there from 200 I never Spoken to them since 2011 or something but every Year, I would send my annual thank You note you were kind to me once I Just need you to I need to tell you you are a Great person. Please continue being kind to Others, you know, and and kindness Matters, you know, and it's just Still something like sometimes a lot of people come to Me and say did you did I do something bad If you remove me for your list. I said no, I don't have I'm not sent it out in the last five years I'm sorry. It's not that I've removed you"

It is very tough to be authentic You know the world wants to Fit into boxes. It will try everything To ensure that you're in one They will every little pressure Every pressure from everywhere Will will will try to do that But I can tell you that If you have privilege if you have a little bit of Power and in my life, I've seen that the Moment I've had these privileges and powers Use it to do something good Because what is the point otherwise, right? I've started Yuva as a Company and the kind of culture we have The reason that we have this culture right now is Because I never got this culture in you know And while again Yashraj was Still a place which was really like kind to Me but culturally I just Feel like what we are trying to do at Yuva is Not something I've gotten anywhere and today The kind of young people who work with us, you know We've it's a four-year company About Seven people have been here from three plus years You know and and all of them Started at 23-24 and they're now 27 and some of them are now in leadership positions You're getting great money also and They're just not leaving and touch wood and the reason For that is they just they they have had Different jobs and they're like we will never Have a place which as a culture Like this right and it is And they've created that they have Bought into that idea that this culture is important So it's not just me saying that Because you know everybody else has to Buy into that idea and be that kind And nice to each other we don't touch Wood again we don't have any Politics at Yuva why should we Because we don't we are very honest and transparent In the systems that we have there is no politics No one's bitching about anybody else at least At least not that I know of right but Like I don't you know you see it toxic Teams you see what is toxic in This team there is just a lot of love And empathy for each other I see That I see people stepping up for Each other I see people looking out For each other this is you know Just small little things that I see that Just makes me so happy like this boy who I really you know Adore if he hears this who is From Kolkata and he's Been with us now for two and a half years and he's still 22 so he's been with us since college He was part of the first roadshow then he You know he got a job which Was making a lot more we couldn't afford That at that point of time now he's grown And he's got more money now but he's trusted Us you know he's very smart very smart kid And he's trusted I feel like his talent with us he feels Like I oversell his talent but he's Very talented and he had His birthday you know and he Was first birthday away from home You know and I was just I wanted to and I was like What are you doing he's like I'm not doing anything and I wanted To kind of that day I had to I think I was traveling or something I wanted to be with Him but I couldn't I told my team I said like Guys first birthday you all have To you know take him out etc and it was Not like meant to be like just over In lunch and said it and that night All the other young people took him out Yeah whatever class they had they all cancelled And they were just they celebrated went to Marine Drive because he said I never seen Marine Drive So they all went to Marine Drive with him and chilled With him I saw in the stories and I was just like this is so Sweet you didn't have to do it I just said it upar upar se but they Left everything said yes we will do it and that's the You know touch wood like that's the culture that We have at Yuva and I've not had that Culture you know and any of the organization People kind of looking out for each other in this way You know but why can't that be a culture So again these pretenses are There because we have Lived in a world where people have You know lauded these pretenses Over us It is not easy to break through these pretenses It's really hard work I've not talked Enough about you know some of the Really tough times that I've faced in My work environments but I have faced a lot of tough times Including my own company in year one at Yuva Was a disaster I Can acknowledge it now But it was a just My understanding Of what empathy should look like at the Workplace just was a Absolute wrong decision I think empathy should come with Also professionalism and discipline I had completely Ignored that aspect of you know Work and just said like If as long as there is empathy In the team it's a great team but obviously It was a great team but it was not a team that was Working as hard it should be So it's a big disaster I failed spectacularly As like a leader or entrepreneur in the first Year and a half but then I've Learned from mistakes tried to Re you know kind of had A 2.0 of Yuva you know and try to get New people try to try and now it's Worked you know touch wood now three and a half years it's been Now where we have a very solid Team and very solid work culture But yeah it's tough No one says it's easy but when you hit Go to the other side it's worth It it's worth it in such I'm Able to be here on a workday because my team Is kick ass I've told them I'm On your podcast and I don't even have To like and it's not like you know anybody Is like oh look at this he's the CEO Of the company and he's going and chilling in a podcast I have to work nothing like that Because we look after them there's a boy from Our team in the last two weeks he's been Ill and this We welcomed him back with flowers and Thank you for being alive like we've not We were never going to question And so many the same kid Okay I was talking about He was feeling lonely Durga Pooja is very Important from Kolkata right so he was being lonely He's like can I go home for a month And work from home from there Now he's very important because he's done A lot of good work In among the younger kids there is he's A lot of responsibility that we put on him We kind of spoke to each other and then we were Like you know we will miss him on these things or whatever It is but then we also realize that he's Been such an important part of you are you Know if he wants this one thing Let's make it happen for him right And then we said okay go ahead you know And and he's just I mean What else are we here for you know if you're Not here to like look after each other so It's just There's a lot of pretense But Beyond that lies love So let's stop"

So Richard Curtis The man behind Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral Notting Hill Runs this organization called Project Everyone which is the media partner Of the SDGs the Global Goals The United Nations Media Partner So his organization Does all the content across the World when it comes to SDGs Or oversees it Creatively fantastic organization Fantastic people have worked with them Multiple times now that was the first We had got an email from Richard Curtis in our inbox Saying like we want to make Something in India around gender equality You know it is SDG And we would love To work with Yash Raj Films and can we Do a preachy Sorry didn't say preachy can we do like a Two minute video around Gender equality and we came back and said Like these two minute videos even Let's get big stars we just said like they become very preachy You can have the biggest stars But they will never have the impact You know if you want to especially you want to reach out They wanted to reach out to young people If you want to reach out to young people right now The cool thing is you know YouTube has become really big in India And we didn't have a YouTube channel at that time So we didn't have like or an active YouTube channel let's say And we had this Thought where we said that what if We did Permanent Roommates had just Come out I was very excited about the potential I had been brought on to make Films at Y Films which is the youth wing of Yash Raj Films but I had been told that I am now Also going to be leading the digital efforts And I was very excited about that so I said like as part of this What if we kind of did a web show around this And then my boss and I at that time Kind of jammed and there was a story that had come To us a series of sketches about gender But like with the world Inverted what if women were in the place Of men and men were in the place of women And then we said what if this wasn't a series of sketches But like a fiction show about A man who is misogynistic And dislikes women and thinks that Women have it too easy Why do you have Seats reserved for you in the buses Why do you get menstrual leaves Why is mother India why is there no father India All kinds of stupid things right And then he prays to the god and says If If the world flipped And you know and men were Women and women were women I wouldn't complain this much And cut to the world flips and he wakes up And realizes that now men are in the minority So to speak And are the oppressed community Women are like now people in power And the next three episodes Four episodes are about what happens there And every situation That women are in we kind of put a man In it and it's funny and it's also horrific Because he is going out In the night Wearing a low cut v-neck And there is a girl who is harassing him And then when he goes to the Police station the police The woman on the police station says what were you wearing So it's it's you know You laugh at it because it's A man and it's funny right But then it's also horrifying because this is what happens with women in India You know and she is Watching like a video You know which is so anyway Not to go too deep into it a lot of interesting People are associated with Ayushman Bhoomi, Richa Charda Pratish Nandy so many people When the show came out They asked us this True story so they had asked What is the what do you think you will get As views and this is now we are talking about 2015 where like What views and you know what not people used To get views but it Wasn't like numbers and targets and what And we said we think we will get Like over a period of five episodes Six episodes and we've got all of these Big people together and the show Will hit a million Hopefully Including the trailer Next morning I remember we came to Office after the show had launched 24 hours later And then all of us were staring at each other's faces Because we had crossed 1 million in 24 Hours without any Paid marketing nothing nothing was done Organically overnight This show had gone viral It was one of the first viral pieces of content At that time and we were How did this happen we had an Email from them Funny email that we had gotten Saying you know you guys didn't have to Like you know You don't have to under tell us the numbers You know like it's you can tell Us like what you're you know let's be honest in our Communication we were like dude we didn't Expect this to happen you know And it just and then you knew what happened Because you see the comments the comments were Insane I mean they were Just so many Girls saying thank you For finally making Something that you know Gets our voice across and what we are Going through and boys saying that man And for whatever it's worth this is Helping me understand my sister better this is helping Me understand my mother better you know Of course there was also misogyny But not at that scale that is there right now You know the internet as I said Discussed empowered a certain kind of Idea And then what happened and this Is where I think somewhere also I realized why What I needed and to do I'd been invited to IP college For women in Delhi for a during a festival they had And I had been Invited for their media fest and you know It was a big auditorium I was there Swara Bhaskar was there You know few other people were there And I had to give a Keynote you know on media and what not I gave A keynote pretty nice cool thing And it was a big auditorium and then There was like scattered it wasn't as Full you know even with all the people there Much bigger names than me it was not as Full and what not I was like okay Now I always do this whenever I go to colleges Where I say that you know after the Whatever prepared remarks or prepared stage Thing I would love to have an offline Meeting with like the people in the college just like Chill with a few people you can get your Same college committee I can you know Just I just want to meet you and spend some Time with like the folks behind the festival or whatever So I just said that love to meet Like some of the people who might want to spend Like few minutes extra with me It took me into a different room after that And before I knew It 500 Girls had come to that room Because somebody had told them That the person behind man's world was Here they obviously don't know my name And what not and It was I didn't have place to we didn't have place to I don't have that picture because like I feel So bad I don't have the picture we didn't have place to Sit we just it was not expected It was supposed to be a small thing about 4-5 People 500 girls had turned Up literally it was full full Hard plate room and I'm standing there and I'm just like What is happening and they're just like we everybody Was just like we want to tell you what your show Meant to us you know what it has helped Us you know it we've helped it Has helped us explain you know Inequality to people that we know This that and I Was like man this is is this the power Of like I mean I had this Idea and hypothesis that you know this is What can happen but this Is insane And I just realized that this is this True potential you know we don't we can't just Start this conversation on the internet And then like stop it there we Need to talk we need to do these things Mindfully offline and And I tried doing that at Yashraj you know I tried I had a big vision for what Twyfels could be all the shows we did Were about socially conscious issues Ladyzoom was about you know it was A feminist show was India's first Show genuinely India's first Show featuring women in The lead and it was English language And we spoke about at that time about You know abortions and about sexual Harassment and about all the you know Issues that now we are talking a lot more about When it comes to women Shreya Dhanwantri And Sabha Azad were in that show that Became again a huge success to an Extended Indie wire called it one of the best shows In the world at that time organically Picked it up we didn't have a say in that so Six pack band we made which is India's first Transgender pop group won the Khan Grand Prix class lion Bang Baja Baraat of course became very popular One of these shows I tried very Hard within the wiref ecosystem To go beyond what we are doing on the Internet I was like the potential for this is To have these conversations offline To take these shows Take them to colleges Take them to because again I worked so Closely with young people across you know I was like Yeah man this they can genuinely have an Impact I wanted to at some Point turn what we were doing into like A maybe e-magazine an offline Magazine have people talking about These issues in a larger way How can we create impact was always the Thing that you know became Especially with young people between you but Of course that's not the business model of Yashraj Why would they spend this kind of I felt like Wirefilms had that kind of it could have been That but it was not the priority And I understand that I don't begrudge that but I And then when I got anxiety You know we were also We were at a place where unfortunately Yashraj Was looting a lot of money in the film business A lot of their films had flopped and suddenly you know Wirefilms was not Earlier The very kind Aditya Chopra Had pretty much given Us full creative freedom to Make whatever we wanted on the internet and was So supportive and so sweet to us You know he's I mean Genuinely one of the nicest I can't Believe that someone at his level of like fame And like power is So sweet and graceful to Just young people in his Organization he's so sweet To you know Who had been always so supportive kind of Just obviously was much busier Figuring larger work At Wiref and and Wirefilms Was not the priority at that time and you know And I was just Impatient because I realized that There is something here but we can we had Made we had hit Two two and a half million subscribers again in 2015-16 Everything we were doing it was Like the most successful Period of my life and career where Anything we were doing was turning into gold And I just Felt like you know and then I Got anxiety which you know Because if I mean And when I took that sabbatical And then I went again to these colleges In different parts of India Before even you I kind of went outside And met a lot of young people in different colleges In India I just knew that that's That's where the kindness project had happened that Had become a transformative experience for me I knew the power of offline communities And I wanted to say like there needs to Be we can't every Young platform in our country is a one way communication It's like we are putting online things And this is to people come And comment on it but we don't interact with them We needed to have a platform that actually Listens to young people we needed to have Two way communication that here's what we are Doing now we're going to go offline and talk about it And now we're going to have conversations about it You know and and that's the That's what I wanted to do when I started You know and again this was All an idea so just to also tell You the small back story of I had a friend called Amritpal Bindra Who was also the producer of Bang Baja Baraat and along You know I mean his production had made it And Pappu and Papa And we had become really thick because of the shows That we did together Anand Tiwari who is the director of You know Bang Baja Baraat again all three of us had become very close And once I was Done with you know when I was This is a true story like When I told my Therapist said that you're not emotional At the end of it she also said that You know what I'm giving you an exercise You have to find a male friend of yours And you have to go and tell that person You know what you're going through you know And I just chose Amrit Bindra To be that person and that night I went to his I said can I come over he said yeah Please come I went to his home and For about Much longer than I think the serial Unseen podcast I just started He's like how are you feeling I was like I just want to explain How I'm feeling and then for 7-8 hours I was just talking About like you know What I'm going through how anxious I am And how I want to do all of these things For young people and all these ideas that I had But I was like how can I do it I don't think They get the potential I was really frustrated I was like I want to do more things etc so Amrit very patiently sweetly listened to me that night And you know just was a good friend To me he had other plans he cancelled them all so just come And you know and the next morning he Said okay let me think over what you've said and I want To kind of come to you with a solution So I said I don't know what solution He will have but 2 days later he called me and said You know I've been thinking about it what if whatever You said is a company And I said that I don't know What how to do a company I'm middle class I don't know everything I'm too scared to You know do something like that he said He's like you don't worry We will raise the money what needed to Actually started and you just Run it you know you are All the things that you're saying that Should be the thing that you know Make it a company Make it a movement do what you can with it And I was so scared of it and This is before the sabbatical and everything And then I went I quit I went on sabbatical and I Think in the 2 months or 3 months I realized That whatever options I had in front of me the only Option that seemed like You know something which So for me Yuva I decided to start Yuva when In my head I made peace with the fact that Even if it fails it will be worth it It was not because I thought that it would Succeed but because I thought that if it fails It will still be worth it And yeah I came back and I Said and I didn't we didn't have a name at that time So I came back and met him and I said I have a name and he said what is the name I said Yuva And they loved the name and said let's do it And I had this vision that I made like this is what this For the next 10 years this is what Yuva will do and it's so It's so I'm so grateful that you know All the like out of all the things that we're doing most of Those things you know at this in 4 years And and the idea for Yuva Was as I said a platform that listens But just As I said we wanted to be the intersection of What is important what is interesting so what Yuva Really does now and the multiple Things that we do and again I'm very Proud of my team to be able to you know Do all of these things at one End we are doing research you know so we Are talking to young people listening To them we're doing listening sessions You know with young people across the country And working with the likes Of again from an Amazon and Netflix Where for example they have a show about You know As an example Majama Which was a show which a movie about You know the LGBT community They got they asked Us to come on board to do a research With young people from the Queer community to you know Take them through the script and take them through the idea And ask them is this does this work Are we being responsible and Representative for the community And we worked with you know Queer rights NGO And and couple of other NGOs we kind of Put on took on board You know with the young bunch of young people over there we did A bunch of research and gave back and said here's what You know people young people think About this and they made those changes so at One end we are working with like Film production houses and studios like Junglee, Excel Phone booth we have done research on Badhai Do we had done research on Many more shows That crash course many more shows That are coming and movies that are coming that we are working on On the other hand we are working with Something I mean like a UNICEF Gujarat To to and we put Together this year a youth manifesto For the government of Gujarat on what should Be the youth policy for Gujarat So UNICEF India Brought us on board they were they Obviously were supposed to present a Youth policy for the government They brought us on board to do the research among young people In India in Gujarat and It was specifically on mental health You know and we worked With different parts Of different young people in across the Across Gujarat and put it all together And we have the I should have Brought it in fact and given it to you It's like a booklet now that we kind of But it's such so insightful so Incredible you know how honest these young people Are and then we presented it to the Government and you know now they have to figure out What all they want to incorporate from it that's up to Them but that's the level Of research we're doing so lots we're Working with for profits non-profits but Ultimately again about impact on the Other hand we have a campaigns Team in campaigns Again we're working with some of India's biggest Non-profits and also some of India's For profits Policy teams so as An example in the branded space we're working With tender India on consent We have created a website with tender India Called letstalkconsent.com Which is a one-stop resource for young people to Go and you know learn about consent so we Have authored and put together the whole website Now what we are doing is we are going We have just finished we did this weekend Last weekend we did our first Campus activation where we spoke About consent and discussed consent In a college VGTI in Bombay And now over the next few months we are going Across the country to have conversations About consent with young people in different colleges Boys girls anybody from any Gender to come in and have Open and honest communication about Why is it so difficult for So many of us to recognize what Consent is you know that's At a you know level of you know With another as another example Of campaigns we are working with Dasara and Bill and Melinda Gates foundation Over the next two years to Put together a community Of 1 million young people online Who will talk about And care about SRH In accessible and talk about In an accessible ways how can we make Sexual and reproductive health the conversation Around that accessible for young People and over the next two years We have put together platforms called Youth K Bol across Josh app twitter Instagram that we are going to be populating And going to be making content around for Two years we are doing offline events will be doing Podcasts but for two years the Ideas at the end of these two years we should have a Community of young people That is constantly talking About SRH You know talking about it in meaningful ways and then Of course being champions where they will talk about it offline In their own families and lives etc right So that's campaigns as a separate Team that is working again offline Then you have a third team which is the events team We are now as an Example you know this year's Spotify has something called IRL And creators day that We are programming for them you know And they wanted to reach out to Young people Gen Z so they have come to us and say Can you please program it for us So we programmed it on the other hand you have As an example We did an Event with YouTube India During pride month where we did Where we had something called The pride class of 2022 Where we got 10 queer creators From different parts of India together to have a graduation Ceremony this year saying that Your voices matter and you know This year we want to kind of bring you together As the class of 2022 for Being the most outspoken about queer Issues and Yeah and we had like Parmesh Shahani And Sushant Divgikar coming and giving Them talks and YouTube coming and Kind of teaching them how can they make Creator content better And just making a day out of it and having A full graduation ceremony where they had a class photo And they had you know You know The whole jingbang that comes with it So that's the third Thing, the fourth is Content that we are making, in content We are doing content on Instagram, YouTube etc But we are also doing branded Content again on issues That matter you know But in interesting ways, how do we make all of these things Accessible, we are also doing Short films, we did two short films this year with MiniDV, one was called Grey with Shreya Dhanwant Jandiya Mirza, one was called Tasali Se with Nakul Mehta and Naveen Kasturia Now we are making a series for I can't say the platform but we are making a series for a Platform that's going to come out next year There is also a movie in the pipeline We have done a podcast with Spotify called Tear Teenage Me which has become one of their Most heard podcast We have been renewed for two more seasons So Yeah that's content And then yeah I think we have covered It all and then yeah sorry finally there is community And college activations where we go to colleges We have a network in about 500 Colleges of India And we work with Different again for-profits Non-profits to do college activations Now whether the roadshow is also part of that At the same time As an example we did During The pandemic we did with UNICEF again a creator intervention It was called the content Creator intervention where We caught 110 Micro content creators in Colleges across the country Would like 10,000 you know You know or less Or more and With them we created 1650 pieces of content Over 6 months around misinformation Around vaccines because We needed to in there so in Places like Ladakh in places like Shillong in places like Tier 2 tier 2 plus Tier 2 tier you know to minus All of these cities where we could have Conversations but with young people talking So we help them create this content It got us like a 40 million reach Over 6 months Across multiple platforms and that's the Yeah that's So offline also we do a lot of work Offline we are doing these open mics and these safe Spaces online there's A lot so you know touch wood the team Has really now I mean they've worked So hard on all of this such a So grateful to have such an incredible Team now and Yeah we are just getting started I think"

finish Finishing reading which I've just now incredibly Like and I'm gonna just Recommend recent books because I feel like That's the easiest thing to do And you know that doesn't otherwise I get Too divided and I start getting anxious Virtual can I name but I'm just reading this book I've Mentioned before Chaos Machine By Max Fischer which is I think essential reading for Everybody about The way the internet And social media has is ruining Society and you know and Shoving us into Division and polarization Incredible book incredibly Researched Absolutely incredible I mean you've You've already spoken about Shayana's but I just Her book was So I mean again gender And Shahrukh Khan Such a beautiful beautiful Book that I've read Another book in the not in the Same lines but called Invisible Women I'm sure it's been recommended earlier As well and Opened my mind And how you know from a lens Of the fact that every space that We occupy has Been created of and for And by men and Just things that I never thought Even as someone who looks at gender Very always sees gender in different Places I never thought of Things like how when In a In a club the Sizes given to the male and female Toilets are the same I mean the question was why are there more Women have longer lines in clubs Than men do why do so many women Want to pee and men don't want to pee But men because we have urinals there can be Five urinals at a club but for the Same type in the same Area which is also given By men designed by Men women will have only three Toilets sit down Toilets and because of that The lines are longer And you just Don't even think of architecture In a capacity of gender And there's just so much I mean it's an incredible book I read It really opened my mind I'll also Name a memoir You know Will Smith's book It is It is so sensitively written And it is also about Gender the entire book is about like You know what you've seen Will Smith Literally his book starts with assault It starts with how First line of the book is how his father Hit his mother And how that has Impacted him all his life this book is about violence And you know And trying to deal with that violence It's so introspective so Personal so well written I'm shocked that a celebrity at his level Has gone so deep And been so transparent About Again his identity From the lens of gender So and it'll help you understand What has happened in the Oscar stage So I mean that's Clickbaity reason why you should read it but otherwise It's just an absolutely great book Yeah okay so The last book I would recommend again You know is a book By Ayaad Akhtar called Leggies or elegies I don't know how to pronounce it And it is it's a book About the Muslim identity It's written Almost as a fictionalized He's written a fictionalized version of his own life You know and what the Trump You know being a Muslim in America Pre and post Trump and it is Just brilliant I mean it is so well written Just I don't even know what is the way to describe Well this man writes just Incredible writing So thoughtful so nuanced So smart I've been I've become Such a huge fan I'm waiting for his Next book like I'll also give like a Really fun suggestion You know because I Read a lot of film books and just Really fun to read You know again recent book Seth Rogen's book And it's both available I mean if you have to listen to an audio book Hear that He's just got bunch of insane Stories from Seth Rogen's life and this So funny it's so funny you laugh out loud So often and he's got These bizarre stories about you know Other celebrities like Nicolas Cage And and and of course Growing his Jew identity and you know What that meant growing up Fabulous really really Funny book I'm still Trying you know I feel like I Don't read enough books from You know Indian authors and I kind of actually Have started You know some some of your Shows and showed I mean recommendations I try to go try to Buy those books but Still need to do a lot more but yeah These are my larger recommendations Music I am you know I'm not A very big music fan or Music buff so I mean not in the sense Of I don't Have a diverse enough playlist You know or I have not Explored as much music as I Think anybody else though one of My obsessions again as If I use that word again over the last Few two three years has been this Singer called Shamoon Ismail Who is a Pakistani Singer and sings in Punjabi And and makes jazz And blues and hip-hop And if you haven't heard him I have just changed your life right now Because he is incredible What a voice and what A what a singer In the pandemic somehow just I don't know Got so much comfort Listening to his songs I've listened I mean my Spotify Rapped over the last three years has been Top is just Shamoon Ismail The other my comfort My other comfort Band is Is Vampire Weekend I'm I'm Again I don't know I feel like I don't know this Is something so The millennial experience Of being lost And and in this Huge world you know And trying to find your place is just Vampire Weekend does such an incredible Job of of Explaining that otherwise You know I am I really love like I mean I listen to Bollywood music a lot And you know I mean Amit Trivedi Has been someone I've just always really really Looked up to you know One of my all time favorite albums But I also really love because of my Father and that's one of the Things that I really am grateful to him for I've listened to a lot of Dev Anand songs So I constantly keep one of my Favorite songs of all time is Hum hai rai pyaar ke hum
