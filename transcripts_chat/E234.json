India and Pakistan have been in conflict since these nation states existed. It may be a hard conflict to resolve. It may even be an impossible conflict to resolve. But it is a conflict we understand. We get the motivations on either side. We know where the roots of this conflict lie. We know both the what and the why. We also know the limits of our engagement. But we know none of this about our relationship with China. Are India and China friends or enemies? Are we engaged more in combat or more in cooperation? Do the two sides look at this as a zero-sum game or a positive-sum game, a win-win situation? What do the Chinese want from us? What do we want from them? Do we even know what we want from them? These are important questions to understand, especially because China is way more powerful than us in every possible sense. And while there was relative peace between India and China in the decades since the 1962 war, things have been heating up in the last few years. This is a problem. And before we solve it, we have to understand"

        "message": "science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma. Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My guest today is a remarkable scholar, Kanthi Bajpai, whose new book is called India vs China, Why They Are Not Friends. I've done many episodes on China before, including a deep dive into the history of our interactions. So when I first started reading Kanthi's book, I didn't imagine I would find much that was new in it. But I did. This lucid and insightful book does the one thing that I enjoy in nonfiction books. It gets meta. Specifically, this book builds a frame through which we can examine the India-China relationship. It's built around what he terms the four P's, perception, perimeters, partnerships and power. If you find China to be a bit of a mystery and don't quite understand the contours of this conflict, then this book is for you. But Kanthi and I don't only talk about the book. I love delving into the personal and intellectual journey of my guests. And Kanthi had tons of insight for me about academia, being a public intellectual, how one learns, why it is important to forget the inessential, how writing and teaching make you a better thinker, and so on. There's tons of dope in this conversation. But before we get to it, let's take a quick commercial break. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons, and now it is time to revive it. Only now, I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com and subscribe. It is free. Once you sign up, each new installment that I write will land up in your email inbox. You don't need to go anywhere. So subscribe now for free. The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you. Kanti, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you very much. It's great to be here. Yeah, I'm honored to have you here. And also, like I start my episodes, generally delving deeper into, you know, a person's journey right from where they went to school, which in your case is interesting, because you ended up becoming a headmaster for you went to school. But you know, before I go back into the distant past, how have the last few months been for you? Like Singapore's been on a sort of a trajectory of its own. And right now, it seems to have coped with it really well compared to many others. And, you know, there was this recent announcement by the Singapore government that hey, we're just going to treat this as endemic after a certain point in time and and not do contact tracing and quarantine and all of that. But quite apart from that aspect of it personally, how has this time been for you where you can't go out so much and you teach and I guess you can't talk to students so much. You can't interact physically with other scholars, you've actually written a book during this period, in some kind of isolation, I'm guessing. What has it been"

        "message": "like? Well, actually, I mean, I'm glad you asked that because I think this book would never have got written if I hadn't had the lockdown or semi lockdown. And the fact that it came along at a certain time, and coincidentally, juggernaut books approach me to write the book. I'm quite disciplined. But I think if I don't get a smart kick in the pants and in an environment where there's pressure on me, very long pieces of writing, I tend to start bracketing them and putting them aside. I write a lot of chapters and books and try and publish in journals. But those are, you know, fairly short pieces. This was supposed to be 50,000 words, and it ballooned in my hands to about 75,000 words. And I think juggernaut got quite nervy about the whole thing. But I think I needed the discipline or the semi lockdown environment, where we weren't completely stopped from moving out. By July of last year, when I began this, we could go to restaurants, there was hybrid teaching, I could go out shopping and so on, so forth, and under certain conditions, even see a movie. But in fact, it became quite complex to do all of that and rather artificial and sometimes stressful, because you're worried about being infected. Oddly enough, ironically, the COVID contributed to my staying parked at home within these four walls in a small study and banging the book out. So I'd say, you know, the kind of collateral of it for me was that it concentrated the mind wonderfully. And I just banged out the book in three months. I have a bit of a library. You know, my kids always say, you buy so many books, what do you do with all of them, dad? And partly, I mean, I do read all of them. But I bank them, I bank them for when I will need to reach for that volume, when I need to check a fact or a perspective. And of course, the internet rides to your rescue. So even though I couldn't get to the library and discuss things with colleagues all that much on the book, I could always turn to Professor Google, who had lots of information and ideas for me. And so that's"

So you know, we'll take a digression here before we go to your history and talk about the act of writing and researching because, you know, when I picked up this book of yours, which by the way, I love reading, so enlightening, and so lucidly written, you know, when I picked it up, my assumption was I haven't read anything else by you except maybe columns here and there. But then I realized that one of your earlier books, The Roots of Terrorism, which I think you wrote in the early 2000s, I had actually read that while researching for a review I wrote of Alan Kruger's book on what makes a terrorist. And I realized that I did not remember anything of your book, or in fact of Kruger's book. And also, I have done a number of episodes on China in the past. And I realized that while reading your book and taking notes and all of that, that there was very little I remembered of them either. And this is something I find as I'm coming into middle age that, you know, one may read a lot and one may try to absorb a lot of knowledge, but it's one you forget. And obviously, by osmosis, you know, some, you know, the frame of how you think about things and the way you look at the world might be affected by osmosis in ways you don't consciously realize, but nevertheless, you forget so much, you lose so much. So in your case, you know, do you have any ways of, for example, doing knowledge management, trying to, you know, make sure you assimilate all the information that you take in all the books that you read? Tell me a little bit about, you know, how you do your knowledge management. And after that, you know, we can discuss how you go about writing a book."

        "message": "Actually, you know, you made an important point, which you phrased a bit pejoratively, in the sense that you said, well, you know, I tend to forget, but actually forgetting is a rather important way of managing knowledge. I think the brain partly automatically does that. If it's not terribly telling stuff, your brain edits it out. It doesn't stay in long term memory. And that's useful, because otherwise, you would be filled with all kinds of stuff that you really don't need. And what you do, the space you need to process more recent readings and knowledge would kind of degrade or be compromised. So I think a good part of knowledge management, in fact, is creative or periodic forgetting. And so I'm quite comfortable with that. I mean, I think partly, I just feel if I need something, which has now disappeared from my memory banks, I'll just reach for the book or go back to the computer. The other strategy, of course, is that I think periodically, as I read, I do kind of do a tick mark to myself mentally, which is to say, what is the value add of this? I mean, does it just reinforce stuff that I already know pretty well, in which case it's dismissible, forgettable. But if it offers something that's somewhat different, then I think I tick it off in my brain. And at least it stays as a kind of gestalt, you know, a kind of a quick picture or an image that remains in my brain of a value add that came from a book. I mean, take an example in my field, and it's referenced in the book. You read so much, but recently, 10 years ago, let's say, I think we all encountered Joseph Nye, the Harvard political scientist's idea of soft power. And I mean, I don't bother to remember every argument he made about soft power. But basically, the concept of soft power, how it differed from other forms of power remained, and I just tick marked it. Didn't make much use of it, to be honest, until it came to this book. And so I had one of his books. I refreshed my memory quickly on some of the details related to it. And I think that's how I manage it. I try to consciously tick mark a value add without stressing myself about remaining every twist and turn in the tale. And I think that's probably what happened with you with my earlier book, which you probably said, hmm, something here, but I'm not sure it really necessarily advances the cause tremendously. And I think your brain quite rightly just ticked it off as something that you wouldn't really need to preserve. And to be honest, I'm not sure I could summarize that book any longer very well either. All the bits and pieces of it are now seeping back in now that you mentioned it."

And, you know, so he's forced to remember it. So I think a lot of wives, including perhaps mine, listening to this will will be like, oh, that's why he forgets. It's not important. But do you use any technology or stuff for taking notes and all of that? Like earlier, what I would do is I would take copious notes in Microsoft Word, for example, when researching for an episode or something I was writing, but it would just be a long linear collation of text. And now I use something called Rome Research, which, you know, has nested entries, bi-directional linking, it becomes much easier to kind of categorize and search for keywords within everything that you've ever done, and all of that. So do you feel that there is a need for that? Or do you feel that no, you know, whenever you get down to writing something, you kind of broadly know that, oh, I need to read this"

I either slavishly write down every single thing that somebody says, or that I've underlined when I first scan a book or a piece of writing, and I can't see the woods for the trees, or I'm so lazy that I just give up completely and hope that if it's interesting enough, stuff will stay in my brain, as I said earlier, as a kind of gestalt, an image, or that little bits and pieces will remain, and I'll go back to the source when I need it, like you say, when I need it, I'll go back to the source, take notes. Even then, I'm a pen and paper kind of guy. And so I will just yank out my little pad and pen and take horrible scribbly notes. And in fact, technology has undermined me, because I've got so used to working on a keyboard now that I can hardly, you know, handwrite anymore. And often when I do my notes, I can't even I can't make sense of my own notes. So I go along as I write, I have a broad sense of where I'm going.

And, you know, I teach an online writing course. And after one of the webinars of that recently, one of the participants asked me an interesting question, which got me to thinking because I hadn't really thought about it. And her question was that, is what you write different? Or is it shaped by whether you are typing it on a keyboard and, you know, actually handwriting it by pen? And at one level, obviously, the answer is no, because words are words. And I've always held that, you know, for me, for example, a book is a words and author writes everything else is packaging. So whether I'm holding a physical book or a Kindle, the words are words. But on the other hand, if you you know, look at the way that you write like there are some people, there'll be videos on YouTube about how you can type as fast as you think. And the act of writing physically on paper is much slower. And therefore, you would imagine that your thinking also has to slow down to match the pace of your writing when you're writing by hand. And that may change the form of your thinking. Now, I don't know in what way and I'm kind of thinking aloud, you know, maybe it brings some kind of tear off to your thinking and helps it maybe it harms it because you're not, you know, you're going along slower than you would.

I began by saying what most people say, I guess of my generation or somewhat younger, which is that I could only compose by writing log hand with pen and paper. And then I used to type it in the old days when there were typewriters, I couldn't compose in a typewriter. And when computers came, again, I wrote longhand. I remember most of my PhD initially was written by longhand back in the 80s. And then I tapped it all out on a computer. And I just couldn't think and compose properly unless I did longhand. Now I've got to the point where it's the reverse. I really can't do the handwriting. I can take notes handwriting. I can't really take notes typing stuff out, but I can only take notes handwritten. On the other hand, I can't now compose coherent text handwriting. My arm hurts, it gets squiggly. And I like now the white screen or the slightly yellow screen. I like the clickety-click of the keyboard. I bought one of those clackety old-fashioned keyboards, which are now newfangled keyboards, because I like the clickety-click and the pushback from the keys. So there was something tactile and noisy that I need now as a feedback or as a feeling when I compose. And I must say, so it's reversed for me. I do much better when I type out the text originally, and then just use handwritten notes as a supplement. So that's where I am."

But I'm just sitting there and there's a white screen. And obviously, there are, you know, various hacks, writers have to beat this. And I myself, when I teach my writing course, perhaps a little hypocritically, because I don't know my own struggles so well, I tell them about how, you know, most of the act of writing is just getting your butt on the chair and just actually getting the work done. Tell me a little bit about your working habits, because you know, when one writes, initially, I guess, there are, one has to deal with the anxieties of what other people will think of your writing. And when you're a young scholar, you want to impress others, and you have to get past that, and that can sometimes come in the way. Later on, you have to handle things like the curse of knowledge, where, you know, you know so much that you assume that is, you know, is this even worth writing about? Surely everybody knows it? Am I stating the obvious? You know, which I would imagine will happen to anyone in any field when they are so deep into it, that everything seems common knowledge to them.

        "message": "Yeah, you know, I think that I need to get going quickly. And if I postpone writing too much, if I think it over to too much, then it slows me down, it paralyzes me a bit. I think when I was an undergraduate in Canada, and, and a bit thereafter, I had this kind of sense that you really have to develop a full outline, fill in the subsectors of virtually every section. And then when you've got a grand scheme set up almost on a board in front of you with connective sort of lines and vectors, and got it all figured out, that's when you really get going. And you write very carefully, very systematically proceeding from A to B and end up at Z. And I think as an undergrad, in one paper, I remember, particularly in my English literature class, urged on by a friend of mine, a girlfriend of mine at the time, I tried to follow that I got the most miserable grade I ever got. And I just had a kind of moment there where I realized that I don't work that way, I have to kind of get into it and then amend and edit and change. And, and the faster I get to it, the more likely I'm to do something a bit more original, and actually finish it and, and probably do a fairly polished product. And when I got to grad school, I somewhat, that is for my PhD in America, I somewhat went back to that idea that I had to get everything worked out in toto before I began to write anything. And then I remember that there was a moment, well, partly under the stress of writing so much in American grad school, you couldn't quite afford to do that. But I remember a moment when it got to my thesis, where I was still somewhat struggling with, you know, these different models. And my late supervisor, now late supervisor, Steve Cohen, was remarkably productive, saying to me, look, Gandhi, you'll never finish the PhD if you don't figure out how to proceed, you know, efficiently. And he said, what I can teach you is not the substance of what you're going to write, but how to get this thing done. It's a finite task, you'll never write something that is the definitive work for all time. That's not how knowledge works. So throw that out of the window. Don't be a perfectionist. Write what you know, quickly and hard and fast. Don't stop writing. If you get stuck in one section, move on to the next one. Write every day, don't lose the momentum. Write ungrammatically, write dot points, write fluently and floridly when things are going well. You'll have to come back to those to edit and, you know, amend. Because what looks wonderful on Monday begins to look terrible on Wednesday, and be prepared to do that. And finally, he said, you know, when you got something done, and you're reasonably happy with it, put it away in a drawer for at least a week. If it's a substantial piece of writing, come back to it. In the meantime, go on to something else. And, you know, looking at his example and how productive he was, and he wrote brilliantly as well, I just decided I've got to give that a try. Plus, of course, you know, he said, if you don't give me the first chapter in the next week, you're out of this program. So I mean, you know, the prospect of a hanging concentrates your mind wonderfully, as Johnson said, and I wrote it in a week. And after that, I think I never looked back. By the way, I should say, you're very kind. I haven't written that many books at all. In fact, one of the stains on my record is that I co-wrote one book. The book you very kindly mentioned on Roots of Terrorism was written likewise in about four weeks in a fellowship in Australia. And this one was written in three months. I've edited a lot of books, and I've written chapters for books of other people and so on. But I'm a bit of a lazy guy that way. I mean, I need someone to really push me and slap me around and kick me in the pants. And I write a lot for friends. So if an academic friend says, oh, give me a chapter on this or write a piece for that, or even this book, Nandini Mehta, who was an old friend at Juggernaut, said, come on, Kanthi, I've asked you a couple of times, write this book quickly. It's time. And I wouldn't say I did it out of a sense of obligation. I did it out of a sense of friendship and not wanting to let her down one more time. So, you know, I'm a bit of an externally driven writer. If you get me by the throat and shake me up a bit and shame me, I'll write."

But if I have to be like internally driven, it's a bit of a problem though. I, you know, I keep telling my students, obviously about the, you know, the constant trade off that everything involves between getting it done and getting it right. And my point always is when it comes to the first draft, you have to get it done. You know, getting it right is something that you do in subsequent edits and so on. Now, I'm also intrigued by the notion that you moved away from the thought that you have to have everything figured out before you write. And I'm reminded of this quote by the economist Deirdre McCloskey, when she said, quote, don't wait until the research is done to begin writing because writing is a way of thinking. Research is writing, stop quote, her italics, she italicized is research is writing. Now, to what extent does writing and also teaching actually help your thinking with the subject like one of the things I liked about this book and that, you know, contributed to its lucidity was that there's a very clear framework through which you are looking at India China relations, you know, the four P's as it were, which we'll talk about in detail, you know, do you kind of begin with a framework does that sort of framework or the way of looking at a problem that getting meta about a problem as it were emerge while teaching while writing, and then you flesh it out? And do you think for that reason that those who write more will inevitably be better thinkers and those who write less? Because writing forces you to think that much more clearly and that much more deeply?"

        "message": "Yeah, I think you've raised a lot of interesting issues there. For me, I mean, with this book, I know we'll get to it. But just in terms of the process, the publisher said, you know, write something that's for a general audience, first of all, so don't have a big, complicated theoretical framework that leads you into the subject and informs it and so on. But on the other hand, I realized that, you know, what I would end up with as a result, then might be just a long list of topics. And there are many things that are missing in the book, the river water problem, Pakistan as an issue between India and China, trade and financial relations between the countries. And they were all there in my original list. And I think juggernaut books probably hope that some of those would all be addressed in the book. But I realized fairly early on that I would just have a list. And I would knock off all these topics, for instance, also the whole issue of India, China in different regions, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, Latin America. And, you know, first of all, I wouldn't meet the wordage. But secondly, it would just be a list. And so it seems to me that one of the things we're trained in an academic life, particularly is, you've got to try and develop some kind of an argument. And that can come from two places, although I think they're kind of linked. One place, you get your way knowing out of ideas is you go to theory. And you sort of say, well, what would theory expect us to think about in terms of the India, China relationship? Why they're in conflict? Why do they occasionally cooperate? And there are some answers there, obviously, from international relations theory. The other way is the other source of a sort of framework is to be a bit more inductive, bit more playful. From what you know, if you're immersed in the area that you're going to write about, you kind of throw up a set of topics, start to sort of group them and categorize them and see whether something emanates from that. Now, pure methodologists in academic life will tell you, never do that. Induction can never lead you to knowledge. But I think that's hogwash. And I think there's actually a dialectic between the two. Nobody is tabula rasa. We bring some theoretical assumptions, perspectives, arguments always to bear, because in a complex world, you wouldn't see the woods for the trees. You couldn't put one foot forward in front of the other, unless you had a theory of walking and where you're going. So you need some proto-theory, and we always already have it. But you also need to be a bit playful, and you're always receptive to experience the empirical test. Things are bubbling around you and they impact on your sense experience. They modify your theory. So in this book and in a lot of writing, I think I do what my supervisor did as well. He would say to me, just chuck out a bunch of initial ideas that you have, a set of topics, literally spread them out on the page with your pen and paper, your computer, and then start to sort of cohere them into boxes, into categories. And he always quoted, I think, Aristotle to me saying, Aristotle said that the first move in science is to put things in boxes. And I'm sure Indian forms of knowledge and so on would probably give you some similar, very sensible advice. And for me, I think I do go with that. I've got some working ideas. I don't work at them too much. I don't develop them too much. And then I throw out literally sort of a bunch of words on a piece of paper. And then I begin to cohere them. And I began to think of what kind of boxes are them and linkages between them. And how many of these can I really handle? How much of these make for some coherence? What will I have to throw out? Where is it too much work? And I'm simply not an expert enough. And it's not the kind of area I should delve into. Otherwise, I'd make a fool of myself, you know. And I think that's how the four P's emanated. And throughout a bunch of topics, I reworked stuff that Juggernaut had kind of pushed at me. And the four P's kind of popped up. And I tried to give them some clothing to link them up a bit more conceptually back with my discipline. Juggernaut didn't like it very much. They said it was a bit too much for the general reader. We had a friendly disagreement. But, you know, ultimately, for a general readership, I think their instinct was correct. And so I didn't elaborate these four P's and where they come from very much. I could probably do that if you push me, or even if you don't, and say a little bit about why I think they are the four important areas. And so I think that's how I operate in my writing. One other thing that you touched on, which is quite nice, and one that I insist on is the link between teaching and writing or research. And I think it's a very important one. Sometimes you hear from academic colleagues that, you know, there's teaching and, oh gosh, it's such a bore. And it takes time away from research. And I just don't buy that. My best ideas have come to me when I've taught and I've had to explain in the most direct, sensible, clear way to students, what are some of the fundamentals we're dealing with here? And I've understood my discipline better when I've done that. And so, and you know, when you do that, also, you kind of, when you're preparing slides or a lecture, you suddenly realize that there are enormous gaps in knowledge. You think that there are all kinds of handy dandy books and articles that will answer a certain question, and then you realize there aren't. And that indicates that there's a gap and an opportunity to write something. So I think that that's very important. But equally, research is very important to teaching, which is to say, the best moment in teaching is when you can bring to bear an area that you're mining in your research into the classroom. It just, you know, there's a, then a kind of authenticity to what you say and do and a richness to it. Students can feel that you have chewed on this and have really made sense of it. And I think they can feel the kind of passion and excitement you bring them."

        "message": "Yeah, that's, that's fascinating. It's something I can relate to in the sense that, you know, I felt that I began to understand writing better when I actually started teaching it and not so much before that. And equally, when I taught podcasting as someone who actually does a podcast, it just came that much more naturally and it also fed back. So it wasn't just that my doing of podcasting helped my teaching of it. But while teaching it, I began to think more at a meta level, for example, about the nature of interviewing and, you know, the different kinds of approaches you can take to conversations and all of that, which I think also helped my craft as a practitioner. Now, here's a question, when you write a book and not just this book, but when you write any other book in a field where a lot of growth in terms of knowledge is sort of incremental, you know, gradually the layers come over years and decades and so on and so forth. It strikes me that there might be, therefore, two competing pressures that you might face. And one pressure would be that I have to say something new that I have to in some way, add to this body of knowledge, which could be dangerous because it could lead to someone trying too hard, for example. Or there could be a pressure which would probably, you know, maybe come from a publisher who might, you know, want to pitch a book for the masses or whatever. And there the pressure might be that come up with something definitive. Like if you're writing a book on India versus China, be definitive about the why, be definitive about the what will happen going ahead, which of course you can't, because it's incredibly messy and muddy. And, you know, every good scholar will have that humility to accept that, especially in a field like this, that there is so much that may never be known. How do you deal with these sort of competing pressures? Is this stuff that you've thought about? Have you ever as a young academic, perhaps aired on one side"

        "message": "or the other? I suppose I have. I mean, I increasingly have become kind of, what's the word? I mean, slightly, slightly more modest is the word that springs to mind right at the moment. And or moderate, in a way, a different way of saying it is, I've stopped taking myself so seriously. And what that means in the writing is that I'm committed to trying to present stuff clearly, use the word kindly about the book, Lucidity. And I think that's an important thing to do now more and more. And take the example of this book. I think those two pressures are exactly right, which is that on the one hand, as academics, we're always taught, you know, value add, look for something quite original that you're trying to say and communicate. Others don't bother. I mean, you're just adding to the noise in the system and overloading it. On the other hand, you know, I think the publishers set me a time limit, which meant that I couldn't do, you know, a very original research. I couldn't delve into some archival material that nobody else had touched or brought to light. I didn't have the time to come up with a grand theoretical proposition or a set of concepts that are used to interrogate relatively familiar materials and give us a different perspective on it. So I didn't have that leeway either. And so it seemed to me that, you know, I ought to kind of make a virtue out of all of these different constraints or opportunities and settle for the kind of book in a way that Juggernaut were urging on me, which is in three months, can I pull together quite a lot of stuff that's already out there that's quite well known and put it into some sort of a framework, nothing too revolutionary, nothing too rigorous and stringent intellectually such that I would have to get into very convoluted arguments about theories and concepts and to show that, you know, here was a brilliant new incision into the problem and a way of thinking about not just India-China relations, but perhaps all these kinds of enduring rivalries. So it seemed to me that I needed to strike a balance somewhere in between. And I think if the book has success, then it may have struck that balance. I pulled together relatively respectable, well-known materials already out there and pulled it into a simple framework, nothing too, too sophisticated. And that made it fairly quick and easy to write. I think it makes it, and it may solve your problem of someday remembering something about this book. The four Ps may stain your brain for a while. And I think, you know, that might allow me to clothe the material in a way that was easy on the eye of the beholder. I mean, I could dress in a very jazzy way when I go out. But if you dress simply, perhaps the image of you walking around will endure. So I think I tried to use the four Ps idea to make it simpler for a reader and yet provide some kind of a scaffolding with which to arrange the empirical materials."

Let's go back to your personal history, which is also very fascinating because you are the son of a diplomat. You know, your father was a very famous diplomat, Girija Shankar Bajpai, who, you know, that's your grandfather. Sorry, that's what I meant. Yeah. And a famous photograph of him with Nehru as well at a 1948 conference and so on. And you travel the world, like in your book, you've written about how, you know, when the China War happened in 62, you were in London and it was cold and you were freezing. And that strikes me as, you know, traveling around the world and all of that as a very consequential childhood to have, because it means you are different from all the other kids your age at that point. And one can speculate about why that may be the case. Maybe you are less ossified in your ways of thinking about your people and other people and so on. Maybe there's a natural sense of curiosity that can evolve from there and so on and so forth. So, you know, looking back, what was your childhood like?

        "message": "grown up in Delhi, for example? Yeah, so I'm a diplomat's kid, foreign service brat. And I think those kids all over the world from whichever foreign service they're in, they do tend to be more ecumenical, perhaps more liberal is the word or cosmopolitan. I think through their schooling as they move around with their parents, inevitably, they're forced to look through other worldviews. You go to school, you encounter foreigners, you in part take on their worldviews inevitably, and see the world through their eyes as well. Curiously, of course, the other side of it is that as a diplomat's kid, you're also immersed in your nationalism, your country perspective, around the dinner table with your parents, your siblings, the other kids in the embassy, the other members of the embassy. There's a very Indian kind of, you know, national environment as well. And there's that lens simultaneously. So I think the thing with diplomat's kids is that from almost the day of mother's milk, they're always bifocal, always looking through things through that national lens, which they're immersed in, and their heart beats to it. But they're also constantly encountering other views, how others see us, how others see our country, how others see other countries, third countries, and of course, their own country. And you as a diplomat's son have a certain perspective on the host country. And then you get a picture of the host country refracted through the lens of the citizens of that country that you encounter. I think diplomat's kids are like that. And they have to be open to that. I mean, they have to fit in in both environments and make sense of both environments constantly. So they're constantly testing reality against both these lenses. And I mean, I think it's a good thing. I mean, I don't mean to say that those who haven't had that opportunity don't have their own kind of strength, perhaps are more unifocal and know what they know and are not easily deflected and have great certainty about things that they do and think. And we need people like that in the world as well. But we also need people who want to roll things around their tongue, who want to be more playful, who want to be experimental intellectually. I mean, I don't mean to say that I'm the most creative human being in the world by any means because of this upbringing. I wouldn't say that's true. And there are other forces that operate on that issue. But I think my reflexive starting point, as it were, is that I don't like to go with the herd, with any herd. And I'm always, my antenna always go up when people are too insistent on a singular point of view. And I think that, you know, that was a bit of a struggle for me in my childhood. The first 11 years or so, my parents were outside India. They continued to be, but they did feel when I was 11 years old that I had to come back to India and be in an Indian environment, partly because they felt that I was losing touch with Indian reality and also because they were moving around constantly and the schools were, you know, an unsettling experience if you keep moving schools every three or four years. And so I went back to boarding school in Delhi and then Dehradun. And I think it was a fabulous thing that my parents did. And so I had an upbringing as a diplomat's kid where I sort of was raised to be uncomfortable with herd mentalities, with givens, with an orthodoxy. And I think that's remained with me. When I started out in more public life as an academic on television in the eighties and nineties, when I was pretty active in Delhi, you know, I exited into a period when I was very certain about stuff. And I argued very stringently about things like India's nuclear weapons options and so on. I think actually after that period, an intermittent phase of being so singular, I've come back to now rolling things around my tongue, I think a bit more. And that's recovering that sort of diploma early, early immersion in this bifocal world that I grew up in."

        "message": "So just just sort of thinking aloud. I mean, this brings me to another sort of question that often strikes me, like when I look at young people growing up today, so many of them choose to do all their thinking and their talking and their posturing and whatever it is in public, which strikes me as something dangerous, because, you know, if everything that I thought or wrote in my teens or twenties was, you know, on Twitter, and people took screenshots and all of that, one, of course, it would not be fair, because young people need that kind of space to grow up and change their mind and roll things on their tongue as you put it so well. But the other thing that it can do is that it can ossify you into positions, like when you're 17 or 18, you might go online, you might find a tribe, and you might join that tribe, and you're part of an echo chamber. And then you raise your status within that echo chamber with harsher and harsher pronouncements and, you know, by signaling virtue more vociferously than the next guy and so on and so forth. And because you take those chances, you start believing them, they become much harder than they would otherwise have been. And to me, that strikes me as a danger and a shame that like once you write something down definitively, once you identify yourself with a certain way of thinking, then you change, you change to the extent that you're more likely to hold on to that. And so do you think that that's a danger in these modern times where a position once taken actually ends up shaping who you are, like in your case, you said, you know, you had more certainty about certain positions in the 80s or whatever, when you would be on television as a talking head, but those clips don't exist on YouTube, right? People are not going to put screenshots of your old article saying, hey, you said this in 1983. So you have any thoughts on the changing times and how they can change a person's development of self even because you're just so much more out there?"

        "message": "Yeah, isn't it an irony that this technology that came along of the social media and all of that, and the unending, limitless kind of memory now with cloud and so on that's there, I suppose the promise was that this would lead to kind of enormous liberalization of thought that people would be able to express themselves who otherwise would not be able to because they couldn't write a column for a newspaper. They wouldn't be asked on television as a talking head, but now they can. I mean, because there's so many platforms where they can be heard. And so I guess, I mean, I went along with that thought that there's something greatly liberalizing that would happen as a result of this. Although I wasn't much until very recently on social media platforms or any of those kinds of instruments. But it's turned out that, as you say, I mean, they've become kind of silos, echo chambers. They've become platforms for insulting people. And when you insult someone, I mean, there are a couple of reactions. One is they could exit the system, though that seems to be quite hard to do. You just become aloof and exit. The other is that, you know, you fight back and you fight back, you dig in to your point of view even more stringently and become more stubborn and lose your plasticity and openness to disconfirming facts or to alternative perspectives. And the third, of course, is that, you know, you do sort of on the platforms themselves, you know, show that you can change your mind and change over time, more or less. And I think that it seems to me that all three are quite difficult. But I would like to think that I would try and do the third, which is try to signal that if you do make a point about my work or something I've just said, which holds promise of even a critique of me, that I'm open to it. And, you know, I went on Twitter when this book was coming online because Jagannath said, come on, Kanthi, you've got to just get out there and move with the times. And of course, it's good for the book and your ideas. And I've already had people challenge me, sometimes dismissively, sometimes slightly insultingly, sometimes generously, but with disagreement. And I think one has to deal with that. And I hope it hasn't been huge, but I've tried to deal with it by sort of saying, yeah, you may have something there. The book was a first cut at this problem. It's not the last cut on the problem. It's not the definitive word. And by the way, what is a definitive word in, you know, in such a complicated world? But if it's provoking and fostering a conversation, as long as we keep it more or less polite, let's proceed. So I think, you know, to my mind, we're stuck with these platforms. I mean, whether we like it or not, I don't think we're going to resile and move away from them very much. And there's something emancipatory and celebratory about them. And I think we have to work our way through to a place where some of the really dark tonalities will reduce. And people will learn that, you know, insulting, terribly stubborn kinds of sticking to your points of view, being dismissive about others, really it just doesn't work. And I still have that positive progressive view that dialogue in itself, they'll be learning from it. And I think, you know, I'm just getting a sense in the last few months that I've been on Twitter, that something like that is already perhaps beginning to happen. And the last point I would make is that, you know, I mean, nobody can be consistent over their entire lifetime, and it would be idiotic to be so. I think that was addressed to Gandhi on his, you know, his change of view of violence and war and his participation. You know, back in the day, he had come out in favor of recruiting troops for the British cause in the early part of the 20th century. He had tried to recruit people for the Boer War. He had, you know, participated as an ambulance person in the First World War, I think, or the Boer War. So people said to him, well, I mean, back then you did that. And now you're preaching nonviolent, you're not consistent. And, you know, he said, Yeah, I mean, I'm not consistent. Times change, I change. Why would you expect me to be consistent? And I think Keynes said it more. Was it Keynes who said something"

And you can get enormous insight and have great conversations that way. But by and large, the other thing that I noticed about Twitter, which is interesting is that, you know, we tend to think that the whole space is incredibly toxic. Now, the truth is that there are these vocal minorities who are incredibly toxic, because they are caught in these echo chambers and always posturing and so on. But there's a vast silent majority, which is not like that at all, which is something that I realized through my podcast and through the courses that I've done where, you know, I popularize them through Twitter, people sign on you, you realize what those people are like, and then you look on Twitter where everyone is shouting. And I'm kind of baffled by just the fundamental rudeness that Twitter brings to the discourse, like the act of quote tweeting, for example, where you quote tweet someone and you mock them. And that's so incredibly rude. Because you know, if you and I were talking at a party, and I said something that you disagreed with, you would not immediately turn to our neighbor and point at me and say, look, this guy is a fool. This guy is a moron. He's saying this. That's just so incredibly rude. It's so bizarre, you know, that we have to not take anything in good faith at all. But this is a digression. Why should we talk about these times where we still have the past to talk about? So tell me a little bit more about your childhood. Did you like to read you studied at Doon School also for a while? What was that like? Because on the one hand, you pointed out that your parents wanted you to be back home because they felt that you were being away from the realities of India as it were. Now, when I look back on my also privileged childhood as a son of a civil servant, although I didn't live all over the world in India itself, but nevertheless massively privileged childhood and going to good schools and so on. And as I grew into adulthood, I realized what a blinkered view of the world I had been given just by, you know, the occasion of my privilege that okay, I am the child of these people. You know, I'm using my dad's car to go here or to go there. This is the kind of school I am everyone else is also incredibly pampered kid. And this is like one view of India from one particular vantage point. And you kind of grow older each adulthood and, and you realize that there's so much more to this. And so one what was Doon School like and two, I presume that everyone you studied with at the time would be present day elites. Like I did an episode with Ramchandra Guha where he told me about his time in college in Delhi where his classmates, his list of classmates is like a who's who of, you know, India today, a small group of people. So tell me a bit about that experience and how your thinking kind of evolves through that. And then we'll move on to your personal journey and you know, what you studied and all of that."

        "message": "Well, first of all, Ram Guha was with me at school at Doon School. He was one year behind me. And there you are. So, but I think that, you know, first of all, when I came back to India, I went to St. Xavier's School in Delhi, in Civil Lines in Delhi. It had a boarding section in those days, and quite a number of diplomats kids, Indian Foreign Service kids were there. And that's where I started out. Although my father was a Doon School boy. In fact, he was the first school captain of the school. So, you know, I had a link to the school, my brother had been there, my uncles had been there, but my father didn't actually send me there. He was posted to Pakistan at that time in the deputy high commissionership of in Karachi. And he would come to Delhi periodically. And he thought that my transition back to India along with my two elder brothers and my younger sister, that he would see us occasionally and that would help us transition back to Indian life. So I was in St. Xavier's for three and a half years. And when they decided to close the boarding, he then petitioned Doon School to take me because I joined the school quite late in comparison to other boys. So I think the experience of the two schools were very different. I mean, St. Xavier's was basically a huge day school with this little boarding element. And as you know, it's a Jesuit school. So there was a very, very different kind of atmosphere. I wouldn't say it was a religious atmosphere in the sense of, you know, we all had to keep to sort of Catholic orthodoxies or anything like that. It wasn't shoved down our throat. Although there was an evening prayer and you could say it or you could just hold your hands and say your own prayer quietly and so on. But I think, you know, there was studying and there was a bit of stuff on the sports field and that was pretty much your life. And it was very disciplined in the sense that every moment of your day was metered and clearly your studies were the primary thing. And the students there, they were all mostly kids from Delhi who for one reason or another, you know, couldn't be day students. Maybe they lived too far away in Delhi. They were people from outside Delhi, but from in and around Delhi, not very far away. Some diplomat's kids as well. But Dhoon School was very different. And, you know, I think we think that, and there's a view, popular view, that Dhoon School, Mayo College, Ajmer, Sindhia School in Gwalior, these so-called public schools, they're the Baba Lok school. But actually the picture is rather different. It's the big day schools that are the Baba Lok schools, because the big business guys, the very senior civil servants, the politicians' kids, they tend to go to the big day schools, Modern School in Delhi, St. Columbus, St. Xavier's in Bombay, Campion and schools like that. Whereas the kids who go to Dhoon School or Mayo College, these are people who are from the second and third tier towns mostly of India. And in Dhoon School, they are mostly from the second and third tier towns of UP, now Uttarakhand as well, Haryana, Punjab, sometimes from Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh, some kids from Southern India, and later some students from Northeast India. But Delhi Party, so-called, or Bombay Party or Calcutta Party, these were really a distinct minority of the school. And the reason for that is that it was the students from these small towns, Saharanpur, places like that, Bhatinda, et cetera, et cetera, who didn't have a lot of facilities, whose local schools weren't necessarily all that great. And these second, third tier elites who wanted to give their kids an imprimatur, a better school experience as well, then looked to boarding schools like Dhoon School. And so actually, most of the students, even in my time, I wouldn't say they were the greatest elite types. There were some Maharaja's kids, there were some big business kids, there were some senior civil servants kids, but there were a lot of kids from small businesses or farmers' children. I mean, I don't mean small farmers, but medium-sized farmer families and so on and so forth. People who were in second and third tier towns from services backgrounds, that is to say they provided some service locally, the tea estates in Assam and so on. And actually, that's grown. When I was headmaster of the school, we did a survey of the kinds of students. And I can tell you that most of the children overwhelmingly were from the second and third tier towns. And contrary to the view, I would say a very large proportion, more so than when I was at the school as a boy, were comfortable in Hindi primarily. And certainly their parents were more comfortable in Hindi. I would say more than 50% of the kids at Dhoon School, their parents would be more comfortable in expressing themselves in Hindi. And so that was one part of the school that it actually wasn't that Babalu elite mostly. And I think the other thing was about Dhoon School was that it forced you out of, I mean, of course, the school is a gated community, but you have to get out and live your life also in Dehradun on outings, for instance. And it's not Delhi. The school has no amenities of the kind that you have in the big cities. I mean, in those days in Dehradun, and even until recently, there were no malls, there were no multiplexes, there was certainly no discos and all of that. And the other experience was that particular to Dhoon School was that from the beginning, thanks to the first two headmasters we had and the Indian teachers of the time, they insisted on two things that forced you out into the community. One was from the beginning, what later got to be called in India, SUPW, Essentially Useful Productive Work. And I think it was probably pretty much started at Dhoon School and a few other schools like that, which is, there was an insistence that the students had to go out and do community work in villages in particular. And that was a requirement of the school, you had a little logbook, and you had to write down how much of that you did, you could do some of that within the school as well. But quite a lot of it was going out into the community. The second was that every term for five days, you had to go trekking in the hills. And you went to very remote places and locales from Dehradun northwards. And I mean, I don't want to oversell it as a kind of foray into ordinary India, but it was at one level. I mean, you came up against just, you know, nature, the mountains, the hills, ordinary people in villages who often helped you as you were, you know, dealing with the terrain and geography and so on out there. So I think that in some ways, it was more of an experience of getting out of metropolitan life that I had grown up in, because I grew up in Paris and London, before I came home to Delhi. And then if I got out of St. Xavier's School, it was Delhi of the 1960s. But Dehradun of the 1960s was something very different. And the mountains and hills and surrounding villages, I mean, it was not a metropolitan life in that sense at all. And I think the school still gives people a bit of a connect to an India that's outside metropolitan life. And one reason I took the headmastership, and I'll just end the segment with that thought, perhaps, is that I wanted my children who were growing up kind of the Baba Logue life in JNU, where I was a warden of a hostel, and where they were going to, you know, kind of Baba Logue schools, the new schools, the Vasant Valleys, or the Sriram schools, where all the kids were businessmen's kids or very senior civil servants kids who were all very metropolitan and cosmopolitan. Whereas when they got to Doon School and Wellam Girls, my daughter went to Wellam Girls, later my son went to Doon School. I mean, it was a very different set of parents and boys. And I thought my kids needed that they needed to get out of Delhi."

So, you know, we'll take another digression before we get back to our narrative of personal biography. And this, you know, I'm struck by the phrase, it was not like the Delhi of the 1960s. And obviously, I understand the contrast, which you're talking about between 1960s Delhi and 1960s Dehradun. But, you know, for someone who lives in Delhi today, for a young person today, how would you describe 1960s Delhi? Like how has it changed? What was it like back then? Because I would find it impossible, for example, very hard, not impossible to describe 1980s Delhi, which I know a little bit better. But what was 1960s really like? I'm also curious."

        "message": "It was a very quiet town. And I literally mean that. I don't mean it metaphorically. It was quiet. You could go out into, you know, central Delhi, Lutyens' Delhi, and walk around there with, there was no hubbub. There weren't, you know, pile driving cars and trucks and buses and honking and all of that. It was a quiet city. It was gracious in the sense that there wasn't this kind of very aggressive sort of scenes and moments that you felt, you feel now, or even in 1980s Delhi. And I think it was a Delhi, I think, to be fair, it was a Lutyens' Delhi in the sense of an elite that was more Anglicized, more Westernized, living in bungalow life and in the few select colonies. It was a much cleaner Delhi. It was a very livable city at that level. There weren't any fancy malls, obviously, or fancy cineplexes. There were very few foreign goods. There was none of that. If you went to Khan Market, there were no shop hoardings visible, pretty much. There were a few cars and motorbikes. And you went into shops where everything was available in cupboards, behind glass cupboards. And it was very unglamorous, all Indian goods, basically. So it was a very different kind of Delhi. I think it was comfortable at that level. And it was a pretty Westernized, elitist Delhi. And for a diplomat's kids, and you know, my father's family had been in Delhi since New Delhi was built in the 1920s. My grandfather had come from UP at that time. And so, personally, of course, when I did get out of St. Xavier's School, I came back from Dhoom School briefly on my way to see my parents wherever they were abroad. It was a Delhi where I knew a lot of people through family connections and so on. So it was a different experience, I think. And there's a sort of a sense of nostalgia about it. It was a very tractable Delhi. It wasn't very big, I think. I mean, when I went from St. Xavier's School to visit my grandmother in South Delhi, you know, she had a plot of land in Friends Colony. My friends who used to laugh at me and say, oh, you're going off to Faridabad, you know. So it was the edge of town. And a really big adventurous outing was to go to South Extension. When my parents would come from Pakistan to visit for a time, they would take me to South Extension. And my friends would be very excited about, you know, you're going to the edge of the town. And Vasant Vihar, I mean, if you looked out for Modern Bazaar, the shop there, there was nothing but farmland there. So, you know, the landscape was very, very, very different in Delhi. Delhi was civil lines and North Delhi and all of that. And then, you know, Rajpath and Lachchind's Delhi and Defence Colony, Friends Colony were the outer limits. And so I think it was very tractable. I would walk sometimes. I could walk from my uncle's house at Wellesley Road, from the Armed Forces Officers Mess there to Connaught Place. Connaught Place was a centre for, you know, things happening, discotheques and shops and fast food, such as it was. And, you know, I would think nothing of walking there as a 14-year-old or a 15-year-old, getting into a scooter. And, you know, you would be on a street, waiting for a scooter, and it would be pin drop silence. And then you would hear a car come. If I could very badly mimic the sense of it, of a kind of eeeewwwwww, a car would go and then there would be silence again. That's unimaginable, I think, almost anywhere in Delhi today. So, yeah, that was Delhi. And I miss it. But, you know, Delhi today has its own excitement and vibrancy, I think. So, you can't live in the past."

        "message": "Yeah, yeah, you can't live in the past. You also mentioned that you went to Dehradun because I mean, one reason was that you wanted your kids to have a life outside the Baba Log life and all that. Baba Log, by the way, would be such a lovely name for a novel because you can read it both ways, right? Baba Log and Baba Log. And that's one reason why you went there. But I guess another reason for why a place like that would be extremely attractive is like you said, the quietness of it, the pace of life being so slow, the hills around and so on. And, you know, at an abstract level, many of us aspire to that. We say, nahi yaar paharo mein jaake rahenge and we'll, you know, live a quiet life like that. But at the same time, the kind of life you might want to live in the abstract collides with the kind of things you want to do in the concrete, which often require being in a big city, which are often not just work, but often just other things, meeting friends regularly and so on and so forth. Is that something you've thought about? Because when I was just reading the bare facts of your sort of biography, it struck me that you bounced around a lot that, you know, you've travelled with your diplomat father, you've been in Doon School and all of that, you've done the schooling here, your sort of BA and MA at British Columbia, then your PhD at Illinois, then you come back to Doon School and in between you've taught at Doon School, you come back there as a headmaster, then you come back to Delhi, you're at JNU and now you're in Singapore. So how does one think of that? Like, does one think of how one wants to live one's life purely in terms of career goals, that these are the things I want to study or explore, or this would be an interesting institution to be part of? Or have you also had other considerations while kind of planning your life out that this is also where I want to be, this kind of life suits me?"

        "message": "I think, I mean, I'd love to say that, you know, I was a person who thought that bouncing around and moving jobs and so on was, I mean, that I kind of was ahead of the curve. I mean, who stays in a job for very long now? It seems to be the norm that you move around and you're hyper mobile between jobs, between locales. But I don't think I was that clever or imaginative or adventurous. I just went where the jobs were. I mean, my father was a civil servant. He had a plot of land that he inherited, but he had no money to give me. He was not really willing to exert himself to get me a job of any kind. And the one time he tried, I mean, it was a farcical and it didn't suit me anyway. So I had to make my way in the world. And I just went where I thought somebody would actually want me. And my first foray to Doon School in 1979-80 was, I mean, basically, I mean, my dad made it fairly clear that I couldn't be on the payroll for very long. And I had to get off and start arranging my life and my finances. And when I said, no, I'm not interested in sitting for the civil service or going into business, then he was like, OK, beta, then better make some plans of moving on. You can't live with me forever. And not being adventurous, I just looked for who would want me. I hoped that someone in journalism might want me, but there weren't many places in those days. So I wrote off to my old school. And so I went to Doon School to teach for a year. But what I realized was that I'm not really a schoolmaster per se. And so after a year, I went on to do the Ph.D. in America. But when I was finishing at Illinois, finishing the Ph.D., what I did know was that I didn't want to live in America. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the U.S. and earlier in Canada. But it just didn't seem to me that America was really deep in my heart that way. And American lifestyles suited me, even though, you know, up to that point, most of my life had been in the West. But I just thought that there was something in terms of lifestyles and the future that didn't work for me. And my wife was Canadian, white Canadian. And I think she sort of had a little bit of a sense that she would like to be back in North America for the longer time. But she was very, very kind to me and I think indulged me a lot. And she agreed that, you know, we would move back to India. And I was encouraged by my supervisor, Steve Cohen, who wanted to train Indian and other South Asian students to go back so that they could hopefully make a contribution to the intellectual life of their own country, particularly academic life. And so with his encouragement, also, I thought about coming back to India as soon as I finished. And my first job, actually, you missed it, but I don't blame you, but it was in Baroda at MS University in Baroda. And that was partly because although JNU was a natural habitat for me, it has such a massive School of International Studies, one of the biggest in the world, and 85 faculty members at the time that I finally went there. But I still had an instinct that I wanted to start out decentred from the centre. I wanted to be away from Delhi. And I'd had my first child, she was very young, my daughter Gayatri. And I think my wife, Bobby, was a bit dubious, living in a small town in India. She knew Delhi, she'd lived in Dehradun with me for a while. But I thought that it would be a bit of an adventure and it would be nice to see another part of India. And I had a cousin there who taught in the history department. And she told me about the job opening. And there weren't too many other jobs in international relations. I applied for it. I got it. And I remember I finished defending my PhD thesis on a Saturday morning or some such. And I was back in India on the Wednesday and I think I joined MS University on a Friday. I mean, I may have got the days a week and all that mixed up, but it was within four or five days of finishing the PhD. I was back in India and in harness, as it were. And, you know, from there, I moved back to the States for a while. I thought the university, which had been glorious for two or three years, was going in a direction that I wasn't enjoying, ultimately. And that's a slightly different story. It was getting a bit too nativist for me, but they were good years. I had a second child and I went back essentially to Illinois for about a year. But again, with no thought of really staying there, although, again, I think my wife would have quite liked to be back in North America with her family. But again, I mean, one day I got a phone call sitting in Illinois in my office and it was Abid Hussain, the famous Indian civil servant and ex-ambassador to the US. And he'd been, I think, deputy chairman of the planning commission or some such. And I had never met him. And he just said, Babu. And I said, I'm sorry, who is this? He said, I'm Abid. Abid Hussain. And of course, I'd heard of him, but he spoke to me in such a familiar way that I was kind of drawn to him and into his world almost immediately. And he was vice chairman of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Contemporary Studies, which is the think tank wing of the RGF. And he said, I've heard about you from Steve Cohen, who's here at the Ford Foundation in Delhi. And he said, you're very keen to come back to India and come for a couple of years and help me with this think tank. And then you can do what you like. And I mean, a few, I finished the semester. A few weeks later, I packed my bags. And Bobby and I and the babies headed home. So I think, you know, I mean, I won't tell you every step of the way of what happened since then. But I think I went where serendipitously jobs opened up. I think there was a broad trajectory, which was that I always wanted to be home in India, doing something in India. I was comfortable. So it was a personal kind of comfort issue. I did have a bit of a sense of, can I do something for my country? But I mean, I'm not trying to dress myself up as being somebody overly noble and all of that. But I just sort of felt comfortable and good. And it seemed to work for me. And I would say it sort of paid off, you know, my whole professional life developed and flowered really in India. And I'm tremendously grateful to the institutions that took a chance on me, my students that helped make me what I am, the media in the 1980s that gave me an opportunity to make a bit of a name for myself and all the rest of it. I mean, my colleagues. And that's how all again, why did I go to Doon School? I got a call one day as I was rushing off to do my early morning lectures, which I'm never good at in early in the morning. And somebody just said, Dr. Bajpai. And I said, yeah, I said, I'm so and so from a search company. And somebody mentioned that you might be a candidate for the headmastership of the school. It's your old school. And I said, oh, my gosh, well, I'm running off to class. I mean, I can't discuss it. But no, I never thought about it and said, well, are you kind of open to it? And I said, well, which old boy wouldn't be? But not really. No, not at this point. And he said, but would you like to have a chat later about it? And I said, well, of course, I can't say no to that.

        "message": "so you know, another serendipitous thing happened. And that took me off to there. That's fascinating. And what's also fascinating is when you talk about these two phone calls, and I you know, I must remind our listeners that today when we say received a phone call, it means you know, you've got your mobile phone and mine is always on silent. So if I get a phone call, it's because I'm looking at my phone already maybe going through Twitter like a junkie and you know, the phone flashes and I pick it up. But otherwise, I'm not going to pick it up. And in at the time you would have got the phone call, it would have been a physical instrument, it would have rung two or three times, you move towards it, you wonder who's calling, there's no caller ID, you pick it up, and then the person says what they say. And that's also such a charming recounting Mr. Hussain saying Babu, it's like, it's so cinematic, almost a scene that you kind of described. So maybe after the biography for movie is made on your life, that could be a pivotal scene, maybe add some dramatic elements to it, look outside after the phone call and your car blows up, something like that. Anyways, let's sort of go back to the final strand of your personal journey that I'm curious about, which is that how did you get into the specific areas that you got into? Like when people are kids, you know, they'll dream of being a pilot or an ice cream seller, or a movie star, they won't dream of being like a foreign policy scholar or a noted academic and so on. So how did this kind of happen? Was it again serendipitous that you do one thing at a time and it takes you to that final destination? Or did you have a sense at some point that these are the things that I find fascinating, that I want to go deeper into, that I want to wake up in the morning and look forward to the day and reading these kind of books, studying this kind of subject will give me that happiness? How was that"

        "message": "for you? I think there was no straight line for me as there probably isn't for most people, you know. And as I said, I was not a person who knew so definitively everything that I thought and wanted to do and how I looked at the world. But I think quite early, I had a sense that something to do with the written word always was very important for me. My eldest brother Shyam was, we would say, a bookworm. I think he introduced me to the world of books a lot and things like chess and intellectual matters a lot. And my other brother Ishwari, who went on to be a journalist, he introduced me to sports and competition and being in the world, you know, being outside of myself. And I mean, I play a lot of sports, or I did, but I'm not a sportsman per se. It wasn't that influence that Ishwari had on me. It was that being in the world, being active in the world. And he's a person of strong views and ideas, and he can be much more argumentative in a good way. And I think I got that from him, from my brother. And I think from my younger sister, I got a sense of a certain kind of loyalty or commitment to a sort of family and all of that. And the metaphor for me there is, I think, you know, not being very public or demonstrative, but doing something quietly towards the well-being of others. I think my sister is a very outward person giving to family and all of that. And what that means, I think, for me in my arena was, I mean, trying to give something back to the public. I mean, I don't want to state it too grandly. I think my siblings had quite an impact on me. But why this area then? I mean, I think it developed gradually. My father forced me to do economics, because my brothers, especially my eldest brother said, oh, no, the way the world is going, you know, they were all history students. My dad had done history at St. Stephen's. Both my brothers did history at St. Stephen's. And they got together when I was finishing at Dune School and said, Dad, you know, Kanti cannot do history, and better for him not to go to St. Stephen's. Too many bachelors went there and kind of wasted their time. So get out of it. And my dad was an ambassador, High Commissioner in Canada. And I went off to do an economics degree. But my heart was not in economics, really. Although I kept, and I thank economics for, you know, instilling me the idea of thinking about things a bit systematically, trying to have a bit of a framework, introduced me to issues like the philosophy of science and things like that, that I think held me in good stead. And I loved mathematics. So the only attraction I had in economics was math, to be honest. But what developed in me through my undergrad days in economics was that I started to do some political science courses. And something along the way in my school life, I began to develop this feeling that Indian democracy, I mean, that it seemed very firm. This is, I mean, I went to Canada in 1973. I began my economics degree in 1973. And of course, it was kind of a high tide still of democracy. It was before the emergency. We were still in a kind of post-Neruvian glow, a Neruvian glow. But I think I had a little bit of a sense that Indian democracy was still quite tenuous. And in one of my courses in my second or third year under a professor called John Wood, who was an Indianist, I read a lot of stuff about civil-military relations. And what came out of that was how many countries in the third world had had military coups, including Pakistan, our neighbor. Here was a military that was born of the same original military, the same genus, the Indian army, but it had intervened in politics in 1958. And by the way, I'd lived in Pakistan in the 60s because my dad was the deputy high commissioner there. And so I had a sense that it may be that Indian democracy was perhaps more tenuous. And I thought initially that India also might succumb to, in a moment of crisis or instability, to a kind of right-wing military coup at some point. And later, I began to worry about the left wing. I thought, I don't know at what point, but gradually perhaps it was the Naxalites of the late 1960s. My brother, Shyam, had been at St. Stephen's College and some of his friends had become Naxalites and so on. And so maybe I knew a little bit about that and I was studying political philosophy alongside economics. And I had a sense that there could be a moment when the right wing and the left wing in India would be thrown into this kind of antagonistic dialectic and the liberal space in India would collapse. And my interest in social science became more political science than economics. And even in economics, the course I loved the most was economic development theory. And quite a lot of my interest there was, what are the political underpinnings of economic growth and development? And I thought, perhaps naively, that democracy and liberalism were made for long-term economic growth. And I was a bit worried that India... I was puzzled why India, as a relatively liberal democratic country, was still, in those days, the so-called Hindu rate of growth. We weren't growing very fast. So I think that led me to grad school in America, where I wanted to do civil military relations. That's why I ended up with Steve Cohen at the University of Illinois, because he was the expert on the Indian Army, on civil military relations in India. And I didn't know it at the time, but he was already more or less finishing a book on the Pakistani military. And I hoped to write a book on comparative civil military relations in South Asia. I thought India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. When I arrived there, he'd already written the book on Pakistan. But what stayed with me there was that, I mean, I was introduced to international relations there. I had come thinking doing comparative politics, civil military relations, doing political theory, because I enjoyed that. And I thought American government and politics, because at that time, it was the city on the hill. It was the world's greatest democracy. And if you were concerned about democracy, then maybe there was something to learn from America. But I started to take some courses in international relations, and I had inspiring professors. And my fellowship was in arms control and security issues, international security. And I saw a kind of nexus, and I'll end with that thought, which is that, would democracy survive in times of intense kind of security turmoil? Whether internal security turmoil, as I suppose happened in Pakistan, leading to the end of democracy there, or other forms of internal turmoil, or in terms of an enormous challenge externally, under which democracy might crumble. So I thought my worry was that, and a connecting thread to my earlier interest in democracy was whether in India, the discourse around security might lead to a point where democracy might be called into question. And I thought the antagonism with Pakistan, particularly in the early 80s when I was there, and overlooking the possibilities of cooperation with Pakistan might someday lead to a situation where democracy might come under stress in India. And so my PhD was on SARC, an unlikely subject, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, because I wanted to look at the prospects of cooperation in the region, and how that might make in all the countries, it might be a part of a kind of democratic spirit that would flower in the region, and undergird and strengthen democracy for the long term. I probably now reading back into it a bit too much, and trying to make myself too clever about it, and maybe too philosophical about it. But there was something like that was brewing in me. And that's how my academic career sort of flowered from there."

        "message": "So you know, when we are young, we are filled with this intellectual excitement whenever we discover a new subject, especially when it comes to answering big questions about the world. So there is this allure of grand theories, right, whether it's in economics or political science or whatever, you know, the first grand theory that you come across that is attractive, and that explains everything in a coherent way. Doesn't matter if the explanations are true or false, because who knows at that time, but that seems to offer a coherent frame of looking at the world, one is tempted to adopt it. And then what happens is that over a period of time, you know, you kind of get mugged by reality, you begin to realize that none of the grand theories are necessarily, you know, the whole answer to anything as a friend of mine likes to say, the quote goes, all models are false, but some models are useful. So what was that intellectual journey on your part, like, in terms of what were the theories that you were drawn towards? What frames did you feel had the greatest explanatory power? And earlier in this conversation, you spoke about how you had certainty about a lot of things in the 80s, where you weren't afraid to express your opinion firmly, but now your view is much more kind of nuanced. So take me a little bit through your personal intellectual development also of looking back at that time and saying that, okay, these are the things that attracted me then that I felt explained the world. And this is how my frame has evolved over time, and so on."

        "message": "You know, I was a bit stupid. I don't think I had a huge, coherent intellectual framework. Partly, I think the way my political science training was, was that it wasn't a high theory school. I think some of the other departments were like that, in you know, the great schools of the East Coast or the West Coast of America. But at Illinois, it wasn't such a high theory school. And I think we dealt more with kind of more meso or micro theories. And a lot of my kind of theoretical predilections were towards issues related to deterrence theory, for instance, which is the idea of how you with nuclear weapons or with conventional military weapons, how can you prevent another country from attacking you? That's a kind of a micro theory. And I delved a lot into the logic of deterrence theory. I knew a lot about civil military relations theory. Why coups happen? Why do military step into power and then fail to relinquish power at some point? For my thesis, I read a lot about regionalism. Why do countries come together, particularly to cooperate at the regional level? I had a whole argument about how we think about regions. I mean, regions are a bit seamless. How is it that we draw a boundary around a region at a particular place, more or less? You know, again, a kind of middle range theory I had, I didn't have a big picture IR view of the world. I mean, your listeners may not be in this area, but there are basically three big paradigms in international relations. Realism, which is a power based understanding of the world. Liberalism, which is that certain institutions and rules and norms out there like international law or diplomatic understandings and negotiations is what makes the world between nation states. And the third is constructivism, which is that we make our world. There's certain kinds of deep values and identities we hold to that we construct periodically, which have great power. And, you know, it's those that affect how we think about other societies and our relationship with them. But, you know, at that time, I wasn't in that game. I was in these middle range theories. In that sense, I was a bit stupid. But in a sense, I was a problem solver. I was attracted to big theory. I read a lot of sociology, literary criticism. I read the French theorists, the Derrida's and the Foucault's and the Roland Barthes and all of that, mostly so that I didn't look stupid. It took quite a long time for that to settle in me to help me make sense of the world better. But I had a kind of problem solving view of theory. It would help me solve certain kinds of intellectual puzzles or concerns and not much more, I think. And so that's where I was. I mean, I looked at problems that interested me, and then I tried to turn to theories that I thought would explain that. Not very big theories, but kind of intermediate theory. So I didn't have a, you know, a very coherent picture. Although deep down, I suppose, and I suppose that's true even now, I was kind of a liberal. I'm a liberal in domestic politics, probably, and I'm a liberal internationally as well. And I suppose there was always a substratum of that. I just didn't quite know it. I didn't quite have the language and the profundity to figure that out, or even the self-reflection. But I think gradually, that's where I ended up. And I think something of what I learned very perfectly through these French theorists, you know, the postmodernists and poststructuralists and deconstructionists and so on, came back to this kind of bifocal worldview, which is, don't make too many big assumptions about there being certainties undergirding your worldviews. There's no language game that produces a stable set of assumptions and arguments for all time. You can't derive an understanding of the world about everything once and for all from some Olympian standpoint, which you hold forever. And so I guess I have a kind of shifting good-humored liberalism, again, a reflex against holding to certainties in a very orthodox position. So I guess my meta-theory is, don't have a firm theoretical base and be wedded to it for all time. So that's my governing theory."

And because I'm thinking aloud, what I say might be somewhat naive, but then it seems to me that one could say that at the extremes, there are two kind of broad ways of figuring the world out. And one is that you have a grand theory and you make everything fit. And the other one is that you have no grand theories, but you get in the nitty gritties of every problem. You solve one problem at a time and eventually whatever intermediate theories, as it were, emerge and whatever grand theories are useful at a particular moment in time to explain something are fine. And it seems to me that you would then have taken the second of these approaches where you are not sort of guided by a particular way of explaining the world, but you're just trying to figure small things out and seeing where they kind of lead you. So, you know, would this kind of be, therefore, an accurate way of summing up the different approaches? And are these different approaches something that exists out of a thought experiment? Are there people you can actually look at? Maybe this ties into the fox and hedgehog sort of description of Isaiah Berlin. Exactly. I was going to say, yeah. Yeah.

But again, the world needs both kinds of people. And I just hate monocultures. And so we need hedgehogs and we need foxes. And sometimes we need to be hedgehogs and sometimes we need to be foxes. So even I wouldn't typify myself totally and forever as a fox. There are times when I've been a hedgehog. I mean, for, for some time in the 1980s, 1990s, particularly, I became a hedgehog. I was obsessed with the issue of India's nuclear weapons and deterrence, and that's all I cared about. And I got very argumentative and bolshie over it. I think I became a bit of a bore and, you know, I bored myself at some point and I think things moved on and quite rightly. And I had to go back to being more of a fox and I'm glad I did. And so, yeah, we need both kinds of people. And broadly, I think Berlin was right. You can, you can divide the world up into hedgehogs and foxes and your own persona. At times you're a hedgehog and times at other times you're a fox. And I think that's fine. I think that's, that's good for the world."

For example, if you're a TV expert, TV experts are supposed to have certainty about the world. So you would imagine a TV expert would be a hedgehog like Harry Truman when he when he was president once said, give me a one handed economist. And obviously, the reason he said that was all his advisors were saying on the one hand this on the other hand that and he wanted a hedgehog that just tell me what to do tell me that this is the way to go. It strikes me that then there is this sort of dual imperative that on the one hand, as an academic, you do want to have intellectual humility, not be tied down to any one idea and be a bit of a fox. But at the same time as an academic, if you want your ideas to be part of the mainstream discourse, then you do want to be a bit of a public intellectual. But being a public intellectual, you'll gain as much visibility as as much as you can be a hedgehog because people crave certainty people don't, you know, crave nuance. So is that something that you've thought about? Or is that something that when you look around you and you see public intellectuals or you followed their journeys as academics to a particular place? Do you see that kind of sort of tussle happening within them?"

And so it's right and proper that there are those who are the hedgehogs and they have a very certain worldview, they express themselves very unambiguously. They tell us how we should proceed. And we need that in times of crises, and so on. And they often lead us in whichever field, including the political field. But as a check and balance, we need foxes. And I think that's important as well. And there are times when I've been a hedgehog, my children would probably say that I was too often at home, but and sometimes I'm impatient with myself. And I think, well, both in academic life, and in public intellectual life, I should have been more of a fox or certainly my television experience forced me towards being a hedgehog. And sometimes my brother who was in television used to say, don't do this. On the one hand, on the other hand, I mean, and I stick to a view, you've got 30 seconds before the anchor interrupts you. And there's no time for that. If you want to make an impact, be blunt. And I think there's place for that. And I tried to do it. But it was never quite me, I think. And I think there are people who read me that way. I did a, you know, an interview with a student of mine, who's now in Australia yesterday. And he said that, you know, a lot of former students of mine, who were never very happy with my political stance in India, thought that I was a dyed in the wool, peacenik, liberal, secularist, and I couldn't listen to anyone else. I don't know. I mean, I must have come across like that. And some part of me is that, that I do hold those values dear. And sometimes I do get on my horse and insist on that. But I think deep down, I'm willing to listen and adjust and think things through and, of course, be persuaded and so on, that I'm not the last word by any means, and I don't know all the answers. So I think that's important. And, you know, I mean, cometh the hour, cometh the man, cometh the hour, cometh the stance. There are some times when you might just have to take a stand and take the risk of holding to, hewing to a point of view and sticking to it. And you probably know that moment when it comes. And I think you have to rely on your instinct and your ratucination at that point to tell you, here, I have to take a stand. There's nothing else. And I can't listen to too much nuance and all of that. I've just got to stand for something. But that can't be a permanent position, it seems to me. So I think I'll just let it wash over me. When I feel I absolutely have to take that stand, I will. Does that mean that I'm the person that you would always call up in a crisis or to sign a petition or to stand shoulder to shoulder on an issue and all of that? Yes, no, maybe, I don't know. That's someone else's judgment. But I think more and more to myself, I'll have to take the risk of making those judgments as and when you know, the moment comes."

Tell me about your interest in China per se like I followed the thread up to your, you know, getting interested in international relations and, you know, beginning with, you know, looking at civil military relations and all of that. And I presume during this phase, you would have studied the 62 war and all of that. When did you really start looking at China closely and start sort of refining your prisms and also this entire period when you've been an academic is a period of almost tectonic change in both China and India in different ways, where just so much has changed. And at the same time, how has a scholarship been changing? How has you know, within the academic world, for example, is it a danger that there are fashions in terms of ways of looking at a particular subject or a subject area? How has that been evolving? When did you start getting into it? How did your thinking on it evolve as the years went by?"

        "message": "Yeah, so you know, you pointed out that in the book in 1962, my dad was a diplomat in in London in the High Commission. And at the time of the war, it was sepulchral at home. It was not that we talked about the war a lot. In fact, it was the opposite. There was just a kind of gloomy silence in cold London during those weeks. And, and so I think, you know, something like all Indians, the war has left a bit of a scar and a vestige in our, in our, you know, memories and hearts. And I think the Chinese don't quite get it. But it's there in most Indians, at least to the elite, middle class type of people. So I suppose it was there in me. And, but my focus, as I was explaining earlier, was really much more India, Pakistan, and South Asia, and the prospects of cooperation and the possibilities of conflict there. So China was not a big thing. Although, in the early 90s, I wrote some stuff on, well, two or three things happened. The first was, somebody asked me to write on confidence building measures, this idea that countries that were locked into conflict could through some forms of communication and transparency, ensure that they didn't get into a scrap militarily, unwittingly, that out of uncertainty and miscommunication, at least you wouldn't fight. And so military talks, better diplomatic contacts, arrangements like that would ensure that it didn't happen unwittingly. So I wrote a piece on that. But again, drifted back to South Asian issues, particularly the nuclear issue. But Abid Hussain, actually, you know, coming back to him, put it in my brain, I think a little bit, that China had to be watched. He was very liberal, but he began to focus on this issue of India's economic reforms, and how India had to get out of Hindu rate of growth and so on. And, you know, this is the period of 1992, 93. The economic reforms had just begun after the crisis. And he was looking at China, and asking the question, how come they've done so well, and India lagged behind. So talking to him and helping him write some speeches and so on. My friend and colleague Varun Saini, who is now Vice Chancellor of Goa University, we were part of his little kitchen cabinet, where we would toss issues around. And he was constantly talking about India's prospects. And we would look sideways at China. And one time we were visited by quite a high level delegation of think tankers and academics from China. And what struck us there was how much more work on India there was in China than there was in India about China. And I remember in the meeting there, in Hindi, Abid just said to me, and he said, they've got so many people who have learned Hindi and Indian languages. You know who can speak Mandarin? And I didn't know the answer quite, but I said, I don't know. I mean, through the various programs, maybe we could get 20-25 people outside of the diplomats who had learned Mandarin in China. And he said, I'll have to fake the figure a bit. Otherwise, it looked very embarrassing. So China was beginning to seep in. And he was always talking about globalization and how China had taken advantage of it, and India had got left behind. And from that, Varun and I both began to think and write a little bit about how India would begin to try and maybe catch up with China. What kind of growth rates would we need? We didn't write a lot about it, but here and there. And I think that thought stayed with me. And I think I wrote some pieces at that time, late 90s, middle 90s, about the gap already with China was beginning to be very significant. And what would be the implications of that? And then I think that went into cold storage. I went back to the nuclear tests and Pakistan and so on and so forth. And then when I finished Doon School, I went to Oxford. Instead of going back to JNU, I had an invitation to come to Singapore, but I chose to go to Oxford at that time. And there, I found that a lot of the kind of excitement was over China and its rise in a way that I hadn't appreciated being at Doon School and dealing with South Asian issues so much. China was in everyone's lips all the time in a way that India certainly was not. And it just struck me then more and more. And then another one of those phone calls came along. I got a call from my old friend Kishore Mebubani, who I had met at Harvard many years earlier at a conference on civilizational conflict, which Sam Huntington had organized. And he wrote the paper on Southeast Asia and civilization issues, and I wrote the paper on India. Anyway, he had asked me earlier whether I had wanted to come and teach at Singapore, at least for a couple of years, when I had chosen Oxford at that time. But he persisted. He said, you know, China is the big issue. Sitting here in Southeast Asia, we can see it even more clearly than you can see it sitting in Oxford. And by the way, this is the place to think about and study China and India-China. And why don't you come here instead? And various things happened, and there's a story there. But at some point, that was part of the reason that I made the move to Singapore. And of course, once I made the move to Singapore, it was China, China, China, but also, very importantly, quite a lot of interest in India in a way that was not true, oddly enough, in Oxford. Those two things came together, and Kishore played a big part in sort of pushing me more in that direction of develop this idea of India-China relations, cooperation, and in the shadow of conflict. And I suppose that's what really then brewed and brewed. And I did various things here to take forward an India-China agenda, which I could talk about if you're interested. But in a way, that led up to the moment when I got that other phone call, which is from Nandini Mehta on behalf of Chicky Sarkar to write this book on India-China relations."

Which is also a provocative title, good titles for books. Do tell me more about the India-China agenda. I'm very curious, like, first of all, to begin with, in Singapore, how different would the gaze on China be? Because it's physically much closer, because I guess there is much greater access to insiders and to Chinese scholars and all of that. And how did your interest develop here? What are the areas you were looking at? This is quite fascinating. So do tell me more."

        "message": "Yeah, sorry. So one part of your earlier question I didn't answer, which was kind of the thought process about how to think about China academically and so on. So I think in certainly when I was at Oxford and earlier, the burden of scholarship was China's peaceful rise, and seemed to be going well. And the idea was how to continue to bring China into kind of a liberal international order. And the prospects seemed quite good through trade, China was joining all these international institutions. And so the narrative was all good. I mean, there was uneasiness here and there and particular episodes where China was a bit more aggressive. But on the whole, there was a sense that, you know, China was rising peacefully and would play a more or less responsible role. But I think that Singapore did partake of that. But Singapore has always had its weather vanes or antenna up and sensitive to other perspectives and possibilities. And I think Singapore certainly wants to ensure that exactly that happens, that China rises peacefully, it's accommodated appropriately, and that it is socialized into this more or less rules-based liberal order. But it's always had a worry that that might not happen, that other countries might provoke China beyond a point, or that things might develop within China that would deflect us from that. So I think that I kind of followed that trajectory, which is, I went from quite a complacent attitude towards where China was in the world. I mean, when I was charting this idea of China's growth and what it implied, it was more, how could India reach those kinds of growth rates and catch up, but not from a very alarmist point of view, you know. And I think that fitted in with this kind of China rise thesis that was prevalent everywhere as well. There were lessons to be learned from China, and then China was to be accommodated in a correct way, not to be appeased, but to be accommodated where appropriate. I think in Singapore, there was already a sense that that might not quite work out, and so one had to give thought to something else. But of course, Singapore itself very much needs and wants and hopes that China will be peaceful and it'll be accommodated in the right way. And it has friendships with the West and friendships with China, and it tries to, you know, reconcile that. So when I came here, I think I began to look a bit more at the arguments for why the rise may not be altogether peaceful. And in the context of India-China, where I'd been a bit more complacent, I began to think that everything may not be necessarily quite so smooth. I mean, I came here in 2010, 2011, and already there were signs that things were sharpening, although the relationship was not where it is today, of course. I think, and a lot of my colleagues look at China issues and there's a lively debate here on relations with China. And one of the things that Singapore deals with is that, of course, geographically, it's much more proximate to China. It's got a population that is 70% of Chinese ethnic origins, 70 plus. So there's another kind of relationship to China that goes beyond just geopolitics. There's an economic relationship to China, which is very vital, as it is for everyone in Southeast Asia. So, you know, I mean, thinking about China here is a very different ballgame. There are many other factors at play here. And what that suggests is that it's not just the China rise story. When you're in a region like Southeast Asia, the connective tissues are ethnic, diasporic, cultural, historical, very profoundly. They are questions of geography and the intimacies that come from that, which even a country, you know, such as India may not quite have because it's got the Himalayas in between. And certainly the Western countries don't have that kind of intimacy. So they look at China in a different kind of way. But this region must factor that in constantly when thinking about China. And they have many deep institutional links over the last 20, 30 years with China through many international institutions, ASEAN, East Asia Summit, APEC, bilateral dialogues, etc., etc., which India, at least until the last 10, 12 years, did not really have and which some Western countries, most of them don't have except for the United States. So I think that, you know, there are many more lenses through which you look at China here in Southeast Asia. And perhaps that's why, you know, my book also has these four different peas or lenses through which I look at India, China, the general ontology, you know, the broad way we think about a subject and its constituent parts. In this part of the world, it's a more pluralistic ontology of looking at China. And I think maybe some of that filtered into my book."

        "message": "So we'll come to your book in a moment. But a final question about this sort of field of India, China studies like it strikes me and I'm thinking aloud and you can tell me to what extent this would be true. One, a lot of policy of countries is shaped by elites in some way or the other. I mean, obviously, you know, politicians have incentives where they've, you know, where more and more they have to be populist and they have to think about what the people feel and popular sentiment and all of that. But a significant amount of it is shaped by elites in most countries. That's number one. Number two, my premise would be that, therefore, academics like yourself and academics in all the places where you've taught and worked have some kind of influence. It's limited, but they have some kind of influence that they will often consult for governments, they'll have, you know, entry points to talk to babus and sometimes some politicians and all of that is there. And the third thing that I'm then struck by is that whatever the extent of this elite shaping of public policy might be in say countries like the USA, which has a rich tradition of think tanks and parties feeding into the think tanks, and to a smaller extent in India, what is that extent in China? Because China from the outside at least seems to be an incredibly opaque system, where you know, the people in charge are not as accountable to the people as in these democracies. Though as Manoj Kevalramani enlightened me in a previous episode that they do really care about what the people think, and they're always trying to shape those narratives, but not in the same way as in India, where there are elections all the time and so on. So how much of an influence are thinkers and academics like yourself in even more of an ivory tower when it comes to the context of policy within China, than they would be in the US and India. And this seems kind of rambley again, I'm kind of thinking aloud. So excuse me if any of these are just, you know, wrong assumptions."

        "message": "No, I think you've got a lot that's spot on there. I mean, I mean, first of all, academics, you know, I think we ourselves undermine our influence. But after all, we're the people who educated the people who run the country. We're the people who educate most of the elite, because they all go to colleges and universities. All the journalists who shape opinion, and the broadcasters all went through our hands, all the businessmen went through our hands. So I sometimes I'm very puzzled by this notion that academics are Lotus eaters, thumbsuckers out there somewhere in some ivory tower, you know, and that's all, they're kind of useless people who that we sort of tolerate them, they have a profound impact on how we think about issues, because they train people, and then those people go out and shape the world every day, and shape wider opinion. So it seems to me, on that point, academics everywhere, including in China, I mean, who in China has not been educated by an academic and the university structure there. So they're all products of that. And to that extent, I mean, their influence, the influence of academics is profound, lasting, and subtle. So I don't think we should ever undermine that kind of thought that they're important. I think in China, it would be a mistake to think that academics, public intellectuals, even journalists, and so on, social media, you know, that it doesn't have an impact. It very much does. I mean, this is my instinct. I am not a China specialist, per se. I haven't lived there. I visited several times, of course, I talked to Chinese colleagues, and you just get a sort of a sense of it, you know, reading their press and opinions and things like that. And then I teach Chinese students, we have a good number of Chinese students in my classes, and so on. I mean, it would be astonishing if Chinese people were not influenced by their academics, their media, their social media. I mean, they would be the most amazing people on earth if they were more or less impervious to it, no matter how much the government tries to control it. Indeed, their elites, the Communist Party, their rulers would be amazing people, like gods. And we know that even gods are influenced by human beings. So, you know, I mean, I'll just begin with the presumption that they lend an ear, they're influenced by, they can't separate themselves from the people and their thoughts. And I think they made it very clear over time that they are affected by those pressures and imperatives and, you know, what ordinary Chinese people may be saying. And we know that at the micro level in government in China, local protests, the interaction with local people, with the Communist Party and administration, I mean, they have an impact. And the Chinese Communist Party is extremely sensitive to what people out there think. I mean, they may not show it, they're not going to declare it, but they are extremely sensitive. And my instinct is that, particularly in India, this government is very, very attentive to how the Chinese Communist Party, as a party, has sent its influence and its kind of administrative tentacles to the smallest, most remote part of China. And those tentacles, tentacles may not be quite the right word, those arteries, I mean, they take ideas arterially out there, and a certain number of ideas and perceptions come back up through the arteries. And I think this government in India, particularly the BJP and its various affiliates, are quite intrigued by how well, in fact, there is this movement of ideas and thoughts from the party down to the micro level and back from the micro level in a constructive way to the to the party. And I think there's something there. It would be amazing again, if the Chinese Communist Party could, you know, just sit up there on these Olympian Heights, sending out famans and diktats and so on, and not bother to listen to anything that's out there. And that's not the history of Chinese political thought either. I think that there's much more going on at those levels, and the Chinese Communist Party is very attentive to it. And one of the difficulties, probably in respect of India-China relations and dealing with, let's say, the border issue, is that today you don't have a magisterial personality like Mao, or a super magisterial personality like Mao, or even Deng Xiaoping, who could swing a deal where China makes some significant concessions on the border with India in the way that they could have. I mean, Xi Jinping, he is magisterial in some ways. And, you know, we hear every day about how he's taken control and he's president or general secretary for life and all that kind of stuff. But I wonder, he's not Deng Xiaoping and he's not Mao. And he would, in a moment, if you could get him to really talk to you personally on the Amit Verma show like this, I think he would confess that he could not swing a deal necessarily as his predecessors, two or three of his predecessors could have. So I think there is an elite there. They can have an impact. And, you know, the thing about the elite is they're like the middle class. They connect upwards, sending ideas and feelings and perceptions up to the rulership. And they communicate downwards from the rulership to people below the elite, the masses, so-called ordinary folks. They're a vital element of a society just like the middle classes. So they both shape and are shaped by ideas. And I have no doubt that the elite there is a very powerful force."

        "message": "That's a very interesting point about Xi and, you know, Modi not being able to sell concessions to their people because, you know, in your book, you've mentioned Nehru and Mao and what magisterial personalities they are. But even there you point out that in circa 57, 58 or something like that, Nehru tried to push through his cabinet the proposal that the Chinese be allowed open access to Aksai Chin so that they could get in and out of Tibet easily. And this cabinet didn't let it go through. So eventually they allowed that access only for civilian purposes. And that kind of remains a problem even now. So even back then when these leaders were so strong and had the aura that they had, that there was a limit to how much they could get through. And this seems a good time to kind of ask that meta question about, you know, the constraint that politics holds upon actually having meaningful action forward like you talk about elite influence. Now, China, obviously, everything you said is very illuminating for me, because I don't know anything about China. But looking at India, I'm not sure it's true, because none of the political class have actually been educated by academics, despite, you know, Supreme Leader having a degree in entire political science. And if there's any university whose ideas they have imbibed, it's really WhatsApp University. And I'm kind of being flippant here. But it is also kind of true that when you look at the underpinnings of the things that drive these guys, I don't see any of that influence. For example, just today, and we are recording this on, let me check the date on my computer, I'm so bad. It's July 9. And just today, Meenakshi Lekhi, who's the new Minister of State for External Affairs, has said, quote, some have expertise in making the virus, some in making vaccines. Now, this is a very jingoistic and incendiary thing to say and totally not on for an external affairs minister, for God's sake, this is not how we want to talk. And as you pointed out in the book, a lot of the Chinese attitudes towards us are shaped by what they see in our media and how they interpret it. And when they see a minister talking like this, that some make the virus, some make the vaccine, it's just completely out of line. But this seems to me to be shaped by a certain kind of jingoistic nationalistic rhetoric, which is popular on WhatsApp, devoid of reality, something that no academic would support. And more and more, you get the sense that our politicians can kind of drive themselves into a corner. Now, it is okay that we have a skirmish with Pakistan. And you know, our leaders can sell the narrative that we did a surgical strike where they basically bomb a few rocks. But when it comes to China, it's a whole different ballgame. This kind of posturing can be extremely counterproductive, and just takes us into the wrong direction. And then it becomes like a vicious circle. So one, what would be your response to my counterpoint that, you know, even if there is some academic influence on the way say bureaucrats may think, it's not there in politics. And this force of domestic politics, this force of populism, and this particular kind of nationalism makes a lot of other things that we might talk about, Moot."

So, I mean, I guess I'm giving you a fairly prosaic answer, which is a literalist answer that, you know, you went through school and college, and so you picked up a vocabulary, which then allows you to make certain kinds of assertions and arguments, even on WhatsApp and in political life, which otherwise you couldn't possibly make. But yeah, I mean, I suppose my sense is that it's true that a little learning is worse than none. But on the whole, I would bet on education, university education in particular, still bringing us to a place of some moderation and thoughtfulness and progressiveness. And I wouldn't want a world where that possibility didn't exist. So it may be that leaders and elites, or particularly political leaders, are not as well schooled or as well educated as we academics would like, and they ignore their own training or the best thoughts that we try to communicate to them and instill in them. But that's the world, you know, and we as academics ourselves in our personal or micro social existences don't always live by the thoughts that we espouse. So I'm a bit more forgiving of politicians that way. Take nationalism, I mean, what else is nationalism, but, you know, a set of ideas that probably almost certainly were put together by sort of academics themselves, first of all, given the kind of modern shape that we today recognize as nationalism. If you trace the origins of nationalism to things like the development of national languages, I mean, Benedict Anderson, the famous historian, late historian, in his book, Imagined Communities, talks about, you know, the role of the kind of nationalization of a language, which is the dialects and so on were reduced and squeezed out. And mass education began to teach a standardized script and grammar and language. And that's such a powerful kind of vehicle for nationalism. It wasn't the only one. The book is much more interesting than that. But he does show that as other theorists and nationalists. And, you know, that was philologists and grammarians, who we would call academics, who did that. So, Ernest Renard, the historian, said that, you know, nationalism becomes possible through forgetting. And historians are also part of this forgetting. We band together as a people by forgetting some of the terrible things our co-nationalists once did to us back in the day. And I think historians play a role in that. They help us contextualize something that happened back in the day. We forget some of the hurt and anger that our forebears may have had, because we see what happened in some context, which is kind of a forgetting. We forget some part of the anger and the resentment we feel because of this larger context within which certain decisions and episodes occurred. And sometimes historians tell us that certain episodes that we think were central forget about them, because actually that wasn't the biggest thing at that time. So, yeah, I think historians have had a very big role in fostering this nationalism as well. I know we have historians in India. I mean, I'm not part of Indian historiography and its study, but very national historians, both of the right-wing and of the more liberal left-wing kind, who very much how we see nationalism today came out of their writings. So, again, I would say, you know, whether politicians understand it or not, they are mouthing the lines that academics have taught. And, you know, I mean, I guess it brings me to the larger point, which is that academics have an enormous responsibility. We can't keep criticizing politicians and lampooning them and caricaturing them, because we have helped make those leaders. It's our ideas that are being used out there, misused by politicians and other influencers. And we do have to be careful, I think. And perhaps the best thing we can always do is insist that, you know, well, if not a hundred flowers bloom, but a multiplicity of flowers are considered. And in our pedagogy and in our classrooms, at least convey that spirit of, even if you don't agree with something altogether, try and live that spirit of weighing up things and telling the other story and all of that. So, I certainly wouldn't exculpate academics from the things that are going wrong."

        "message": "Yeah, I mean, I have a couple of thoughts here. And one is about, you spoke about, you know, the importance of history and memory. And at an individual level, you know, one of my big learnings about memory, which I remember discussing also with Anshul Malhotra in an episode I did with her, she's written this lovely book on partition of people remembering through objects they've carried. And it's a big TIL learning about a memory for me, because how memory apparently works is that when we remember an event, the first time we remember an event, we remember the event. But the next time we remember it, we remember the remembering of the event, and so on in a case of Chinese whispers in our brain, which is why, you know, two people who shared the same experience can 10 years later remember it completely differently, because each remembering it has altered a bit because of so many other factors. And that seems to me to be the case, in a sense with a collective memory, also historical grievances that a lot of the grievances that we have that the Mughals did this, or so and so did this, or so and so did that, you know, I don't even see why they should be relevant to us in the modern day. But we have these simplistic history, which then create these simplistic sort of grievances, which feed into the things that we do today. And the other aspect of it is the aspect of where academics are important in sort of keeping the those dialogues and you know, that nuance alive, like you mentioned nationalism. Now, in the last episode I recorded with Pranay Kotasane, which is coming out after we are recording this, so it's not out yet. He spoke about how one of his favorite books is the Gandhi Tagore debates. And you have mentioned in your book, and I'll quote those lines where you write about how Gandhi and Tagore and one matter on which they agreed, viewed nationalism, where you have written, quote, especially for Tagore and Gandhi, nationalism is both emancipatory from colonial rule and oppressive. It encourages individuals to sacrifice their creativity and moral sense for the collective and to make excuses for social violence. States built on nationalism are inevitable, but for both Tagore and Gandhi, individual self-restraint and moral behavior are the key to peace and order. If you all respected certain norms of behavior towards each other, irrespective of nationality, governments and states would become largely irrelevant, stop quote. And it's a sort of a broad sort of view of nationalism, which encompasses more than, you know, our current narrow divisive visions of it. Let's come to the book, because otherwise, your publisher Chiki will get extremely upset if you don't discuss a book at all. So let's actually talk about this framework, which I found so fascinating, the four P's. So tell me a bit about the four P's. And how did you arrive at the framework? Did it happen over a period of years? Or did you start thinking about this book? And then, as you started making your notes, this came to you, how did it happen? And then, you know, we can begin with the first of the P's maybe."

        "message": "Well, it happened with a fifth P, which is panic. I guess in conversation with Jagannath, set myself such a big list of things I was saying earlier, you know, river water issues with China, trade issues with China, our influence in third regions with China, Pakistan, another P. And the list was just getting bigger and bigger. And I was getting more and more panicky, because on some topics, I thought, oh, my gosh, if I have to cover all of these, first of all, the length of the book, how will I accommodate them? But secondly, I'll either write some pablum, another P, something so boring that, you know, everyone knows already, or, you know, I would have enough to say. And some chapters will be humongous, like the perimeters chapter, which is about the border into where, and in others, I'll be muttering something for about four or five pages, and then I'll be done. And it'll look very odd, the book will be imbalanced, you know. So out of that panic about, oh, my God, the time was ticking. So I think about three or four weeks into the book, I began with what I knew already, the perimeter, the border issue, that's where I started. So I thought that would be chapter one, turned out to be chapter two, eventually. And I thought the power chapter had to be done, obviously, weighing up the relative power of the two. So those two were very clear. So I started in the Steve Cohen mode, just start writing, don't think about it too much, start getting stuff on paper. So I started that way. And then I had fingers crossed that other things would fall by the wayside or fall into place as I went along. And I guess, in a way, that's what happened. Out of that panic and beginning with what I knew, slowly it dawned on me that the length of these chapters, I was already getting to the halfway point of the book, it didn't lend itself to too many more chapters. So I had to start to squeeze down. And then I began to sort of just play it backwards from what I knew to what I would declare to be a virtue, which is, you know, what did I know best? And what could I write about that would be most interesting to me and possibly to a reader, to what ought to be properly in the book, rather than some grand scheme. And I just thought, yeah, something about the perceptions of the two societies towards each other. And because Juggernaut had said, you're trying to infuse a bit of your own personal experiences into it, I thought that's where the perceptions would come in. My trips there, sometimes a conversation with some Chinese people or students or some visitors from China, I could resurrect some of those episodes. So I thought a perceptions chapter would get Juggernaut off my back there, where they would say, oh, my God, don't just narrate all this thirdhand, but give us your firsthand experience of some stuff. So that started to form itself as that chapter. And then, obviously, there's a geopolitical context in which India, China interact. And that was the partnerships chapter, the fourth P. And actually for myself, I think that's the least successful chapter of the book. I mean, that's the one that ought to be my bread and butter, India, China, Russia, Soviet Union, USA. But I don't know, I found it the most difficult to write. And I think it's the least successful. I don't know, I almost think if I had it over, I would chuck it out. But you know, I think"

Of course, the perimeter chapter is the longest. But I guess one needs to go into that kind of detail, because they are the kind of concrete details that animate the relationship that we've had. Yeah. So for me, I, you know, you've almost framed your explanation of the book as if it is something you know, you're responding to this from the publisher, that from the publisher, I will just assure my listeners that it doesn't read like that at all.

        "message": "Yeah, so I think the one way of saving that account that I just gave you this rather disjointed as it actually happens, existential account is to maybe draw an analogy to personal life, you know, why these four. So if you do that, I mean, the first thing you can say is that how we relate to another person is refracted or, or affected by how we perceive each other. So we have some perceptions of each other that grow and chop and change and form themselves. And we can't even quite account for why we may think about people in certain ways. But that has a very powerful framing effect. So I think that's one justification for putting the perceptions chapter in there and putting it up front, a more kind of conceptual way of talking about these four P's. Although, I mean, drawing this analogy to individuals is not a very good way to think about social affairs. But it's one way of kind of just, you know, giving it some respectability, I think, and communicating to your listeners about why these four are important. The second piece is perimeters. So the analogy there in our personal lives is, of course, you know, to my neighbor, to others, you've got to respect my property, which is territory in geopolitics or international affairs, but my home and hearth, my belongings. I mean, if you try to steal them, if you try to break them, if you violate them, we've got a fight on our hands here. And I will defend them to the death, presumably. So, of course, perimeters matters because our property matters in personal life, and we will fight for those. The third P is partnership. So that's friendships. My friends' friends are my friends. My enemies' friends may be my enemies. My enemies' enemies may be my friends. That's true in personal life, I think. You know, at least it's the first clue or gesture. If my friend introduces me to their friend, the chances are I'm going to be congenial towards them. If my enemy introduces me to their friend, I might look sideways and suspiciously at that third person, et cetera. So I think, again, partnerships are important and undergird that, you know, they come from that sense that our larger network of sort of connections has a role in whether we are friends with someone else or not. And we learn from third parties. If we're friends with X, and they say Y is a bad person, and Y is my neighbor, then I might suddenly start to look at Y in a jaundiced way, because X who has had some other experience of Y that he or she narrates to me, and so on. And the fourth is power. So, of course, all our individual relationships are mediated by power at some level, some more than others. And again, the relationship between countries turns on relative power as well. So, I mean, I would say that that's four more formal arguments, if you'd accept the analogy to individuals and their relationships, that made me think that I was on a bit more solid ground. I wrote it not that way, a bit more conceptually. And then my publisher said, this will bore everyone to tears. Chuck it out. And I did. And I think they were right. And that's why I dismissed other P's and other aspects of the relationship, such as water, such as Pakistan, such as influence in third regions, and trade, and so on. And I said, those are more effect than cause. So they become problems between India and Pakistan because of some fundamental conflict. It's not that they are the cause of the conflict. I don't think Pakistan caused the India-Pakistan conflict. It's that the China-India conflict caused Beijing to reach out to Pakistan, and that drew Pakistan into the India-China conflict more and more. So I think sometimes we are mixing up cause and effect. And of course, at some point, effect becomes cause in a further loop. So I don't deny that sometimes what Pakistan does with China then affects India-China relations. But to give the book a succinctness and a direction, I decided to go with these four P's and just make it more readable for the ordinary reader."

        "message": "No, the four P's, to my mind, do strike me as sort of a foundational frame to look at the relationship, as you correctly pointed out, Pakistan, whatever is happening, there is more effect than cause. And I love this quote from your book where you quote the former Prime Minister Yusuf Jilani, talking about Pakistan's relationship with China. And he describes it as quote, higher than mountains, deeper than the ocean, stronger than steel and sweeter than honey, stop quote, which is incredibly romantic. Let's move on to the first of the P's now. Your first chapter is called perceptions from regard to disdain. And that does indeed seem to be the movement. It's a bit more nuanced and that of course, it wasn't always regard and it isn't necessarily just disdain now. But you know, as you point out, for about 15 years out of the 70, we had great relationships, especially in the early 50s, mid 50s, Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai and Nehru overflowing with goodwill, almost like Mr. Jilani towards China. And then it gradually began to go downhill. But you kind of go a little deeper into history, into the past, into the kind of interactions we've had through the centuries, which also I found very interesting because, you know, growing up what I've been taught in school or what is there in the popular literature, we know enough about India's troubled history with those who colonised us and our history with, you know, those who invaded us or those who visited and so on. But China is just kind of mentioned in footnotes, you know, even though they are our immediate neighbour, like we'll, you know, know of Hunsang and Fahain and all that, which we read in our school books with a different spelling than the ones you've used, which I assume are more authentic, if we don't know much more about them. But actually, the truth is that India, China have had in terms of people to people contacts, pretty deep relationships for centuries. So can you, you know, briefly give me a sense of sort of this historical journey of the contacts we have and how they shaped our perceptions of each other."

        "message": "So I think the story really begins with Buddhism. I mean, I'm sure there was contact before then, but I think most people begin the story there. And so did I, I mean, I'm not a historian of India, China, but just picking up the synthetic material that's out there and rendering it for readers. So you begin with Buddhism, which actually probably almost certainly went from Central Asia to China first, not from India, as I think we sometimes think. And so it was indirectly from India, but not directly. The Indian influence comes later, when particularly I think Chinese pilgrims and monks and so on came to India to receive wisdom and to pick up texts and practices and take them back to China. And then some Indian monks and Buddhists went there to help translate and communicate and so on. So, I mean, from that time forwards to roughly, I would say the 10th century, very broadly, crudely, you could say that China had regard for India. And even there, as I try to show, China did have a sense of its own kind of importance. And there were certainly segments in China, the elite people around the court, who at various times reacted quite negatively to Buddhism. And in effect, you know, they were able to accept Buddhism by synthesizing it. I mean, so they weren't negative towards India necessarily, but they wanted to synthesize it. And there were elements that claimed, you know, that Buddhism was actually a Chinese religion originally, the Buddha was Chinese, etc, etc, that it was actually, you know, synonymous with Daoism and things like that. I think, nonetheless, the broad story is that until about the 10th century or so, China had a regard for India through Buddhism. There was trade, there was other stuff going on, particularly in Buddhist relics and things like that, and in Chinese goods coming to India. But it was born out of Buddhism and the learning associated with it and practices. But at about that time, which is about 1000 of the Christian era, Buddhism was more or less ending in India. And, you know, Brahmanism or whatever you want to call it, made a pushback. And in a sense, I mean, I think this is what came out of one of the seminars I was in after the book, Buddhism became naturalized as a kind of part of Hinduism. So it didn't die in the sense that it was completely vanquished and obliterated. It just became a part of the pantheon of Hinduism. You know, so you have Buddhism as another god in the Hindu pantheon. And so, but as a result of that, I think the Chinese pilgrimages to India, and the looking up to India kind of began to die. If China began to export Buddhism to parts of East Asia, and even parts of Southeast Asia, and perhaps look for Buddhist interactions and influences elsewhere, and develop their own Buddhist thought. And by the 15th century, I would say, and somewhat earlier, the tables were turned, as it were, and in the parts of India, began to look up to China, to the Chinese court, the Chinese imperial domains, and parts of Malabar, southern India, where there was a lot of trade, and where the great Chinese admiral, Cheng He, visited. And before that, you know, the great Khan, I mean, there were kingdoms in Bengal, that also were sending tribute to China. So, you know, I think the relationship was somewhat reversed. There are parts of India that began to look up to China, and perhaps even to some extent fear China. And there was some interference by the Cheng He's and so on in Indian affairs. And even going back to Harshvardhan's time in northern India, there was a kind of Chinese military expedition that was sent to India, to take some amount of revenge and sort out some of the affairs of some, you know, at the time of Harshvardhan and so on, when some Chinese envoys had been humiliated and killed. So, you know, there was a kind of fear and respect for China at that point. Then there's a hiatus in a way, I mean, there was trade increasingly, there was contacts between Indians and Chinese in third regions, Southeast Asia elsewhere. But colonialism, Western colonialism arrived. And I think increasingly, the relationship was mediated through the Portuguese, the Dutch, and increasingly by the British. The opium trade began with between India and China. And out of that, and increasing colonial influence in China, the century of humiliation and all of that, the Chinese looked at India with two kind of jaundiced eyes. The first was, you know, they looked at Indians in China, the policemen, the Indian troops that were being used by the British, some elements of Indian traders in China, of course, the opium trade, which clearly had a very bad effect amongst a segment of Chinese people. You know, so that led them to a kind of negative perception of India and Indian society. And associated with that was the question amongst a group of Chinese reformists, who were Republicans, mostly, and were trying to reform China. And the question they asked was, and this is what I recount, you know, how come this great civilization west of China, we think of China as a northern country, but they think of us as being in their west. How had this great civilization fallen on hard times? Why did it fall to the British? And this was asked at a time when China was going under. So, you know, they wanted to figure out how such a big landmass, huge population, vibrant civilization had fallen to a handful of imperialists and remained under their jackboot. So, the answer they came up with was, in a way, a pretty familiar one, one that we tell ourselves in India. They didn't fight hard enough, the Indians. They were disunited. They had been driven by and developed a psychology of being disunited by waves of invasion. They were not able to mount a, you know, a united kind of response to invaders. That different groups played out their animosities through these invaders, including the British, and they wanted to settle scores with other Indians rather than keep the foreigners out, et cetera, et cetera. And one abiding image was India was a country of many castes and religions and hopelessly pluralistic and divided, and they were a kind of Luan people. Luan means sort of chaotic. There was no center there, and this society was therefore hopeless and could not mount an effective response. And China, there were signs that China could become that, and it should never become India. So, they drew a negative lesson from India that China should not become that, and that's not a very pretty picture of India. So, by the late 19th century, their view of India was rather negative for all these reasons. And then fast forward, of course, you know, to the Nehruvian period and Mao and the Communist Party come to power. I think there were elements of that that still hung around. I mean, you're right that there was also an appreciation of India even now. Mao continued to famously say apparently that, you know, if a Chinese person was ever born again, they should be born Indian. It's some sort of quite well-known statement amongst the Chinese. So, there was a kind of regard, and of course, the admirers of Tagore and so on that I mentioned in the book had an admiration of India, and I don't want to deny all that. But I would say on the whole, you know, by the Nehruvian period and beyond, there began to be a kind of looking down the nose at India. And to tell the Indian side of the story, I mean, I guess it developed also, although I don't do enough of that in the book, I just didn't have time and I don't have enough access to it, but also perhaps both a regard for China that was there, but also in the modern period, a kind of negative view of China, partly racist that we learned through the British and the Westerners. They were yellow people with strange ways and, you know, consumed by drugs like opium and so on and so forth, more arrogant and warlike, again, learned from the West, you know, so I think mutual disdain was the story and elements of that remain the case."

        "message": "So a few asides from this historical journey, like one part I found fascinating was where you write about how when Buddhism first came to China, it wasn't entirely smooth, there was a little bit of friction and its acceptance and many people fought back because they said, you know, Taoism and Confucianism, they are our natural distinct, but then as Buddhism declined in India itself, they kind of appropriated it and it just became like a third prong. And it's interesting that, you know, what you just mentioned here, I don't remember reading it in the book that they tried to paint Buddhism as a religion that originated in China. We've kind of seen a similar thing in India where, for example, the wacky quote unquote historian P.N. Oak, he would write about how Christianity originated in India and Jesus Christ was Indian and Christianity was originally called Krishna Niti. And this is the same guy who, by the way, said the Taj Mahal was originally Tejo Mahalaya. So I don't know, you know, whether this is whether these ancient civilizations have this kind of inferiority complex that they need to make up these kind of stories to sort of make themselves feel better about the influences coming in. And speaking of influences coming in, there's also a nice section on trade where you talk about the opium trade and you point out that we would give them opium and in return, one of the products that we would take is white sugar, which we therefore call Chini, you know, Chini because Chini is fairly obvious. So all you Indian nationalists listening to this who feel glad that TikTok has been banned kindly stop eating Chini also, which is actually good for the health. I mean, if you stop eating it, that'll be good for the health. So that's one way that xenophobia may actually work for you. Now, the other interesting thing that strikes me with this disdain is and that, you know, you point out about how in the late 19th century, they lose the war to Japan. And you write about how young reformers in China are now saying that, listen, we need to be more like Japan, Russia and Germany. And the country whose fate we need to avoid is India. And as you point out, an implication that the yellow races are as talented as the white but not the case with other races. And you quote from this very interesting article, I think it's a 1906 article, a series of articles, which is called the causes for the demise of India. And in that article, the author writes, quote, the word India is in fact nothing but a name from history. Ah, yeah, their land is all smashed to pieces. This brown race will be forever enslaved. Looking at China today, it is like India in the past. As a matter of principle, it was the Indians who brought about the demise of India. The character of the race is chaotic, their language is topsy turvy, their religions all separate from each other. There is no unified spirit, no patriotic thinking, the elites are drowning themselves in song and dance and know nothing of great purpose. Alas, India is lost, stop quote. And later you point out sort of a similar tendency when Tagore visits in 1924. And there are small groups of people who welcome him and give him the respect he deserves. But you also point out, quote, he was roundly denounced and ridiculed, particularly by leftist communist revolutionaries old and young, including former admirers and translators. He was seen as extolling traditional feudal Asia and romanticizing the Orient against the material industrial Occident, stop quote. And later you quote Ram Guha, quoting the Chinese scholar Wu Qin Hui, and forgive me if I get the pronunciation wrong, where Wu Qin Hui says of Tagore, quote, Mr. Tagore, a petrified fossil of India's national past, had retreated into the tearful eyes and dripping noses of the slave people as a conquered country, seeking happiness in a future life, squeaking like the hub of a wagon wheel that needs oil, stop quote, all of which lovely little snippets. Now, my kind of question here is, and we've also obviously at different times had sort of xenophobic views of them. You talk about how a lot of Chinese came to Calcutta, settled there, especially in the Babazar area, the sort of frictions that would often be there. But the other thing that I wonder about is, how much are contemporary frictions or contemporary impressions shaped by things that happened in this distant past? Like do these sort of narratives that are there in the popular culture, actually carry on as a kind of oral history from father to child and so on all the way down so that one generation will, in some way without knowing it by osmosis replicate the attitude of like five generations ago? Or do some narratives just naturally get lost to history? And it is the imperatives of a future time that they are perhaps revived in some way?"

        "message": "Yeah, I think that, you know, you're right to shine the light on this issue of whether these negative views and disdain and so on, going back to the 19th century, still really alive and kicking in China. And likewise, whether elements of racism and so on, on our side too, and negative pictures of China persist from, you know, long ago, or even whether the regard remains on both sides and still affects us. I mean, I suppose I think they do. I mean, that's the whole premise of the chapter in a way, is that the something of that as a vestige, at least remains, some sort of collective consciousness is handed down from one generation to another. And they, they can be in very seemingly innocent, popular remarks and things, you know, Indian people are like this, or Chinese people are like that. So there are these tropes that are out there even now, you know, and I mean, very good natured Chinese have said, Oh, you Indians are also talkative and argumentative, to pick up Sen's word about Indians. That's there from somewhere. It may not necessarily be from, you know, received from or mediated through British influences. After all, they had their own popular kind of encounters with Indians who were in China. And likewise, I mean, Indians who had some contact with the Chinese here and there, might very well have kind of concluded that the elements of Chinese culture that seem strange and not so nice I mean, an extreme materialism is, I can't think, I suppose, a particular kind of trope or image that a lot of people have towards China. And I think there's an associated in India with a view that they're somehow very violent people, and can be very cruel or, you know, despotic. And I don't know quite where that comes from. But maybe it came from Indians who were also involved in the trade in China, might have run into troubles there, or soldiers that served there, and brought back some stories. We know now from a recent diary, of course, a different view. I forget the name of the diary that has been written by this Indian sepoy, which has now been translated and made available, which shows that actually there was a very great regard for his Chinese hosts, that he admired the ordinary Chinese people and their struggles against colonials. But yeah, I mean, I think overall, there's probably some basis for, you know, the kind of pictures we still have of each other. And just like in personal psychology, I mean, you may be early in your life, you receive certain kinds of cliches and prejudices from your parents and those around you. But your own experience gradually as an adult, gives you some more. And I suppose, in the life of a nation, that's true, too. So the 62 war, the terrible problems of the border, the sense of mutual betrayal on Tibet, you know, those kinds of things, in turn, has only amplified some original kinds of bad feelings on both sides over time. So I, you know, the reason that chapter is there first is because I wanted to show that over time, we do have evidence of these kinds of, at least ambivalences on both sides. And, you know, one section of the book in the modern period, I worked through three books, Vikram Seth's book of his travels through China, you know, it's Chinese views of India through Indian eyes. So Vikram Seth looking at interacting with Chinese people on his bus journey and all of that, and giving us a sense of how the Chinese look at India. And then this lady in Singapore, who I met Anurag Vishwanath, who over many years did research there, how she encountered Chinese people in China, and sometimes how they looked at India. And then lastly, Reshma Patil, the Hindustan Times correspondent in Beijing, and this very nice book she wrote, also recounting many stories of how the Chinese people looked at India. So I use that section to show how even now, I mean, from Vikram Seth's journey was in the early 80s or late 70s, through Anurag Vishwanath's journeys, which are through over many years up to a contemporary period, and then Reshma's just seven, eight years ago. But there is a thread there of negative views of India, but also some approbatory or positive views of India. So this ambivalence, at least, is quite deeply there, you know, and I don't have so much data on the Indian side, though I tell a few stories there. But I'm sure that there's a research project waiting to be done there, of mining Indian perceptions of China, even in the modern period after the 62 war, in novels or, you know, commentary, and stories of individual kind of encounters with Chinese people that we could put together. My guess is that both sides are at fault there, if that's the word. There are bad perceptions and some good perceptions on both sides."

        "message": "Yeah, and they come through in these books you mentioned, like in Vikram Seth's book, From Heaven Lake, he writes about how he needed to get a permit to visit Tibet. And one thing that enabled that was he discussed Awara with the Chinese official who was supposed to give him the permit because they were big fans of Bollywood. And similarly, in counter view to that is in Reshma's book, she writes about how, you know, she sort of asked the Chinese broadcasting executive she meets about his views of India. And there are these two really pithy lines which say so much, quote, children in India are naked, they piss on the streets, stop quote, which is such a succinct way of just, you know, putting the impression of a country. And then apparently he added, but all Indians have inner peace, which is like a kind of a backhanded compliment. So I love these. And of course, you know, these three books contain kind of, I guess, impressionistic accounts. And you've presented a lot more systematic data on Chinese perceptions of India. There's Simon Shen's 2011 survey, there's a survey Shen did with Debashish Roy Choudhury, where you wrote about their survey. At a broad level, they found that the Indian media's coverage of military affairs is marked by shrill jingoism and distrust, reflecting the paranoia at the heart of India's elite perceptions. The Chinese media is more sober because it is under the watchful eye of the government. But it has increased its coverage of India and feeds off what it reads in the Indian media to produce its own brand of self-righteous anxieties, stop quote. And this kind of worried me because then you feel that this might be a vicious circle forming itself where, you know, the jingoism on each side is leading to increased reactive jingoism from the other side. The other fascinating part of this chapter, and there's much within this chapter alone that is fascinating, leave alone the rest of the book, is when you talk about the three Indian worldviews and the three Chinese worldviews. So would you like to briefly go through them? Because, you know, one of the conclusions that you later come to, and it struck me, is that out of all these six worldviews, the three Indian and the three Chinese, there is only one which, you know, can actually work for a positive future for all of us. And that is the least likely to happen. So just take us through these worldviews."

        "message": "Yeah. So beginning with the Chinese, let's just begin there. I mean, I said they have three. I mean, obviously, there are probably more, but these are three big ones. The first is this idea of Tianxia, all under heaven, which is really the kind of view of China at the heart of the world and certainly of Asia. And mostly we know it as the tributary system. China sits in the middle, and there are all these smaller powers around it historically, and they send tribute to China. The tributary system had then China give something back, and generally it's accepted that the Chinese emperor gave back more than he received in the form of legitimacy to these smaller countries, sometimes interfering in their affairs to, you know, prop up rulers who wanted his help, and of course, mostly opening up Chinese markets to their exports. But this Tianxia system, if we go from that, then where is India in that worldview? India is another potential tributary, basically. And now, having said that, obviously, if you were Chinese looking at these tributaries around China, India is the biggest tributary by far. So, I mean, the Chinese are not foolish. Certainly India, and this is a thought experiment. I mean, I have to ask Chinese people this, but proceeding from this Tianxia view, India would be the biggest of the tributaries, and therefore it had to be given a certain kind of special position amongst the tributaries. It would be grander and deserving of a more respect and autonomy. But certainly, all tributaries were in a subordinate position, ultimately. So India appears there at best as a kind of junior partner. Then there's the kind of communist worldview and the republican worldview, where, you know, this Tianxia and all that is thrown out. The empire is dismantled. The emperor is bid adieu, made into an ordinary human being. And what replaces it is communism and basically a republican view, which is that people, by merit, will rule the country, either the republican view of the Kuomintang or the Communist Party. So there, I mean, again, you can see, let's just take the communists. The Chinese communists certainly thought that, you know, the great fight was with capitalism. Who would lead that fight? Well, the great centers of communism would enlist all the minor socialist and like-minded oppressed people and lead the fight. And very quickly, Mao decided that the Soviet Union under Khrushchev, he was a kind of, you know, he was too weak and cowardly. And the fallout with the Soviet Union at that time was that they were too cooperative with the West. And therefore, it was actually China that would be the leading edge of the revolutionary struggle with capitalism. Where would India appear in that? I mean, if the Chinese accepted, as some did, that eventually, not initially, that India could be a kind of ally, that it was a sort of socialist aspiring country, that it was not altogether, you know, a petty bourgeois, also ran, you know, a sort of running dog of imperialism, then India could be admitted again as a junior ideological partner and revolutionary partner of China. China would lead the struggle and provide leadership and backing to these minor powers. But India would not lead the struggle. India might, more than some other centers of socialism and resistance, be a partner, but a junior partner. The third is, of course, as China exited communism, mostly, the third great worldview is China's a great power. And there, too, China now, the only peer it recognizes is the United States. And if the China dream is correct, then under Xi Jinping, then China will be not just the peer, it will be the superior. It will be the hegemon. It will be the greatest power on earth. And even the Americans will be in second place. So where is India in that? I mean, very charitably, the Indians hardly see India as a great power. At best, they sort of see India as a aspiring power. Sometimes they call us an important power with a role in world affairs, very grudgingly. And even that's a kind of backhanded compliment. So in all three worldviews, India appears as a secondary junior partner at best, and maybe even ignorable at worst. So the Indian worldviews, likewise, if we go from this sort of mandala picture from Kautilya, well, there, I mean, China is a neighbor, and your neighbor is your enemy and should be conquered. And then, you know, the Vishwaguru, or before that, the Chakravartin, keeps expanding and takes dharma to successive entities that it conquers. But not even in the greatest Indian fantasy can one imagine Indian armies, even in the past, really, traversing the Himalayas into the great flat plains of Tibet, and then moving on and conquering China. So the mandala system, the best that can be imagined, is that India cultivates your neighbors' neighbors, and they become your friends. But that doesn't work too well for India, because if you follow the logic through, then the Russians should be our friends against the Chinese. But they've cut a deal with the Chinese, at least contemporaneously, and become the junior partners of the Chinese against the West, because their mandala is, or whatever their strategic, you know, kind of system is, is that the West is the bigger problem. They look westwards. Their neighbor that's threatening is the West, and the Chinese are, you know, the enemy's enemy, and so their friend. And India no longer really appears very important to them. So then Japan is a neighbor's neighbor. But Japan is separated from the great landmass of China by water. The stopping power of water prevents Japan playing a very big role on the landmass and can't help India out too much. So in the mandala scheme, the only people who can help India is, by extension, the West. And not surprisingly, America and the Western powers are our enemy's enemy, who become our friends. But in all of that, you know, China doesn't, never appears as a friend. Then if you look at the second worldview, which is the worldview of, kind of, India as, from the perspective of cosmopolitanism. You see, I almost forgot my own book. In this cosmopolitan Nehruvian-Tagore vision, see, that's the most soft-eyed, twinkly-eyed view of China as a fellow Asian civilization. It's a viewpoint where nationalism doesn't count for so much. In fact, nationalism beyond a point might be the problem. Then it's India looking at China through a different lens, as another potential civilizational partner, or another part, another civilization that deserves respect, that one can learn from, work with, et cetera, et cetera. And that's a worldview that can accommodate China, that can look at China as a friend, as a kin, through softer eyes. But then we come to India's third worldview, which is our great power view. And actually, here I club Nehru and Golwalkar, you know, the RSS supremo, in one bag, because I don't think Gandhi and Tagore would have talked about India as a great power. That wasn't their kind of vocabulary. But Nehru partook of that vocabulary, and Golwalkar did as well. So in that worldview, then China is a rival. And it's not geography that makes China a rival. It's the fact, so that's, you know, that's a mandala theory. But this great power view is that China's a rival because it's another great power. You see, just in that worldview, even the United States would be a challenge to India because it's another great power. So China, from this great power view, is that, well, great powers can never be really good friends. Although in Nehru, you know, you said earlier that he had this kind of nice view of China and a romantic view, but he also always had a doubt and worry about China as another great power. And some of his views are almost racist as well. And Golwalkar too, you know, wrote sometimes about China in a very bad way. And the book that he wrote it in has, you know, you can't buy that book. It's been taken away and hidden by the RSS and so on. So, you know, both of them, with their own great power view, could not look at China as anything but a kind of a rival, although their view was slightly different about where the rivalry came from. So you're right. The only, out of these six worldviews, three Chinese and three Indian, the only nice one was the Gandhi and Tagore one. Gandhi didn't know China that well, I think, just my sense of it. I don't know enough about his writings on China. But Tagore, of course, knew it much better. And then, you know, he started Chinabavan and the whole attempt to bring Chinese and Indian aesthetics and artists and writers and intellectuals together. You know, those were the only two who could really have a very nice accommodative kin view of China. And yet, as I point out, and you reminded me, that those are the only two who today, where do those worldviews figure? I mean, there's the obvious, you know, October 2 view of Gandhi, which even the right wing plays up. But there's no great affection or, you know, kind of partaking of Gandhi and thought beyond the point in India anymore. I mean, it's an obligatory schoolboy view, father of the nation view, but not a real engagement with Gandhi and his values. And likewise, where is Tagore today? I mean, and his thoughts about post nationalism or a worldview transcending nationalism. Again, sadly, I think probably"

        "message": "really not there very much. Yeah, and it's very interesting that you should, you know, talk of Nehru and Golwalkar at the same breath. Like I often say that, you know, Modi for all his rants against the Congress and the family is actually very Nehruvian and his top down vision of how the state should rule society, and is very much like Indira in his unquenching will to power as it were, and the desire to do anything to get there, that whole oppressiveness and authoritarianism that comes from him. But Nehru and Golwalkar is an interesting sort of connection there in this context as well. Let's let's kind of talk about perimeters there. And I found that chapter really fascinating. And I have actually covered elements of it in previous episodes with Manoj Kevalramani, Hamsini Hariharan and Shivani Mehta. I've done a bunch of these episodes. But nevertheless, briefly, give us a sense of what actually happens. Like at one point, you'll talk about, I'll quote from your book, because I found this a very illuminating paragraph to which kind of sums a lot of things up, where you write, quote, in the 1950s, both saw the other as insincere and stubborn in the border discussions. They concluded that the other had failed to honor commitments on Tibet. And they came to regard the other as militarily aggressive and themselves as militarily defensive. Having said that now and then the differences on the border did narrow, they agreed on the status of Tibet in 1950, 51 and 54. And they tried to avoid escalatory military actions. So it seems to me that one at a level of where their posturing is that this belongs to us and that belongs to us. There's absolutely no way that there is a common ground there that if you know, one army is an exposition, which the other country claims belongs to them, it will be viewed as an act of aggression by one and as an act of defense by the other. And there's no getting around that. Yet it seems for decades for large parts of our history, there was a certain practicality about how far you can push these differences, whether at Aksai Chin or Arunachal or whatever. And there weren't skirmishes. In fact, at one point, there was a proposal of doing a kind of a swap. So tell me a little bit more about sort of the arc of this relationship as regards to border differences. And, you know, the possible reasons that it's kind of exploded, you know, in phases over the last decade, like really coming"

        "message": "to a head last year, of course, in Ladakh. Yeah, the border issues and the perimeters issue and I call it perimeters just to stay with the peas. But it's an interesting one, because I think we've lost track of that it began as a cooperative venture. So definitely, the two sides did begin a process of negotiation and talks. And it seemed to go fairly well for about four or five years until about 1954. And the issue of of the border cannot be divorced from Tibet. Because obviously, Tibet is where India meets China. And so it was intimately connected with the status of Tibet as well. And again, the first four or five years brought cooperation on Tibet. India conceded that China basically owned Tibet, and concluded a treaty in 1954, and backed a certain agreement that the Chinese had with the Tibetans in 1950-51 as well. So it began well, you know, one might have expected that things would get better. And that was belied, obviously. And what I try to show in the book is as balanced in as balanced a way as possible, is that, in a sense, I mean, it wasn't maliciousness, and it wasn't point scoring. And it wasn't, you know, a desire altogether to hurt the other side. In those initial years, I pointed out that there was a kind of a split in the negotiating stance that they had. There was the so called sooner school, my term, and the later school on both sides. So my grandfather, Girija Bajpai, and KPS Menon, Shivshankar Menon's grandfather as well, they were two of the senior most foreign service people. And they were in the, with Sardar Patel, they were in the sooner school, negotiate with China, because the Chinese are going to raise the border issue, and twin an agreement of the border to the status of Tibet. We will agree to Chinese kind of sovereignty over Tibet, if they come to an accommodation on the border. But Panekar, who was our ambassador, the historian, geopolitical thinker, who was our ambassador in Beijing, he was of the later school, he said, don't raise the border issue, because we won't agree, and then be reforced to negotiate. And we don't want to negotiate, because in some ways, our position in administrative control in the furthest reaches, particularly in NIFA, which is Arunachal Pradesh today, is very weak. So we've got to buy time. It'll come, but let's, let's wait for the Chinese to raise it. And Nehru kind of oscillated between the two, and then eventually came out on the side of Panekar. And the Chinese, you see, I think, and I tried to show, had exactly the same debate. Their Tibetologists and their cartographers came to the view that China, that the Indians were not playing fair, the Chinese had a case, and they should raise it sooner rather than later. And the politicos, that is Zhou Enlai and Mao and others in the Communist Party felt that the time wasn't right, that China was too weak. And they would deal with India later on this matter, and not provoke. So the first five years, from 1949 to 1954, they were both tiptoeing around the issue, both kind of expecting to join the issue at some point. And probably, you know, they were still fairly friendly, rhetorically, and so on. And an accommodation might have been reached, but it wasn't. And then things got worse and worse. And, but when they did begin to talk, and then I'll roll the movie forward faster. When they did begin to talk in about 1954, both sides did things or said things that could be prone to misinterpretation by the other side. You know, Nehru insisted on issuing some maps where Aksai Chin seemed to be very much within our territory. And he did this just around the time of a meeting with Zhou Enlai. Zhou Enlai didn't take umbrage. But as soon as he went back, the Chinese began to issue maps of their own that contradicted that claim. And when India objected, the Chinese said, oh, no, no, these are the old Go Min Dang maps, give us time. So we did stuff with maps that they didn't, that caused suspicion amongst them. They did stuff with maps that we thought was dishonest as well. Nehru was not even sure that we really had a strong case on Aksai Chin. And some of his advisors also didn't think so. It was really only when S. Gopal, the historian, went to Britain and looked at the archives there and came back that India began to feel that it had a much stronger case on Aksai Chin. And Nehru began to make much stronger statements publicly about owning Aksai Chin. And the Chinese went through something similar. Their records also had been disrupted by the Civil War. At least that's a thought experiment that I do. Some records may have gone to Taipei, you know, when the Go Min Dang ran away with all those documents. Some may have been destroyed in the Civil War. So they had to reconstruct their stance as well. So, you know, I give both sides a long rope, in effect, saying let's not jump to this conclusion on both sides that the other was thoroughly dishonest and trying to outpoint the other. There were genuine administrative, political doubts, worries, weaknesses. They had come out, both had come out of a Civil War. In India, the Civil War was Congress Party and Muslim League. In China, it was Go Min Dang Communist Party, which is a literal Civil War. They had both come out of a partition. After all, the creation of Taiwan is a partition. And Hong Kong was still there, and Macau was still separate. They had both come out of a world war. They briefly fought on the same side against the Japanese, but they both came out of a chaos of a world war, the Chinese particularly, because they were occupied. We were not occupied. They both came out of a period of war. We were fighting the Pakistanis in 47, 48. They were fighting the Americans and South Koreans in Korea. Both were confronting the Cold War. So, you know, it's quite forgivable that they didn't know their minds altogether about the border themselves, each other, etc., etc. You know, so let's be a bit more forgiving of both sides and not jump to the conclusion they just wanted to screw each other. And that's what I tried to reconstruct. But of course, they also did, unfortunately, read each other in a negative light. What might have been innocent prevarications, contradictions, hesitations, was seen as the other side as you're trying to screw me and being dishonest with me and fooling me. So not surprisingly, things increasingly fell apart. And that brings us to the swap, which I suppose was the last great moment when things could have been salvaged. And it's true the Chinese under Zhou Enlai, when he came for that fateful summit in 1960 to Delhi, the Indians already knew that he was bringing a proposal like that. They weren't stupid. And this whole idea that Nehru and his advisor were naive, here was Chacha Nehru in his kind of slightly indulgent, benighted, faltering, foolish way. You know, he knew from the beginning, thanks to Panicker, that there was a problem. Thanks to G.S. Bajpai, thanks to Patel. The letter that Patel wrote in 1950, just before he died to Nehru, alerting him, was written by my grandfather, the draft, and then Patel played around with it and sent it off. They were not naive at all. But, you know, there were other considerations. Anyway, Zhou Enlai arrives in Delhi, as the Indians expected, with the proposal. But Nehru and his advisors already had lost courage. Nehru said famously, which I quote in the book, if I go for the swap, I will not survive as a prime minister. And who are the people who would have been his biggest critics? The right-wing critics in his own party, and the right-wing critics outside his party, the Jansang and others, but also perhaps the Swatantra party of Raja Gopalacharian, who were more America-inclined. And they turned out to be formidable forces, as Ram Guha shows in his work on this period. So they very quickly basically shut Zhou Enlai down. And, you know, they had reasons. It wasn't just the domestic political sphere. They had concerns of, as I think R.K. Nehru said, or was it B.K. Nehru at that time? I forget. I'm forgetting my own book here. And the foreign secretary of the time was saying, you know, in 1960, that if we give in to the Chinese now, under pressure, because border incidents were already occurring, what's to stop the Chinese learning the lesson that if you push the Indians militarily, they will give again? So we get a swap. And then they go, oh, no, we actually forgot we want some more territory. And then there's another set of border incidents. And they would be the expectation that the Indians would cave in again. And they also concluded that Zhou Enlai had never put anything down on paper. So this was a kind of chatty proposal. And what was really the, would Mao go for it? Were there other forces? Or was this more or less a good-natured proposal by Zhou Enlai, slightly intended to smoke the Indians out and buy time? So there are all kinds of reasons that India could worry about the status of the proposals. I mean, the Chinese concluded from this episode that the Indians were simply not willing to, A, enter into discussion seriously, you're not going for a reasonable proposal, they were imperialists, they wanted to take over Tibet, etc, etc. And you just couldn't do business with them. Even so, there was still some attempts to try and deal with it. But it collapsed, partly with these military moves that occurred. And so, you know, the chapter shows that one period of proto-cooperation through a collapse into war, peaking in 62, occurred. And just to take very quickly the story forward, after 62, we go through almost a similar arc. Again, almost immediately in 63-64, India sends out messages to try and get some talks going again. It has a certain amount of receptivity, an arc of cooperation begins, and it does well until a much longer timescale here, right up to about, I would say, the early 2000s. Maybe 2006 is the turning point when the Chinese ambassador in Delhi, very publicly at that time, says, by the way, we own all of Arunachal Pradesh, so please, you Indians, don't forget it. And there was consternation because we hadn't heard that kind of blunt statement for the Chinese for a long time. And from 2006 onwards, then, you can see a deterioration in the relationship. By 2010, India, perhaps in reaction, stops making fulsome statements in the joint statements that, you know, happened with summits about, oh, yeah, yeah, Tibet is yours. And so we stopped doing that. They keep insisting Arunachal is theirs. I mean, of course, they'd said it earlier, but there was a long period of time where they stopped insisting on it very publicly. That's 2010. 2013, we're almost back to where we are now. You have the Depsang Plains incident when Manmohan Singh is in his last year. That occurs just as Li Keqiang, the current premier, is coming to meet Manmohan Singh. 2014 is Chumar. Modi and Xi are sitting on a jhoola in Gandhinagar, and the troops are faced off in Chumar. 2015 is Burtsey. And this is an episode that people have sort of forgotten. I don't know why the Indian media has largely forgotten it. And so 2013, 14, 15, annually, there are these fracases or confrontation. 2017 is Doklam, 73 days of staring each other in the face. And 2020 is Ladakh, back in the eastern sector with Chumar, Depsang, and Burtsey. So that's the arc. So we didn't end up in the 1962 war. We ended up in Ladakh 2020. It's an arc of cooperation through attempts to settle the issue. There were very thorough border talks from 1981 onwards. We never stopped negotiating on the border after 1981, which people forget. But again, it degraded, and we went into near war in 2020. In 62, we went into war. So, you know, it's an odd thing that we've had two repeat cycles. And at the heart of it, I mean, I don't know exactly what the answer is, but fundamentally, there's an issue of trust there, which is a tautology, right? You don't cooperate because you don't trust, and you don't trust because you don't have a history of cooperation. So then, I mean, tautology is useful, because they make us ask, well, why don't you trust? How can I break out of this tautology? And here, I would just end with some thoughts, which is they're unprovable, but they're up for discussion, which is the political cultures of the two sides, really, in a sense. You've got liberal India working in constitutional ways, taking constitutional ways from the British, and that whole mindset from internal negotiations to external negotiations of a certain kind. You know, they're settled borders by treaty and customary understandings, and that's how you deal with the problem with China. That's Nehru. Whereas the Chinese, they're two revolutionaries there, hard-bitten, cold-eyed men who went through cataclysmic total warfare. They are deal-makers. They're strategic-minded people. They think that the liberal adornments of law and constitution and all of that is some bourgeois idea, which is supposed to mask reality. After all, what does the middle class do and the capitalists? They pretend to give you all these freedoms and protections of the law to make sure that they actually come out on top. So they looked at this whole insistence on constitutionalism and negotiation and insistence on rule of law and treaties as trying to fool the Chinese. So, you know, they just couldn't quite comprehend where Nehru was coming from, and likewise, the Nehruvians thought that they were dishonest. And then, as I said, all these hesitations and cartographic kind of weaknesses that they had made each suspicious of the other. Both sides, ironically, were weak states, and weak states find it difficult to cooperate with each other because they can't convince the other that their moves are, you know. Then there's history. The two countries I try and point out, or the two civilizations, their two heartlands never had a very rich diplomatic history. They traded, monks went back and forth, et cetera, et cetera. But empire to empire, they didn't have a long history of knowing each other's ways, which could see them through. And what do they get from that history? They get predictability of how the other, but most important, they learn a lesson about does the other side keep to commitments, i.e. promises. If you feel the other side keeps to promises, then you might begin to think, okay, if we did a stucco deal, they'll honor it. And the last point is, where does trust come from? It comes from, you know, if you're part of the same civilization or culture, you have a certain kind of sense of, I understand where you're coming from, we come from the same place kind of stuff. But for all that, China and India, you know, don't come from that place. They don't have that assurance, that immersion in a common culture. And so I think, you know, those are some reasons that they just, there was a lack of trust. And to some extent, all that continues to be the case. So your other two P's, of course, are about like,"

And therefore, China is saying we will not give any concessions because we are much more powerful. And India, which recognizes that it is not as powerful, but it aspires to be, will say we will not make any more concessions because you know, all kinds of reasons it looks bad. And, you know, what would our voters say and all of that. I'll direct listeners to go and just buy the book and read it because it's a fantastic one sitting read. And really, I don't think we'll do justice to it if we try to really summarize it. But I'll end with a couple of final questions. And one of them is this that it seems to me that post 1950s, what has happened to our relationship is almost like this great tragedy where both countries for various reasons, various reasons which are rational and understandable, have somehow gotten locked into this antagonistic relationship, where it has become impossible to trust the other side, again, for good reasons. It's not as if there are any bad actors in this, but it becomes impossible to trust the other side, and which led to that one eruption of the 62 conflict. But what has happened since then, is that both sides seem to have recognized that this is, you know, let's make a stable equilibrium out of this and not enter into any more skirmishes because war after all is a negative sum game and blah, blah, blah. So let's just ignore the problem. And we'll make occasional noises and we'll posture occasionally, but we won't actually do anything against each other. And let's just keep it as it is. And it's it kind of stays that way for decades. And yet over the last few years, it seems to have exploded into a different kind of place where the Chinese clearly want something and these these border disputes don't just seem to be about borders because, you know, I mean, these are, you know, Siachen is important for India, Aksaichen is important for China, but they're not that important that you risk a full fledged war or that you break this equilibrium. Also, the danger here is we enter a vicious cycle where we have jingoism on one side met by jingoism on the other side, and it just escalates and becomes worse and worse. So the first of my two questions is that why is this happening? Why the sudden belligerence from them? Why have they kind of upped the game? What are the kind of competing theories and what seems most plausible to you?"

        "message": "Well, I'll go back to these four Ps, I want to investigate all four. But I think that, you know, in search of a fairly simple answer, I would go for the simplest, which is that it's the perimeters of Tibet, which is the Chinese built a lot of infrastructure in Tibet, which is relatively easy to do, because it's a plateau. And they did massive amounts of building there in the late 90s, early 2000s. India then alarmed by this suddenly started to get going on building its own infrastructure under the Manmohan Singh government first, a little bit under Vajpayee, and then again, with Modi. So all three governments have played their role in pushing or playing catch up. The difficulty on the Indian side is that our roads are twisting turning. We're going from the plains up in straight up into these massive hills. So our road building and infrastructure is much more difficult to do. And so it's not surprising that it's slower. I mean, there are other reasons too, we were reluctant to build it earlier, and so on and so forth. But so we've slowly started to catch up. We've rehabilitated some in our flatlands in Aksai Chin. We've rehabilitated some of the airfields going back to an earlier time, excuse me. And that has alarmed the Chinese, as we've caught up. Now, we can say it's unfair, because they did their infrastructure first. Why should they object to ours? But this is a strategic issue. There's no fairness issue here. This is again, you know, we're talking the fairness game. They're talking a strategic picture. And to understand what's strategic about it, which again, we don't appreciate enough, probably on our side is, and I've been saying this in some of the other talks is, when you think the border issue, when you think conflict with China, please think Tibet. They are so super sensitive about Tibet, in a way that we don't appreciate. You know, we think that, oh, we did that deal back in 54, that they should be happy with it. And that's the end of the story. No, there was a rebellion in Tibet after that, that they accused us of fostering and working with the Americans. And there's evidence that certainly the Americans very much pushed it. But beyond that, when you build these roads and infrastructure, I mean, they're reading that as not a defensive move, but potentially a move into Aksai Chin to again, endanger their road from Xinjiang down into Tibet, and to potentially at a moment of internal instability in Tibet. And I'll come to that in a minute, that India could play a role then. I mean, maybe not invade and take over, but cause significant trouble at the border, and send a message to rebellions within Tibet, which then the Chinese would have difficulty handling. So I think that's the thing that we have to keep in mind on the Indian side. And we're going into a dangerous period. So it's not just the roads per se, it's that for China, we're going into a dangerous period for them. What's that danger? Well, the Dalai Lama is a wonderful person, and I hope he lives for a very long time. But we know we're entering a period of transition. And he will depart this world, sadly, at some point. And then where are we? The Chinese will put up their successor. The overseas Chinese community, including very powerfully in India, will want to do their own succession planning and process. There may be Tibet diasporic communities in the West who will do their own search, which would not agree with either of the other two searches. So one can imagine a very difficult time if you put yourself in the place of Beijing. And strategic thinking, you have to think about how your adversary thinks about problems. So they can see a political strategic problem arising in the next 10, 15 years, perhaps sooner, where the Tibet issue boils up, the Indians have completed their infrastructure and are much more able to intervene or cause trouble at the border, coincident with an internal rebellion and uncertainties. And it may be that they would be generous towards us and say, whoever's ruling in Delhi would not deliberately stoke the problem, but would an Indian ruler, given public opinion in India, be able to handle the fallout of the succession and what it would mean with China? So from every point of view, they would be extremely worried about the Tibet problem. And that's the issue, you know, I think, which is that it's a bit incomprehensible to us that they're so substantially in charge of Tibet and all of that. What are they worried about? Why do they worry about the border? We can't invade them, et cetera. And as you said, the slices of territory that might be involved, barring Arunachal Pradesh, seem to be very small. But there's Tibet. There's their worry about Tibet. And this, I think, is the problem. And it's almost like a structural historical moment or a conjuncture that we've reached of the fatality of human beings, that the Dalai will leave this world, sadly, current Dalai Lama, and a decision has to be made about the future of Buddhism in Tibet and the governing arrangements, et cetera, et cetera. And the fatal problem, fatal meaning, it's out of our hands that there's a Tibetan community here who will want to have a say. Beijing can't do anything about that existential reality. Delhi can't do anything about it. We're not going to force out the Tibetans. We're not going to put all the Tibetans in jail so we can avoid a problem with the Chinese. The Chinese can't do something about the Tibetans in India beyond a point, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it's a real difficulty. And that may account for the very serious kind of problem that occurred last year. And you can see 2013, 2014, 2015, all in eastern Ladakh. 2017 is a bit different, but that's a different part of Tibet. It's still Tibet. And by the way, the problem is in eastern Ladakh. But going back to 62, Mao took a decision to hit India hardest in Nipah, in Arunachal, where India was probably strongest militarily because he wanted to make the point that if we're going to hit India, we're going to teach them a lesson. You can't do it where they're weak because they'll find excuses saying, oh, they beat us up where we're weak. No, we're going to beat you up where you're strong to really make the point that we are angry with you. So this may be, again, the problem. And the further issue is that they lay strong claim now as they didn't as much back in the 60s to Arunachal. They may see economic resources in Arunachal that they didn't earlier, river waters, agricultural lands, minerals, and all of that, timber. And it's symbolically important because coming back to Tibet, Tawang Monastery, that's there. They want it. We can't give it to them. When the next Dalai comes, it will be in the mix of things that might play a role. So Arunachal is important from that point of view as well. And lastly, where are their main military headquarters? They're near Arunachal Pradesh. I mean, Lhasa and all of that is near, it's not in Ladakh. They're not in eastern Ladakh. So the command headquarters are in Chengdu and neighboring areas like that. They only have one big command center, and that's in Hotan in Xinjiang, and that's quite a distance away from eastern Ladakh. So I mean, a common sense of prediction would be that if there is a problem, we could have a very serious problem in Arunachal Pradesh, because that's where their military strength and command strength is."

The stakes are huge, right? If you look at it as a negative sum game, as all conflict inevitably is, it can get just much worse and worse. And it doesn't matter how bad it gets for China, it'll get much worse for us, and we don't want conflict. And the positive sum game of cooperation and trade and all of that, the benefits are also incredibly huge. So now the question is that, what should India do now? Like, going by this analysis, that this is a problem, these are their worries, there's historically been distrust, let's resolve it once and for all. And let's kind of move ahead and let's do what it takes to resolve it. What should India do now?"

        "message": "Yeah, exactly. Thanks. You put me in my place there, anyway. But I guess that for me, ultimately, at this point, I would say, there has to be a thorough excavation domestically on both sides. And I think that, unfortunately, you know, on the Chinese side, even if it happens, we're not going to see it, because they don't do that kind of stuff. They don't open up in their system domestically, let it all hang out, and warts and all, you see their debate and their mayor culpers. But we can still do it, because we're still open enough, you know, and we still have a bit of a political culture, I would say, where we could open it up. So, I think that, you know, this is a difficult question. But probably, for me, the answer is that Beijing and China are not going to carry out this internal, somewhat public discussion, which is probably necessary. I mean, they may do it internally, and it could be effective. But in a sense, it can still happen in India more easily, given our relatively open system. And so, you know, it takes courage. But I think India has to begin to vent, to open, to excavate, to take a risk, to open up its archives more. Maybe some things can't altogether be opened up. But I see a kind of opening up already happening. I mean, you know, there have been some very interesting books just recently, Zorawar Dholat Singh's book. I know you interviewed, I think, Anand Krishnan, perhaps."

        "message": "Right, Manoj's work, which I don't know yet, actually. And so, I must read that. Thanks for alerting me to it again. I know there are at least a couple of Indian diplomats, who are very soon going to come out with books. They're China, you know, at least three of them, very, very high ranking in diplomats. I'm not going to mention their names, because I don't think it's my call to mention it, when they still haven't come out very openly. But I know, you know, in a way, through them, we are beginning to open it out in a way that we haven't done for a very long time. And so, I'm kind of still hopeful that these books will start to open it out. And if my book also plays a bit of a role there, you know, in just provoking people, then I think that'll be mission accomplished. So, I think there's hope there. And this government and Shivshankar Menon and Manmohan Singh also began to open up the Indian archives. So, I think that, you know, both these last two governments have played a role in encouraging that. And I think Foreign Minister Jaishankar and Modi himself, to their credit, I think are sticking with it. Yeah, I think that's what's got to happen. If out of that debate, then, you know, you see, then it's not just Modi taking a case to the country. There's a whole range of people who will begin to open things up, talks like this and other settings. The Indian elite and middle class will begin to access these debates. So, by the time a Modi or his successor comes to really sort of go back to China with a possible deal, they will already be a kind of civic society support base, which will say, all right, we're kind of ready. And I think that maybe already, barring some real fanatics here and there, there is a willingness now in India to kind of revisit the whole thing. On the Chinese side too, I think there are constituencies there. But I think it probably take India to kickstart it at this point. I know that's a hard one for us to swallow on, because we think we've been wronged very badly by China, including last year. But from the spirit of your question, leaving aside, you know, this episode and that episode, and who was at fault altogether, do we fundamentally want a resolution of this issue so that we can all move forward and deal with other problems? I think from that much bigger strategic perspective, I think we will have to take the lead in opening this up. Fascinating. I mean, I obviously don't know India-China"

        "message": "Well, the best case is kind of this increasing internal debate that, which, in a sense, was catalyzed by the events of last year. So, if one could put it that way, the Chinese may have done us a favor by that. They may have catalyzed an internal debate that will culminate by 2030 in new perspectives in India. And, you know, I mean, I can't say I'm a big fan of this government, but the chances are that Mr. Modi or a successor will be re-elected. And if they come back fairly strongly, they might be able to take this change that is in motion in India. And it may be that, if it's Mr. Modi himself, that he would see that as part of a legacy, you know. So, to personalize the possibility, maybe that's the way it'll work out, is that he would take it forward. And by that time, who knows, Xi Jinping may also be looking at a legacy issue. And they decide to go for it, and it works. And we have catalyzed the debate enough internally that there'll be enough support for a Modi at that point. And so, we get an agreement. Does that mean all quarrels will be over? No, but it means that at least this big one will be over, and then we can see whether we can adjust other matters between us. The worst case is, of course, that, you know, that doesn't happen, and things get worse. And the Chinese, you know, going back to what you paraphrased nicely for me, just the gap between the two countries either remains substantially like this or gets worse. And if that happens, then the Chinese would be even less prone to concede to anything to us, and we would find it even more difficult to, you know, do a deal which wouldn't look like a surrender. And who knows? I mean, our nationalists, super nationalists, and their super nationalists might just, it might all explode. India might drift closer and closer to the United States to compensate for that power gap, which will antagonize the Chinese even more. The Chinese will overread it, and something will happen here or there on the border, and we could get into a serious problem. What might salvage it for India, of course, is that despite the disparity in power, geography, the Himalayas, and so on, will still play a role as a stopping factor. And, you know, it may be another stalemate, but it could be, if any, it could be a little war again. I mean, the optimistic part of that is 1962 war, we think of it as one month long, but it's actually only 11 days of fighting in two phases. And really, for such a massive border, sad as any casualties are, the casualties were relatively low in the history of warfare. And that's probably going to be the case again, it seems to me, you know, unless people lose their heads completely on both sides. So I think that's the worst case scenario, that we do actually go beyond what happened last summer to an actual fight, maybe mostly centered on the eastern sector. And that would be, you know, unpredictable exactly where it would go. But again, it would make the problem worse for another 2030 years. Yeah. And if other countries get drawn into it, to some extent, then it affects Asia, it has Asia-wide ramifications. But I still remain somewhat optimistic that the events of, oddly enough, of last year may have catalyzed something, particularly on the Indian side, who knows how much on the Chinese side, and out of this something positive may come. And we could now, one last thought on again, to personalize it, both Xi and Modi have shown that they can make dramatic moves, either in their internal politics or externally. In India, you know, demonetization, GST, you know, certain kinds of other decisions that have been taken. One day, Modi flies to Pakistan to make peace in 2015. The next day, we do Balakot or whatever, you know, provoked by the Pakistanis. One day, there's Doklam. The next day, Modi is meeting Xi Jinping in Wuhan and then Mamlapuram. The Chinese, likewise, do all kinds of, one day is full four-year diplomacy. The next day, Xi Jinping is telling his diplomats, can you please ease back and use less harsh language and be nice, play nice. So, you know, we could see a dramatic reversal to Wuhan, the spirit of Wuhan and Mamlapuram at a moment. And you know, we have ambivalences about the relationship with the Americans. So, you never know, it might turn on these leaders suddenly making a switch strategically."
