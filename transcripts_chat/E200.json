        "message": "When I started the Scene and the Unseen four years ago, I could not have imagined what the show would become. At that time, I thought I will do 20 minute episodes on the unintended consequences of public policy. Today, this is a show that features long form conversations, sometimes longer than three hours on subjects that range from politics to history to economics to society and culture. And along the way, I discovered truths about the nature of audio and the power of podcasting that ran contrary to what I had earlier believed. Also, I built a listenership that was far more engaged and that cared more about what I was putting out than any readership I could have imagined as a writer. We are 200 episodes old today. What a journey it's been. Maybe it's time to sit back for a moment and take stock."

        "message": "science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen. In fact, welcome to episode 200 of the Scene and the Unseen. This is a special episode for me for a number of reasons. One, 200 is a nice round number and it feels appropriate to celebrate it in a way that one won't celebrate, say, episode 196 or episode 203. But still, it's nice to have these milestones that allow you to celebrate or to take stock. Two, I'm using this episode to launch the Scene and the Unseen books. Along with the publishers Westland, I'm bringing out a four-volume anthology of the Scene and the Unseen with curated excerpts from the 200 episodes of the Scene and the Unseen so far. These four volumes, which will be out early next year, will be divided across the themes of politics, history, economics, and society and culture. Three, I'm also launching the Scene and the Unseen merchandise, beginning with designer mugs that you can browse at sceneunseen.in slash stuff. And four, my good friend and frequent guest, economist Shruti Rajagopalan has put together a special episode in which she got 22 guests and fans of the show to ask me questions. So the tables have turned and I'm in the firing line. We ended up recording a five-hour conversation and I consider splitting it up into two episodes. But then I figured that me talking about myself felt a little bit self-indulgent. So it was best to just release it as one bumper episode. So this is therefore the longest episode ever on the Scene and the Unseen and regular programming resumes next week. Before we get to the conversation, I need to express my gratitude to those who made the show possible. Four years ago, I didn't listen to podcasts and therefore didn't understand why this was such a special medium. Then a friend of mine called Amit Doshi approached me. Amit ran the podcast network, IVM podcast, and he asked if I'd be interested in doing something with them. I met up with Amit and his then creative director, May Thomas, at a restaurant in Juhu called Fable and decided to take a shot at this show. May soon went her own way and my partnership with IVM ended last year as I went solo. But without Amit Doshi's initiative, you would not be listening to this. Almost all of my 200 episodes have had one editor, Vijay Doifode. Vijay's been a silent partner in crime, often fighting a valiant battle to salvage shaky audio. And I continue to feel so reassured that he remains by my side as I go down this path. The artwork of the show is done by the brilliant artist, Alekha Gupta, whose wonderful work adds to the character of the Scene and the Unseen. While Vijay and Alekha are the two people I work with every week, I also want to thank those who've played a part in this show in the past. Josh Thomas, Swati Bakshi, Abbas Mohamed, and Jude Weston helped produce it back in the IVM days. Madhu Menon built the website sceneunseen.in and took the podcast of photographs, which are actually pretty good photographs if you take the podcaster out of them. And May Thomas and Sean Fanthorne helped me with advice and support at crucial times. I also want to thank the many, many guests I've had over these 200 episodes who have trusted me and have been generous with their time and insights. It takes two people to have a good conversation, and I'm blessed to have been able to learn so much from so many wonderful people. And I also want to thank you, the listener, for making me feel that someone is listening and that this matters. I've often had lonely moments where I've wondered if this was worth it. And your constant validation and support has meant a lot to me. Also, since I opened the show up for support in April this year, many of you have made generous financial contributions to keep the show going. I feel guilty that I haven't been able to write to each of you personally to thank you for this. But it's been heartwarming and even moving for me. The show remains independent because of you. More than that, it remains meaningful to me because of you. So thank you for that. Over to the conversation now where Shruti unleashes one surprise after another. But you know the drill. Before we get there, let's take a quick commercial break. And I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode. Besides all the logistics of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel and so on. So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going. And that involves you. My proposition for you is this. For every episode of the scene and the unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth. You can do this by heading over to seen unseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of your choice. This is not a subscription. The scene and the unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at seen unseen.in. This is just a gesture of appreciation. Help"

Just FYI, for this episode, I am prepared with energy bars, caffeine and water. I have only not come with like a pack for like survivorship or survivahood. But other than that, I'm fully prepared.

So we did you know, like a sort of big reflections episode 100 episodes ago. And that was a little bit more fun because we got to have lunch at Oh Calcutta just before we recorded that. So this time all the yummy food is missing and it's the pandemic and we're not in the studio together. But other than that, it feels really, really nice to celebrate this big sort of, you know, milestone."

For what it's worth, I live and record in Mumbai and Shruti is in NYC and we record most of our episodes remotely. But you happen to be down in Mumbai that time. So we had lunch at Oh Calcutta and then recorded the 100th and here we are at the 200th. And I don't think you invited yourself in the sense that it feels perfectly natural to, you know, do a milestone episode with you because you know, I don't know if you remember, but you know, before the show started, you know, we did a bunch of sort of pilot episodes. And you were my guinea pig for those and listeners may not be aware of this. But before we launched the show, when I was partnering with IBM, the way we conceptualize the show was something of a produced show where I go on a theme and then we have soundbites from various people coming in and all of that. And later on at some point we realized that's too much of a pain and what the hell and let's just do a straight interview show because much easier to kickstart it and I had a good sense of it and the show of course went on to evolve massively from there. But Shruti was the guinea pig for many of those."

What is the point of recording this conversation? Really, the two of us are going to talk about minimum wage or something like that. You know, one of the guinea pig episodes was I think on minimum wage and I was like, who the hell is going to care about what we have to say about this? So I was a big time naysayer. I'm really glad Amit did not take my advice and he went with this. Otherwise, there would be no 200th show. So that's my mini confession. But I became a big cheerleader for the show soon enough. This was just in the very, very initial period."

But at the start, it was just an experiment. It was like, let's do it. The show was nothing like what it is now. And, you know, from there, it's kind of evolved. And I mean, really one of the sort of the turning points in my thinking about the medium was episode 26, which we did together on the right to property, which was, you know, more than an hour. And, you know, early on in the show, my conception of podcasting, my conception of media in general, because I didn't listen to podcasting, my conception of this kind of media in general was that people have short attention spans, and you have to hook them in the first 15 seconds. And no matter how long you make it, it should not be longer than 20 minutes, which was all rubbish. And I'll, you know, maybe get a chance to elaborate later in the episode why I feel that way. But as we sort of when we did episode 26, which was more than an hour, I thought, okay, this is my best episode so far. And it happens to be my longest. So what is going on here? And I really enjoyed this and listeners seem to enjoy it. And it took a new life. And now of course, one hour is like a ridiculous miniature, I would never do something so hopelessly shallow. But what I'll do on social media, by the way, is release sort of without the numbers, I'll show you a list of my top 25 episodes in popularity because so many people discover the show and they're like, what should I listen to first? So I'll share the top 25. And you'll see that I think more or less all of them are more than two hours. And there's a very good correlation between sort of length and popularity."

You tend to engage more with guests who are very, I mean, I don't mean some of your guests are not high quality. But you know, sometimes when the conversation is going really well, you tend to go longer. And that is why the listener is hooked longer because it is that good. So you know, it's this funny thing, Jerry Seinfeld, in one of his shows, he talked about how a length and quality are just substitutes for each other. And I think this was with Patton Oswalt. He said, you know, there are three second cat and ad videos on YouTube that he can't tolerate two seconds off. But there are other things which you know, you're willing to watch for hours, people are willing to watch the directors cut a lot of rings back to back and things like that. So I really think it's not that people enjoy the length per se, but it is the amount of quality packed in per minute, which you have managed to sustain for three hours, I just cannot imagine how."

And we'll probably talk about interviewing. But one of the things that I do during an episode is always calibrate how long it should be, according to a number of factors, such as if I'm really enjoying it, and if it is a stimulating conversation, and there's enough dope to talk about, and the other person is willing, which is key, then I go on as long as I feel like, but sometimes the conversation may be great, but maybe the other and the other person also feels as great, but they just don't have the time they've given me three hours. So we have to end before that. That's fine. And sometimes there aren't, you know, enough things to talk about. And they kind of wind down. And sometimes I just feel that they're getting tired, they want to talk, they want to be kind, but they are just getting tired, they haven't sort of stacked up with energy bars and caffeine as you have. So at that point, I just, you know, I have to make the call that I have to be kind to this person and let them go. So they live to see another day and maybe another episode someday."

So if I can begin right after this long prelude, I mean, let me tell you the plan for the show, since you don't know what's going on, you have a rough, vague idea. So we did something, we went behind your back, and we asked a group of guests and fans, and this is not, you know, it's just a random ordering of people I know you have enjoyed having on your show. And some of the fans I have interacted with on Twitter, and I know that, you know, they're huge fans of yours. So those who are not on this list, this is entirely my fault. Um, it had nothing to do with it. Right. So this is just like a group of people who thought it would be great to ask you some questions. So what we did was I just asked them to record a question in their voice and send it to us. So Vijay, who is your sound guy, and amazing and my life savior, and who have traumatized over the last, say, two to three weeks, has been very helpful in putting this together, making sure we get all the recordings, they're of good quality. So I'm going to play the question. And you have to answer the question. So for the listeners, this is pretty spontaneous, because Amit doesn't know what's coming. Right. And I have a whole bunch of questions in the middle that that, you know, I will have, I'm sure. And, you know, just as there is always with your episodes, no fixed plan, no fixed script, we just take this where the conversation"

Because I've been on your show three times, and I've heard you discuss various things with various experts and writers and others ever since. And one of the things I've noticed is that you always spend a good amount of time right at the start, trying to get them to open up about themselves, their pasts, their childhood years, the kind of intellectual inspirations they've had, where they studied, what brought them to these junctures where they currently are. And I've always thought, what about you? You know, where did you grow up? What are the books you read? What made you this complete podcast guru? You know, this figure who's able to sort of woo other people and get them to talk about things that they may not necessarily otherwise relate to a public audience, but you managed to extract that kind of information. And I wonder if you let us extract a little bit of information about you as well, about your background and the things that make you who you are. I hope, you know, Shruti will ask you and prod you in this direction and get you to open up a little bit."

        "message": "Wow, that's such a lovely question. So, you know, before I get down to answering it, like, first of all, of course, we link all these episodes from the show notes, I must say that I've done three episodes with Manu and they were all a super hit. And he's been doing this lovely thing. Just be a guest. Yeah, no, but I have to, I have to say these things about these very kind guests of mine who have asked these questions that, you know, Manu has been on Twitter recently reading out from Hindi and Marathi translations of his books and just absolutely lovely. It shows you why he's like the resident chick magnet of Twitter. And he's got a great voice, you should totally get into podcasting, though, as I often keep saying that this is not radio, so voice does not matter. And I can elaborate on that separately if you want. But to sort of, before I get to answer this question, because I am a guest, I can ramble as much as I want, and the host cannot interrupt. That's the rule of the show. So I'd also like to talk about why I get people to open up. It's a conscious decision. It's not a decision at all, I have to reach three hours, how do I do it, spend one hour talking about them, but it's a conscious decision. But you know, not the intended reason, but part of why it works is the tactical thing is that it gets a guest to relax, and then they're more likely to trust you and open up and all of that. But the real reason I do it is for the listeners to sort of give them a sense of the flesh and blood person behind the ideas and the work that we're going to hear about. Because too often, I think that in the world, we and I've been thinking a lot and talking a lot about this recently, that we focus on abstract things and not enough on concrete things. So if you're talking about somebody's work and somebody's ideas, and you can go into all these abstract areas. And it's also interesting to me to get a concrete sense of who is this person? What is the journey where does she come from? What are the, you know, and I'm not referring to Manu as a her, I'm just, it's a generic pronoun. And so which is why I do that. But to sort of, and I think I actually talk enough about myself in little bits and pieces here that readers should already feel they know me. But basically, I was sort of, my dad is Punjabi, my mom is Bengali, my dad was an IAS officer. So I was born and brought up in Chandigarh, where I was still I think the eighth standard. And then my dad sort of shifted to Pune, where he was a director of the Film and Television Institute of India in the late 80s. In fact, he was a person who took the decision to expel Sanjay Leela Bhansali from the Institute, who was an editing student and demanded that his graduation film should be one that he's allowed to direct. And my father was like stickler for rules and know what are you saying you are an editing student and all of that. So I would have expelled him for aesthetic reasons alone. But I don't think my dad thought along those lines, I could have seen the future monstrosities that would come out of there. So, but I mentioned that as an important point, because I, you know, as a child, I basically grew up watching a lot of world cinema and thinking of it as something completely normal, not a separate genre, like world cinema or something, not as you know, a different kind of cinema, but as something completely normal, I would watch two, three films a day, that was a big influence on me. I was also fortunate because my dad is a reader and loved collecting books. And we had 1000s of books at home, literally many 1000s. So I would read I would just pick up whatever I came across and serendipity helped me when I was about the age of 10. And I saw this book, I still remember, it was a hardback modern library edition. And the book had the intriguing title of House of the Dead. So I thought, okay, this will be some really funky, nice, you know, thrilling book zombies and all that, whatever, I don't know, let's check it out. And it was a book by Dostoevsky about his years when he was in a prison in Siberia. And I was just blown away, my whole world was blown open, though I haven't read it since then. So I need to go back and read it. So I read all of Dostoevsky and then I read all the Russians. And then I got to Shakespeare. I read all of Shakespeare when I was 10. Though my I must say that while my reading was prolific, my tastes weren't very evolved. Because if I remember correctly, my favorite Shakespeare play was Titus Andronicus and kind of moved on from there. And then as I entered my teenage years, I kind of read less and less. My reading habits sort of went off into adulthood. But there was that early base where I had kind of read a lot and so on. And at this point, I had no sort of ideological sort of leanings. I was sort of probably mildly left liberal, like many people tend to be in college. And then I went to college and I decided, okay, I want to be a writer. So what do I do? How does one write and it seemed made sense to be to say, okay, I'll be an advertising copywriter. And right. So I did my BA in English literature in Ferguson College. And I did not then know of a story past. You know, it was in Ferguson College in I think 1892 or 1893 that Gopal Krishna Gokhale and who had one of the founders of the college met Mahatma Gandhi for the first time and they went for a walk on the grounds of Ferguson College and had a long chat. And it had a history of atheism. It's also in Ferguson College where Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, one of the great figures of our independence who sadly died too young, a great classical liberal, once while teaching a biology class, he asked all his students, if a donkey had God, what would that God look like? And then he held both his hands up above his ears. And brilliant. And I remember in, you know, Gokhale's biography by B.R. Nanda, there's an anecdote about how Gokhale tells someone about Ferguson College and that person says something to the effect of, oh, you come from that hotbed of atheism. Anyway, I wasn't aware of any of these in when I was in college and nor was I an atheist then. Like I said, I was mildly left liberal and mildly very fuzzy about God. And I thought spirituality and there is some bigger force out there and we cannot give it a name and all of that complete rubbish. Now, of course, I'm an atheist, but defined as the absence of belief. So I don't believe that there is no God. It's simply that I don't believe that there is a God. So this is a complete digression. But I remember a letter I did to the economist once said that, you know, saying that atheism is a belief system or a religion is like saying that not collecting stamps is a hobby. So that's kind of that's kind of how I look at it. But also what happened was then I went to Delhi from there. And in Delhi, I joined this place called HTA Hindustan Thompson Associates, where I spent a few months. And for whatever reasons, I wasn't happy advertising wasn't doing it for me. And at that time, you know, channel V had just started and they had come out with the quick gun Murugan commercials and all of that. And, and my then girlfriend now wife was in Pune, and she was planning to go to Bombay to study, although she didn't end up studying, she said she would study, but she was trying to go to Bombay and the long distance thing wasn't working out. So I said, TK, I'm going to go to Bombay. And that's the best decision you have made. It was so so I went to Bombay, I can I think I landed in Bombay on a Friday. And in Monday, I was employed at channel V. I worked in channel V for a couple of years, I worked for a couple of years more in MTV after that, you know, spent kind of five years between those two places. And then sort of moved on and did a bunch of things. I've spoken about that journey in other places. But basically, I sort of did. I tried to be an entrepreneur for a very short while, which was right after the dot com bubble burst. So not the best of timings that didn't work, then I joined wisdom, which bought Cricinfo. And I became managing editor there, did that for a few years. And because I didn't want to write only about cricket started a blog called India uncut, which, you know, back in the day became kind of fairly popular, wrote that a lot. I call that my writing gym. Like, you know, when I sort of teach my writing course, now I tell people about how important it is to write regularly. And India uncut was great, because I was writing five posts a day. And because my attitude was it is just a blog, I wasn't paralyzed by the fear of anxiety that what will other people think of my writing, and so on and so forth. So I ended up doing some 8000 posts in five years. Then I moved on to sort of playing poker professionally for a living. And after five years of that, I decided that you know, it was taking a toll on my lifestyle, I had saved up enough to kind of not have to work for a while. So I thought, let me be a writer again, left that then I kind of became editor of the online magazine Pragati for a while, started the scene and the unseen around the same time. And now I can safely say that I'm either a professional podcaster or a professional educator, none of which I would have, you know, expected five years ago, but like, here we are, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's a wild journey."

Is this going to sort of lead to short term results and validation and all of those things. I just jumped into it. Having said that the one thing I wanted to do all my life, which is write novels is something I've just written one bad novel. So I haven't done enough of that. So actually, I haven't done what you're saying I've done, which is jump into what I love. But I've done a lot of other things which have interested me because I wanted to do them. Now my broad sort of advice to people would be whenever you're doing something two pieces of advice. One is don't overthink it. I think there is a trade off between getting it done and getting it right. And wherever there is a conflict between those two, you should privilege getting it done. And in fact, getting it done as a way to get it right, because you get it done once and then you keep doing it, doing it, doing it, you keep iterating, it becomes something else and event that's actually the only way to get it right. Like, even the scene and the unseen, for example, like I'm really proud of the episodes that I've done since say maybe episode 8090. And, you know, the last the last 100 episodes, so to say, but I don't like the early episodes at all. Because the conception of the show was very different. And as you keep doing it, you know, you sort of keep learning, you keep growing, you discover new things, and then it becomes a different kind of beast. So my first piece of advice is don't overthink it, where there's a you see that trade off between getting it done and getting it right air on the side of getting it done, just start and see where it goes throw things at the wall. My other way of looking at it, which is something I've come to realize this year, and maybe we'll get a chance to speak about it at length later in this episode is that, and this is a piece of advice I give creators that I think much as they say about futurists and science fiction writers, that they tend to overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term. I think creators do this as well, that many creators will start creating something and they'll overestimate the short term and what it will get them in terms of validation and financial rewards. And they'll say, my podcast will be so popular and it'll get so many hits and I'll make so much money and they overestimate that and they could get disheartened by that and stop doing it. But you might underestimate the long run because what will happen in the long run is something that you don't really know. I mean, look at someone like Joe Rogan, he's been podcasting for donkey's years and now he gets 100 million deals from Spotify. And obviously, there's a little bit of survivors bias at play there. But regardless, I think those who succeed in creative enterprises will be people who do it for the love of it. And of course, you have to be practical and you have to think about how you want to make money and so on. But there are people who do it for the love of it, and then it works out and then they sort of start thinking of all of these other aspects, many of which fall into place. So I won't say that I didn't want to make money of this. But I started seeing in the unseen, obviously, I wasn't like the first 108 episodes made nothing. And till I went independent, in fact, and broke with my as well partners, it was making very negligible money. And now for the last few months, it's better partly because, you know, and again, this is something which in the context of creators, I can speak about later that as creators, you have to think of what you do for each and what you do for revenue. And they may not often coincide and you may do something to build your brand which which then pays off in other ancillary ways. So there's a sort of now post facto of figuring out a lot of stuff. But the bottom line is that there was a long, long period when the show wasn't, you know, making any money, and it was a labor of love. And especially when it became the long form conversation thing, you know, I would often read many, many books to sort of prepare for it. And for each episode, and it became really hard work. So I remember once I was going to an episode recording, and I was feeling very low that day, I was saying like, what's the point, you know, it's there's no money, there's nothing. Again, you know, one more time in my life, like India uncut, I'm doing something which is very popular, but there's nothing in it. And then at the end of the recording, I was like walking on air, I just felt so elated. And I thought that, you know, it's worth it for its own sake, it doesn't matter the other stuff can come or not come, but it's worth it for its own sake. And the recording for those who want to know though, it could have been many recordings, because I've, you know, made almost all the recordings I've done in the past couple of years are worth it for their own sake. But this was episode 150, which was with VK Kartika. And we were talking a lot about books. So that's sort of something that I enjoyed."

Now I have several friends who are children of civil servants, IAS, IPS and so on. And so many of them are now committed vocal libertarians. So anecdotally, there seems to be a pattern at work here. So my question for Amit is, what role, if any, did witnessing the workings of the Indian state growing up play in you later becoming a libertarian?"

        "message": "Yeah, that's such a great question. Great, perceptive question. You know, to really speculate, I mean, I don't know too many other libertarians and I don't even like to use that label now because I think labels make people think in tribal ways. So what I would kind of say is, if I may speculate on why it may be the case that children of bureaucrats might tend to distrust the state a little bit more is that they don't think of the state in abstract terms anymore, that they have seen some concrete effect of it because in a sense, they are part of it and beneficiaries of it in indirect ways. So perhaps that could be a reason but I never actually consciously thought about it. As it happens, my father was a remarkably honest IAS officer and known for that and perhaps even suffered for that. But regardless of that, I think the state is all around you. But I would like to think that, you know, just growing up in those times, even if my father wasn't who he was, I would probably have, you know, grown to think the way that I do. Because in fact, I was not like a libertarian in childhood or something. Like I said, I was mildly left liberal if there's any problem my, you know, I'd want the state to step in and solve it. And, you know, all my intent for everything would be compassionate. And I would not think about outcomes and the way the world really works. And it's really much later in adulthood that I kind of turned away from that. But I would say that, you know, what you call libertarianism is, I think, a common human decency that all of us share. And this is something I want to elaborate on at book length at some point. But the point of it is that in the concrete in our personal lives, most of us behave in ways that you would call libertarian, we respect the consent of others, we don't try to coerce others, we won't force somebody else to pay for our preferences. If we go to a restaurant with a bunch of friends, you know, we won't force everyone to order exactly what we're ordering, and so on and so forth. But when we go beyond the concrete and talk about the abstract, and we talk about the state, suddenly these values go for a toss. And we, you know, because we don't see the cost of the sort of coercion, and the other things that we then begin to recommend. So I would say that in our personal lives, most of us, if we are decent human beings, we are by default, what you are calling libertarians. I mean, I use the term in a shorthand way. And, you know, I'm just wary of using terms like these, because they're so tribal, but all of that. So I say that, so I don't know what part that played in my life. And I know the kids of a handful of bureaucrats and none of them think like me. So I think maybe Rajat's experience is different. I wonder how, you know, I should have asked him this during the episode, but it never came up. I wonder how truck drivers feel about sort of the state, because they are actually constantly victims in so many different ways of the oppressiveness of the state. So given how so many of us normalize that, perhaps they don't think about it at all."

And there is like this universality to these themes, like whether it's migration, whether it's driving, that each one of us can immediately connect to what it is that's going on.

        "time": "00:35:42.680",
        "message": "Oh, yeah, my own migration story. So I mean, there are two ways in which I can tackle this question. And one, I've already kind of spoken about my background born and brought up in Chandigarh and then moved to, studied in Pune for a few years, was in Delhi where I worked in HTA for a year and then Bombay since then, the last 25 years, more than that. But before that, if you kind of look at where my parents are from, my mother was, you know, a Calcutta person, a hardcore Bengali, a Bhattacharya as it were. And my father was born in 1941 in what is now Pakistan in Sheikhupura, which is a place in Lahore. And as a kid shifted to Calcutta, and he and my mom, you know, met in college and had a roaring love affair, which was the talk of the town and parental opposition, and all of that nonsense. And I guess fortunately, or unfortunately, for me, they kind of battled through. In fact, it's an interesting story. My father had, you know, when he graduated, he had sort of options where he had, he had private sector offers, I think from Clarion Advertising, which was then the number one to join the then editor of EPW. And this would have been the mid to early 60s. The then editor of EPW loved something he did. And he said, come and work with me. And one day you will be the editor and all of that. He also I think got a scholarship to Cambridge, Cambridge and whatever, for further studies, but he wanted to marry my mother. And my mother's father said the boy must have a job and a proper job, not some silly private sector job. And what is this going on over the place for studying? So my, so my father decided that, okay, he'll try for the IAS. So without really preparing for it, he gave the entrance exam and go through and voila. And, and the interesting thing is when I asked him about his past, and in fact, at one point, I thought that I should record these memories. So I sat down with a recorder and recorded a couple of hours of me talking to him not for the purpose of publishing anywhere, but just for my own sort of personal memories. And he doesn't really kind of care about his past. Like, you know, when I was going to Pakistan for the cricket tour in 2006, I said, where were you born? You know, should I probably go there? And he said, No, no, don't bother. I don't even remember. It doesn't mean anything to me. So, you know, that's kind of how it was. And I once I've asked him a couple of times about counterfactuals about how his life would have been had he say gone to Cambridge or done this or done that or whatever. And he always kind of hedges and doesn't really give an answer to that. And but anyway, I mean, here I am. So all's well that ended well. The other way to answer that migration question is to also think about it in terms of the mental geographies we inhabit. That while I have, of course, been born and brought up in India and have lived here all my life, the mental geographies I have inhabited, and this would be true much more for millennials here today than perhaps would be people of my generation. But the mental geographies were always Western, in some senses, all the books I read were in English, and they were from all across the world. And all the music I heard was largely American and rock and all of that. And my mental landscapes were mental, my Western, my ways of thinking about the world were Western. So I think that, you know, people in India are a kichri in more ways than just their physical geographies may indicate. And by the way, I want to say, you know, whenever someone asked me to recommend a book that they should read about India, I don't recommend some of the famous books that I've done episodes on, I recommend India Moving by Chinmay Tummey, because I think it's a masterpiece, one of the best books of the last decade. And people haven't heard of it. And that's just such a blooming tragedy. So kindly go and listen to my episode with him because it tells us so much about who we are. It has so many TIL moments. Like, for example, you know, the biggest TIL moment in that episode for me while reading the book, in fact, for me was when he spoke about how the highest amount of migration in India happens when women get married and they leave their parental homes and they go to their marital homes. And most of us won't even and it's invisible, it's invisible. Most of us because we have such a male centric view of the world wouldn't even think of that as migration, right? You know, it just seems so natural. You're going from one home to another home, but it is migration and what are the influences that has and what happens. So it's a wonderful book. I'm sorry, I can't help plugging past episodes and books that I have enjoyed."

        "message": "Well, so like I said, when I was a kid, you know, growing up as a kid in the FBI, where my father was director, I used to watch movies all the time. And at that point, you know, I wanted to be a writer since I was like, four or five years old. But at that point, I said, I also want to be a filmmaker. And my father through his connection said, Listen, you know, after you're done with whatever I can get you admission into the French Film Institute because a director there is a friend and blah, blah, blah, and we can do something and you want to go and I was a lazy bum. I said, I left to learn French. He said, Yes, I said, forget it. I'm cool here. And I didn't go. So, which I have actually not thought about since the time that conversation happened. But since you asked me, I suppose that is one counterfactual. And for what it's worth, I'm still passionate about cinema, but I decided not to follow that path because your creative product is dependent on too many other people and too many things falling into place. And I said, with my writing, I can just turn out books on my own, it doesn't matter. Now it so happens I've been a lazy bum. And I haven't actually written the 15 books I should have by now, though there is time to make up for that. But I don't really have any big counterfactuals. Apart from that, the fact is, I was, you know, if you want to look at counterfactuals, it would not be in terms of opportunities that came to me, but parts that I chose not to chase. So I could have gone, you know, I'm sure I could have gone the IIT IIM way if I wanted to. But I wanted to do arts because I wanted to write at some point. I'm sure if I really wanted to, I could have gone abroad and studied there and made a life there. But when I was young, I had this very rebellious attitude of why should I go abroad, I will do things on my own. And I was very anti the education system, and just anti just all those traditional paths that people take. And, and I don't regret any of that. I mean, if I have any regrets is that I haven't worked hard enough at what I set out to do. But I am convinced that I set out to do the right thing."

        "message": "one of them, which one would it be? Yeah. Lovely questions by both of them. And they're both people who are personally close to me. I respect them a lot and I'm really fond of them. And Prem has been on a couple of episodes and Joy was on a very memorable episode about sports ecosystems where I, you know, the second half of that episode with Joy where he talks about, you know, all the work he did setting up the football under 17 World Cup and all of that was just made me so happy. And it was so inspiring because, you know, I was like, here is another idealistic fool. So someone who's making much more of a difference to the world than I managed to, but just absolutely wonderful people and wonderful episodes. To answer that question, I, you know, the tragedy is, I think none of them mentioned the one thing that I really thought of myself all my life as and which I haven't really done enough of, which is writing novels, writing fiction or literature or whatever. And I haven't done enough of that. And I will at some point do more of that. I've just written one shitty book, as I said, long ago and which was, yeah. So, you know, but out of all of these, look, the early years, like I don't even mention advertising or television on my CV because it just doesn't mean anything to me. It didn't enrich my life, didn't teach me anything. You know, as I think I enjoyed my blogging a lot, because sort of the more you write, you know, writing forces you to think. And, you know, there's something that I talk to my writing students about when I teach writing these days is that there is a two way causal relationship between clear writing and clear thinking. That not just that if you're, you know, it's obvious that if you're a clear thinker, you're more likely to write clearly. But equally, if you force yourself to write clearly in simple language about complex things, you have to think that much deeper about whatever you're writing. And that just improves the way that you think. So I think all that prolific writing that I did in my blogging years was useful to me. I'm kind of, I'm happy with that. But you know, I used to say until recently that there is nothing I have done in my life that I can really be proud of. I think to some extent, now when I think about it, I think the scene in the unseen is I think I've created value. And obviously, it's an ongoing journey, but I'm proud of some of the conversations that I've done. I also think that in what is a very new field, I've been able to sort of gather a certain understanding about a medium which did not exist there earlier, like I'm teaching a podcasting course now. And while preparing for it, so I had a whole bunch of insights, I wrote that down, structured it. And then I thought, let me see what others have taught. And I tried started going through other podcasting courses. And they were all like your basic dummies guide to podcasting kind of thing. These are the kind of mics, this is how you edit, this is how you do and none of the conceptual stuff that I had gathered over all this time. Like why is audio so different as a medium which people don't get so many people think of it as video with visuals, but it is incredibly different in every way. Why are podcasts so different from radio podcast is not just radio on demand. Like people think of Netflix as TV on demand, and that's correct. But podcasts are much more than radio on demand. And, you know, and some of that also came from my realizing the insane level of engagement with which my listeners have with the show, and the sense that many of them have that this means something to them that they have a stake in it, you know, and all of that. So in that sense, I think that, you know, I've kind of the podcasting journey is very interesting, and it's an ongoing one. And I'm sort of enjoying it. But at some point, if I had to give up any of them, look at give up the poker years, not because I mean, I took it up because it was a an intellectual challenge and be unlike my other great passion until then, which was writing, I actually saw I could make money off poker. And I did. And one of the reasons I left was that I thought I'd played for a while make a few money and then you know, do my thing. And I found it doesn't really scale that way. You know, you get to a certain point. And after that, it becomes a question of access to bigger games. And it becomes very political in that respect. And also, it destroys your lifestyle because you're playing like, you'll play a 15 hour session, come back, sleep for eight hours, go play another session. And I also found that during those years, I felt like I was getting dumber. Because poker, you have to be obsessive to be good at poker, and you can't do anything else. So I stopped reading books, I stopped hanging out with friends apart from the people I played poker with. And you know, I was reading the biography of some famous poker player of the 70s. And there was a story about how for 20 and he was an American player. And there was a story of how for 20 years, he didn't know who the president of the US was. And I could understand that, because it was just constricting my whole whole world. And I felt my brain and I felt I have to get out. So even though I am not knocking, kind of what I did, going back, if I had to give a piece of advice to my younger self in 2009, it would be no, no, no, don't don't play poker, just just just focus on writing and do your thing. But poker also taught me a lot about the world that I think enriched the way I think about the world. For example, I think of the world much more in probabilistic ways, I recognize the impact of luck in our lives much more, which most people don't. Most people give too much credit to their agency and what they have. You know, they imagine they are responsible for their successes and their failures. And that's true to a very small extent, you know. So when we succeed, we'll tend to let it get to our heads and become arrogant. And when we fail, we let it get ourselves down and it will hurt our self image. And the truth is, in both of those is a lot of luck involved. And part of what you have to do as you go through life is become equanimous about the outcomes of the things that you do and the and the cards that life deals you like in poker, you you know that, you know, it's a game of skill, but the quantum of luck is much higher than in other sports or games of skill. So any single hand will be mostly luck. It's over a long period that the edge, the skill plays out. So you play a hundred thousand two hundred thousand hands. The tragedy is that in life, you cannot do that. In life, you get the cards that you get and it is what it is. But it is still important not to sweat what you cannot control and instead to focus on what you can control, which is you focus on the process or as that great poker player Lord Krishna once said, you know, just do the right thing and don't worry about the fruits of your action."

The book he's written on the Gita Press is just incredible and so eye opening for someone like me. So my life as a poker player would, you know, this gets into odd territory because poker is illegal in India and it's only legal in the offshore casinos of Goa, which is where I first started playing. I think in 2009, I took a holiday to Goa and we went to Casino Royale, the offshore casino there, played a little bit of poker, had beginner's luck, and then decided this is what I want to do. And of course, I didn't know anything about the game then. But as I studied the game, the intellectual challenges overtook me and I kind of loved getting into the math and the game theory and all of that and that sort of changed the way I think about it. And I used to write a column on poker for the Economic Times as well, which I think I wrote 42 installments for them and stopped it at exactly the point where I decided to leave poker. And one of the interesting things about poker is that it is on the intersection of being a serious sport slash science and gambling. So, you know, you might be treating it as a serious sport and a serious science, but there are people who are sitting with you who are essentially just addicted to gambling. They're playing it for the dopamine rushes. And I wrote columns about this as well. It's, you know, the way the, I mean, gambling addiction in biochemical terms is, you know, the same as addiction to alcohol or cigarettes or whatever you take a puff or you drink a peg, you get that dopamine rush. It's a similar thing with sort of gambling. And that led to this period of frustration where I felt that what is the point of my skill? It's I'm not playing against other people who are also treating it as a serious skill and as a game theoretical thing. I am playing it with people. And by this, I mean, in the underground cash games that I used to play in Mumbai and around who are just sitting off, you know, have no idea what they're doing. And eventually, it's all going to come to us. And I remember there was me and a very close friend of mine who's also pro and a really good player and who's gone on to do phenomenally well in the last five years since I left, though not because I left, but in general. So he and I were at a game together in Vashi. And there was a third person in the game after the whole game had wound up and he was a big builder there and he was high on cocaine and he will just every hand he would just, you know, push a ton of chips and huge amounts of money blind without looking at his cards. So it's only a matter of time, right? And then we are driving back and both my friend and I, his name is Jagdeep and both Jagdeep and I were, we didn't feel good about the whole thing. And we were like that, what is the difference between us and drug dealers? It almost feels like we're exploiting someone's addiction. So there was that aspect of it where, as you would know, I keep talking about all how all human interactions are positive, some interactions, right? So if I create a podcast and someone listens to it, and like every interaction that takes place is a double thank you moment, both people benefit, which is why they say thank you to each other. Poker is not like that, right? It's a zero sum game. And you know, considering that if you're playing at a place where the game is being great, it's actually a negative sum game. And you only win when someone else loses. And someone else losing is not just someone else losing someone else losing means their sort of lives could just fall apart. And I've seen that happening to people. I've tried to make interventions in the case of two friends of mine who were addicted to gambling. And I remember, you know, I mean, there are just very sad stories. I don't want to get into them right now. But one thing you realize is that interventions don't help. And people might rationally realize that they're addicted to something, but they can't help themselves. You know, and I, for example, see that, like, I think I might be addicted to social media, for example. So, you know, or maybe addicted to distraction if they can be such a thing. But the bottom line is, I think all of us know this, that we know that I should not, you know, go on Twitter now, or I should not start watching a YouTube video now, because I will go down a rabbit hole and watch 50 of them. But then you just start and, you know, and most of the time, the sort of the impact of harmless addictions like that, as it were, is not such a big deal. Like, when I was trying to wean friends of mine of poker, I'd say just play online chess here, you know, you know, that's a better thing to get addicted to, because you're not losing money, you're losing time. And I've just seen horrendous consequences of this. And it all happens below the surface, you know, the families of people realize what has happened to them, they may try to help them, there's really nothing you can do. It's a downward spiral. And it's horrendous. And that's why, you know, when I started playing poker, I had the impression that the winners stay in the game, the losers leave the game. And over a period of time, what I realized when I was leaving, is that it's the other way around that it's the winners who eventually leave the game, but the losers are addicted, they cannot leave the game. So there are all these aspects. So while I was an evangelist of poker once upon a time, because it's so intellectually stimulating, and all of those things, there is also this other dark, seamy side to it. And you cannot, you know, rationalize that by saying that this is, you know, the voluntary action of consenting adults and all of that, which of course it is, which is why the state should not ban it. But it is nevertheless a social problem. And you would hope that, you know, solutions emerge from within society."

But also, I mean, it's a great episode by itself. But also, she is the publisher at Westland. And as I mentioned in the introduction that they are publishing the four volumes of the scene and the unseen, you know, selected excerpts from conversations I have had, you will have to wait a while Shruti to see if your conversations get featured or not. But yeah, that's, that's a really good question. And it's something that I thought a lot about like, number one, I would venture that many more of us are prone to addiction than we think, except that, you know, in some cases, it may manifest in very overt addiction to either alcohol or drugs or whatever. But there are so many other things that we can get addicted to, like when I, you know, I've done a bunch of episodes with about the Mughal period with say, Manu and Manimugdha and Ira Mukherjee and I need to record with her again soon. She's incredible. And one of the things that keeps coming up again and again, Parvati Sharma also, and one of the things that keeps coming up, Supriya Gandhi recently, and one of the themes that keeps coming up again and again, and all the wonderful books is how so many of these Mughal princes and all that died of alcohol addiction. And the thing is that it just strikes me thinking aloud that that is the only thing you would get addicted to what else are you there's no social media, there's no Twitter, there's no poker, there's no chess. So alcohol is going to be one of the most common ways for affluent people who can afford enough alcohol to get addicted to. But to come back to it, I think, you know, when I was sort of playing poker, I the thought crossed my mind when I decided to leave that I'm a winning player, but it could be the case that I am an addict and a winning player. And what will happen if that is the case, and I am glad to report it wasn't the case. As I left, I had no urge whatsoever to play the game. Like once in a while, I will, you know, watch some interesting poker videos or whatever, you know, just for the intellectual aspect of it, like these days, we're recording on November 10, there's a great match going on between Doug Polk and Daniel Negrano, sort of a heads up grudge match. And I'm a big fan of Doug Polk. And I think he's going to destroy Negrano. So although Negrano in popular circles is much more famous, but he's like the Chetan Bhagat of poker, frankly. So in"

But otherwise, I don't get the itch to play at all, which is great. But I think I might like I play a lot of online chess. I think there is this interesting case that there is an addictive side to my nature. And the question is, what outlet do I give it? And, you know, online chess is an interesting outlet. And I, and I play online chess and chess.com. Like, do you want to find my name there? I play under an avatar. And in fact, I have a girl's avatar. So people keep hitting on me, horny Indian boys keep hitting on me. And also, I probably win more games and I should because of that. But I played at the way the fish used to play poker, the bad players used to play poker, that is that I don't want to improve, I just, I'll play one minute games for timepass, bullet or bullet or blitz games for timepass. And I don't want to improve. So I don't want to work on my game, which is how a lot of people play poker back in the day that they would not improve at all. While you know, the rest of us would study a bit and we would discuss hands with other good players. What were the choices? What do you think his range was? But bad players are just playing for the heck of it. And of course, many bad players will make a show of going through the study, but not actually do any of it. To answer that question, I think I think I am. I don't know if addictive is the right word for it, because it's never gone beyond a certain limit. But I think I am intense, where I'll, you know, get into something and just go all in. Like I've, I went all in on podcasting, I went all in on blogging, and I'll, I'll just go all in into things which is great. But what I need to do is I need to go and you know, with Kartika's encouragement and help, I think I'm on my way to doing that now is go all in on actually writing books, you know, not just a compilation like this is but actually go all in on writing books, because everything that I've gone all in for while rewarding for its own sake and in many other ways, has also sort of distracted me from that thing, which I think is so core to myself as a writer and storyteller. So I need to do a little bit more of that. Yeah."

And it is very hard for you to do things on the side, like you just completely commit. So the the product that comes out of it, whether it's a podcast, whether it's columns, whether it's the blog, it is the quality and the output, it's a function of the fact that you are that immersed, right?

But when I'm enjoying something like you know, like India Uncut or back when I was blogging regularly, or the scene in the unseen or poker, I'll just go all in. But the regret is that the you know, the going all in comes at the expense of something which is, in my case, it's a writing of books like pre poker, I don't really regret the very meandering journey I took because I don't think I had the life experience or the maturity to be able to write good books anyway. But I think I was just kind of getting there when I gave five years to poker. And I think that had had the opportunity cost that I could have written a number of books by now, which I haven't.

There are a lot of very skilled people can't play the bluff. Shane Warne was a master of combining extraordinary skill and bluff. Now, you play poker, and I would imagine not having played it myself, that there is a wonderful interplay of skill and bluff in poker as well. My question is not about that, though. My question is about poker players. Do you find that people who play poker and who therefore are playing the bluff almost every day and playing it with a lot of skill? Do they live life like that as well? Are they do they take chances? Are they gamblers in life? Are they a little edgy? Or is that a persona they put on when they get on to the on to the poker table? Hmm. Love to know."

        "message": "Yeah, that's such a lovely question. And I really enjoy, I've got to, you know, again, a few words about Harsha before I answer this question. My first introduction to audio as someone who did audio, my first attempt at audio was, I was, you know, I traveled to Pakistan with, you know, following the Indian cricket team in 2006. And I was covering it for the Guardian and also writing about it for Crick Info, where I was actually employed at the time. And I also got a side gig where for one of the BBC channels every day, I would have to give a one minute update on what was happening at the time they called me. And if at that, and so I would have my narrative prepared, so many wickets have fallen and all that. But I'm actually watching the match at that point. And if something happened right, then I would have to weave it in, which I found difficult. So I was struggling with that. So Harsha was on the tour as a broadcaster. And at one point, I, you know, I mentioned that I had this problem. And he was so kind. I think if I remember, he sat with me for half an hour told me about the sort of the all the basics of what to do for radio and, you know, really calmed me down and gave me great advice, all of which I have completely forgotten. And I didn't do audio after that for many years. But it speaks to his kindness that he was also such a huge superstar at the time, like you correctly said, and, and such a, you know, a warm and helpful human being. To answer the question, there are different aspects to it. Number one is that as far as what are poker players like, do they also bluff their way through lives? I think the the people who are addicts to poker are also people who are doing all kinds of other gambling. So there would be people who would be constantly on the phone call with bookies betting on cricket betting on this betting on that. And that's the way that they are. The people who were treating it like me were not like that, number one. But number two, the thing about bluffing is that has the sort of has a deal that when you're bluffing, you're playing a game of probabilities. For example, I hope I don't get too technical here, but I'll try and kind of explain the way to think about bluffing. Let's say that if there is a pot on the river with 1000 rupees, right? So I bet 500 rupees into it. Okay, now there's 1500 in the pot to win that 1500 you have to call 500 bucks, right? So you are getting three to one odds, which means that you have to be right one in four times for your call to be correct. Right? Which means that optimally, I have to be bluffing there one in four times. And the rest of the time I have to have value bets. If either of us deviates from these percentages, they are making a mistake and they will lose in the long run. So the result is that if you do not, if somebody never bluffs and they are betting a value hand 100% of the time, two things happen. One is you don't get enough value hands in poker, so you will not win enough hands. But more importantly, your opponent will see that you are never bluffing and therefore they will always fall to your bet. So you're never going to make enough money. So therefore, bluffing is not something that is any different from any other kind of bet that you're trying to fool someone. It's just something that mathematically you have to throw in for your poker to be profitable in the long run. And you throw it in depending on a variety of factors like how you are building your ranges and how your sort of whole thinking about the game is. In fact, you know, what is known as like there are two and this is another interesting thing to note is that people think that tells count that, you know, in movies they'll show that somebody bluffs and then he's completely still all over and the other guy looks at him and he'll see a vein popping somewhere and he'll be like, ha, he's bluffing, call, call. But in real life, actually, that once you pass a certain level of poker, it doesn't matter. Good players won't even look for tells. It's all about the math. And there are two things come in in poker. There are two kinds of sort of poker that you can play. One is exploitative poker, where you try to exploit a mistake the other person is making. So if they call too much, you value bet more. If they fold too much, you bluff more, you adjust according to that. The other is game theory optimal poker, like in the example I pointed out, where it doesn't matter what he does, you get your frequencies right. So if you bet 500 into 1000 to a river and you give him 3 to 1 odds, you build your range in such a way that you have that percentage of bluffs and that percentage of value hands. And then in the long run, you cannot lose. If he deviates, he loses by either calling too much or folding too much, but you cannot lose. So if you play game theory optimal poker, it doesn't matter what the opponent does. You don't need to look at him. It doesn't matter what his tendencies are. Now, obviously, game theoretical optimal poker is a theoretical construct. No human being can possibly play it perfectly. But the better you have an idea of what GTO poker might be, the better you will be at spotting mistakes that the other person makes and therefore exploiting them. Now, the fascinating thing, in fact, about this duck poke versus Daniel Negrano match that I'm kind of talking about is duck. So Daniel Negrano is an old school poker player who plays exploitative poker. He'll sit at the table and he'll stare at your neck and he'll look for bluffs and he'll kind of do all of that. And it's all a lot of psychology and all that. Duck poke is a new computer generation player who basically at one point in time was the best heads up cash game player in the world. And he's completely into GTO stands for game theory optimal. And he's completely into game theory optimal poker. And he had an incredible video channel, which sadly started after I left poker, where he would, you know, talk about different hands from a GTO perspective and just really mind blowing and educative. Though he retired from poker at a particular point in time, but he had once mocked Negrano and they had this feud going on. And it was a feud about ideas. Like one of them said rake is good. The other one said too much rake is bad. There should be a limit. This guy said no more rake is good and blah, blah, blah. So they had a battle over ideas, but being macho, they decided to settle it over the field. And so therefore, they are now having a challenge match, which is 25,000 hands. And at the time of speaking, I think only 1000 hands are over and poke is already up. I think $250,000 or something. And the other board deposited a million each to begin with, though I think if Negrano goes all the way, he'll end up depositing more and losing more. So it's like new school versus old school. But anyway, regardless, I think the idea that most people have of poker that is that is a of exploitative poker. And B, I think they overplay the psychological and the tell aspects and the bluffing aspects. And as far as bluffing is concerned, the way you think of it is you have a range for every particular situation, whether you're calling or you're betting, and you play with that range. And that range will include both value hands and bluffs. So when you psychologically when you think about it, you're betting with that range and it doesn't really matter, you're playing correctly. And, you know, equally when somebody else is playing against me, if that person is a competent person, I'm thinking of their range in my range in that spot. And, you know, playing accordingly and all of that and I don't really want to get into poker theory here. But I'll say that those typical popular culture stereotypes of poker players are, you know, where those stereotypes are of these dynamic people wearing, you know, sunflower shirts and dark glasses and doing flamboyant things and all of that. I think that's completely false. But where it comes to geeks who are sitting in front of a computer and, you know, I have known of people who play 24 hour sessions and they'll have a bottle near them so they can pee into it because they're playing 20 tables at a time and they don't want to get up to go to the loo. That's true."

You're just hanging out and you're playing a game. Right. So to me, it seems like the element of surprise or bluff can have a lot of value there in this one time game or in a new interaction. But in the repeated game, it doesn't. Right. As you just pointed out, that other things take over. So now I'm going to ask you, Harsha's question from that point of view, when you meet people the first time, do you hold your cards close to your chest? Are you able to like sort of, you know, bluff easily? Not in the sense of telling lies, but in the sense of, you know, just being polite and not getting too much into it or not letting them know exactly what you're thinking.

And I love that that particular one of the thinking man. In fact, one of my favorite places in the world is the Rodin Museum and the sculpture garden in Paris. So I'm really thrilled about that."

Because I talk about how editing and writing are basically the same thing. And the example I give is of Rodin coming up with the thinker where when he conceived of the thinker, he's not creating it out of thin air. He's taking a block of stone and then he's editing that block of stone. So writing and editing really amount to the same thing. So Rodin comes up there as well, you'll be pleased to know."

But but you know, it's going to be soon for the rest of you who are listening in India. Well, you're lucky. Right. I want to now start talking a little bit about the podcast. So I want to start right at the beginning. What made you start the scene and the unseen?"

        "time": "01:20:24.360",
        "message": "Yeah. So I mean, like I sort of mentioned in the intro, what really happened was that this friend of mine called Amit Doshi, who runs IBM podcasts, podcasting network approached me and said, Will you do something with us? And I said, Oh, I don't listen to podcasts. I can't think of anything. Listen, I have this interesting idea for which I could thought I'll someday do a YouTube show of called the seed and the unseen, which is about the unintended consequences of public policy. So he liked the name, he liked the concept, he said, Let's do that. And that's that was really the concept behind the show that you take a little bit of piece of public policy and you talk about that. In fact, we we did pilot episodes on the minimum wage, but I never ended up ever doing an episode on the minimum wage, which is interesting because it moved away from public policy and became more about, you know, these deep dive interviews into ideas and lives and history and so on and so forth. So what what really happened then was that over a period of time, it just evolved along with my own intellectual curiosity and the journeys I wanted to take. And I figured out that, you know, longer is better. And I learned a number of different things about audio along the way, which, you know, I've explored a great length in my podcasting course, but I'll briefly sort of go over some of that. One is that audio is different from other mediums because of the way people consume it. Like if you're watching a YouTube video, it's probably on your laptop or phone and you can click away to another tab or look away or press the back button or whatever. People will typically consume audio when they are either commuting, working out or doing errands, like washing dishes, for example, which was a use case for so many of us during the lockdown. Now, what that means is that either a captive audience have chosen to be a captive audience and not going to be distracted. The primary thing they are doing is something else, but it's automatic. It doesn't require the brain. So therefore they are sort of listening. Secondly, which is very different, right? Because in no other thing, you have a captive audience like this. It's only audio. Secondly, people are listening at higher speeds. And the reason for this is that while our brain can allow us to speak at a natural rate of between 150 to 200 words up to 225, we can listen from 275 to 500, which is why, you know, it's difficult to hold someone's attention when you're talking to them because they've got spare attentional capacity and they can do other things while they're listening to you, which is also why people can listen at higher speeds because they can actually take it in. So it's not like squeaky squeaky. It normalizes very fast. People will take it to 1.25, 1.5 and it will just normalize. And so these two things are coming together. It's passive listening. They're listening while doing something else. So they're a captive audience and they're listening at double speed. So when you do a 20 minute episode, by the time the guy has put his shoelaces on to go jogging, which might take 10 minutes, the episode is over. Right. So when I started kind of working out and listening to podcasts at the same time, I realized that if I'm out for an hour, a two hour episode is perfect for me. The third sort of learning that comes from this is that people have great hunger and desire to for deep content that typically, you know, first of all, it is true in a sense that we live in the age of short, the short attention span, but the opposite is also true. And it is not true that there are shallow people and there are deep people. It is that we contain multitude. So within each of us, there is a shallow me and a deep me. And you know, so the shallow me might be surfing TV channels or, you know, I'll have 50 tabs open on Chrome at the same time. But the deep me also craves deep learning and deep knowledge. Now, the thing is, many of us may not have the time to actually listen to books in our daily lives. How much time do we have? How much time are we going to devote to reading? But because we listen to audio while doing something else, we are more likely to take in knowledge that way, which is why I often say that, you know, audio books and printed books are not really competing with each other. They're entirely different use cases. So a lot of people, therefore, like getting their sort of deep sense or rather fulfill their hunger for depth by listening to audio, whether it's audio books or podcasts. Now, this is one aspect of it. Now, the thing is that, as I said earlier, podcasts are different from radio. It's not just radio on demand. And there's a reason for that as well, which is that let's think about this concept of space in media. Let's for a moment, look at visual media, that when you go to a cinema theater to watch a movie, there's a certain distance between you and the screen. And similarly, on the other side of the screen, there's a certain distance between the camera and the actors. You know, they are much further away. Then when you come to the television age, you're in your living room and the TV is across the room, it's a couple of meters away, and there's a distance between you and the TV. And similarly, the shot on the TV has become closer and you have sitcoms and everybody's in a room and it's closer. Similarly, if you're watching a YouTube video on your laptop, if it's a made for YouTube video, again, the two distances correlate to each other. Now, think of the distance in terms of audio that when you're listening to radio, say you're in your car or whatever, and you're listening to radio, there is a certain distance, but podcasts are in your head. They're literally in your head. It's the most intimate medium that there is. It's a one-on-one conversation. And this is a reason, this is a critical reason why, a critical difference between podcasts and radio, that in radio, in a sense, you're broadcasting, you're speaking to many people. In audio, you're not doing that. You're speaking to one person. So you can take that tone, which is why I say that many of the qualities that make for good radio, like, oh, radio voice and diction and you must speak like this, do not apply to podcasts at all. You don't need a good voice. You don't need an accent. You don't, it's an intimate one-on-one conversation, which, you know, makes it such an incredible medium. And, and, and when you're listening to people for like two hours a week, three hours a week, or whatever, when you do with a long episodes, then you have that sense of relating to that person, also trusting that person, respecting that all of those things, you know, all the podcasts that I listened to, you know, you and I both, you know, admire someone like Russ Roberts, or we'll listen to Tyler Carvin, who you're fortunate enough to work with and meet regularly. And, you know, so there is, you feel like you have a stake in those shows. It's not just their shows, it's also your show, in a sense of speaking, and they are merely the custodians of it in a manner and podcasts have that kind of intimacy, which makes it such a such a sort of remarkable and special medium."

        "message": "Absolutely. You know, it's, like I said, at the beginning of the show, I was a bit of a naysayer initially, because I just couldn't imagine why anyone would find it interesting to hear me and Amit speak to each other, because we talk like this with each other all the time. And we were like, now we're just recording it. Like, there's no music, there's no script, there's no jokes, there's no punchline. So I was a big, you know, critic in the beginning. But over the 199 episodes, and I've been on the show more than a dozen times, ha, take that Vivek Kaur, but I've been on the show, you know, a number of times. And when I have come to India, and I have met people who know me through the show, and that number keeps increasing, they will literally quote things I have said in the show back to me, which I'm always just, you know, so surprised by one because I never I don't like listening to my own voice. I've never heard any of the episodes you and I have done with each other. And second, I just don't remember them. Like, you know, I'm in that moment, I'm having that conversation with you. And I don't remember exactly what I said, I've had a couple of people correct me, you know, you said this, and we went and looked this up. But you know, it's actually that. And I find that really incredible one that someone would care so deeply, they would remember things one said they would quote one back to oneself, you know, things like that. But the other part of it was also that we live in the information age, but there is almost too much information, right. And in that sense, what you bring to the table, aside from the intimate conversation is, you are curating, I know that it's the other person living in your household, who is the curator, but you are also an intellectual curator of sorts, right? Like you, you are really reading so much and cherry picking and presenting and saying, Hey, you one really must reach in my book, right? Or one must really read this thing about the Gita Press that no one may have heard of before that. So in that sense, a lot of people are also listening, not because of I mean, in addition to the things you mentioned, it is passive, it doesn't compete. But it's because they may not know what to read yet. Right? Because they may not have had time to go to the bookstore or browse, you know, do things like what you and I do, or, in your case, in my case, we're particularly privileged because we get early manuscripts of people's, you know, working drafts, I routinely get review copies from book publishers. So you and I get to read very differently sample very differently for most people. And that is also something I learned about the show that Amit Verma is not just someone they listen to for information. It's also someone they listen to, to tell them what is worth listening to what is worth reading, what is worth thinking about in the world. And I don't think that can be done quite as easily in the written format. You know, you can put out a blog post on India uncut tomorrow, 20 books, one must read today, it will have nowhere close to the impact that discussing those 20 books over, you know, the podcast medium has, I'll tell you why."

        "message": "I mean, one reason, of course, is that I'm sort of, I kind of follow my own intellectual journey. And, you know, just take the listeners along with that. So I'm not really thinking that I'm not thinking of it as a curatorial function, I'm following my own journey. And that curatorial thing becomes a default thing. But the other aspect is that, you know, you read a book review, what is it, it's 800 words, you know, even if you read a long essay on a book, a long read on a book, it's like 3-4,000-5,000, whatever, that's, that's about it. But a scene in the unseen episode can be, you know, is usually over 20-25,000 words, which are consuming in a short period of time, like my episode with Karthik Muralidharan was not just the longest episode of the scene in the unseen so far, maybe this will break that record. But it was also, he speaks at 1.5x, right? And so I got that episode transcribed, and it was 43,000 words. Now, where are you going to get 43,000 words of directed conversation? Not just a person talking, but a conversation that is directed in interesting directions and so on and so forth. And that's, again, something that makes podcasting different from radio. Radio, because of all the imperatives, has to stay broad and shallow. You've paid a license fee, you've got a radio station, one, you have you recoup your money through advertising. So you go for lowest common denominator, which is why FM in India is so horrendously bad. But even otherwise, even if there were no entry barriers, you are catering to broad audiences. And therefore you can't go too deep, like who's interested in an argument on how India's First Amendment came about, and all of those things. You'd rather talk about Bollywood and cricket and gossip and all of that. Podcasting allows you to go deep to find what Kevin Kelly calls a thousand true fans, that there are plenty of people out there who are interested in deep knowledge, interested in books. Maybe they don't know where to look. Maybe they don't know there are others like them, you know, and maybe they don't. And suddenly you give them access to these kind of discussions with the author. And not just those, you know, every author that I've spoken to will probably have videos on YouTube where somebody speaks to them for 20 minutes or 30 minutes or even an hour. And I find them incredibly shallow. All these lit fests, they have these, you know, these panels where you'll have a one hour session and 40 minutes, you'll talk to four authors and then have Q&A. And that's incredibly shallow. You're not going deep at all. And the way I think of my podcasting is one, I want to go deep and two, I don't want to follow the news cycle. Like even if I cover something that is in the news, I'll wait for a period of time. And like my two most popular episodes, I was Srinath Raghavan on Kashmir and the CAA. And in both of those cases, I didn't release them immediately when the event happened. It took a couple of weeks. And I think they're like definitive and classic episodes. You can listen to 30 years from now. And my aim with everything that I do is I'm not just sort of going across space in terms of people across the world listen to me. I want to go across time. I want someone 30 years later to binge on my show. You know, when you were starting your Ideas of India podcast, one of the pieces of advice I gave you was that, you know, do not think of what your listener will hear on episode one, think of what they will binge on episode 100, you know, and you want to create that for them, you want to create that body of work. So that was sort of my ethic towards podcasting and, and why it is so incredibly, you know, exciting, because, you know, you can do all of these things."

        "message": "No, it's, it's amazing. I think one, you've also sort of cracked open the podcast space, especially something which is not cricket or Bollywood, you know, the usual suspects of mass podcasting. But the other is you have also sort of, I think, set the template or become the role model in one sense, right? I'm, of course, in a particularly privileged position that if I'm starting a podcast, I can pick up my phone call Amit Verma and say, hey, I'm thinking about doing this, what do you think I should do? But for most others, they've sort of started many, many of our common friends, in fact, has started their podcast. And a lot of their template or the way they think about it has been informed by how you think about it or how people engage with you. There were two pieces of advice that you gave me three pieces of advice, actually, which really stuck with me. And one was you said be yourself, because it is exhausting to be anyone else. And you can't sustain it. And that is, in one sense, the only secret sauce that one brings to the table, right, which is it becoming, of course, to hear all these different episodes, some are coming just for CAA, some are coming to hear Manu Pillai. But the people who are coming over and over again are coming for Amit Verma or are coming for Shruti Rajagopalan as, as you know, you were talking about me. The second was the thing you said about think about creating a bank of knowledge, you know, over a period of time. But the third thing is something I have imbibed from you, not because you specifically said it to me, but just by looking at your journey. You were talking about how you were frustrated, you know, at various points, is this really worth doing? It takes just an enormous amount of work to put together, there's no infrastructure, there is no money in it, and so on, so forth. And I realized that, you know, many people say you did it for the love of doing it. I think this whole love business is, you know, it's a little bit overdone. I think what the reason you did it is that you also converted it into a consumption good for yourself. Right? If I do a podcast with Karthik Muralidharan, I must inform myself on the education system in India. And that is something that's going to broaden the horizon. And then I'll speak with Karthik. And of course, Karthik will crack open anyone's brain and, you know, broaden their horizons, and so on, so forth. And that is something I follow to the T, I've only done single digit, you know, episode numbers so far. But I treat it as a consumption good that even if there were zero people listening to the show, I get enough out of doing each show and having each conversation that, you know, even if no one tuned in, I would walk away pretty happy. And once again, we are in privileged positions where we don't need to do this for money, of course. So there's that. But I think these are three bits of advice that I got from you, which, you know, for the podcasters who are listening out there, that were just incredibly useful. The fourth one came from my producer, Jeff. And you know, this is also a bit of the culture at Mercatus, which is that we won't look in metrics. I actually have no clue other than the first episode, how many downloads or listens my podcast got, and so on. And the rule is that I won't ask and that he won't tell me until we're about, you know, six, seven months in, at which point, you know, we can have a little bit of information. And the goal is that, you know, the tail doesn't wag the dog, which is also something I learned from you. Don't worry about the numbers. Don't worry about what is going on. Even if the numbers are very few, you have 1000 genuine fans and so on and so forth."

And the quality and the amount of feedback I get is enough to you know, tell me that it's kind of really worth it. Just to sort of elaborate on the two other pieces of advice you pointed out. One as far as you know, you know, I tell keep telling my writing students don't use jargon and you're just saying consumption goods and all of that. No, I think I think one of the byproducts of my podcast is certainly that I enrich myself intellectually in terms of what I'm reading and in terms of the knowledge I'm taking in. And I appreciate that. But that's not the reason I'm doing it because it's a byproduct. And I the reason I do it is to be able to have these great conversations, but it's a great byproduct. And it's a good reason to do it if you know that matters. But the other one is also so important. Like I'm teaching this podcasting course. And one of the things I point out is, you know, people will get too obsessed with, you know, where is a gap in the market and what is a hole that I can fill in all of those things. And I'm like, don't be market obsessed. Because no matter what you try to do, like, you know, there are interview podcasts are a dime a dozen interview podcasts with public policy. People are a dime a dozen. There are 7 billion people on this planet. There are already more than a million podcasts. Everything's been done. All ideas are out there. Even if you find a gap in the market, 20 people will fill it for you. What makes your podcast unique? Only one thing makes it unique. And that's you. Because nobody else is you and you are you. So what I therefore try to do is I'm following my own intellectual journey. I'm thinking aloud, I am almost having no filter, in that sense, that, you know, you can listen to something I said in a past episode, which, you know, and say that, hey, but you know, that's such a silly line to go down on. And I have often changed my mind while thinking aloud over the course of all the episodes that I've done. So yeah, I think that's, you know, as far as podcasting advice goes, that's, in fact, number one on my list that be authentic to yourself. That's the only thing that gives you a shot. And then what you end up with will at least be meaningful and valuable to you to that one person rather than to nobody"

        "message": "not when you meet them over lunch? Yeah, I think, you know, the thing is, Stephen Covey once said that we don't listen to understand, we listen to respond. And I think there's a profound point there in the sense that that is almost Kantian in a sense, you know, where, you know, Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative warns against treating other people as a means to an end. Now, there is a sort of a larger conversation to be had here about do we do that in our lives, is everyone a means to a particular end? And I don't have a good answer for that. And I think much of the time that is the case, even if we think that should not be the case, it is the case. But I think that becoming aware of this can enrich our lives, treating other people as people with agency and an individuality and respecting them for that can enrich our lives. And part of how you do that is through listening, where, you know, if you are listening to respond, you're listening for reasons of self aggrandizement that you want to respond because you want to win a point or you want to show people who might be listening, how smart you are and all of that. And therefore, I made a conscious decision that I am not going to do that I am going to give the person I am talking to maximum respect because it is also true that no matter how knowledgeable I might be, or how intelligent I might be, every single person in the 7 billion plus in the world knows something that I don't. And therefore, my life can be better off if I can get them to share it with me. And so you have to give that respect to everyone, even someone you disagree with. So some of the sort of principles that I've come up with, therefore, is that you never interrupt, right? You know, I just want them to go with the flow of thinking. I don't like to sort of, I will not interrupt them at any point. And it's very rare when I do that when there is an interjection that must be made. And I will then guide them back to whatever they were talking about or whatever. But I might disagree very strongly or I might have something to say, even if they go on for 20-30 minutes, I will write down the points I want to make and I will make them sequentially later. So I will often say, when my turn comes, that okay, I have three responses to that. And I'll go through them one, two, three, because I'm also writing down and taking notes. But I will never interrupt, I let them go where they want. The other sort of trick to avoid is sort of when you have a list of questions prepared, and then you want to follow that order. So the other person is talking, but you've already tuned off and you're thinking of the segue into your next question, and you go down to that. And I like the conversation to flow in a natural way. And to make sure that doesn't happen. So obviously, I have really exhaustive notes. And I do sort of cover a lot of ground in those notes. And I know what are the themes I want to cover, and I make sure I cover them all, or as many as I can have the broader themes. But I don't try to force the order, I like to keep the flow of the conversation going. If they say something interesting, I can pick up on that and we can go a little further. And that's what I aim for. And I've been you know, because I teach this podcasting course, and we are recording this on the 10th, this Sunday, on the 15th, a week before the episode releases, I'll be giving my second webinar, which is also about talking about interviewing at much length. So I've been thinking about how different interviewers do this stuff. You know, Joe Rogan, Russ Roberts, Tyler Cowen, Sam Harris, the some of the people I've, you know, listened to and admired their craft for different reasons. And it's really interesting. And I think I'm most similar, of course, to Russ and I agree with you, that's a beautiful episode, it just warmed my heart to record it. And I think, you know, Russ felt similarly about it. And it was just a lovely episode on conversation. But that's also partly because I think we have the same sort of ethic towards conversation. I wish the shows were much longer, which is, I think, the one fundamental difference between us that we're both very respectful of the guest and we are trying to unpeel the layers. But you know, while we both go around as deep, I probably go broader, because I have that much more time to play with. And Sam Harris is a little different Joe Rogan is, you know, extremely different in different ways. And Tyler is brilliant, because he can ask things that I can't even think of, which, you know, questions and areas that I can't even conceive of. And I'm just wow at the question, you know, the question alone, sort of enlightens you in many ways. But I think what he also does is that he doesn't go enough with the flow of the conversation, where he will have a sequential list of things he wants to cover. And so that's a style. And it's a great show conversations with Tyler, these are different sort of styles. So you have to figure out what works for you, because you're being authentic to yourself. And I found that this worked the best for me to don't interrupt, give them the space, don't look for gotcha moments, right? I don't need to show off how smart I am. So I'm not going to, you know, keep interrupting to show off my cleverness or that I have done my research or whatever, I'm not going to look for gotcha moments that on, you know, last year, at so and so it's a time you said this, now you're saying this, because I don't want the conversation to be adversarial, because I want them to come relax to at the level where they are much more open and honest in sharing their thoughts and their ideas with me. And it's important not to so even when I, for example, disagree with someone, I will, I always state my disagreements, people don't realize this, because I'm being very polite, and we're not used to politeness on social media disagreements and all of that. But I state my disagreements, but I don't push the point. So you know, in fact, people have, I don't know if you're one of them, but people gave me feedback on the Arvind Subramanian episode that I didn't push back enough. And the thing is, I stated my disagreements. But then I don't want to push back and say, no, you didn't answer this properly. Or what about this? Or what about that? Because I don't want it to be adversarial. I'm happy to let the listener make up their own mind about what I asked and what he said. But beyond that, I see no point in litigating something beyond the point in time. And I also think that it's a little disrespectful that when the person has been generous enough with their time and their, you know, with the insights, and you cannot take that generosity for granted, to then disrespect that by, you know, taking it into other directions and showing how smart you are and all that. I'm saying, my philosophy is you take in all that you can from the conversation and whatever the disagreements are, you state them politely, and let the listeners sort of make up their own mind, which is why so many people have disagreed with, have come back on the show very often, because they enjoy that as well, given the take. So yeah."

Your show is not about holding public officeholders accountable, right? This is not primetime television. Or this is not, you know, you are not, as you said, litigating. The purpose of your show is to educate, you know, both oneself and, you know, the broader audience. And that's, of course, the larger point of it. But also in that immediate moment, be in that moment, right? Treat the other person, look in their eye, have that conversation, learn something from each other, have the benefit of spontaneity, that the conversation may take your mind to a place that you've never been to before. So it's not so much that I think interruptions are bad or having prepared questions are bad. It's just that it doesn't fit with the goal that you have in mind, right? Which is to see where this conversation might take you. And you can do that, because the guests on the show are so high quality, that they need very little, you know, direction or interruption and things like that. So I don't know if what you do and what Rusts does can be done by many other people with many other guests. But for the kind of purpose that you have in mind, I think the format just works beautifully. And also too few people, as you said, the end goal is usually to can an episode in a particular way. That's the other thing I learned from you. I am exactly like you, I prepare a lot of notes, I go in with like 20 pages of notes for each episode. But I actually don't, you know, prep questions or read out questions, I'll usually have my first question in mind. But other than that, it's like, you know, usually cracked open. And that's another thing I've learned from you. And I think the joy of that, for me, has been leaving myself open to be surprised in a way that it is impossible to be surprised if you go with a very"

        "message": "since I got into the long form conversation, I think, see, the thing is, the challenge of doing a three hour conversation is exponentially tougher than say, a half an hour conversation. It's not that you need six times as much research, it's just exponentially tougher. So what I try to do is I try to like, first of all, of course, there is a selection bias in that I'm choosing subjects which are already interesting to me. So I'm likely to have already read books on them and have a certain amount of background information. But otherwise, the thing is, like, if I'm talking to an author, I will obviously read all his books. Like last week, my episode 199 was with Ambi Parmeswaran. And so I read five books by him. And he's actually written 10. But the other five are like case studies and things like that. So I read five books by him, watched a bunch of YouTube videos, took a lot of notes, all of that you want to read around the subject. Like for a long time, I wanted to do episodes on Gandhi with Ram Guha. And I read more than 30 books on Gandhi. But the thing is, many of them are already read, they're not specifically for the episode. So besides his own two books on Gandhi, I read a whole bunch else. And some of them I, you know, did a reread skim when the time for the episode came about. So I've often had 20-30 pages of notes on Microsoft Word for a particular episode. I have just recently discovered this app called Roam Research. And that's amazing, because it allows you to categorize and have nested queries and bidirectional linking. And so for the last two, three episodes, I've used that and really enjoyed that. So which is much better than, you know, Microsoft Word, where everything is one long list, and you bolded the parts. But when you have 20 pages of notes, it's like, very difficult also that when you're at the start of the show, somebody may mention, you know, some subject, which you know, your 25th question is about or roundabouts there. So you're quickly scrolling to it, because while it's been mentioned, you want to quote that relevant bit from that relevant book. And that's far easier in Roam Research. And, you know, all of that. So I put in a lot of research. And the idea is not so much to ask about all of those things. But because I think you need that background information, that I need, if I'm talking to someone who's going to give me deep knowledge on a subject, I need a certain baseline of knowledge myself, to be able to take the conversation to those sort of interesting places like in Akshaya's case is not just reading Akshaya's books, but I also have to have some awareness of the history of that time and how the Indian freedom movement was shaping up. And, you know, all of those other kinds of things. Despite that, I must say that Akshaya's book is just such a eye opener for me, because there are so many things that I didn't know in that, which is why such a remarkable book, there are very few books, which, you know, have so many TIL moments, especially about one's own country. So yeah, so I put in a lot of work into research, which is rewarding for its own sake, I feel like I know the subject much better. But I often, you know, at my age, I'm in my mid 40s, almost touching 47 next month. So I sort of, so I forget a lot. So I forget what I've discussed in, you know, 30 episodes ago with somebody or whatever. But the point is that, you know, at some level, you've internalized aspects of the knowledge and that informs your worldview and your views on things to some extent. So So yeah, but I think I think that in a sense, the one unintended consequence, the unseen effect, as it were, of the show on my life, is to just really kickstart my reading habit again, and make me read a lot more. And because of that, think much more deeply about knowledge management. Like I was, you know, when I was doing the last class for my podcasting course, somebody also said I should sort of one day teach a course on knowledge management. I don't know if someone will be interested in that or not. But I've been getting into that because I think one of the great challenges I face is that when you're exposing yourself to a lot of knowledge, how do you sort of say build a second brain, so to say in, you know, Tiago Forte's words so that, you know, that knowledge is sort of systemized, and it's not just diffused and lost and all of that. So that's, again, something that I've been thinking about. And I don't imagine I would have been thinking about it so much, had it not been for the work that the scene in the unseen makes me do."

        "message": "You know, knowledge management, there are two parts to it. One is, of course, knowledge management in terms of creating a record of what you're doing, right? I think, in that sense, what you're doing with the four volumes of the scene and the unseen is going to be this incredible, you know, resource, especially because unlike me, you don't put out the full transcript, right? So it's hard for people to go back and look up things or, you know, they may want to, but if they didn't have a piece of paper, because they were doing chores, they couldn't get the name of the book down. So I think it's that kind of knowledge management I really believe in, like, you know, just putting a body of work out there. The personal knowledge management, I don't believe in that much. You know, I always tell my students this, my students are always taking copious notes, you know, they're like, what is the best, you know, is Evernote better or Rome research better? By the way, thanks. That's a lifesaver. I just started using it. But I always tell them, think about it, internalize it. If you wanted to find it, just have faith that you will be able to find it. It might take you an extra five minutes in that moment, but you will be able to get it. The reason is now, unlike when you and I were studying in college and things like that, everything is available on the internet. Search functions are so good. You know, our own personal mobile phones and things have started getting search functions. So I think it's just much easier to go back and find something. My worry with knowledge management systems is they are so hard to create and maintain for personal use. I don't know if 95% of that crap I'm ever going to go back and see. Now, of course, if you're doing it for a project like a book or a podcast, it's a little bit different. But I think just like a general personal knowledge management system, I'm I'm not a big fan of it. I think just have faith in your brain and your curiosity and your ability to internalize concepts. And I think, you know, that'll take you quite far."

I think our brain is not meant to retain information in systematic ways. And all of that our brain is meant to be creative and think about stuff, but not really retain information. And I have often find knowledge management to be frustrating. And I'll think of something that someone said and simply not be able to find it at all. Right? And no matter all the search functions and all that. And what I find is that I actually find Rome very helpful. Because what I'll do is every time I come across an interesting quote, maybe in something that I'm reading, I'll just do that bi directional think I'll put double brackets and quote around it. So now I have a page on Rome called quote, which includes all the quotes I've ever, you know, tagged in that way, which is useful. And then within that there'll be other similar things. So like, for example, when I was getting my podcasting course ready, I said, I have to read books on the history of radio, the history of audio, and blah, blah, blah, whole bunch of resources, books, videos, do all of that created a one page for that, then for each of them, I had these nested bits where for each book, there's this nested bit, you click it, it opens out, I have various insights there, I'm sort of linking them to each other. And just in terms of organizing my mind, it was incredibly useful. And during that process, I mean, part of it turned out to be useless, because most of those insights were not at all useful to me. And most of the insights, some of which I've shared here are not something that are actually written anywhere. So you know, it's just coming from my experience. But for other subjects, like when I research for episodes, like when I did the episode with Ambi, I had sort of like I had Ambi Parmeswaran is the name of a page below that I have personal then that's nested, you click on that it opens up it has, you know, which room of Godavari hostel in IIT Madras he was, so then you use little nuggets like that. And then he also relaxes and it takes a nice personal tone. When you bring that in, I had each of his books, I had, you know, separate nested sections for that within that conceptually, I have separate nested sections, I come across interesting quotes, because he uses quotes a lot in his book, they are now part of my larger database of quotes. So it's, so I find it useful for me. But you're right. I mean, you said that is good for projects, but not otherwise. I haven't used it long enough to be able to tell. But I think for individual projects, like for researching for episodes is great. But one of the things I'm going to do now, as I prepare my four anthologies for the seen and the unseen, is the transcripts of all my episodes, when they get to me, I'm going to put them all in Rome research, so that then it becomes really much easier to do that sort of bi-directional sort of forming connections, like I have asked so many times that was a liberal constitution imposed on an illiberal society. And it's very easy for me using tools like this to see how many people have asked it to and just bunch all the answers together and all of that. So I think my brain struggles with the enormous amounts of knowledge out there. And I think finding ways like this to kind of bring it all together is useful."

And it's philosophical, but it's also about a contemporary issue. It's, you know, he's really one of my favorite thinkers. And I was so thrilled when you got him on the scene and the unseen. I heard that episode on, you know, 1x, I didn't speed it up, because I wanted it to just go on as long as it does. And like, enjoy every moment of it.

So one question I've always been meaning to ask you, is you have this great love for literature, and you're one of the most voracious readers of novels that I know of. So if you were doing a seance version of the scene and unseen, and you were inviting back a dead novelist for a conversation, who would that be? And what's the question you would be dying to ask them?"

I think, yeah, I mean, that's, you know, like you said, like, I love Pratap's writing, and he's incredibly thought provoking with everything he writes. And I'm afraid he is thought provoking with his questions as well, because I'll have to think a bit to, you know, come up with this, but I'm really glad I could finally get Pratap on my show. Because you know, it's, you know, when I first started the scene and the unseen, I remember, you know, opening up the notepad on my phone and thinking about who the possible guests would be. And I put five names down, and then I couldn't think of any more. And Pratap was there. So I'm really glad we kind of crossed that one off. And hopefully, he'll be back on my show at some point in time without necessarily having a subject in mind just to sort of shoot the breeze as it were. To answer this question, as far as novelists are concerned, well, you know, I'll cheat a bit, I'll say George Orwell. But what I really love about George, as I said that Shruti held up a piece of paper on which she had written George Orwell, so she guessed it. But again, my admiration for Orwell is not so much for his novels, which is why it is a bit of a cheat, but really his nonfiction writing, especially his remarkable collected essays, which is just so incredible. And every time I'm stuck writing a piece, I'll, you know, open that and read three, four essays by him on whatever subject, it doesn't matter. And just the rhythms of the language that he uses will get my brain working properly again. So I love Orwell. Now, what would I ask him? I think I would ask him that. I mean, he was already, I think by the time he died, disillusioned with the extreme left by that time, even though you could call him a man of the left. And I would ask him that, you know, if he had, presumably, if he comes back in a seance, and as a ghost, he's been witnessing everything that's been happening since in some depth, that has that disillusionment deepened, what does he feel now? And, you know, would he be more likely to agree with his contemporary higher who I don't think that the two ever would have met or known each other or even written about each other. So maybe just use the world because it's interesting seeing his views evolve over a period of time. And I think Orwell was one of the greatest, you know, he threw his novels, he looked into the future. I mean, the warnings against totalitarianism and statism that his novels contain is second to none. And even today, you know, especially people keep talking about 1984. And how, you know, this combination of state power and technology could be bringing about something that makes what was once a dystopian seem not so outlandish after all. And I'd ask a little bit about that, because I think that he would have seen clearly enough to sort of, you know, be able to paint that crisp picture where you realize that this sort of totalitarianism and statism doesn't come either from the left or the right, it comes from both places. And in a sense, it comes from the same instinct of imposing your vision of the world on others. And I'd be very interested in seeing how his thinking would have evolved over these, you know, these sort of last 70 years. But that's a bit of a cheat, because my admiration for Orwell is because of his nonfiction, though I love both 1984 and Animal Farm. So give me a moment, let me think about whether this I am so kicked right now, while you"

I mean, the easy answer and the name that pops to mind, and I hope you haven't written it down and you're going to wave it at the screen in front of me, but you have it ready. Okay. It's probably, I mean, Bastia is obviously, you know, the first name that comes to mind. I mean, the name of my show, the scene in the unseen is inspired by Bastia's great essay, that which is seen and that which is not seen. And his works are remarkable. The law is beautiful. His essays are great. The law is just a masterpiece. And in so many ways, I mean, the law contains so much of what, you know, it almost anticipates public choice theory in so many ways. And also I look at Bastia as, you know, I kind of find there's a certain sense of both tragedy and inspiration there that he spends those last years from forties to, I think he died when he was 49 or 50, much, much like Orwell. And he's essentially fighting a lonely battle that it's inevitable that no one agrees with him, but he's putting his ideas out there because it is important to do so. And in a sense, he's again, not writing across space, he's writing across time, because, which is why someone like me, you know, a century and a half later can be inspired by him. And, you know, of course, I've won two prizes named after him, but that's orthogonal. And, but someone like me can be inspired by him and can, you know, find value in doing just that. And it also tells you that, you know, the fact that that battle was never won that, you know, which he was fighting, which is for individual rights and agency and, you know, controlling the power of the state and even understanding it was something that was never won and may never be won, but you have to keep fighting the good fight and sort of working on that. So I find him inspiring for that reason. The thing is, you know, when you ask a hypothetical question of if you could talk to someone from the past novelist or otherwise, and ask them a question or whatever, the thing is, like I said, I'm so incredibly private and introverted and whatever is that I probably wouldn't want to meet them. I would, I would just, you know, like, what would one say with Bastia? Of course, I'd love to do an episode of the scene and the unseen with Bastia, like what is a French parliament like, do your friends mock you for your views, like my friends mock me, and all of that, you know, and I would have tried to get a human sense of that battle, sort of the loneliness of the battle, because, you know, I can reach out to many other people who think like me across the world, and I have that access and all of that. But, you know, Bastia would not have had that. So then what kind of keeps you going? In a sense, I think I somehow in some strange way managed to make this about me. But yeah, I mean, Bastia is interesting. Adam Smith is, of course, interesting when you just see the sort of the breadth of his work in just those two books, a journey from a theory of moral sentiments to, you know, the wealth of nations, just in sort of that journey and how much he covers. And of course, you know, Russ Roberts, and I spoke a bit about Adam Smith in our episode, and he's written a great, lovely book on Adam Smith, which I recommend everyone goes out and reads. Adam Smith would have been interesting, Locke would have been interesting. You know, and I think had he lived today, he would have refined his ideas to a much finer degree. But to think that a man like that wrote, you know, works like that when he did is just remarkable. Apart from that, yeah, I should, you know, I'll be accused of being non-Sanskari if I can't name Indian figures. I would have loved to hang out with Kabir, just, you know, just, you know, talk about poetry and sort of, you know, how he thinks of language, and how sort of all of those sort of different things. And I haven't done enough episodes on that. I mean, I kind of should, but Kabir would have been fun. Even, you know, I did an episode with Amardeep Singh on the travels of Guru Nanak and Nanak Banti. And Nanak is a very Kabir like figure, a very interesting person, not just someone who founded a religion, but a very interesting, deep thinker. So again, I would have liked to hang out, maybe just be a fly on the wall and maybe travel around a little bit with someone like that, not necessarily do an episode and get gyan, because I think there is something beyond intellectual gyan and just discussing ideas. But, you know, just maybe travel around and, you know, as far as travels are concerned, I am notorious for being the kind of person who, you know, I don't like to walk very much. And I don't, I'm not the explorer kinds. I'm like, you know, book me into a comfortable place. I want to chill and relax, because that is what vacations are for. But I think it would be different if I was hanging out with either Nanak or Kabir or any of these guys. And maybe I'd be live blogging while I was with them. Like, you know, after the tsunami had struck in 2004, I'd, as you'd know, I'd gone along the coast of Tamil Nadu and those were early days in my blog, and I was posting updates every day. And that was in a different way or sort of a very, it was interesting. And I'm glad I did that. It was difficult also, you know, like at Nagapattinam, and I wrote about this for Rediff also, but, you know, just in a field where you have dead bodies all around you and kind of walking through them. And at some point it normalizes in your brain and you don't think of them as, you know, former people, so to say. But it's interesting."

So I got on an unreserved ticket and just went to Tamil Nadu. And then, you know, figured it out from there and joined a volunteer group. And they placed me in a tiny village called Kutty Andir, which is in Nage district. And so not very far from where you were blogging. And your blog was really lovely. It was one of the very few sort of, you know, I mean, now we have all the blogs and the live tweets and all those things going on. But at that time, it was very unique to get that, you know, instant, not just news, but also reflections, you know, that was an odd thing that was going on at the time. So that's how I found you."

And you could make out by the last time on these time pieces across all these villages across the shore, when the waves had hit. And that's so incredibly poignant and almost heartbreaking, because it carries with it the loss of life and the loss of so much, you know, it's just so yeah, and at some level, I wish I'd done a little bit more of that, that kind of reporting. And in that sense, you could say I didn't take the initiative enough in some ways, that I was just like a death bound person per se, which is what I even am for the seen in the unseen, right? I'm just like, you know, sitting in a studio or during the lockdown at a mic in my room, and just talking to people and not really out there.

But there was this one place where the dwelling structure had really caved in. And clearly, someone had been trapped in there, and they hadn't found the body. But obviously, it had decomposed to such an extent that there was a stench. And then, you know, people were called in to move the rubble and things like that. And the only thing that hadn't decomposed was the polyester sari, you know, and the thought that someone's, you know, I mean, this must have cost 100 rupees or less, right.

And then when I was linking that post from my show notes, I went back to all the posts I'd written during that period. And I'd realized and I'd realized how unformed my thinking otherwise was, how naive I was in my faith that, you know, the state could have sorted this out with better regulation, there would have been less life lost, and we needed sterner coastal laws and a bunch of other things, which over time I, you know, I had reason to think about deeper and say that, okay, that was misformed that I just sort of intentions and not probable outcomes and the way the political economy actually works and blah, blah, blah. So it's interesting also to see one's own journey through that past and realize how about, you know, one's opinions were just wrong about so many things, but, you know, and even during the scene in the unseen, I think there's a sort of a mirroring of that where I remember I did that episode with Akar Patel on, you know, the intellectual foundations of Hindutva, which I remember you saying at the time that you really loved that as well. And that was a great episode. But both of us were of the opinion at the time of that episode. And, you know, my view before it, in fact, very firmly was that there is nothing there, there is no intellectual tradition. And whatever claims to be an intellectual tradition is just a cover for a Makota for bigotry and all of those other things. And later in the course of doing episodes with people like Akshay Mukul, you know, that episode then tells you that there is a tradition. And the reason many people like me are missing that tradition is because we read in English, where those arguments aren't made in English, but there is a rich tradition in Hinduism. Now, you may not agree with that intellectual tradition, but it is coherent and cogent and it exists. And, you know, chatting with people like Akshay Mukul and Rahul Verma, and others sort of made me realize that in that regard, I was I was wrong. And I needed to have a more nuanced view. And that that view reflected my own shortcomings as someone who read mainly in English, rather than, you know, something that was actually the truth."

And his newsletter is great, co-written with Raghu Jaitley, whose real name I know, but shall not reveal, though I never met him. Oh, yes. Okay. Oh, really? You didn't know that? Okay. Yes. Yeah, bragging rights. So I have bragging rights. Yeah. So these, these great questions. And I think the short answer to the difference between writing and podcasting is really breadth versus depth, in the sense that, you know, as far as reading, writing is concerned, you can just read a lot. And you can read a lot about a bunch of different subjects, and you can get breadth that way. Whereas the best podcasts go deep into one specific thing. And obviously, if you're listening to different episodes or different podcasts, you're getting a certain amount of breadth that way. But writing doesn't allow you to go as deep as podcasting does. Like I said, my episode with on education with Karthik Muralitharan was 43,000 words when it was transcribed, which at double speed, you could have listened to in one and a half hours. You know, that's almost a short book. That's a monograph. You know, how are you going to consume that and get, you know, that many words, you know, in that much time? And where are you? And that's like a sharp, focused kind of discussion that is happening. You know, an interview of Karthik in a newspaper would be 800 words, even in a long interview in something like caravan would be 7-8000 words at most. And here you have 43,000 words. And I think in one word, I think that's the main difference, which is why one has to sort of embrace length. And I'll pat myself on the back a little bit for this. Because I think when I started growing long, you could say, I shifted the Overton window of length in Indian podcasting, that, you know, now, interviews, which last one, one and a half hours are perfectly common, especially, you know, among the policy podcasts and all of that. And that really wasn't the case. You know, it's like a string that I remember that I just kept lifting it. And I have so many three hour episodes now, including presumably this one by the time it's out, that a one hour episode feels like nothing at all. And I'm sort of happy about that. The other aspect of that, and I don't know what the related stat for other Indian podcasts is, but the one part, I don't look at metrics. But the one interesting metric that I have sort of, that gives me satisfaction about my podcast is that most people listen, most regular listeners listen to podcast apps on listen to podcasts on their podcast apps, while I still get about 30 to 40% of my listens from Chrome, which means that these are not regular listeners from the browser, rather. And this means these are not regular listeners. These are people for whom that episode of mine has acted as a gateway drug of sorts. And that's how they've come into it, which you know, and hopefully I'm kind of, I managed to convert some of them. So that gives me a lot of happiness, because I think the ecosystem is very young. And we are at a stage where nobody's competing with anybody else. We just want to grow the listening habit among people. And we all benefit from that. And that's something that we need. And which is why I go out of my way to help people do podcasts. I've sort of, you know, as the editor of Pragati, I, you know, started the Pragati podcast, which Pawan Srinath does so well. And he did that with Hamsini for a while, she started her own podcast. And so I sort of tried to keep that tradition going. Even now with my podcasting course, what I sort of stressed on in the first class that I did, was that I don't want this to be like taking a gym membership, you know, I want to podcast at the end of this, I want to, you know, so let's work at that. So initially, I thought that the first two webinars, the total three webinars, the first two can be kind of conceptual, and then we get down to the nitty gritties that this is your basic equipment, this is how you record, blah, blah, blah. But I devoted half of my first webinar to the nitty gritties because I said that you got to kind of, you know, get down to it right now that we can't stay at the level of the abstract, we have to get down to the concrete and actually get things done. And I feel strongly about this because, you know, I am in a limited space in the sense that right now podcasts in India seem to be heard a lot by English speaking elites. And I think the real scope is in the languages, because there is so much more hunger for knowledge and information in the languages. If you if you read in English today, you can go on the internet, and the world of knowledge is at your fingertips, you can go to YouTube, watch the best videos, blah, blah, blah. But supply of that kind of knowledge and insight is so limited in the languages. And there is much greater hunger and scope for it. And I'd really like to see young entrepreneurs start podcasts, which may not cater to the same use cases, because beyond a certain class of society, people may not have the time to actually be working out for an hour a day. So when are they going to listen, but, you know, figure out different ways of distributing podcasts, maybe not a podcast app, maybe on WhatsApp, a guy is getting a five minute update every morning in Hindi, which gives perspective on what happened that day, not just news, or things like that, just throw things at the wall, try interesting things. Because that's where I think podcasts will kind of really explode and really make a difference in our society."

Whereas, you know, normally, the only access to these ideas would be through the written word, which is much harder to access if, if your fluency levels are not that high. So I think, even for non English speakers, or those who are perhaps less fluent, I think the podcast medium does something really interesting and really special. And and you told me not to use jargon, you admonished me a few minutes, or was it a few hours ago, I lost track of time. But I think there is some value to that, right?

But no, that's a that's a great point. And that brings me to a related sort of I thought it was little more gentle than scolding. Well, I mean, yeah. So I mean, there are surely simpler synonyms of admonished. So you know, but that's absolutely true. Because you know, a good friend of mine, I don't know if you met him, Yogesh Dashrath, who runs Storytel. Yeah, you haven't met Yogesh. So Yogesh who runs Storytel, and I've done some work for Storytel in the past. And they have this, and it's, you know, sponsored many episodes of the scene and scene in the unseen in the past. So friends of the podcast, in a sense, early sponsors. So Yogesh once told me and they have a great bank of Marathi and Hindi audiobooks. So a lot of the listeners are people who are listening to Marathi and Hindi. In fact, I, you know, I heard Raag Darbari there, because I'd read it in English, and I wanted to read it in Hindi. But I thought, let me listen to it in Hindi and it's such a masterpiece. And he told me that many of those listeners, we think people who listen to audio listen at higher speeds, he said many of his listeners, listen to the English content of Storytel at lower speeds, 0.75, 0.5, because that's how they understand. And that also opened my eyes. And another similar sort of eye opening thing that I learned recently, is that when I heard someone complaining about, oh, Netflix now allows you to play videos slower or faster. And he was appalled by that, because he said, why should someone speed it up or whatever it is made for natural speed. But then I looked into why that was. And I'm very impressed by the reason and why Netflix has done it. And the reason is that when blind people are watching shows, in a sense, they're not really watching the shows, they're listening to a description of what is happening, which is how they consume the content. And they like to speed it up, because they comprehend audio faster. So the higher speeds help blind people watch shows, which is such a, you know, remarkable thing. And what people who can't hear what they do is that they are reading the subtitles, because they can't follow the dialogue. And so they like to slow it down, because it takes them longer to read. So it makes perfect sense. And those of us who can see and hear perfectly well, don't realize this. And we think of our experience of the world as a normal experience. And this is the way things should be. And, you know, so you know, credit to Netflix for building this stuff into the software and just suddenly expanding that universe of content in such a, you know, heartwarming way."

And I'm a professional economist, but there are capabilities I have built, there are words I have learned, there are shorthands I have learned. And I think we don't pay enough attention to this as we communicate, right? And the nicest thing about technology, especially one that is asynchronous, like podcasting, is that people can do this. And they can also do this in the privacy of their own home. Because normally, when we do it in the classroom, when we do community viewing, or community listening, or community education, as we do in schools, people are routinely made fun of for pronouncing a word wrong, or not understanding a question the first time it is posed. Many people who lack fluency skills in a particular language need that question to be posed, maybe multiple times, maybe a little bit more slowly. I mean, for me, when it comes to Tamil, anything other than food needs to be said, you know, a little bit more carefully and gently for me, you know, especially if it's something like economics. And I think that is a lesser appreciated aspect of how podcasting and video streaming can really crack open the education space, even with shows that are not intending to educate, but they can educate because they've built in the infrastructure to do so.

His point was that one, they have paid such license fees that the investment in a TV channel is massive. And two, you know, government regulations have price controls on how much they can charge subscribers. Therefore, the bulk of the revenue comes from advertisers. And so they need to dump it down, which is why you have the shouty nonsense that you see, and which is or Bollywood or Bollywood, which is why all our channels are functioning at a lowest common denominator, and you cannot get into any niche.

Like imagine if they were giving licenses for podcasts. One, I would never have got a license. And two, even if I wouldn't have applied, I wouldn't have applied. And I would never have got one.

And I think it's like 25 hours of content spread over five episodes of five hours each or something like that. And it's just him talking. It's nothing else. There's no sound effects, there's no music, it's just him talking. It's so pure and beautiful and incredible and thought provoking. And that's kind of just brilliant. And I've always since then wanted to do a solo history podcast at some point, but that you know, requires resources far beyond anything I might have right now. So maybe someday in the future. But to answer Kumar's perceptive question, and it's something that I have, you know, we all three of us have lamented this, that our brains are wired in prehistoric times, where we lived in different realities. And therefore, many of the truths about the world, the way it really works are unintuitive. Because, you know, in prehistoric times, we used to live in, you know, where things were scarce, and there was brutal competition, as it were, as Hobbes would put it harsh and brutish competition. And therefore, our brain evolved to think of the world in zero sum ways, that the only way somebody can benefit is if you take it away from somebody else. And we don't intuitively understand the positive some nature of voluntary interaction is what John Strassel calls a double thank you moment, that, you know, when I buy a cup of coffee at a cafe, when the coffee is handed to me, I say thank you. And the person at the other person says thank you. And the thing is, I value the coffee more than the money and they value the money more than the coffee. And it's a mutually beneficial interaction, which is why you know, both of us saying thank you, double thank you moment, it's it's, it's a positive some game. But our brains think of the world in zero sum ways that if the rich are getting richer, the poorer must be getting poorer. And that's a difficult truth to communicate communicating something like spontaneous order is very hard to communicate that you don't need a grand central planner, that really complex systems like evolution, like markets like the like languages cannot happen by central committee, you know, that they, you know, that they happen in different ways. And there's a great episode called the evolution of everything that I read with Matt Ridley, where we spoke about this at some length. So this is a challenge. And I've I've thought about this. And I've recently sort of come to realize that the reason for this also lies in the distinction between the abstract and the concrete, that the reason these things have evolved is that if you're living in a time where you are in a little tribe, and you have to, everything is scarce, then your concrete reality has scarcity in it. And you will see the world in zero sum ways, because that is what you're doing for you to, you know, get the meaty part of that deer, you have to sort of, you know, win it over somebody else, that means someone else doesn't get it, and so on and so forth, that tribes of 100 people are best handled from the top down, perhaps, and spontaneous order is not necessary, because that level of complexity is not there. So I think perhaps the way to getting closer to communicating some of these things is by getting concrete, what is the problem, for example, with concentrated benefits and with concentrated benefits and diffuse costs. Now, I'll quickly go over the concept. And obviously, Shruti, you've thought about it and taught it a million times. But the concept basically is that, let's say in the case of Air India, that every year, Air India basically, a failing dying airline is kept alive by infusions of taxpayers money. And let's say each citizen is paying two rupees for it, I'm just picking a hypothetical number. Now, the point is that the benefit is concentrated, Air India gets it, and therefore they will lobby for it. And they will do all kinds of things. And if the beneficiary was a private party, they would contribute to party coffers, they would buy politicians, all of that, the benefits are concentrated. But the costs are diffused, that all of us are losing only two rupees, it is unseen, we don't even know that we are losing it. And therefore, why should we protest? And this becomes a dilemma. And the problem that therefore arises from this is that how can we therefore make it, you know, make this concrete aspect of the situation more explicit, so that the abstract principle then becomes obvious, and then that kind of comes across like, I remember once in a conversation with Kumar, when we were chatting about this, I spoke about it as flicking a light switch, that, you know, once you flick the switch, and you turn it on, it's fine, the light is there, but you have to flick it. And, you know, even for me, I suffered from all these misconceptions, because that's how we are wired. And then you gradually flick the switches, and you see the world in a different way, because there is that. So as communicators of these ideas, which we care so deeply about, we have to find ways to flick these switches. And we cannot do that at the level of the idea at an abstract level, we can't do that at the level of abstraction, we have to get concrete, and we have to relate it to their own lives. And that becomes a complicated challenge. Like if the garbage outside your house has not been collected, you know, there are so many like you and I had done an episode on urban governance, where we spoke about the disconnect between power and accountability. And, you know, why that affects the governance in our cities. And all of that is abstract. How do you make it real by talking about why the person's garbage outside his house is not being collected? Or why, you know, whatever, whatever problems that citizens face in their everyday lives. And I think as communicators, that is a challenge that we have to sort of communicate at that level and not an abstract level. Because if we just talk about stuff at an abstract level, we will fail utterly. And I think this is something that, you know, the extreme right wing does this very well. They are wrong, but they are wrong in that they talk about concrete things. So they build simple narratives. Like one of the reasons I wrote a column on this once about why Trump succeeded in 2016. And it wasn't because he was right, because he was basically wrong about everything, then, as he is now, which is not to say his opponents aren't also wrong, but he was wrong. But the stories he sold were simple stories, which are easy to understand. So when you're speaking to people in the Midwest, who don't have jobs anymore, it is easy to sell the narrative that immigrants are taking your jobs, therefore, immigration is bad, and that your jobs are being shipped overseas to China. So, you know, China is bad. Now, both those narratives are wrong, but they are simple. So similarly, if you want to sort of communicate any kind of ideas at a mass level, you have to find a way to make it simple and relatable. And you do that at the level of the concrete."

So it's not just about putting it out there, or even as you said, though, it's very important of making it less abstract. I think it's also story after story, example after example. So the way you gave the example of Air India, I think if you gave 100 such examples, then you know, the broader public choice principle of concentrated benefits and diffused costs might penetrate. And this is also where I really enjoyed your conversation with Nilesh Mishra, you know, I mean, it was the importance of storytelling, the value of sentiment, the value of nostalgia, you know, of course, there are broader themes, they invoke certain emotions, which make you connect or make things more intimate. And it's related to the art of conversation. But it's also related to the art of education, right? Everything is not passion and information. It is also sentiment, it is also nostalgia, it is also storytelling and fitting things within a broader tradition.

So I'm just going to queue up their question. And then, you know, you can give us your policy response. And I'll start with one of our common friends, Barun Mitra.

Most of the time, despite the slightly different guideposts, have still led us to very similar conclusions on a range of public policy issues. But with the onset of coronavirus, for the first time, Amit and I disagreed on the appropriate policy response to a public health emergency, particularly the relevance of lockdown in an epidemic situation. Amit held that a lockdown was justified, while I didn't see any justification in penalizing every citizen in search for the virus. So the question that has been making me think for the past few months is, why our framework didn't lead us to a common policy position, as had been the case for all the years?

        "message": "Barunda, of course, is again, one of my favorite people on the world, such a delightful gentleman, I've learned so much from over the years. I think our frameworks are pretty common in the sense that I also care about means and the ends in the sense that I care about means to not include coercion. And I value consent a lot. And I agree with Barun and indeed, the Mahatma Gandhi that, you know, the no end is ever justified by unjust means. And therefore, we should be careful. Now, in this particular case, I also think that look, and I could be wrong here. This is one of those areas where one is never sure and I'm open to accepting I could be wrong. And I think, and I hope Barun will also share that sentiment. But I think that and I hope Barun will also share that sentiment, not am I being wrong, but either of us could be wrong. But that, you know, I think the purpose of the state is to protect the rights of citizens. And that includes, say, protesting the rights of citizens against external invaders, for example, which is why libertarians will say that you have to have rule of law so that rights are protected within a country. And you have to have, you know, an army or some kind of defense, which of course should be voluntary, which protects you from external invaders. How do we classify a virus? I think that, you know, the point is that when it comes to public health, I think, for example, you know, not wearing a mask in public can create externalities for others. For example, this is why in general anti-vaxxers have it so wrong. Vaccines are important. You don't take a vaccine just for yourself, you take it to protect others as well. And if enough people refuse to get vaccinated, you are putting everybody else at risk. And we all agree that there is this liberal paradox, right, that to protect everyone's rights, that is to protect everyone's consent for that matter, you have to infringe on them a little bit. The very existence of the state is an infringement on individual freedom because, you know, a state can only exist based on taxes. And therefore, there is some amount of coercion. And we all agree that the state is a necessary evil, the night watchman state, as the old classical liberals put it, is a necessary evil. Now, I think all ideological discussion comes down to how much coercion is justified by the state. That's all it comes down to. I think anyone who denies that every act of government is an act of violence, I wrote a column with that headline once, or that the state depends on coercion, is deluded. It is obvious that the existence of the state depends on coercion. And the only line of argument is about how much coercion is necessary, and what justifies coercion. So, does like everything that the government does, whether in terms of spending money or whatever it does, has a cost. And that cost is coercive. So, that's the question. And therefore, the argument would be about, you know, you can argue, does a statute justify that coercion? Does, you know, keeping a failing airline alive with all the other associated costs that you have that you have of crowding out and all of that, does that justify the coercion? Do roads and bridges justify the coercion because of the positive externalities they have? And I think in this case, there are reasonable arguments to be made at both ends. So, similarly, does a lockdown justify the coercion? And it's a very difficult question. You know, you and I did an episode in April where we spoke about the policy trade-offs involved here. And the point is that no matter what you do, it will seem like the wrong decision because the cost, which is the lives that were lost and what happened to the economy, the cost will be visible and the benefits, which is the lives that were saved because of the measures you took, will be invisible. And this is regardless of whether there is a lockdown or no lockdown or whatever. Now, this question becomes extremely complicated because even if you say that a lockdown is necessary, you then look at the state capacity. Even if you argue that our lockdown was necessary at the time the Prime Minister called it, you know, you look at state capacity and you think that, okay, there's still going to be enormous suffering because state capacity can't handle what is required. And added to that, you have, say, political apathy, as in the case of the migrant workers, which was a humanitarian tragedy that played out at scale. And you have all these other things going wrong. And I just think that this is a really difficult kind of question. And we argued about this, we discussed it rather, I don't think you and I really argued about it. I think both of us agreed that to some extent, you had to have a lockdown at that point or, you know, public health could have fallen apart. At the same time, I get Barun's point that, you know, it's coming in the way of the voluntary interactions, which make us prosperous as a society in the first place. And if Amit wants to trade with Barun, who is the government to say that he cannot leave his house and do that and meanwhile, both of them starve at home. And that is, of course, a problem. And in a sense, I'm not even disagreeing with him. I agree with his concerns. And I think he would agree with mine as well. And where the policy decision should fall, I don't know. I still think that a lockdown was necessary. I think it was completely botched. But I think it was necessary. Otherwise, our hospitals could have been overwhelmed. And we could just have had a disaster that spiraled out of nowhere. Now the point is, the lockdown was badly botched in terms of what happened to migrant workers and the implementation and the fact that I'm not sure that the government managed to use that time wisely to get in the state of readiness that they should have managed. But all those questions apart, I think it's very complicated and nuanced. And I'm completely open to realizing three years later that I was completely wrong. Had there been no lockdown, it would have been better for all of us. But at the time you make the sort of, you know, it's complicated and messy. But I don't think I would say that the state should not have the right to call something like a lockdown. Because if like, for example, okay, the you know, the Coronavirus is what it is, but imagine a far deadlier virus, you know, imagine a virus that is both extremely contagious and kill 60% of the people who get it. Is a lockdown justified then? Where do you draw?"

If it is not, what are you, you know, I don't know how you can justify a lockdown not being necessary in those circumstances. And if you think it is justified then but not justified now, where do you draw the line? Based on what information do you draw the line, especially when we are in the kind of epistemic fog, if I may use jargon again. So I think that's it. It's a deep and nuanced question. But I think Varun and I have the same kind of framework. And you could say that I am in fact being hypocritical here because I am sort of, you know, turning away from the question of consent that the government did not take the consent of all the people that it forcibly locked down. But I think we also accept that there is a state that has a certain minimum sort of role to play. And the real argument then is that does something like this fall within that role?"

        "message": "You know, I'd add a couple more things to this. So one, of course, I mean, I like you, I'm completely open to realizing I'm wrong about this a few years from now. I already have a more nuanced view than maybe in, you know, early April when we talked about this, which is, of course, you know, some kind of intervention I thought is necessary. But is it necessary in rural Bihar? Is it necessary in Arunachal Pradesh, for instance, where there are no cases, at least at the time of the lockdown, there were no cases, right? It's important to, you know, maybe come down really hard on the Mumbai locals where you can think of them as super spreaders, right? Is it really that important to come down on rural areas or farm activity? So, you know, that is one kind of, you know, aspect of the lockdown for which I completely understand why someone like Barun and even us would just be, you know, think not twice, but many, many times over this kind of an imposition of government over liberty. But there is another aspect to it. Now, normally, the public choice economist in me takes over, and we talk about government failure and, you know, the incentives and how government does things badly. Does that mean government should not do it at all? Right? And this is a question for which I honestly don't have a good answer. Now, I think policing is an incredibly important function of government. I think India is under-policed. I think the people who pay the most because it's under-policed is minorities and, you know, Dalits and women and things like that. Now, because we haven't figured out policing and how to do it right, does that mean the state shouldn't be in the business of policing? Right? Some libertarian friends we have would say yes, right? Some would say absolutely not. There are very, very minimal areas like, you know, this is probably someone like Ajay Shah, right? Or someone like Niranjan Rajyadhyak, right? These are critical state functions, night watchman state functions, and it's very important to to slowly give the chance and allow the state to build capacity in these areas. Now, I know the lockdown is not the same thing as, you know, policing, nor do I want the government to get very good at imposing lockdowns, because then we are in Kashmir and China, and that's a horror scenario in itself. But to me, the fact that the government doesn't do the lockdown well, is normally a good argument. In this instance, I think it weakens just a little bit, because usually when we say the government is not good at providing, you know, telephones, you know, let the market solve it, the market actually solves it pretty well, okay? In this particular instance, I'm not sure how voluntary interactions, because we're not talking about a market for viruses, but how voluntary interactions or that they necessarily solve it well, right? We know people who've continued having big events, super spreader events, there are people who continue having weddings, right, political rallies, Chief Minister Adityanath was planning this huge event, just before the lockdown was called for Ram Navami, and they would have probably gone ahead with that, you know, had some kind of a mandate not come in. So it's not that private citizens are in a place to act in the same way as they do when they are buying telephones and bread and butter, either relative to, you know, let's say the government running Modern Bakery, or the government running Lodhi Hotel or Air India. So there is also that comparison, did the government botch the lockdown? Absolutely. Was it necessary? To me, some intervention was necessary, this kind of a horrific lockdown, especially I thought it would go on for three weeks, it went on for like, whatever 70-80 days, right? So there is that element of that trade off. And there is also, do we need a lockdown? The question is compared to what and I honestly do not see private citizens acting that responsibly, right, as one would require in this kind of a pandemic. Because for everyone, it's important to get married, it's important to have a family event, it is important to have a political rally, right, and the and the losses are passed on to someone else or the externalities passed on to someone else. So I think, even within, you know, the libertarian classical liberal framework of thinking, there's obviously a lot of things to consider. But this is how I have started to think about issues of the lockdown. Now, I know, it doesn't get me to the exact same point as Barun. And I keep wondering why, because like you, I, I hugely admire him. And maybe, you know, over a period of time, we all kind of figure out where we are on this. But, you know, epistemic fog is real. I thought the dead bodies would just be piling up in India, based on my experience with the healthcare system in Italy, when I lived there. And, you know, then when they had like, you know, this kind of crazy fatality rate in Italy, I was like, if this is happening in Italy, what will happen in India. But at that time, when I was imagining those horrifying things, we didn't know that it disproportionately affects older people, or that younger people are not, you know, affected quite the same, and the fatality rates are much lower. You know, we just didn't have this, this information in March, early April, or at least, you know, the really good studies from the cruise ship and things like that hadn't come out yet. So I think the epistemic fog lifting also genuinely helps our understanding of, hey, only 7% or 6.5% of Indians are above 65 years of age. So you know, maybe this wasn't that necessary. Also, Indians don't overwhelmingly, you know, put the elderly in old age homes or nursing homes, which means you don't have this kind of huge impact where one event and you know, you suddenly have lots and lots of people dead in a particular area or a particular county. So, you know, those things have helped us understand why India wasn't as badly affected. But at the time, I still believe some intervention was necessary. Should it have been all India? Should it have been as a grave as it was? Should it have, you know, been extended three times over those things, I would agree with"

        "message": "Varun were quite unnecessary. I mean, I'll say a couple of things. I mean, one is a fairly trivial point almost that people I have noticed worryingly, often come up with responses to policy based on where it is coming from, who is a politician in charge, for example, it's almost interesting to see here that we had the right wing government of Modi calling a lockdown in India and a right wing government of Trump opposing a lockdown in the US. So I don't like to use words like right wing and left wing because I don't think those frameworks are correct. But regardless, and similarly, the opposition breaks out along those lines that those who oppose Modi here will say, array, the lockdown was too strict. And those who oppose Trump there will say that we need a stricter lockdown and more of a lockdown and all of that. But I'm not saying that's why Varun opposed it at all. I mean, he of course opposes Modi, but this is perfectly law opposing the lockdown is very cogent according to his framework. So I respect that. But the deeper point I want to make is a point that I think every libertarian will agree with. And again, I don't really like to use these sort of tribal classifications. But I think anyone who uses these to describe themselves will agree with anyway, which is that what went wrong in India, the botched lockdown also speaks to a fundamental structural problem. And I'm not even referring to the flailing state. And I wrote a column about how India's great disasters as shown is, you know, even worse than the viruses are flailing state, which, you know, causes far more suffering than the virus can or has. But rather, that our structure of governance is true top down. And if it was far more local, the responses would have been better. Like as you just said, that the policy that you carry out in Mumbai is not something that really fits in Arunachal Pradesh or rural Bihar or whatever. So if governance is really local, and responsive to what the actual needs on the ground of local citizens are, then better decisions can be taken that way at a local level. Now, there will be places where people get it wrong. But there will also be places where people get it right. And the point is, a bad decision will not scale in the way that it can, when there is just one guy in Delhi, who is making a bad decision, and then it just percolates down.

Then a prime minister who enjoys tremendous popular support, favorable demographics with a large young population and a global openness for trade, etc. A corporate sector that is chasing excellence for a change. This window and its many positives are now closing. Many negatives, among them increasing cussedness in politics, policy, and in general, dominate the scene now.

I mean, you know, one, I think that it's going to get worse before it gets better, if it gets better. So it's going to get worse before it gets better is actually a hopeful statement, not a despairing one. That, you know, our discourse is very polluted. And what has happened is that we are inevitably getting more and more polluted. And I think, you know, we're getting more and more polarised, because the worst angels of our nature, as it were, the worst demons of our nature are given scale by social media and technology. And that, you know, that makes me feel fairly sad sometimes about the way things are going. And I don't know what one can really do. You know, politics has become, politics has always been not about governance, but about narrative. And all narratives that are out there are in some way reductive and toxic to different levels. So what do you kind of do about that? And that's what I've always said has given me hope is that I've and I think, you know, while I despair of what is happening in the larger, broader scheme where abstract ideas rule, what I do take hope from is the small concrete ways in which our lives are improved, especially by technology. Like I think where politics has failed liberalism, technology has succeeded by empowering individuals in many different ways by empowering them with choice by empowering them with access to information, and so on and so forth. And, you know, maybe there is hope there. I mean, anyone who is listening to this is listening to this because of technology that didn't exist 10 years ago. And you could have podcast 10 years ago, but the precise confluence of technologies that has brought my voice to your ears right now, didn't really exist or not, not at the circumstances. And so, and I think the future is largely a sea of unknown unknowns. So, you know, we can't tell in what ways good things will happen or even bad things will happen. And there will be domains in which things will get worse. And the arc of history will bend towards injustice as it were, or it will seem like that in the short term. But, you know, I have hoped that in the long run, it will sort of, and maybe I'm being delusional. So here is again, this is something somewhere where I could realize that I should have been more pessimistic in the future. Who knows? You know, for me, I try, these days, I try not to think about what's happening in the broader political space or in the economic space, because it is, it makes me angry and frustrated, and there's nothing I can do about it. So I want to keep exploring ideas and keep, you know, keep keep the discourse going about all of these things, but there's nothing I can do about it. So at a personal level, my personal philosophy really comes down to cherishing small joys, like the good conversations I get to have, or just, you know, the kachoris I had earlier today. And which makes it sound very trivial. But you know, I wish I had kachoris today. Yeah, there you go. I have just darkened your world. I have. Yeah. So yeah, so I think, you know, so you do what you can at an individual level, both for yourself, for your, you know, own mental enrichment, and, and all of that, and whatever you can throw at the wall of ideas out there, you throw it, you know, the point is, you don't, you don't, I mean, I think of Bastia again, you know, no chance of success, but he writes all those great books, like the law and all his essays like that, which is seen and that which is not seen. So you just got to do what you got to do. The future is unknown unknowns, you increase the probability of good outcomes, if you can continue doing good things now, without hoping for, you know, good outcomes later. So, you know, you just increase that probability, you add your voice to the mix, you kind of do what you can, but you also I think, I think all of us also need to sort of look us look after ourselves as well."

And the one thing I'm optimistic about, the older I get, is I think most people are fundamentally good, decent people. Right. And in that I have a very large amount of hope for the future of India, right? I know everyone thinks everyone hates everyone. And there is all this right wing anger and left wing anger and people think Twitter is what the real world looks like. The real world in my sense, I mean, I know India is remarkably violent and remarkably difficult and all of those things, you know, casteist, racist, misogynistic, but it's also full of remarkable kindness, you know, in the face of extreme shortages and, you know, some really difficult circumstances for a lot of people. And the more I travel in India, the more I see that kind of, you know, individual level kindness, that gives me a lot of hope. The other thing that gives me a lot of hope is I, you know, also do Emergent Ventures, right, which is one of the Mercatus Center platforms with which we support moonshot ideas. And just reading the applications from really young people, their ambition, you know, their imagination, their creativity. I, anytime I work on Emergent Ventures applications on a given day, you know, the next few hours are very bright and optimistic for that particular reason. So I'm also hugely optimistic of the younger people in India. I want to now move on to the other favorite resident economist that we have, and that is Rajeshwari Sengupta, right? I mean, she is just such a great thinker. Again, you know, our fields of specialization are different. So anytime I read a column or a paper by Rajeshwari, immediately it's got like, you know, my brain just expands and opens up a little bit more. So I really value her as an academic, but also as, you know, a guest on your podcast as a fellow guest, because we, we did one episode together. So I had the pleasure of meeting her. And she also has one of these big think questions for you. So I'm not going to say more, I'm just I'm going to, you know, play the question then. And then we'll talk about it."

First of all, heartiest congratulations to Amit and team on completing 200 episodes of a podcast, which I think is one of the best in the country on the topics that it covers. I've thoroughly enjoyed listening to several episodes and learned a lot. I wish you guys all the best as you hopefully continue to enlighten us with more such informative shows. My question for Amit is as follows. The podcast can safely be categorized as one that caters to a highly educated English speaking elite audience. But the word elite now has a negative connotation, it seems, in several societies, including us. All over the world, we are witnessing a sort of a backlash against us elites. The unsaid unwritten criticism seems to be that we the elite, the intellectual thinkers of the country have ignored or marginalized for common man. And in doing so, somewhere we have lost the plot, we have lost the narrative. There seems to be a deep disconnect between what we say or think or write, and what the common man who votes in our democracy believes in. So my question for Amit today is that, is there anything that he thinks that we can or need to do to bridge this ever expanding divide? Or do we risk becoming redundant and reduced to passive observers reminiscing about the past when things were different? Yeah, what a what a fantastic question. No. Yeah, it's it's Rajesh. And it doesn't surprise you that it comes from Rajeshwari, right? Like she, she never thinks narrowly. She just thinks so big and broad. I just, you know, classic macroeconomist thinking"

        "message": "macro question. Yeah, she's great. I did an episode on GDP with her, which was a fabulous episode. And for anyone who wants to understand the concept of the GDP, and the way it's measured and the larger conceptual questions as well. That's a great episode. And you Rajeshwari and Vivek Kaur were my guests in a four person episode, we did 12 dream reforms, which is one of my 10 most popular episodes, I think. And that was great fun. And you and Rajeshwari were, of course, fighting all the time. We're not fighting. Economists talk to each other. I think we scared everyone. Yeah, very deep question. So let me let me respond to it by saying that first of all, I mean, I of course, use the elites in a banal descriptive sense, but it's obviously true. We are the elites, right? We have to acknowledge our own good fortune and our own privilege and all of that. And it's true. We are the elites by definition, because there are so few of us and we are so fortunate. As far as the criticisms of elites are concerned, I think they are largely justified. I think they're largely justified because elites too often, people like us, and I include you and me, will sit in ivory towers and be sanctimonious about what is good for everybody, including what is good for the common person. And, you know, and because for so long, elites have controlled the levers of the state and the levers of media and all of that. We'll, you know, we can do what we want and we can sort of, our narratives are the ones that get through. And you could say in a sense that has started to change in recent times, and there are ebbs and flows in that. I think the two, you know, to get back to the constructive part of it that what can elites do better, I think there are sort of two important things that we can do better. One is at a level of attitude, we need to be open. We don't need to look down on people who, you know, are not elites and say that, oh, you know, so-and-so voted for Modi because he's bigoted or so-and-so voted for Trump, so he must be a racist. And I think that kind of condescending, demeaning attitude doesn't help. People's concerns are different from ours. We have to be open to understanding. See, people contain multitudes. Like you said earlier, you know, there is much kindness in the common person towards others, even towards those who he would consider in an abstract sense to be the other, you know, that abstract term, but there is kindness in an actual concrete way towards that. And I had a, I had an episode recently with Anshul Malhotra where we discussed the concrete and the abstract a lot and very moving episode for me. And so I think that this, we need to do that. We need to stop looking down on people and say that these are the unwashed masses. What do they know? We know better and all of that. And we need to be open to A, their concerns and open to their concerns, not in a way that we are, you know, giving compassion from on top, but actually try to understand where are they coming from? Why are they, because the point is, you know, there, but for the grace of God, go, aye, as it were. And, and that's actually the wrong quote, because it's not even as if somebody is in an inferior position and someone is better or someone is inferior or someone is better. It's not like that at all. It's just that everyone is a creature of their circumstances and their thinking. And maybe it is some of the elites who are in fact, intellectually hobbled by a narrowness of vision. So I think elites need to be open and especially in one good way of doing this is through considering what Barun calls means. And I would call consent that if you want to, if you want your ideas to percolate through society, kindly do not impose them at the cost of others, but try to make it happen in a bottoms up way. Too many of the elites have a particular vision of the world, which they want to impose on others out of the best possible intentions. And I sort of have an issue with that. So that's one aspect where the elites can do better just in terms of their attitude and their approach. Have some humility, be open, don't, you know, try to look at the world in a top down way and impose your ideas in that manner. And secondly, I would say that if the elites really have a sense of conviction in what their ideas are, like you and I did and going back to Kumar's question, then focus on a narrative where you're not talking at someone, but you're actually talking to someone, you're respecting their concerns, and you're trying to convince them in a respectful way, instead of lecturing to them, and judging them because they don't agree with you. So they must be bad people, and so on and so forth, which is happening too much. And yeah, so these two things, I think a lot of criticisms of and anger at elites are justified, and we should have the humility to accept that and the capacity to then think about how do we communicate better. And I think a lot of the answer comes in learning from others who are not like us. And some of the answer comes from being able to have the sort of dialogue with them that we can convince them of our ideas."

        "message": "I would add one more thing. And maybe this is because I have been in the academy my whole life that I feel this particularly, I think elites, not just Indians everywhere in the world, but also very cliquish. And, you know, it's like a club with a secret handshake, right? Because if you didn't know how to pronounce that French word correctly, or you know, you know, you said Rodin instead of Rodin, then you know, oh, you are you are not you don't know the secret handshake, right? So there is, there is a very cliquish nature, we use pronunciation, we use schooling, we use brands, you know, what you wear, things like that, right? Like how you speak as proxies for whether you are part of the club or not part of the club. I find that particularly disturbing. And I never realized this about Indian elites while I was living in India, I was probably one of them who would have made fun of someone, you know, I hope I wouldn't have been that unkind. But you know, I can easily imagine myself being one of those people, either openly making fun of someone or at least like thinking in my head, I can't believe they don't know how to say that. But I think one thing that has changed me is also being an immigrant, right? So once you leave the place that you were raised in, and you come to a new world, which was open enough to accept you, even though I'm not one of them, right? I'm not, I'm not American. And being welcomed with open arms, people engaging with you, people mentoring you, teaching you so on so forth. And now suddenly, the lens with which I look at my own community or childhood or my own people, so to speak, people like us just flipped. So you know, ever since I left India, I have had actually, I guess, a more harsh view of this club nature of elites, like I just despise, you know, I mean, the people in a very pejorative way, say, you know, Khan Market, Kabal or something like that. But I grew up in Khan Market, you know, Bari Bookstores was my bookstore, right? Like, India International Center is where we had family dinner. So I have also been in that sort of, you know, Kabal to know enough that it is very much an in group, you know, you are one of us or out sort of environments. And I think that is something Indian elites really need to change as an at an individual and at a group level. I think this, there's also a value in networks, right? Thanks to Twitter, I have been speaking to more people who are from different backgrounds, right? Dalits, LGBTQ members, who, who I normally wouldn't have met, we would have never been in the same room, you know, given the circumstances in which I grew up in India. And one of the things I realized is one of the hardest things for Dalit students to get into American universities is letters of recommendation. Right? There aren't enough people that they know, who would write a letter for them that would carry weight in an American university that, you know, would get them admission. Of course, they know wonderful thinkers, I'm sure they have great teachers. But there is this gap, and this gap exists, because we wouldn't let them in. Right? So I have made this offer multiple times on Twitter and privately, and I'll make it on your show, that, you know, students who need help and help opening doors, opening networks within academy in India or abroad, they need people to recommend them or at least people to mentor them. And we need to open up a little bit and not say, I'm only going to mentor so and so who came from, you know, my father's friend's son, or, you know, someone who grew up in my neighborhood, or is the, you know, alumni of my school and things like that. So I think this in group clique behavior"

And some of these exclusionary behavior is, of course, the default condition of being an elite and not necessarily an intentional, this thing on the part of the elites, but it helps to be aware of it. And that self awareness is important. I'll just respond to a couple of the things that you said. One is about pronunciations. You know, I read someone make the point once which I agree wholeheartedly with, and it's a great point, is that when you hear someone pronounce something wrong, you should actually respect the person and applaud him. Because it means that he is not in those circles, where people talk about that person or that idea, but nevertheless, he has read up on it enough to know about it, but he can't pronounce it, which which shows that added sort of work that the person has put in. And therefore, you know, if someone says Rodin instead of Rodin, which I'm sure I must have done at the start, the very first time I read the word, how would I have thought of it exactly like that, right? So it's, it's perfectly fine. And and we need to sort of lose some of that inbuilt snobbishness. The second thing I'll say is that, you know, I think I've sort of been an outsider in every sort of community that I've been remotely part of in my life, whether it's an intellectual community or writers or poker players or whatever, I've kind of been on the fringes one foot in one foot out very different kind of view bringing a different lens and all of that. So I've kind of gotten this from the start that while I am extremely fortunate and privileged and all that, there's just so many problems with, you know, those sort of narrow, constricted worlds. And the other thing I would say is that, you know, we know for a fact that this podcast, for example, does have an elite audience, it goes out to a lot of the elites, and especially young PhD students, and so on and so forth. And if they are listening to that, I just ask that always retain intellectual humility. Because, you know, we reflexively fall into certain ways of thinking that are common in our circles, you know, depending on where we are being educated or the circles that we talk to and whatever. And it's always sort of tempting to harden the ways in which you think to fit in with your peers and to gain brownie points for them or whatever. And that's a natural human tendency, but always try as far as possible to retain a certain amount of intellectual humility, and to not make the mistake of dehumanizing those who disagree with you. Like one thing that is so sad about these modern times is that discourse has become so toxic, that if someone disagrees with us, we treat them as if they are a bad person, there is a character flaw there. They are the enemy. They are the enemy and kindly avoid that. But enough of my hectoring as the elites would do."

        "message": "Yeah, I mean... So, Varmaji. Varmaji. So, obviously, Varmaji is never going to happen. It's absurd, but I love thought experiments and I appreciate that Sudhir put a thought experiment. So, I'll respect that and let us say that, okay, if I am ever in that kind of position of power, first of all, do an audit, rationalize everything the government does and think about should the government do this or should the government not do this. And, you know, my sort of rather heuristic for looking at what is wrong with the public policy or where the problem is, like if there's a particular outcome in the world, why is that outcome there? Where is the problem? And one heuristic I use is to ask the question, where is the coercion? So, I would do that in the case of government where I would look at different policies and say, okay, where is the coercion? Is it necessary? Why is it necessary? What is the impact of this? What are the outcomes that it is having? Do a complete audit on everything that the government does, which will immediately knock off a lot of the ministries, which will knock off a lot of the spending. Figure out ways to do it because even though you can't shift from one equilibrium to the other overnight, there are what I would call transaction costs in that and you got to figure out ways to make smooth transitions. But one do that, have a clear vision of what the government is to do, you know, and think about that. Like one metric that I would love using for this is Gandhiji's metric, where Mahatma Gandhi's metric was that for every public policy, think of whether it will help the poor or not, which is actually, I'm quite happy for that to be the single metric that I use for everything in terms of outcome, when I think about outcome, that will it help the poor or hurt the poor? And the interesting thing is that most of the policies that many people think of as being tailored towards the poor actually hurt the poor, they don't help them and vice versa. So, think a little deeper, think about unseen but entirely foreseeable effects and work according to that. So, rationalize according to what the government has no business doing, what it can do to solve poverty, which is our number one problem and should be our number one problem and think about it, not at the basic, you know, patronizing level of, you know, handouts and schemes and all of that thing. But think about structurally, what can we do about our poverty, how the rest of the world has tackled it. And therefore, that's what we need to do. So, I really start with these two. And the thing is, the problem with the Indian state is that it is too small and too large at the same time, that it doesn't do the few things it should do properly, such as maintain the rule of law, and so on, where basically in most of the country, there is no rule of law for elites like us, we can buy, figure out ways to work the system, but there is no rule of law for most people. So, the things that we should do strengthen the state there. And there are so many things that we should not do and get the state out of that as smoothly as possible. So, these are the broad areas, you know, I, you know, can't really think of five and all of these are in the realm of wild fantasy, you know, it's, but, but, yeah, I mean, if you put me in that thought experiment, these are the lines I along which I will think you remove restrictions on private enterprise, voluntary action is what what makes society grow. Now, with every act of voluntary exchange, both people are better off. That's the secret to prosperity. So remove all restrictions on acts like that, you know, if you know, there'll be one class of people in India, who will say that we should be free to do whatever we want in the marketplace, but not in the bedroom, and there'll be another class that says the opposite. And I'll say that no two consenting adults should be able to interact with each other in whatever way they want, as long as they're not infringing on the rights of someone else, be it in the bedroom or the marketplace. So get out of, you know, the regulating people's personal morality or passing judgment on that, and also let them interact freely in the marketplace, unless you're doing a deal to get someone assassinated, in which case you're obviously infringing those rights. But otherwise respect the power of voluntary exchange, we do not do this enough. And this will automatically take care of a lot of cronyism, like people often confuse markets with business that what is good for markets must be good for business. And it's actually, they are at opposite ends that, you know, a pro-business policies will be bad for markets and therefore bad for the people, because every big business will want to shut down competition, and, you know, put barriers to entry so that their position is protected, and they will want special favors from the government. And in the end, this harms the people, and this harms the poor. So, you know, the more we get out of regulating voluntary exchange, the less this kind of cronyism becomes possible. So this sort of a rambling answer, I hope will satisfy Sudhir. Yeah, I mean, that covers more than five, right?"

So now, we are moving on to, I think, what is going to be one of the most exciting parts of this conversation for me. I want to move on to a really exciting area. So you know, one of the things I have been so jealous of, pretty much the entire time I have known you, is how broadly you read, and more importantly, how quickly you read. You know, by the time I finish one book, you have finished five, and I think I read a fair bit, but you just put the rest of us to shame. The other thing is, you manage to read, you know, not just the same type of thing over and over again. And of course, you know, being in the academy has stunted me in that we specialize in a particular discipline and things like that. But you read everything, right? You're not a snob about things. You may make fun of Chetan Bhagat, but you will make fun of Chetan Bhagat after reading Chetan Bhagat, right? You've read everything. So there are a number of your, you know, guests and fans, not surprisingly, who have questions about books. And so I want to start queuing that up and, you know, ask you those questions, right? So the very first question comes from, as we have discussed this multiple times in this episode, Russ Roberts, the host of Econ Talk, and one of my most favorite thinkers. You know, you talked about education, and of course, I am not self taught like you. I have had a lot of formal education, you know, which a lot of your listeners have also, you know, learned about through various episodes. But I feel like I have learned more from Russ Roberts than virtually any other book in economics or any other single professor of mine, because I have been listening to his podcast since I think 2006 or 2007, from the very, very early days. And he was a professor at George Mason, and that was the pull. But you know, I have just learned how to think about the world through his voice. And you know, through his eyes. I also think he's a remarkable human being and so incredibly kind and generous. I feel like I hope somewhere that has also seeped into me maybe, you know, the I hope I have become less judgmental, less critical, less snobbish, you know, more kind, more willing to listen all all the things that you know, Russ just embodies. I don't know how he's been doing it for so long. And so I, when I emailed Russ, he sent in a question.

One that enthralled you as pure entertainment, perhaps a novel or biography.

        "message": "to be asked the question by Russ Roberts, right? Because he is such a legend of both podcasting and and and you know, I've obviously never met him personally, but his humanity shines through his writing, and is therefore so inspiring. And that that episode, of course, was such a, you know, wonderful conversation that I did with him. I really loved it. And this reading, I mean, even his short book on Adam Smith is really, in a sense, a guide to how to be a better person and to live a better life. So I kind of love that. A book that changed my view of the world. I'm not going to name a libertarian book here, oddly enough, I'm going to name The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker. Because and what that book sort of did to me and and was that it made me much more cognizant and aware of human nature. And the fact that we aren't blank slates, that we have a hard wiring. And in fact, it made me very conscious of the different ways in which our culture is both a reflection of the hard wiring, and also an attempt to mitigate it and to fight it, that we are wired in certain ways. And we are also wired in certain contradictory ways. But the most remarkable thing is that we are the only animal, so to say, that has been given the tools to fight its hard wiring, which is the ability to think about the world in conceptual terms, and to make value judgments about what is a good way to behave and what is the wrong way to behave. And that awareness of our own humanity and sort of the different ways in which you know, we are like I think of the brain as a machine that we have to fight, that the machine is wired to do so many things to look at the world and, you know, different kinds of toxic ways. And we have to fight that machine and we have to fight it even in more everyday mundane things like our brain is wired to be distracted, to take the easy way out to preserve cognitive energy and not actually do deep work. And in various ways, we have to kind of fight that. And the blank slate is this wonderful book that, you know, through this long arc shows one on the different ways in which we are shaped and our cultures and our societies are shaped by a wiring and be in the ways in which different fields have, you know, are shaped by it and also reflect sort of the different battles that then arise when we try to fight this and also how dangerous a view of the world would be that rejects the fact that we are wired and treats us as if we are blank slates when we are absolutely not. So, you know, it takes a very nuanced view of nature versus nurture. I think in one of his books, Pinker writes about how, you know, nature gives us knobs, nurture turns them, which I think is, you know, such a powerful line. That's one book, which I think changed the way I look at the world. Another great book, which I think sort of moves me a lot and, you know, has me sort of connects me deeply with the shared humanity of all of us and the shared tragedy of life, as it were, is a book of poems called Almost Invisible by Mark Strand. And I would recommend all my listeners to just go and buy Mark Strand's collected poems, because that will include this book, obviously. And that's a remarkable volume. And he's a remarkable poet. And these poems were written, I think, when he was towards the end of his life, if I'm not mistaken, it's his last book of poetry. And it's prose poems. Right. So it's just, it's just prose. And, and since Russ said, maybe I should read something out from it. Let me, let me, let me quickly find something to sort of read out from this. Yeah, so I'll, I have opened the page, and I'll read out a couple of poems are very short, and they're very powerful. You can always get there from here by Mark Strand, a traveler returned to the country from where he had started many years before. When he stepped down from the boat, he noticed how different everything was. There were once many buildings, but now there were few and each of them needed repair. In the park where he played as a child, dust filled shafts of sunlight struck the tawny leaves of trees and withered hedges. Empty trash bags littered the grass, the air was heavy. He sat on one of the benches and explained to the woman next to him that he'd been away a long time. He then asked her what season had he come back to. She replied that it was the only one left, the one they had all agreed on. I'll read out the next one now. Like a leaf carried off by the wind by Mark Strand. After leaving work, where he is not known and where his job is a mystery even to himself. He walks down dimly lit streets and dark alleys to his room at the other end of town in the rear of a rundown apartment house. It is winter and he walks hunched over with the collar of his coat turned up. When he gets to his room, he sits at a small table and looks at the book open before him. Its pages are blank, which is why he is able to gaze at them for hours. And I'll finally read out a third one and this is called Harmony in the Boudoir by Mark Strand. After years of marriage, he stands at the foot of the bed and tells his wife that she will never know him, that for everything he says there is more that he does not say, that behind each word he utters there is another word and hundreds more behind that one. All those unsaid words, he says, contain his true self, which has been betrayed by the superficial self before her. So you see, he says, kicking off his slippers, I am more than what I have led you to believe. Oh, you silly man, says his wife. Of course you are. I find that just thinking of you having so many selves receding into nothingness is very exciting, that you barely exist as you are, couldn't please me more. And what was the third kind of book?"

And, you know, in the realm of ideas, the book that immediately comes to mind is Bastia's The Law because of what, you know, the relationship between the state and the individual and the principle stand that it takes. But it's a difficult book to read. It's actually very simple, but the language is archaic. So it's kind of difficult for that reason. I mean, one could also point out, you know, you know, Adam Smith's, both his books, Theory of Moral Sentiments. And though, I mean, if you don't have time to read both of them, you could maybe just read Russ Roberts's book on Adam Smith. I love Orwell's essays, but I don't know what would be the value of reading them if you read nothing else, because where do you get context from? Right. And similarly, you know, I wouldn't recommend Mark Stantz's poem if it is the only book in the world, because again, there is no, you know, your taste would not have built up to the point where you could appreciate it, perhaps it would just. So it's a tough question. I think, you know, I don't know, maybe just, yeah. So in nonfiction, like I said, you know, maybe Bastia's Law, maybe Orwell, I don't know. In fiction, you could go to Orwell, you could go to something like 1984 or Animal Farm, which also are in their own ways, books of ideas and books that kind of contain a lot of truth about the world. But I mean, depending on how one is feeling, one could come up with, you know, a bunch of different answers. But I can't think of a satisfactory single answer for fiction, because the joy of fiction is that with every book, you enter a different world and enter other people's lives. And all of it collectively, just increases your empathy and makes you a better person. I mean, some book, like if somebody read only one book, you have to give them a book, which is also easy enough to read. So I would think... But it's not somebody,"

And that also gives you a sense of how you can enter someone's else's head and see the world differently, and yet is written in simple enough language that everyone can get it. So that's one sort of book that comes to mind. But you know, you get the fundamental difficulty with the question. And also, perhaps this is my shortcoming that I read so much that I am simply unable to imagine what it must be like to not have read anything. It's somewhat like, you know, Thomas Nagel wrote this famous essay about what it is to see like a bat. And, you know, which makes a philosophical point that some experiences are so outside of our realm that we cannot even imagine what it must be like.

And I recommend everyone listens to that. Great question. And I remember once when I was a teenager, and I remember this memory. And like I said, my father had 1000s of books across ideologies and across genres and all of that. So I remember once, I was meeting a bunch of friends in college. And in my bag, I took the book Das Kapital, which he asked about because I thought it would be cool. I thought it was fashionable, it would make me seem intellectual, and all of that when I was a very young kid. Young teenager, and I think a lot of what draws us towards ideologies, as also ideological books is the desire to fit in and you know, with a cool gang and to be seen as, you know, one of a cool bunch of people and all of that, which is why we shall, you know, we will read Das Kapital and we'll read Marx and we'll wear t shirts of the mass murdering. Yeah, Sheikh Guwahara, which is which just repels me when I see someone wearing that t shirt. But yeah, so it's kind of those social currents where you want to fit in with a cool bunch of people. And especially if those cool bunch of people seem to be enlightened and they've read a lot and they're compassionate. Though, you know, we have seen where compassion can lead society in the 20th century, that kind of shallow stated compassion that remains at the level of intention. And I think that's a big reason why some ideologies are so fashionable and others don't really take off. Also, I think a lot of leftism appeals to simplistic ways of viewing the world, which are inbuilt in us. For example, you know, zero sum thinking or thinking of, you know, the world in terms of adversaries in an adversarial way that oh, then you know, the workers versus so and so and all of that. And, and these sort of simplistic narratives that the way to get rid of poverty is that, you know, just redistribute and, you know, all of that. And I can see why those are appealing. And so I'm not really surprised why more people have read Das Kapital than, you know, Hayek's books. And Hayek also writes in slightly dense language, but so does Marx, of course. And, and, of course, I read Marx before I read Hayek, which, you know, tells you something about the way the world is that many people will never even move to Hayek, which is why it's a responsibility of those of us who read Hayek and, you know, find illumination in him to spread those ideas in concrete terms and simple language. Because I think that there is a social cost to reading the wrong books, there is a personal cost and a social cost to reading the wrong books. And this is possibly the wrong time to sort of elaborate on that. But we are shaped by what we read. And what we then become is what shapes society, if enough of us turn out that way. No, and also the other thing to note is that besides Das Kapital, a book that has been perennially on the bestseller list in India over the years is Mein Kampf by Hitler. And you could also ask that that is another toxic, dangerous book. Why are people reading that? But because one, because I suppose at some level is enthralling and two, because it speaks to simple narratives that you need a strong leader. And all I mean, I used to hear these kind of arguments back in the day that India needs a strong leader like that. And, you know, who can get things done in the trains will run on time and you still hear arguments like that from people. So these are sort of, you know, from different end from different ideological ends, both simplistic, both dangerous, we have seen the damage they have caused in the 20th century with Stalin and Mao and, of course, Hitler himself and so on and so forth. And both having commonalities in terms of having a simplistic vision of the world and believing in the power of the state to shape society as you wish through coercive action. And we, of course, haven't learned any lessons. And I think it also, I mean,"

And I think that has a lot to do with, you know, this lovely article that Hayek wrote called intellectuals and socialism, where in a way, you know, the socialists managed to capture an intellectual elite class, who then furthered and propagated those ideas, probably for all the reasons that you mentioned, which is, you know, the simple narrative, the appeal to tribalism, the appeal to our base instincts of thinking in terms of zero sum and things, things like that.

And actually, the man is just profoundly wrong in so many different ways. But you don't even want to enter into an argument about it with anyone, because it will seem like you, who has no compassion for whatever and all of that.

Exactly. So now I have another question on books, but this is not about your favorite book. This question comes from Ram Guha. Again, one of our, you know, probably favorite writers, thinkers, historians, I mean, again, someone who has multitudes, just, I mean, right now, I'm excited about Guha for a completely different reason. I was reading something that he had written on, you know, forest nationalization and forest rights of tribals. And my husband is incredibly excited about Guha, because he's coming out with a new book on cricket, right. And in this household, that I think there are very few intellectual figures who excite both of us in equal measure on dimensions which are so far apart. So thanks to you. And thanks to the 200th episode, I got to say hello to Ram Guha on zoom during the pandemic. And, you know, get to ask this question. So I'm first going to play the question and then"

None of these people have read his books and to paint him in that manner was really tragic. And what has also happened after that is that today you'll have, you know, woke liberals on Twitter also ranting about Ram for different reasons. One of which of course is his contempt for the Gandhi family, which I entirely share and which we discussed on the show, I think in the Republic Day episode that we did at the start of the year. And, and that's really tragic because this is a great story and a great thinker of our times and a very nuanced thinker. So, you know, obviously both ideological tribes will reduce the world to a binary and anybody who doesn't fit that binary is by default, you know, a bad person, a bad thinker or whatever. And it's sad, but his books sell well.

You know, another thing here is we talked about this a little bit earlier when we were talking about intellectual influences and how, you know, partly because the, our, you know, school curriculum is so heavily, you know, got this, this colonial hangover, you know, sort of thing. We don't read whether it is in literature, whether it is non-fiction, we don't read too many of our own, you know, Indian voices, Indian thoughts, Indian letter. Right. And I think one thing that India after Gandhi did was it just cracked that wide open. Right. It made me at least understand, and I'm a keen reader of history. I mean, I'd already almost finished law school by then. You know, the, I remember having this conversation with my husband, I'd given him the book, you know, so it was, I think, one of the first presents that I gave him. It had released in India, but it hadn't released in London. So when I was going to see him, I got the book for him. And he said, I had no idea all this happened during the emergency. Right. I, on the other hand, had been to law school. And, you know, I knew a lot of it from the litigation point of view, but I had no idea what was going on in Nagaland, for instance. Right. And just cracking that open, you know, talking about Indian events and Indian intellectual thought from the point of view of what was going on with our people. I don't think anyone has done that better, you know, than Ram. And in one sense, I hope that, you know, the silent majority and like the lots of people who buy and read his books, we are able to create a culture of, you know, Indian thought and writing. Now, it doesn't have to be liberal, it doesn't have to be centrist, it doesn't have to be right wing. It could be all sorts of things, because India also contains multitudes, right. But I think that is a critical piece. And I think that's also where his question is coming from, which is in this homegrown intellectual thought or tradition, you know, Rajaji is an incredibly important member.

The significance of Ram Goha himself is, I think, something that perhaps he himself would not be aware of, because in a sense, his books are like a gateway drug for so many people into reading history, into caring about history. You know, would a great historian like Srinath Raghavan, for example, have less readers if Ram Goha did not exist? The answer clearly is yes. Maybe Srinath himself would be a different kind of writer if, you know, part of that way wasn't sort of laid out for him before that. And that's important. And this, you know, things like the books like what Ram writes can then have a domino effect on future historians or would be historians or people who would not have thought of themselves as possible historians, but who like good stories and who like reading about the past, suddenly reading, you know, something historical written by Ram and saying that, damn, this is so exciting. I need more of this. And then they read more and then they want to write more and all of that. And these are all unseen effects, which will, you know, play out across generations. And one may never know where it kind of ends up. And I wish more people express their admiration for him, you know, on Twitter and elsewhere, rather than the sort of vituperative space that it's become. And forgive me, I keep going back to that, but it's just disturbing that I know that I know people like, you know, Ram and Barkha Dutt and all of those probably ignored their Twitter notifications completely. But it just disturbs me to see the amount of sort of abuse and hatred that they get that what is wrong with us as a society when we cannot, you know,"

And I kept asking for lots of questions, because I thought, you know, we have so much time. But as always, there are more ideas and thoughts and interesting conversation than there is time. So, you know, we've, we've sort of covered all of it. But more generally, one of the things I have, I have personally experienced being a guest on your show, and I'm incredibly grateful for is two things. I have never had the kind of engagement that I get from your listeners to pretty much anything else that I do. Right? I write academic papers, which we all know nobody reads, right? I write columns, which people read, but you know, it's a very quick and dirty, sometimes not even past the headline or the first couple of paragraphs. I've had I have students who pay money to listen to me and learn from me, but not all of them are quite as engaged. But there is something incredible about your listeners. And obviously, there's a selection bias here, because only the most engaged reach out. But their questions are so penetrating. They are so, you know, they're critical, but they are so civil. They're really like a model in my mind of, you know, how discourse should be conducted. I think the way you conduct your discourse has a lot to do with how your listeners respond. But I have, you know, immense gratitude for the engagement from your listeners. And the second is the love. I mean, they are just ridiculous. I, I'm both envious and also still quite astounded because when people are that sort of profuse in their praise and warmth, I'm always like, wait a second. I mean, what do they want? Or what is going on here? Is this normal? This just feels very awkward and uncomfortable. But I wanted to talk to you a little bit about that. How, you know, what are you grateful for? Now that you do the show, I know how much work it is to put it together. But I also know that you feel so happy and so much gratitude for how it's turned out."

        "message": "Yeah, I mean, two things. I mean, one, of course, to begin with gratitude towards my guests that they trust me, that they trust me to come on the show. They are generous with their time and their insights. And it's okay, you and I were friends before and people who've come on the show have come on the show have been friends. But there are many people who don't know me from Adam, who will still come on the show, and who will still sit and they will still speak with intellectual honesty, assuming goodwill, in good faith, and have that kind of conversation that is so enriching. So obviously, you know, that that's part of the whole thing that you're trusting yourself in the hands of a stranger, in a sense. And that's, you know, one essential thing, which is actually one reason why I've sort of taken it easy on having foreign guests, because I could, you know, write to foreign guests and get them, but they may not know me, they may not have heard that show. So that same level of trust isn't there, it can become a bit like a q&a, which, you know, a couple of episodes in the distant past have have gone that way. And it just doesn't feel like that relaxed conversation. So I feel much more comfortable doing an episode with someone who's probably, you know, heard me at some point, or at least heard of me or is willing to take that step and maybe listen to an episode or, you know, engage. So that's great. And the other thing, obviously, is like you said, the listeners, the listeners are incredible, and I don't even know what to say. And like you said, one of the things is not just the depth of engagement, and very often, they'll disagree with me, but they'll be very polite. I mean, it's a you understand the dual meaning of the term civil society, that they are just neatly Yeah, that they're just so polite. And you know, when they're engaging with you on Twitter, it seems like it seems like a world within a world because Twitter is otherwise so shouty and adversarial and all of that. And then you have this sort of very polite, reasoned engagement from folks, which I really value. I mean, the one thing I block for on Twitter is actually rudeness. Anyone is rude, I just block them. You know, and but, you know, so many of the listeners and they'll disagree with me and they'll say they disagree and they'll say where they disagree and whatever. And they're just so polite. And, and it's also kind of struck me that, you know, since I opened up support for, you know, when I asked people to buy me a cup of coffee from April onwards, if they enjoyed listening to an episode of the show, so many people were so generous. And I just want to say here that, you know, I didn't have time to sort of, I couldn't write to each of them in person and thank them for it. But also, because I procrastinate, and I'm really bad at this stuff and email and all that. And I have literally 1000s of 100 emails and all of that. But I was blown away by it. It's really been enough to keep the show independent. And I appreciate that, because that means I don't have to, I don't have to tailor it for anybody else. But just keep going in the directions that I want to go. And like this episode, I think is already well over four hours. And I can do this, no one's going to say, you know, no one's going to come up with old fangled notions of who listens to something so long. And all of that. So yeah, so I'm kind of, you know, I'm just, in a sense, grateful to even beyond these two categories of people to guests and listeners to, to just dumb luck that's brought me in a situation where I've discovered something that gives me satisfaction and that I'm enjoying for however long it lasts. I mean, I've reached 200. And I think one of the questions said, may you do hundreds more. And I don't think it's going to happen. But it's nice to get this far and to feel that I'm still part of the journey. And, you know, while putting together my course for podcasting, I started thinking deeper about it and realized that I'm still learning so much about it. And then that makes it so exciting. And that one can kind of go ahead and do that. Yeah, but that that's, that's broadly,"

I spoke about this before a little bit, you've cracked open an audience for a policy podcast, right? Things that people thought were just impossible, you yourself thought anything longer than 20 minutes is going to, you know, just not work. And you are brave enough to experiment, right? You're brave enough to put it out there and say, I'm going to do this. And let's see if it works. Or if it doesn't work, I'll change it. And so that is incredible. And what you've done is you've created a very keen listening audience, which is different from a keen reading audience, right? It's a little bit different. And there's a lot of overlap. But you've created this entire space for policy podcasts, and whether it is Pawan, who's been a guest on your show, whether it's Pranay, you know, whether it is Hamsini, myself, Srinath, Pooja Mehra, we've all launched our own podcast, I'm sure I'm missing a few people. And so much of our initial audience has come from the seen and the unseen, or because of some recall value, right? That, oh, I heard them on the seen and the unseen, and I enjoyed that episode. And I would love to listen to them. And in that sense, you know, you really are sort of a model for how to create a market, how to expand it. And it also takes generosity and mentorship. I know you've mentored each one of us, I've never heard you say, hey, I'm doing this. So I don't want you to do the same thing, you would be as generous, you know, to someone who is launching the seen and the unseen part two versus, you know, someone who's doing something very remote from what you're doing, or someone who's doing it in a different language. And, and I think that policy podcast space, you know, at least I'm very grateful, and a lot of us are grateful that you exist. The other thing I think people are grateful for is the books, right? I mean, I watch this on Twitter all the time, there are people who have shelves in their homes, which are the seen and the unseen shelf, right? Which is all the book recommendations that they got from your show, and then they picked up those books, and they enjoyed reading it. And that, of course, creates this whole other ecosystem, whether it is, you know, publishers, I know many publishers are vying to get their next book launched on your show and things like that. But even book authors, you know, someone who spent a couple of years writing a book, the kind of very sympathetic and generous profiling you'll give, you know, like you said, you're not one of those literary festival spiels, where you talk to five people for 10 minutes, and they come with this programmed spiel about their book. This is a very different kind of conversation, whether it's profiling the author. So I think all of these things I am very grateful for, like there are so many books, I wouldn't have discovered, I never read as much history, you know, before I started listening to the show, it was more policy and economics and things like that. You know, I mean, something like, you know, I mean, Chitmai, of course, is an economist, so I would have, you know, read him, but something like Ira Mukherjee's book, right, would have not been anywhere on my radar, for instance, right, or the book with Anshul Malhotra on partition, right, I would have just, you know, thought, oh, this is a sentimental, sweet memoir sort of thing, you know, I'll read it later. And, and the way I have the discovery process is another thing I'm grateful for. It's not getting an annoying mailer. It is not a publisher, like bombarding you with things. It's someone really thoughtful, who is carefully putting this together, you know, for an entire community building out other ecosystems. So that's another thing I'm very grateful for, as far as your podcast is concerned. I'll just say a couple"

You know, when you have voluntary interactions, so so so yeah, it's not like a grand plan, or that I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that I'm going to make people read more, I'm going to do whatever, whatever that has happened has happened, you know, has been an unseen and actually unforeseen effect. It has been organic has been an unforeseen effect of my just following my own intellectual journey and my curiosities and kind of getting there. So I feel as I feel blessed. And the other side of it is as far as helping others is concerned, is that I think there was a time when I was much younger, when I might have been competitive about it. What helps me not be competitive at all, is the sense that I am making something across time, which is, I think, you know, and broadly, like I said, I'm also making the show for listeners of 30 years later. And that approach is something I come to almost out of necessity. Because I think I have realized that as far as the ways I think about the world and my ideas and all of that, it's basically, you know, it's, it's, it's kind of a lonely road. And even in terms of success, you know, I might not achieve any kind of success with anything I do immediately or in the short run. That's the default attitude I've taken after all these years of doing whatever I have done, because I have sort of been on the margins of every community I've been sort of involved with, in a sense, and I'm used to people not taking me seriously. So I figured that, okay, I'm not going to bother about all that and think about present day validation and riches and all of that. I'm just going to do something I love. And maybe, you know, 30 years later, people can look back and say, okay, these were great conversations. And I know that sounds very vain and arrogant for anyone to imagine that he can create something of value, even for the present moment as an act of arrogance. But to say that 30 years later, people will be listening to this or reading me is even more so. But, you know, what do you do? That's what you do, right? So, no, I don't, I don't"

        "message": "question because it gives me some time to sort of get away from us answering the second one, which I don't yet have an answer for. But no, my fascination for TikTok is because of, I think, one, of course, the quality of the creativity within TikTok, if you look at it. And two, I think it, like I taught a course called, I put together a course called TikTok in Indian society. I taught only one batch of it because TikTok was banned by then. So there was no way for, I mean, I had all the videos downloaded and I taught it on WhatsApp because that's the only way to send people hundreds of vertical format videos. And then I decided no point doing it again because people can't actually see TikTok. But the reason I was blown away for it is that I think it gave a voice to people who did not otherwise have a voice before that. Like, I think a couple of things happened in India simultaneously. One is that broadband on smartphones became much more widespread, I won't say ubiquitous, became much more widespread at a certain point in time, partly because of what Jio was doing. And forget Jio's means of getting there and the cronyism that might or might not be involved. But the bottom line was that broadband became much more accessible to many more people. And then along came an app which actually empowered them by, you know, allowing them to showcase their own creativity. Now, here's the thing. If you think of popular culture in India, you know, popular culture in India has gatekeepers and is run by elites. For example, just take Bollywood. I mean, I know there are film industries across the country. Let's take one of them. Let's take Bollywood, where if you look at the, there are two different kinds of elites which dominate Bollywood today though is gradually changing. And one is that old school elite who have their old school regressive attitudes, which they bring into everything. And the other is perhaps their kids who have gone abroad and studied and come back and they're like the woke elites and they've got a different conception of what entertainment is and what they should do with it. But they're both out of touch with the real India, which is not a judgment on either of them. But you know, they're in cities and they've lived different lives and they're out of touch with the real India. And what TikTok did was that it did, it changed this at two levels. One is that it allowed anyone to create anything without a gatekeeper being there and put it up. Two, as consumers, it made them realize that there is a world of entertainment out there on TikTok, which has not come through these gatekeepers and which reflects their lives and their values and their struggles. And you see this in various little niches, for example, the LGBTQI community, where you have an outpouring of incredible creativity and self-assertion, confident self-assertion from them on TikTok, because suddenly so many people realize that they are not alone, that there are so many others like themselves. And it's one thing to be an English speaking, marginalized person in a city and to be able to go on the internet and see people like yourself and connect with people like yourself. But if you don't know English, if you're in a village somewhere or whatever, and you might feel that you are a freak, it will affect your self-image and the way you live your life and all of that, which I think was, you know, true for marginalized people over decades. And suddenly along comes this app and on this app, you see that, you know, that you are not alone in a sense that there are people in identical social conditions to yours and identical orientations to yours who are expressing themselves powerfully and the kind of sort of create. And obviously, a lot of the creativity is the lowest form of humor. There'll be puns and there'll be memes getting played out. But there's also a lot of sophisticated humor. There's also a lot of heartbreaking stuff and some insane creative talent on TikTok, like, my God, so good, you know, and then it got banned. And it's such a tragedy. I feel like it's personal that it's, I mean, I just feel so sad about it. It's horrible. And it also tells you the happenstance that if that particular app which worked like that didn't come across at that particular time, this would not have happened. And now you've left them high and dry again. But the question here for entrepreneurs and for people who, you know, feel the way I do is that think of the unknown unknowns of the future, what are the ways in which you can sort of fill some of these gaps that even people may not know exist, people in those gaps may not know exist. And, you know, and there's so much hope for doing something there. And that moment"

And it's just become this extraordinary platform, right. And I think TikTok did something similar.

And they said, okay, he'll repeal it. But the other point that I kind of want to make here is that the loss is not just that a niche is not being served, but that it is not being discovered. Like one of the points I make in my podcasting course about the difference between radio and podcasting is that because radio out of necessity has to be so broad, that not only can it not serve certain niches, they don't even discover those niches and those niches don't discover themselves. And you see, for example, in the newsletter, if you go to the top paid newsletters at Substack, and you'll see so many niches being covered there that Bill Bishop is doing cynicism, which is a newsletter on China, and it is such a huge hit and is making him so much money and who would have thought that niche existed. Emily Oster is, you know, doing the economics of parenthood and pregnancy and all of that. And that's a hugely popular newsletter. And there is that niche, you know, even the seen and the unseen serves a particular kind of niche. If I had to apply for a license for a podcast, and I told someone I'm going to do three hour interviews with intellectuals who write obscure books, like no way, man, it's crazy. I myself would have thought it was crazy, crazy. I discovered it by the serendipity of just get being able to do it in the technology existing. And I think tiktok served some of that. Yeah. And now I'm not going to let you weasel your way out of Chinmay's question. Chinmay's question if I had to do? I don't know, man. I've never actually thought about it. Because tiktok is the one sort of medium where I was just a pure consumer. I never fantasized about doing something on it. So I have, I have no idea if tiktok existed, I would take it up as a challenge and maybe do something. And maybe fulfill Ram Guha's request as well and do something on Rajaji. I can't, you know, nothing really comes to mind, I guess I'd pick up an existing meme and subvert it in some way and just kind of run with that. But I think the thing with tiktok, if I were to start a channel just thinking aloud, I think I'd start off doing mundane, boring things, which in retrospect would seem horrible. But then over a period of time, it would evolve. And it would probably be my 100 video, which would be nice. And my 3000 video, which which would be incredible. And then I would get"

I have sort of now one our memory is sort of tainted by who we become at any particular point in time. So we look at memories differently.

And the second time I got to celebrate with you and Nandu and Yazad and all the other friends who were there. But I don't, I don't know. I think that somehow, you know, how does one even define happiness? It's, you know, and does happiness exist when you consciously think about a moment and you say, I am happy now? If you just experience it without without classifying it like that, is it happiness? Can there be, for example, the quiet happiness of enjoying a sunset without my thinking about it and therefore classifying it as a happy moment? So yeah, so there are, as usual, I've got a little meta and ask these meta questions. So I don't really know, maybe happiness is would be personal moments that I wouldn't want to share here.

And I'm also sounding I'm sure incredibly ungrateful to all the people who've given me happy moments that I don't think of those or they don't kind of automatically come to mind. But I mean, conceptually, what is happy, I can look back on a memory that has happened and classify it in retrospect as happy, even if in that particular moment, it might have been some other elation, such as an unseemly pride or whatever, going through me. I mean, memory is a strange thing, right? Like, you know, the way memory works is, and of course, I discussed memory in great detail in with Anshul in the episode I did with her, which another episode I enjoyed a lot. But, you know, memory strange in the sense that the way our brain works is that the first time we remember, remember something, we remember it. But the second time we remember it, we are remembering the remembering. And across time, therefore, memory becomes fiction. It becomes fiction. So in that sense, and we are inventing our own fiction and adding to it as we go along. So in that sense, I can I can look back on past events on my life as either happy or unhappy in retrospect.

So and now to move on to Vinayak's second question, which was about why don't I start a publication like Yashamong's Persuasion? It's you know, so I was editor of Pragati, which is a magazine of ideas and policy and whatever. And one of the problems with something like that is just finding enough writers that do we have such a rich ecosystem full of intellectuals where you can get enough content out regularly? And, you know, and if I were to make a list of just a guest on my show, the answer would seem like yes, but then you have to get them to write regularly and all of that. And it just didn't feel at that time, like it would be worthwhile, maybe when the ecosystem is richer, maybe 20 years later, or 10 years later, maybe someone could do that. But if I were to do that, I think that there's a danger that it would just fizzle out that they wouldn't be that I'd be working much harder than I would like to, to try and get people to write for it. And there just wouldn't be enough of them. And I think that that's kind of the thing with the intellectual ecosystem. That is one thing that you know, people can have the generosity to come on my show for three hours and have a relaxed conversation and all that. But actually writing and then writing regularly is a whole different ballgame. So just speaking from my own experience of trying to do a version of it, it's difficult. I have had various ideas at times for media startups in the sense that I think that the way people consume and discover content in India has changed radically over the last 10 years and no publication mainstream or otherwise gets it. So I've often thought that why don't I try to fill the gap and do interesting things, but I just don't have the appetite to be an entrepreneur. And the thing is, everything has an opportunity cost. The scene in the unseen takes some time and I want to get down to writing books, which is what I'm trying to do now. And you know, which is the one thing I've always wanted to do. And if I don't do more of that, I'll sort of that's the one thing I'll regret. So that's what I'm trying to get down to. So I'm not sure I really have the time and that, you know, yeah, so that that's kind of a short answer. And as to the third thing, when I said that, he hopes I keep doing it forever. Look, I love doing it. So I'll keep doing it for as long as I can. But, you know, one doesn't even live forever. So who is to say?"

I mean, he's an incredible person and entrepreneur, just such a kind, wonderful person and mentor, but has the most remarkable voice, which is completely wasted in his day job in his regular life. And I feel like, you know, he could read, I don't know the yellow pages and, and it would still be amazing to listen to him. So here's Mohit's question. And you are going to complain I didn't give you more time, but for what it's worth, here it is."

I almost think of him as family in a sense, like when I go to Delhi, I stay over at Mohit and Premi's place and just I have great love for him. He asked me this question on WhatsApp a few days ago, by the way. And it's not such a difficult question to answer because and the answer will seem like a cop out. But it's a genuine answer that I don't care. I mean, I'll be gone. So what difference does it make what my epitaph reads? I mean, I don't have the vanities of leaving a legacy and all and this might seem at odds with what I said earlier about creating a show for 30 years later and all of that. But it gives me pleasure to think that I'm sort of, I might be able to create that kind of content. But once you're gone, you're gone. So it doesn't really matter. You know, the thing is, I don't anymore have the vanities that I did as a much younger person that I will imagine that I can change the world in some way or that my ideas have great meaning or resonance or whatever. So I don't know, I'm kind of, I'm kind of pessimistic about, you know, any epitaph. It's just, you know, one does what one does. But I think you're thinking of it too literally,"

        "message": "right? An epitaph has two purposes. One, of course, it's you're leaving something behind in the world to be remembered by and things like that. The other is, it's also a very pithy way of summing up a very rich, large, fulfilled life. So I will ask you Mohit's question from the second point of view, not from a point of view of vanity, but like, what would you want to be known for? What would you like the life to add up to? Okay, tough question. Like you said, no preparation."

        "message": "There are different aspects to it. I mean, one can break it down and say that what would you, like the way you phrased it, what would you like to be remembered for? Or the other way of looking at it is like, what would you have liked to achieve, have achieved in your own life? Like if I am on my deathbed and I look back, what is my epitaph to myself? And the thing is, the answers would be completely different. And in the first case, at some level, when people look back, it's fleeting. Yeah. You know, maybe as someone who, you know, engaged with the world with intellectual honesty, or made people think about the world a little differently. That would be nice. You know, the things I want to be remembered for are things that I want to go ahead and do, such as in the books I write, and not anything that I have done yet. So if you're expecting me to say that in someone who had great conversations on a podcast, that's not my answer. I'm very happy to have done this. But I don't think it's that memorable that people will remember. It's not the iconic status of econ talk, for example, 750 episodes or whatever. But even otherwise, I, you know, what one would like to do in an ideal world is that you want to sort of let your ideas reach far and wide, you know, the way Bastia's ideas reach me, but it is such vanity to expect to have that kind of an impact on people. And also, I grew less and less hopeful of that happening. But I want to sort of increase the probability of that happening by at least doing everything I can to that end, which involves writing the books and continuing this podcast, so that when I can others can enjoy listening to it. So I guess that's it. I mean, this is just, you know, I don't know. What's your answer, dude? To my epitaph? Yeah."

You know, it's gonna be something very simple, something that brings me joy. You know, this is the perfect spot for your dog to be. That's probably what the tombstone and the epitaph is worth, if I was being facetious. But it would be something really simple. I don't, I mean, I certainly don't think of myself as like a public intellectual of your caliber or anything like that. But I think, you know, the, the bigness and the richness of my life is always in the personal, you know, that, you know, you know, enough about me and my life and my private life and my family to know that.
