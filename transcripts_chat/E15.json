That's a good start because I could have died and found myself in a traffic jam on the Western Express Highway on a Friday evening, which I suppose is one idea of hell. Anyway, so I died and went to heaven and I didn't even need an Aadhaar card to get in. They took one look at me and said, Come on in, Mr. Verma. You've been a good man. You fought the good fight against the evil tentacles of the devil's spawn, also known as government. Welcome to heaven. I walked in and it was beautiful. The air smelt of jasmine, a flower particularly close to my heart. And the grass was green, the air was fresh. And all around me were picnic baskets with seafood platters in them. Oh, the prawns. I ate six prawns from one of those platters, though I should have stopped at two. And then I noticed that all the buildings around me look the same. In fact, they were all cinema halls. I went to the nearest such amphitheater, where the attendant told me that people in heaven did nothing but watch movies all the time and eat seafood platters. This really is heaven, I thought to myself. I walked up to the movie schedule. All my favorite filmmakers were listed. There was Kieslowski, there was Fellini, there was Scorsese, there was Shatrujit Rai. But then I noticed one problem. All these films were dubbed in Kannada. I don't know Kannada. Maybe this was a Kannada amphitheater. I asked the attendant about this, who told me that every single theater in heaven showed only Kannada films. All non-Kannada films had to be dubbed into Kannada before they were allowed to release. But why? I asked. Why this rule? Why only Kannada? At this moment, I realized that the attendant looked just like my friend, Bhawan Srinath. In fact, he was my friend, Bhawan Srinath. Bhawan looked at me, grinned widely and said, This is payback!"

This is so bizarre. Why? So, this is obviously unconstitutional and illegal. But what happened was, the state, by the way, was born out of a new political movement in independent India, right? Around 1956. And around that time, the Kannada film industry was also trying to find its feet. People who are thought of as stalwarts today, you know, people like Rajkumar in Karnataka, they were up and coming back then, and the South Indian film industry was dominated and run out of Chennai. So, movies were coming into Bangalore and Mysore and other regions of Karnataka, but they were all dubbed from Tamil into Kannada. So, this started as a little protectionist movement to say that, hey, no dubbing allowed into Kannada. We will just have our own movies for our own public. And what started from that sort of a protectionist move just became the norm for close to 50 audience."

They were starting from scratch. So, I don't particularly want to judge them too harshly. They did what they could. And remember that this was also a time where the politics around the language was very important. So, they drew strength saying that by defending the Kannada film industry and protecting its interests, they can protect the interests of Kannada as a language and Kannadiga as a set of language speakers."

So, here is this one state government and in this one state where it's sort of protected and allowed to flourish, right?"

So, what's happened is, while 50 years ago, people in say Mysore and Belgaum and various parts of Karnataka would go watch movies in Kannada, they slowly started shifting to watching movies in Malayalam, watching movies in Telugu, in Tamil and so on, many of them which have very, very dynamic film industry. So, what happened was the market for Kannada movies itself started shrinking and the quality of Kannada movies also started deteriorating. So, one of the things if you see, the Kannada film industry today is about 2% of the South Indian film industries combined. Population wise, we are like a fourth, if not more, but the film industry is that much smaller. There are no corporate houses which are investing into Kannada films the way they are with Telugu and Tamil films. Why? Because it's now a very bad market with this ban on dubbing just being one of the many protectionist moves by the film industry."

And as the market shrank, incentives grew smaller for people to come in and make quality films for that market. And it became a sort of a vicious circle, which is why the film industry is at such a pathetic\u2026"

Because those people who can understand other languages a little bit are watching that. But a lot of people don't understand any language other than Kannada. And so, they are completely robbed of entertainment options. They are robbed of television programming as well. I mean, so, though this ban started with the film industry, today, as of a couple of years ago, you couldn't have an English cartoon channel in Kannada, you couldn't have the history channel, National Geographic, Discovery Channel, none of these could be dubbed into Kannada. And this is the age where they started getting dubbed into almost every other Indian language, enabling access to quality science and history and, you know, kiddy entertainment content that would have otherwise been impossible for us to create locally."

A differential entertainment tax. So, all those things that are, well, a little par for the course in the country. But what's like the, the layer of cream on this horrible cake?

You know, it had complete narrative dominance that this is good for Kannadigas, this is good for the industry and everyone. Around then, you had a lot more Kannadigas who became more prosperous, who entered the tech industry in Bangalore, who entered other things, who had also seen the world a little and started writing about, hey, you know, our film industry is terrible. In fact, there was a whole period and there's a whole type of films in the Kannada film industry called the machu long films, talking about the machetes and the long machetes.

For the first time, there was this growing public awareness that the film industry's interests are not the same as the languages interests. And it's amazing to look at the motivations of those who went on this. It was not just that people who were, you know, liberal, fighting for liberty, fighting for economic freedom. But basically, the argument was that if you have, say, Discovery Channel getting dubbed into Kannada, then you will have more Kannada words that get created and that get used. I mean, right now, for example, the internet is called Antar Jala, Antar Jala, right, which is a literal translation of inter and web. And, you know, the moment you have more dubbing happening of, you know, music, entertainment, science, history, you will just have more words that are coming into Kannada, more the language gets modernized as a result of it. So, from a deep rooted language development and activism angle, they sort of came in and said, hey, let's have more competition in the film industry."

We need to protect our language. And this is speaking on behalf of the language and saying that instead of protecting the language, quote unquote, by shutting access, we need to make it richer by opening access, which is such a fantastic argument that it's not, like you said, this is not an argument made on grounds of liberalism or individual freedom or what have you.

Now, as a result of this, a few years ago, the Consumers Association got together and filed a case with the Competition Commission saying that the film industry is acting as a cartel and it's abusing market power and doing a lot of illegal things, including sort of brute force thuggery, you know, threatening people if they wanted to go against the consensus. And the Competition Commission took its time and then finally said, look, they are illegal. I mean, the practices are illegal and even slapped some fines on to the film industry association and related bodies. So, does the law still exist? There's never been a law which bans dubbing. So, this is a mob rule in action. This is the state not enforcing the rule of law. So, what has happened as a result is stakeholders, market players have become risk averse. They just don't want to take the risk to do something like this. No one wants to be the first one to dub a movie, you know, when the returns are very uncertain. So, what the Competition Commission judgment and other things have done is they've signaled saying, look, this is all right. You should go ahead. You sort of have the blessing of the state. And after the decision a couple of years ago, you've had about three movies getting dubbed into Kannada. They're small movies. They're not things that you would actually want to go to watch in a theater, but they're something. And now the campaign is on to get a big Indian movie or a big foreign movie dubbed into Kannada because that would be the watershed moment.

But Raj Kumar was a big, very, very big figure within that small industry. And, you know, he had played past kings from the Kannada history. So, you know, you have all that symbolism around him. So, when the film industry is seen as a champion of the language and the history and the culture of that state, there's a lot of cognitive dissonance in people's heads that these guys are the ones who are responsible for keeping our language where they are. And to have fought that successfully over a decade, and this is a shout out to one of my friends, Vasan Shetty, very active in the Consumers Forum. They've done a mammoth job to marshal all kinds of arguments and persuade large numbers of people over a decade that this is the wrong thing.
