But in truth government consists of human beings like you and me who respond incentives and their own self interest. Therefore, the sharpest way to study and understand government is to use economics because economics is after all, the study of human behavior. human behavior and for a country like india with the tentacles of a parasitic and predatory government are present everywhere the most fascinating branch of economics to study is that which deals with government public choice theory"

        "message": "really my favorite branch of economics and i keep saying that it's see economics to me you know it's not some arcane subject economics is the subject of human behavior under conditions of scarcity but basically it's the study of human behavior and public choice is a branch of that which has incredible insights for the state of india today if you want to understand the indian state the indian government why are people corrupt why do politicians behave the way they do all of those things and it helps in the central insight of public choice theory is this that people in government whether they're politicians or bureaucrats are human beings who respond to incentives so you know economists speak in terms of incentives and they're like okay this is how within this market different parties behave these are the incentives they have and you must also think of government like that and when you look at government action everything becomes explicable if you look at it through the lens of interest now i write a monthly column for lumber quint which is called politics without romance which is a phrase by james buchanan the father of public choice theory in a sense because politics without romance is what public choice theory is you look at politics without romance you look at the incentives of people you know how people really are and the first column of those in fact examined the question that people often ask a lot that you know back in the days of independence we had so many great leaders uh you know but today you look at all the politicians they're all venal corrupt guys why and people bemoan it as if you know we had good people then we have bad people now lots of nostalgia gone are the great days of you know stalwart leaders who could whether it's nehru or patel or whoever your favorite hero of choices but my point is that it's not that we had great leaders then and we had great leaders now we had great incentives and and the incentives that we have now are guaranteed to produce us venal crooks and the reason for that for example is that what animated the people who fought for india's freedom uh they had no chance of getting to government they had no chance of getting to power and making money from it so those sort of baser instincts were not there people who wanted to make money or have power over others did other things they did not fight for india's freedom because the the the risk reward ratio was way out of whack so all of these people were high-minded people who were driven by principles and so on and so forth and therefore you have all these great leaders and if you look at that generation of leaders in the 30s and 40s and so on the nehru's and patel's and even the shama prashad mukherjee's and so on it doesn't matter which side of the spectrum you are they are animated by higher principles whether or not you specifically agree with those principles what we have today is that you're animated by different things the state is such a bloated beast and there is so much power that typically what are the incentives for a politician the incentives for a politician is i want to win the next election and come to power so he needs two things for this one is he needs money because elections in india are incredibly costly the money comes to him from special interest groups and that means that they want a quid pro quo of some sort so it could be for example an association of small retailers who pays you money and in return for their funding you you have to look after their interest maybe by banning fdi and retail so and this is a very concrete example because bjp until recently used to be against fdi in retail because they were a party funded by small retailers and the aam aadmi party in delhi still is against fdi in retail and you have any kind of interventions in markets like that typically what they're doing is they're harming the consumer at large to the benefit of the small interest group in this case you're harming all the consumers who would benefit from a more competitive retail market and they're benefiting the small retailers in question and so people say for example arvind kejriwal isn't corrupt but hey you know what is this corruption is an inbuilt part of the political the electoral system but anyway i don't want to you know we shouldn't name specific politicians here so the point is that this is one of the incentives of politicians today are driven by the interest groups that play on whose money they are dependent so it is not just that you know prime minister modi people say is captured by ambani adani it's like come on i mean every government was ever was captured by ambani you basically have you know different kinds of interest groups running the show and the second kind of pressure group is voters because india's politics is all identity politics it's the first pass of votes vote system it's a very fractured electorate and therefore every election typically goes down to figuring out which are your vote banks will this caste support me will that particular class of people support me what is your vote bank and then catering to that vote bank and using patronage to benefit that vote bank in some way so that you get their votes so therefore all politicians are caught up in this endless cycle between power and money where then necessarily have to play these kind of games and sell themselves out completely to get to power which then ensures that the only kinds of people that politics attracts are people like that people who don't mind their principles being corroded and all of that who don't really care about the public service because where's the incentive now those kind of people you won't see in politics anymore it's people like this"

        "message": "question and that leads to let me first answer questions of why we should not vote and then i'll come to why we should vote and i'll have more reasons of the former kind but i think we should look at both sides of the case there are three reasons why we should not bother about voting one is what economists call rational ignorance now here's the thing you and i both know that uh it is likely that our single vote is not going to influence an election we might go to vote anyway on the day of voting but we know that a single vote is very unlikely to influence an election therefore since the benefit of that single vote is so little it is rational also not that the cost should be little and that we don't spend too much on it what does that mean that means that voters don't spend enough time understanding the processes of government and what different policies different parties have and how the state works and so on it doesn't make sense for them to spend too much time studying those things because the benefit is very little one vote is not going to do much so it is rational for them to be ignorant that's called rational ignorance and in fact there's a philosopher jason brennan who will be on my show soon i've already recorded with him who in a book not the one i'm talking about in my episode with him but in a separate book examines the ethics of voting jason brennan and he in fact makes the argument that it is immoral to vote if you don't know enough that if you are ignorant then your vote could do more harm than good and therefore that is a reason to not vote but i mean that's a normative argument for not voting but if you look at it in practical terms rational ignorance is why you will find that voters tend to be ignorant and that many of them because ignorant they decide what's the point and they just it's rational not to vote as well second reason which is kind of related and which has something to do with public choices if you look at all of politics it involves a redistribution of resources from the many to the few right so for example in the example that i'd used earlier banning fdi in retail all the consumers at large lose a little value and all of that goes to certain interest groups and that's known as diffuse costs and concentrated benefits the costs are diffused so if i have had like if i'm getting two rupees a month taken away from my pocket i don't really give a damn but you take away you do that from 20 million people and then you give 40 million rupees to one interest group it matters a lot for that interest group so that interest group will then be very motivated and very incentivized to interfere in politics and do things but for me because i am you know it's only two rupees i may not even know it's the unseen effect as it were i may not even know i'm losing that two rupees i won't be that incentivized or motivated to actually go out and vote or to protest in other ways and because people very often don't know the harm that is being done to them because it's an unseen effect it's what does not happen uh you know they don't get that extra value from something they don't know they haven't got it that they might be apathetic about voting a third reason not just for not voting but for also not for participating in civic action is what is called the free rider problem which is that for example somewhere let us say a dam is coming up it will do a lot of damage so you will find you know the medha patkar and those activists they will be leading it and there will be those normal NGO groups which will be leading it which have their own incentives but whatever but let us say that you know that the dam affects you adversely or the policy affects you adversely but you'll say it's affecting a million people adversely let them do the action in a similar way if there is like a bad politician or somebody who should be out of power it is tempting therefore to think that my vote won't make a difference make you go let others vote the person out let others put in the effort and in a democracy the free rider problem is a bit of a problem a fourth reason for voting which is actually my reason for not voting and it only applies if all the options are equally unpalatable so i would consider it my duty to go out and vote if i found that one party was substantially better than the rest but if all the parties are equally bad perhaps unwise in the long run to choose the least evil option instead of not voting at all because think of the political marketplace as a marketplace let's say i want to buy a shirt i go to the mall all the shirts there are crap right so the best thing for me to do is to not settle for the worst shirt and to not buy a shirt at all and my not buying a shirt the absence of the activity sends a signal to the market that there is a gap in the marketplace and some entrepreneur will come and fill the gap similarly by not voting uh you know you can see the statistics that these many percentage of people don't vote and any political entrepreneur can then see that and say that there is so much apathy these people there's a gap in the market let us go in and try to fill the gap and this is especially valid in what is a fractured marketplace where you can get 25 percent of the vote and win a seat and if 25 percent of the people aren't voting then it makes sense for somebody to an entrepreneur to say that i'm going in there and in a sense uh without necessarily parsing those numbers that is what arvind kejriwal did with the aam aadmi party he recognized that there was widespread apathy among voters and that there was widespread disillusionment with the existing political parties and he positioned himself quite perfectly and quite brilliantly as an alternative who was different from the rest and he went in and he occupied that space which in that limited political marketplace of delhi at that time worked now whether you think much of kejriwal or not as it happens i don't this illustrates the point that if there is a gap in the marketplace somebody may come and fill it and i think therefore it is my duty as a citizen to indicate my dissatisfaction with all of the choices available these are all arguments for"

        "message": "do i i'll speculate on a why they do vote and b why they should vote because i am torn myself uh over this i can see both sides of the question one reason people have speculated why they do vote is that in a sense the act of voting for the party of your choice is almost like a tribal act similar to supporting your football team by going to the stadium and watching the match so let's say you are a mumbai indians fan or a manchester united fan or whatever the case may be though i know many indian manchester united fans have never been to manchester but leave that aside but it's like okay so you support this cricket team and it becomes like a tribal act of solidarity and kinship to actually go to the stadium and cheer for your team or even gather with your friends and you all have beers and you punch the air and though i don't think real fans believe behave like that that's just what the show on tv when fans are watching whatever a high five yeah who does a high five in real life and somebody hits a four or maybe i'm just old and jaded by now so that's that's kind of one reason that it's a signaling thing that they are signaling their membership and their kinship of these people that they feel solidarity with which might be also valid given how much of india's politics takes place along lines of identity one possible reasons among many others it would be absolutely simplistic to say this is the main reason anything like that i mean a lot of people no doubt do hope for change and so on and so forth uh but i think the reason why one should vote the normative reason is that look we are a democracy and the thing is that even if one vote doesn't make a difference it might still be considered you might still say that no it is still my duty even if it doesn't make a difference to go out and vote because if everybody does this then you know there is in the end a difference and if i make the effort of going out and voting then i because i am you know taking that cost upon myself i will then i might then make the effort to justify that cost of actually going and voting by actually being more of an informed citizens about things that matter so i can make a a good choice so in that sense i think you should for example it's it's this and i'm just thinking aloud here and might not make sense but i think just in the same way that i think it makes sense for us to normatively follow certain rules in our lives even if in a particular instance we might be able to breach it for example you might have a rule that i will never lie and or for example you know i'll take a much simpler example when i drive around if i'm turning left i always turn the indicator to left now i do this even when there is only a left and everybody is going left and it's one o'clock in the morning and there's no one on the road with me but i do it anyway it's a normative act what this means is that a i am saving effort by automating this process and b it means that at all times i will do this and there is never an occasion where i need to do it where it so happens that i don't do it and you could say this applies to ethical behavior as well how you treat other people with courtesy and so on for example should you tip at a restaurant that you're never going to go to again if you're traveling now i make it a point always to leave a tip and the thing is then the question comes up is if i'm visiting a city and i'm never going to go to that restaurant again should i tip and sometimes it's just a good thing to always tip and there might be different opinions on this and you could say you could in a cold way say it's rational not to tip but you could also in a similar way say that it is rational to tip every time because that is normatively a good way to behave within society they are both rational"

indians would agree that corruption is a huge problem but i don't think there's enough of an adequate appreciation of what causes corruption corruption is not caused by bad people you put a good person there the good person won't take a bribe no that is not what causes corruption is caused by power right you give one set of people power over another set of people they will be corrupt because as lord acton said power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely and i would sort of say something which seems extremist but i kind of believe in it i would say power always corrupts it is in the nature of power to corrupt because your incentives change completely now what the problem with the indian state is that i often say the indian state is both too large and too weak it's too weak because it doesn't do the few things it ought to do properly like maintain rule of law or whatever the few basic things reasonable people can all agree on doesn't have enough manpower doesn't have straight capacity doesn't do them properly it is too large because it has too much procedure it might have too few people in some places it has too much procedure in some other places now what is that procedure that procedure is for example if you are starting a business and you need 40 licenses and for each one somebody has a power to end your dreams so you have to pay them right and you know like i did an episode on restaurant regulations many months ago and one of the revelations in in that episode was that restaurant regulations at least in karnataka they have these two conflicting regulations where the excise people or rather the people who look after alcohol say that a restaurant should only have one entrance so they can monitor the inflow and outflow of alcohol only one entrance that is mandated the fire department mandates that for safety purposes you have to have more than one entrance so you have multiple entrances now the point is you whatever you however many entrances you do you are breaking the law if you have one entrance fire department will come after you if you have two entrances the alcohol guys will come after you so you have to bribe one of them and the truth of the matter is you don't have to bribe one of them you have to bribe two of them and you have to bribe the other 30 authorities involved which can this enough on the margins is enough to stop new businesses opening and to drive many existing businesses which would otherwise be barely profitable out of business and all of this is because you're giving discretion to government servants who have the power to use this and if you think about it you know a lot of what people who should be looking after the rule of law stopping violence investigating murders and rapes a lot of that effort instead goes on into figuring out how can we make money on the side because of all these bad laws like many years back i had written a column called the matunga racket and what the matunga racket was at that time 377 was still on the cards which made homosexual sex effectively illegal so what the matunga racket would do is that these cops would go on these online forums no grinder in those days were in 2007-2008 they would go on these online forums and they would pretend to be gay men looking for other gay men and they would call so and so to a spot near matunga station and the poor chap would turn up expecting an exciting rendezvous and three cops would surround him and they would say okay we'll file 377 or we'll call your home and tell your parents or whatever unless matlab ki atm jaate hain put the guy's card in take out whatever they feel like so on and so forth so i i wrote about it and it was a very common racket and now it can't take place why because the discretion in the context of that law is gone that law is gone so you cannot anymore catch a gay man at a railway station and extort money from him like this and a lot of what these bad laws do a lot of what these bad regulations do is they amount to extortion and the people who are supposed to protect your rights instead become the people who are extorting money from you and so this has been a bit of a tangent but my central point is that to end corruption the best way to do it is a is a twofold thing one is you reduce the discretion of the government in areas where the government has no business being like the government has no business being in your bedroom as ever with 377 you remove laws like that and the government has no business deciding which business should exist and who has a license or doesn't have a license take it out of that you know have complete ease of business remove all of that rent seeking that is one way and the other way is in areas where government does have to have power because there has to be a rule of law in certain areas government will have power in those areas you figure out ways and to change the incentives by making it more accountable and the key to that is by having governance which is as local as possible like on the scene and the unseen i had my guest shruti rajgopalan who's actually a much bigger expert in public choice economics and i could ever claim to be i'm just an enthusiast and shruti spoke about urban governance from the point of the mismatch over power and governance that your local legislator who you have control over uh you have power over doesn't actually he can't do anything for you and the people who can do something for you are the state legislatures who depend on the rural vote they don't give a shit about you so if governance is as local as possible if cities have strong empowered mayors village panchayats are empowered as they are to some degree now and you fix all of those local governance problems then you make them more accountable so dual solution reduce discretion where not required and where you need the presence of the state make it more accountable by making government more local and figuring out other ways"
