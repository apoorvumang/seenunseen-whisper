There was a sign that told me, welcome to heaven. So I went in and there was some sweet music at the start. And I thought, ah, this is going to be wonderful. Maybe there will be unlimited seafood platters here. Maybe there will be slaves in silk harem pants who will hold up grapes above my face as I reclined languorously on a couch. All day long, I will get massages from voluptuous women who keep telling me how slim I am, who giggle at all my bad jokes and flirt with me so endlessly that an accidental non-flirtatious statement seems like downright rudeness. The music will be mellow. The saffron will be yellow. This will be heaven. Instead, imagine my shock and horror when I find that it's really a dark and dingy dungeon. There are cockroaches all over. It smells like the underperformer in the Sulabh Shauchala family. There is ice cold water dripping from the ceiling. There are mosquitoes as big as frogs. There are frogs as big as cats with slimy skin that gives off mild electric shocks when they bump into you. The chairs have spikes on them. And worst of all, the music is Justin Bieber. I am in shock when I see all this. Am I really in heaven? I turn around towards the entrance and I see a babu in a safari suit wearing a badge that says, Undersecretary, Department of Salvation. What's going on? I ask him. Am I really in heaven? Yes, he says. You are. What happened to it? I ask. He replies, We nationalized it. Nationalized it."

In 1969, Indira Gandhi carried out a big wave of bank nationalizations with immensely noble stated intentions. Were those bank nationalizations good for us? What were their unintended effects? Indeed, are public sector banks structurally flawed in such a way that the very concept makes no sense? To discuss all this and more, I have as my guest on the show, my very good friend, Kumar Anand, an economist based in Mumbai. Welcome to the show, Kumar."

But the government's stated objective at that time itself, if you read the ordinance, when these ordinances were promulgated, when these ordinances were promulgated and banks were nationalized, the instrument through which it happened, they have said that we are basically taking these resources so that we can better plan the development of the country. As you know, after independence, what we had done was we adopted a central planning model of development and for that you need a lot of resources. But the problem that India faced, that we had a democracy and private properties. So, you can't do the kind of planning, which, for example, Soviet Russia did. So, you had to do these kind of appropriations."

So, for example, the planning entire thing started in 1950 and during the time we nationalized, in the decade of 1950, we nationalized transportation, we nationalized mining, we nationalized parts of insurance corporations. But always the reason of not getting the right result from the planning was given that we don't have enough resources. So, you kept on trying to get more and more resources and it was in that same spirit that we nationalized bank in 1969 and then again in 1980."

And the interesting immediate backdrop is that Indira Gandhi was sort of, this is when the Congress kind of broke into two, Congress I and Congress O. For Indira, because the other faction of the Congress was leaders who had lived through the narrow years but kind of learned from the mistakes and were trying for a course correction. The only way for Indira to differentiate herself was to go further leftward. And this kind of pro-poor rhetoric, though these actions of course harm the poor the most, but the rhetoric is pro-poor, was a very good way of setting her brand apart. You know, Garibi Hata, Indira is India and so on. So, tell me something, just going back to the scene objectives.

And when you nationalize these banks, so as I was mentioning the first tranche was done in 1969 when you nationalized 14 banks and then again in 1980 when you nationalized 6 more. So what you had was majority of the banking was all publicly owned, all owned by the government of India. So you couldn't say that what, you don't have basically a counterfactual. You can't say if there was a private sector bank, what would have happened? Because all banking in India at the time was owned by the government and run by them. So, both the objectives of financial inclusion and directed credit, in hindsight people have studied this. In 2008, I think Planning Commission set up a committee under the chairmanship of Raghuram Rajan and he studied public sector banking in a little bit detail, did some studies on ransom numbers and judged the effectiveness of public sector banking having existed for now about 30-40 years, what were the success. And on both the measures, it turned out that they had not done really well. So just to quickly tell you about a few of them. So take for example financial inclusion. On financial inclusion, the committee found that poor in richly branched urban areas have no more access than in poor in rural areas. So the problem of financial inclusion is not so much about availability of branches"

Then they also found that in rural areas where private banks are present, they don't discriminate against the poor. So at the end of the day, it's business for them. Rajan in fact has concluded that the kind of environment you want to build is where you compete for the poor. Now when you look at the other objective which was directed credit, in recent years we have seen that private banks have done better than public sector banking in achieving the priority sector lending criteria. Just to give you a quick background, the priority sector lending is something that RBI mandates that every commercial bank in India, private or public, will have to lend 40 rupees out to priority sectors which are agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises etc. So in those areas, the committee found that the private sector banks have done a much better job than a public sector bank. Then again coming back to the same directed credit, they also found that in terms of loan timing, in times of drought in a district, private banks appear to provide more agricultural loans while public sector banks are still harmful. And when it comes to quality of directed lending, the share of NPAs in the PSL has been higher for public sector banks."

So when you are running an enterprise, what is your objective? If it is a private enterprise, the objective is profit maximization. Now I should forewarn that the government and the public sector banks themselves they know that the profit maximization is not their goal. So their goal is financial inclusion and directed credit and we just saw that they have not been able to successfully achieve this credit. Now the incentive, the way it works for public sector banks they don't have too much of you know, they have complete job security. So no matter what mishap happens their jobs are guaranteed. They don't have any incentive or disincentive because if they do a good job they are not going to get a great pay hike or if they do a bad job"

So essentially what is true of all governments what is true of public sector banks therefore also is what Friedman mentioned in his four ways of spending so there are four ways in which you can spend money. One, you can spend your own money on yourself when you obviously try to maximize value because you are spending it on yourself but you also want to economize because it is your own money. The other is when you spend your money on someone else when you want to economize but you don't care so much about value because it is going to someone else. The third is when you spend someone else's money on yourself when you want value but you don't really care about economizing because it is someone else's money they will work in a company and send you on a foreign trip and you will be ordering whatever you want in room service because that is taken care of by the company. And the fourth way is when you spend somebody else's money on somebody else where you don't care about value and you don't care about economizing it is not your money you are not spending it on anyone else and that is all of government and to add to that this is the fact that all of government is therefore also tenured and their incentives are not there it is just their incentives revolve around how they can use their power for personal benefit and that is something that is a problem with any public sector enterprise especially public sector banks"
