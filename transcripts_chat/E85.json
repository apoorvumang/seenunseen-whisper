What economic benefit could justify the moral cost? They immediately arrest the journalist for being an urban naxal And one of them bends down to massage dear leader's foot Which is aching from pressing the accelerator so hard All for the good of the nation"

        "message": "Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen Today's episode is about demonetization A subject on which I have done a couple of episodes in the past You can look for them in our archives at seenunseen.in This episode is sparked by the RBI finally releasing the data On how much of the demonetized currency came back into the banking system 15.3 trillion rupees or 99.3% That basically is one final metric of the policy failure of demon As we call it now As if we needed any more metrics And my guest to talk about this today will be Shruti Rajgopalan But before I get to my conversation with her Allow me a small rant Because this is a subject I feel very very strongly about Right after demonetization was announced I wrote a bunch of pieces about how it was such a blunder They will all be linked on the page for this episode at thinkragati.com or seenunseen.in It was evident to me at the start That demon was wrong from both a moral and an economic lens In a piece I wrote for the Times of India shortly after demon was announced I pointed out the economic problems with it One, Modi claimed it was an attack on black money But this was nonsense The government's own estimates showed That only 6% of black money was kept in the form of cash The rest was gold or real estate or foreign accounts and so on Two, Modi said that demon would help fight counterfeit currency But the government's own estimates showed That only 1 in 4000 notes was fake Which is normal by standards across the world And which governments usually fight successfully by phasing out old notes Three, Modi said that terrorist activities would be hurt by this But cross-border terrorism has actually gone up in this time Leave alone domestic terrorism by gaurakshaks Four, Modi later said that this would help digitalization But data since is shown that digitalization Has followed the same upward trend it was on before demon And people are now back to using cash in the same way that they were before Also it's unclear why digitization is such a good thing anyway So none of the economic benefits were going to pan out anyway Now what about the costs? There are two kinds of costs here Economic costs and moral costs The economic costs were quite obvious If you remove 86% of the currency in use Where cash transactions are 97% of all transactions The economy will be crushed There are numerous estimates and descriptions of the damage that Narendra Modi did And I will point out one specifically striking figure to you My friend Nitin Pai first mentioned this That every 1% rise in the GDP Brings 2 million people out of poverty The opportunity cost of demonetization is much more than this And naturally the rich were hurt the least They used their connections to launder their money One indication of that being automobile sales in the months following demon They fell for 2 wheelers and 3 wheelers But remained steady for high end SUVs But forget the economic cost Let's talk about the moral cost When millions of people find out that much of their money is worthless And they have to queue up outside banks for hours and days for their own money What else is that if not theft? What else is that if not violence? More than a 100 people died directly because of demonetization And I consider them people murdered by Narendra Modi These include Jagdish Panwar The tea seller from Sikar in Rajasthan Who had a heart attack brought on by the fact That he suddenly did not have money for his daughter's wedding These include Halke Loti The farmer from Chattarpur in Madhya Pradesh Who killed himself because he didn't have money to buy fertilizer and seeds In time for the sowing season These include the unnamed 55 year old woman from Telangana Who killed herself because the 54 lakh she had saved over a lifetime Was now worthless These include the newborn child who died in Mumbai Because a hospital refused to accept the newly demonetized notes And so on and on and on These are human beings not statistics Beyond these deaths Businesses shut down in the informal economy Because it runs mainly on cash Livelihoods were destroyed Years of hard work were wiped out in one evening I call it the largest assault on private property in human history It was a crime on humanity And there were people who tried to do a cost benefit analysis of this They claimed that the economic benefits justified the moral cost Leave aside the fact that there were no economic benefits And this was an economic disaster as well But even if there were benefits Can you play with the lives of people like this? Would it be right to use even one person in this manner As a means to an end? Narendra Modi did this to every citizen of this country Modi is a delusional megalomaniac There is nothing new to say on him But what really makes me angry is The supposedly respectable economists and public intellectuals Who supported demonetization Many of them were rewarded for this With positions in the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council In Niti Aayog and so on I personally know different economists who worked in government And were ordered to defend demonetization Even though they personally thought it was a disaster They should have refused But they defended it And all these people who defended this crime on humanity With its massive moral and economic costs How do we describe them? Are they bad economists? Well, duh! And are they also bad human beings? Which is a more charitable explanation? I view demonetization as a litmus test For both sound economic thinking And basic human decency Demon was indefensible But I won't rant about that anymore Because I might burst a vein or something Something dear leader would not mind at all I have a bunch of links on the page for this episode Which lists out all my writing on the subject Do check them out In the meantime It's time for me to bring on my guest for today's episode My friend, the brilliant Shruti Rajgopalan But before that Let's take a quick commercial break Like me, are you someone who loves fine art But can't really afford to have paintings By the artists you like hanging on your walls Well, worry no more Head on over to IndianColors.com Indian Colors is a company that licenses images Of the finest modern art From some of the best artists in India And adapts them into objects of everyday use These include wearable art Like stoles and shrugs Home decor like cushion covers and table runners And accessories like tote bags This allows art lovers to actually get fine art Into their homes at an accessible price And artists get royalties on sales Just like authors do What's more Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products Including fridge magnets With some stunning motifs And salad bowls and platters made of mango wood Their artists include luminaries Like Babu Xavier Vazvo x Vazvo Brinda Miller Dilip Sharma Shruti Nelson And Pradeep Mishra They accept bulk orders For corporate and festival gifting But even if you want to buy Just for yourself or a friend Head on over to IndianColors.com That's colors with an O-U And if you want a 20% discount Apply the code IVM20 That's IVM for IVM Podcast IVM20 for a 20% discount At IndianColors.com Shruti, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen"

They just made the wrong assumptions In terms of How much black money There was in the economy And how much money Or you know One time revenue Would be recovered From the demonetization policy So one kind of bad economics Was grounding it On poor assumptions The second kind of bad economics Was just grounding it On poor reasoning Which is The idea that You know All these costs That you're talking about Which is people dying People not able to pay Their hospital bills Or get their children married Poor people losing Their entire life savings Right? Even rich people Who are running From pillar to post Trying to avoid the tax Trying to spend A lot of resources To avoid the tax Of demonetization All of these are Huge economic costs So These were basically The two different kinds Of responses From the bad economists But there were a lot of economists You Larry White Ajay Shah Myself Who basically You know Called a spade a spade And said demonetization Is a bad idea Because it's just Simply too costly"
