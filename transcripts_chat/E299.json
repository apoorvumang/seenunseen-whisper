        "message": "Here's a question I sometimes ask myself, how often in my life have I been actually alive? By which I mean engaged in what I am doing, living in the moment, questioning what I really want and not just following a groove set out for me. Here's the thing, through our lives, we often get on a path and follow a default. As young people in our society, we look at our parents and the people around us and sometimes become those men and women and don't think for ourselves. If the conventional way is to get married and have kids, we get married and have kids. We get the education we are supposed to get and then embark on the career we are supposed to have. In our workplace, we tick the boxes we are supposed to tick. In our personal lives, we play the roles we are supposed to play. It's as if we have been coded to live in a particular way and we are machines of flesh and blood following that code. But sometimes, we can step back for a moment and see the matrix we are stuck inside. We can question our choices, think about what we truly want and not just what we are supposed to or expected to want. Are those moments the only moments when we are truly free, when we are truly alive?"

        "message": "Please welcome your host, Amit Verma. Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My guest today is Samarth Bansal, a journalist known for his skill with data, but someone whose journalism goes well beyond numbers and whose thinking goes well beyond journalism. Samarth was into math and computing when he was young, went to IIT, decided not to follow the typical IIT path, became a journalist, decided not to follow the typical journalist path. And he now lives in the hills, working on the stories he wants to work on, taking breaks when he wants, still visiting Delhi once in a while with a different gaze than the one he had when he was growing up here. I've always found Samarth's journalism thought-provoking, and when I met him at a recent conference in Udaipur, I invited him on the show. I think we also gelled well on that first meeting. I found Samarth thoughtful, straightforward and curious. And when we finally recorded in Delhi, I was so, so impressed by the quality of his self-reflection. In this episode, he talks about his journaling habit and how that helped him question everything about his life and choices. He talks a lot about journalism, going back to first principles, asking questions like how do we define newsworthiness, how do we decide what stories to do. He speaks about ethics in his life, on the college campus, in the newsroom. He speaks about the choice he has made to live an examined life and how that involves walking away from the expectations of others. He speaks in detail about his time in IIT and in the media, so other IITians and journalists would find a lot to relate to. But the first half of our conversation is about life itself, and I found much wisdom there and much to think about. For some reason, there's an honesty and warmth and a connection in this episode that reminded me of the ones I recorded with Prem Panikkar and Amitabh Kumar and Chandrahar Choudhary. Except those guys were old friends of mine, and I was meeting Samarth here for the second time. So I'm touched by the trust he placed in me and in all of you because you're all listening as well. By the way, this episode was recorded in August, and the story we discussed in it about the wire was an older one. And now we're releasing it in October, when the wire is in the center of another storm. I'm reserving judgment on it till I read what Samarth has to say. I know he sees angles and nuances that no one else does. Anyway, before we begin this conversation, let's take a quick commercial break. There are no commercials because but let's take a break anyway. Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, the art of clear writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students, we have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community interaction in the course itself through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150 and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiancut.com slash clear writing. It's indiancut.com slash clear writing. Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you. Samarth, welcome to the scene on The Unsealed. Thank you Amit for having me. So it's just to let the listeners know I bumped into Samarth at this conference where, you know, everybody wore these name tags with them. And I looked at her name tag and straightaway, obviously, I've been following your work. And I thought, okay, this is kind of going to be interesting. And I think we also when we were talking in a session there just got into this really comfortable groove. So I was looking forward to this conversation. And I think we'll both enjoy it. So let's start by you telling me or you telling us, you know, more about yourself, like, kaan se aayo? Where did you grow up? What's your background?"

        "message": "Sure. So I was born and brought up in Delhi, North Delhi, specifically, I like to make that distinction, because there is this big, I think, cultural difference in different parts of Delhi, I went to a school close to my house, English medium private school, medium sized school. But right from that time, you had some sort of, I would say, inferiority complex that you know, you are not one of those kids from the DPS archipelago or modern school Parakhamba. So you know, and like, it was a very homogenous group in the school, everyone in the Pitampura area is, you know, same kind of backgrounds. So that's the kind of school I went to my family. My dad is a businessman, he grew up in a village near Ludhiana, there were seven brothers and one sister. When he was 1884 riots happened in Punjab. And so around that time, three of these brothers moved to Imphal. And like my grandfather didn't really have like, in terms of finances, the very, very modest beginning. So my dad, and two brothers, they didn't, they like built up a business from scratch in Imphal. He was telling me, you know, they had these dealership of like fruity and other brands. So one of the they build their credibility, and, you know, used to drive a truck all across Imphal and Manipur, and, you know, made good fortune for himself there. And then, after six, seven years in the early 90s, early 90s, what I think in 91, came to Delhi. And yeah, then, slowly, other other brothers came, and they built a business here. And I think post liberalization, you know, their business grew up. So I sometimes retrospectively think that somehow, you know, my father's journey is in a way, you know, that moment where liberalization was giving opportunities to people. So my father was one of the beneficiaries. And my mom, she grew up in Delhi. And my nana ji was a gazette officer. And she, again, like both my dad didn't go to college, my mom did a correspondence course from Delhi University. And then they got married, arranged marriage setup. So after that, I think, since I was a, you know, right from early childhood, I was told that education is the thing that matters the most. And one of the things that was that my mom felt like a victim of patriarchy, right? So we have a massive family. It's a I told you already, right, like seven brothers. Then my grandfather had like four brothers, so it's a big family. And my mom was somehow not able to fit in. So for her, the success, quote unquote, success of me, and I'm the elder kid, my sister is, you know, eight years younger to me, was kind of, you know, to show that kids can be on their own, and they don't need the, you know, like what she felt. So her, what I'm trying to articulate here is that my education and the investment that my mom did, was in some way, a reflection of a rebellion, you know, about what she didn't feel about, you know, things that she didn't feel right, and her response to that. So I gave this context, because all through my school time, you know, this was a big push that and she invested a lot I can see in retrospection. So again, I told you in the beginning about that inferiority complex. So I have this vivid memory where I'm sitting in front of the school, I got the admission, and my mom was so angry because some other elite schools rejected me. So you know, you have to prove yourself in academics, and do well, all sorts of things. So that's the long context. And I think, I don't know where it came from. But right from the beginning, I just absolutely loved studying, you know, since a kid, you know, you know, that classmate, you're a topper, you're doing other things. My mom used to take me to extracurricular activities. So I learned, you know, music, dance, all of those things, they were all happening simultaneously. So that's how it, you know, I was growing up. And yeah, always on top of the class. And I think sometime, so yeah, school went like this. And in retrospection, I think that somehow, like then, you know, until like fifth grade or sixth grade, the way you just assessed myself, I assessed myself was primarily through your exam scores, right? Now that, like, I'm trying to build a career in journalism and writing, and I hear so many writers about their childhoods. So many of them, you know, read books, they grew up reading books. Like I didn't grow up in that environment. Like for me, books always meant textbooks, even again, you know, culturally, if you look at North Delhi, we don't have a bookshop, like, you know, it was only after I became a journalist, I learned that, okay, there is a bhaari sansin khan market, where now I'm a regular. So I'm saying that was the kind of environment you, I grew up in, it was just textbooks. But again, my, I remember like, you know, I was so engrossed in my math classes and science classes, it was never forced. But yeah, there were things like my cousins and my friends would play cricket in the evening. But I was told that, you know, it's important to study. So I think maybe early class three, class four, I would have felt, why is this happening? But I think in the larger scheme of things, I was very happy with what I was doing. So that's the academic part kept going on. And we can do details later. But I think somehow in fifth grade to eighth grade, you know, I became like, really passionate about computers. There's a whole series of things that happened while I was growing up, which led to that. And in seventh grade, I requested my parents that please, I want a computer at home, I want a desktop. And it was a big deal to ask them. And one of the things I told them is that I really want to learn things and I will never play a computer game. Okay, so I promise you just get me a computer. And they did. And the funny thing is that I was not even interested in gaming, you know, so it was not something that I had to give something up. But that's just the way of telling them that I really want this. And I think that opened the world for me. I remember telling myself that this is seventh grade, that God made humans, right? Like at the time, like now I'm an atheist, so going back that there's God, God created humans and humans created this machine. So I can now play God, you know, I can do things with it, I can create anything I want. And that I clearly remember the day when I told my parents, I'm going to be a software engineer. This is seventh grade. So it became very organically. And then I did a lot of stuff on my computer back home in school, all of those things were happening. And in eighth grade, I learned one of my cousins was preparing for this exam called IIT JEE. And then I learned that if in India, you want to study engineering, then you have to the best school is Indian Institute of Technology. And that was it. I think in eighth grade, I realized that, you know, there is this college, I want to become an engineer. And I was told that the exam, you need to be good at math and science, which I was. And I think there was some again, it's a whole diversion into details, but there's an exam that I qualified in eighth grade, which gave me the confidence that I have a standing beyond my school. And then I think, grade ninth, I joined coaching. And it was like, you know, it was brilliant, you know, my coaching days preparing for JEE. And fortunately, I got into, got admission to IIT Kanpur, studied math and computing. And yeah, so that's the, that's, that's my childhood till I went to college."

        "message": "So let's go back to, you know, the early part of the story where you mentioned your huge family and your mom and the patriarchy and all of that. And what I realized looking back at my own life, for example, is that we figure out a lot of this stuff in retrospect, like you said, you know, in that, you know, the world that we are in, it is normal for us, everything there is normalized, this is how people kind of live their lives. So is it all, you know, through retrospect, when you look at your mom that you realize what she was going through, and this narrative is there that she was struggling against that and all of that, or in the moment, could you also sense her frustration and the stuff that was happening to her? And this is such a common story, right? This is basically India's story, that women are trapped in situations. And you know, they look at different ways to gain escape. And sometimes those are invisible ways. Sometimes those are just tortured interior lives, right? And so tell me a little bit, you know, more about your mom, firstly, and and also, you know, did you resent what you might sometimes have thought was overbearing, ki padhai karo, cricket mat khelo, all of that. And, and you know, how much like you mentioned before we started that you've been journaling for four years. And that's, you know, kind of useful and in a sense is dangerous, because you're kind of constructing yourself as it were through the through what you choose your memories to be. Right. But at the same time, I think like in journaling, you know, I did an episode with Amitabh Kumar, and we spoke a lot about journaling, and it's something I recommend to everyone, because it's a way of not just knowing yourself, but kind of shaping yourself. So how much does, you know, introspection at this stage, self reflection, looking back, how much does it sort of shape your understanding of that world? I mean, and how much did you know in the moment ki yeh aisa hai and all of that?"

        "message": "So I knew in the moment. So have you heard of this term, parentified kids? So, the first time I heard this term, I think, actually, it was on a Tyler Cohen podcast. I can't pronounce the name of this author, but one of her book, Strangers Drowning, it's a book on moral philosophy, you know, seven or eight profiles, deep profiles and Larissa something, I'm forgetting the name, sorry. So the parentified kid, when the term I heard, it just blew my mind, because it is something that, again, I try to think a lot about like, who I am I today, what can I trace back to my childhood? What are the roots of who I am as a person, what goes back? And one of the things that hit me was empathy, that, you know, there is a, like, if I go, when I was a student in college, you know, there was this sense of deep sense of right and wrong, that, you know, I want to make an impact, I want to change things, I'm a very different person now, but 10 years ago, that was me, where you had the sense of, you know, may occur, right, or, you know, this whole Steve Jobs sense of changing the world, or, you know, you see, you know, you see injustice around and you feel I have to do something to help. So where is that empathy coming from? So one of the this idea of parentified kids is that, sorry, I didn't even describe what it is, but it's something like, when you're growing up, you start, at an early age, start acting as a parent to your parents. Okay. And I, you know, I always say, you know, that, to put it simply, there is the, it's a dysfunctional family. Okay. And the way to, I see that with my friends is that, you know, I talk about films. So there's this friend of mine and I was talking to her about Zoya Akhtar's movie, Dil Dhadak Ne Do. And she was like, what a stupid movie, you know, have you seen the movie?"

        "message": "Which is a lovely film. Right. But what you see in all of these situations is just that, you know, deep, you know, like dysfunctional families, which from the outside, you won't know what is happening. Right. But anything can break at any time. And you can't, you don't even know how to talk about it to someone. Even the fact that I am telling it to you now. It's because now I have, over the course of journaling over four years, I have now understood what it is. Right. Five years, six years ago, I could not even talk about it to my friends. But now I could because I'm not comfortable with what that was, what that did to me. So that's where I'm saying that when you are a parentified kid, when you see dysfunction in family, and you're, but you are not smart enough to know that who is right, who is wrong. You're just a kid, but you have to take that responsibility. So you see that things are off. And that channelization is that you are responsible for like my, if I do well, my mom will feel happy. Right. So these things are happening. And the culmination was, you know, I remember the day I graduated from college and it was my convocation, right. That day when my mom told me that I think I was 21 when you graduate, I graduated, that like, and I, when I got my first check from the Hindu that, you know, like she felt she finally had agency because she had started earning because after, you know, she used to work at an office. It was a very, it was not a fancy job, but my mom, she just loved what she did. She proudly remembers that I used to do this. She would get a small salary, but, you know, used to spend it on others, not on herself. Right. So that sense of agency, when you see has gone away, right when, and my dad is the youngest. So, and again, it's a constructed story. So no, I just feel terrible because I don't want to paint like a, you know, a picture about other people in my family. That's not my objective. I'm just telling you what I felt, what I saw my mom going through."

So, you know, to answer your question, yes, a lot of it, I was feeling back when I was growing up, but things started making, you know, you need to connect the dots that happened, I think, over the last four or five years. And I will end on this note on this question that, you know, the interesting thing about journaling is that when you dump your thoughts on paper, you also, and you are just honest when you are in your diary, right? Like no one is going to read my diary. So you're so brutally honest. So the discomforting thoughts about the present, right? About what happened in childhood, like that, you know, this, let me put it this way that I think a lot about as an individual, what is my relationship with society? What is, what do I owe to Amit Verma? Right? We are sitting next to each other. You know, I believe in individual as a center of society. That's my worldview and individual, individual freedom. But then I'm also a member of the society, but then my parents, right? That's a different sort of relationship. I can't, the way I would think about Amit Verma or say my best friend, the relationship with parents is different. So where does that agency come in? Because when I was growing up, my mom and how, you know, I remember, right? You know, it's almost like she gave in everything, but is that something I asked for? Right? You know, you get this question and it's, it's a very discomforting thought because today, how do you manifest that relationship when you are a child, when you're not an adult and now. So how do you think about your responsibility? What do you owe to your parents? I don't have answers, but this is the, this is the struggle. And this hit me for the first time when I went to college, like I thought that, you know, like for me, it was a dream, you know, to, to study at that Institute. And I think my years at IIT really shaped me in so many ways, but I went away from home, right? I went to Kanpur, my parents didn't realize that that will happen. They just thought it, it doesn't strike you, right? That like the kid will go away. So that left such a big void in my, you imagine, right? I mean, you do everything for 18 years for this one person, right? And my sister and I, you know, I joke with her that, I mean, I say you have a more comfortable life because you know, over the years, you know, the family prospered, but the love and affection I got, I feel, I mean, she would disagree that it was more because I'm the elder kid. So now when that creates this big void in her life, it changes things, right? And that had its own series of impressions that made me discomfort, you know, made me uncomfortable that, okay, what is happening? And now that, you know, I decided to live by myself, I don't live at my parents' house anymore. So that decision, you know, what would it mean for my parents, right? These are all questions that come to me and I am processing it in my journal. So again, that's, sorry, it's a long winding answer to your question, but I think, yeah, I realize it at that time. But now that I think about it, it has become such a central thing in organizing my life that I have to, I can't just ignore what happened in childhood, but then also think about what is happening in the present and then just find a way to navigate it."

It's tricky because like, I don't know, because you see the tension, you know, so the sense that I always have had with them is that I say, you know, whatever I do, I love you. I care for you. I will always be there for you. But I have a life that is outside the idea of a family, right? Now how do you, and they understand, you know, I mean, the choices that I have been able to make, you know, I still don't have an answer to it. People keep asking me all the time, how did your parents react to X? You know, how did your parents react to Y? And is it because of them or is it because of you? I don't know. So I think they and I, we know what is going on, but, and there have been times when things go heated up and like we sit and we talk, but you know, it's almost like I realized after a while that look, both are right. You know, it's just worldviews are different. You know, they came from a certain background, they have a certain expectation. I grew up as a, you know, after like, after you leave home, you change. And after graduating from college, when I started reading, you know, reading just, it opens up the world for you. And that happened like, you know, the, since the time I started identifying myself as a reader, you know, the world changed for me, right? So your ideas expand, you just, you're just not the same person. So the trajectory of change, we went on different paths. And the problem is that, you know, within this giant family, like almost all my cousins, most of them, all of them are in family business, right? In my neighborhood, most of the kids are at home, right? That's how, that's how you're expected to be largely, you know, in the, in the zone of Delhi I come from, like, that's a norm, like people joke about it, you know, ki aisa hi hota hai. So when you see other kids around behaving just the way she would expect me to, right? But then she's also proud that he has an independent life and standing, something that she wanted, right? So I think she also has that conflict and I also have that conflict, right? So it's, it's there. So I don't, I mean, that conversation happens, but it's more of that, you know, to like something , something heated has happened, right? And you're trying to pacify it, right? And on an ongoing basis, I think she has, like, of course, like both of us have moved, you know? So I think, I don't know. I still sometimes feel like, like, I don't know the answer, honestly, Amit, that I don't know. And there've been other things that are too personal that I, I, you know, like, I, I don't have problems to share, but you know, it just feels like that's her story. And do, do I have the right to even tell it? I don't know. Right. They're like, there's so many, like, I've told you a lot, but I think there's this important things that I could not say, because I think I respect her privacy of things that I could say or I could not say. So that will remain the missing bit. But yeah, from my POV, I'm saying that it's, it's something that I've now accepted to live with. And I think my journaling is a way for me to build my own philosophy about, you know, also accept uncomfortable truths. And in all that, like, I think part of growing up is to realize that your parents are not always right. Right. They are as flawed humans as I am. So and in this whole mess, you just find a way to get through things and take hard decisions. You criticize yourself. So yeah, I am now at a fairly comfortable space in my head. I don't know what my parents think about it. Does that answer your question?"

So I can just tell you that they are like super rich, like super rich, you know, they built a business and they just have now this really fancy house in our society. And what such deeply unhappy lives of women in that house, right? I know details because my mom told me and you see the, you know, the way, you know, in the evening when my mom and her friends, they just get together, right? These are the conversations that are happening that you know, how it's just that and I think, you know, Amit, and this is the thing that my sister has learned from all of this, right? That how, why financial independence matters so much because at the end of the day, right? Like, where do you go is the question that hits you, right? Like that's the lever through which lever of control in a way that you don't have independent agency, like economically, like you can't do anything. And that way, again, you know, I, at one point, you know, this whole thing about, she said, now that you've started earning, I have started earning that sense that, you know, you, you get that feeling that now I have become independent. So you know, in that way, I think that the factor of not, the factor of, you know, not having an independent source of income becomes a lever of control. And you know, all of that, Amit, when I started reporting and I was reporting on this data on suicides and I saw that I always heard about narratives about farmer suicides, but every year farmers and housewives compete among who has the highest number, right? And I think it was in 2017 when I saw that statistic and I was blown away because it just explains for me, at least that there could be hundreds of reasons why what is happening for my limited personal vantage of what I saw growing up in, not in my home, I'm saying in my neighborhood, in my society, where I grew up. That was a sense I was getting that it was so, the frustration that I could see in my house around me, that what it could lead to, you don't know, right? And you can't even talk about it, like in a party, I would see, not a party as in like a family gathering, every, every family is happy, right, everyone is happy, but you know, you go on one on one and then you see that the story is different. And things that happen in college, you know, when you get heart to heart with your friends, you know, different, like one of the best things about IIT is that you meet people from all across the country, right? In an environment, you grew up in Delhi, I told you, it's a small homogeneous, you know, community in school, everyone is from five kilometers and then you go to a college, kids from all cast, class, states, languages, and then you go heart to heart with friends. And then you see the same story, you know, and those are also the people with whom you deeply connect. Because you say, huh, you know, they get it, they get where we are coming from. So yeah, I think it's, it's, it's just so generic. And honestly, I think all of these questions have such a, now that we have spoken about it, it has had a big impact on how I think about the world. Because it just makes you, yeah, you know, the whole thing about what looks at the surface, you know, like now it's, it's, let me put it this way, when I see, it's a very weird thing to say. But when I see someone who is like extremely happy, you know, like he is very happy, he keeps laughing all the time, you know, I feel this, there's some, there's some problem"

But the question is in my mind, okay, what is their story like, you know, like, you know, the way you are asking me about my story, like, and I can't just go and talk to a random person and say, you know, but yeah, I think that has started happening. Because again, just to diverge in college, when all of this was happening, there was a moment I had to take a semester drop in my college because of something at home. And that phase, I went into that direction where I thought there is no such thing as happiness. Either you are unhappy, you are in the shades of unhappiness, that's it, there is no such thing as happiness. So for now, I don't think like that. But I'm saying that when all of these impressions build up, and you say, my friends even don't know about what is happening behind the scenes. So maybe something is happening behind the scenes with them that I don't know, right? So that way, you know, this started happening that there's always a deeper life, you know, I don't know what is happening. So even now today, you know, if I don't like a person, right, or I'm disagreeing with them, or I don't like, then you know, I just feel there's a part of me which is like, you know, what I don't know is, what is his story, you know, there is, you know, he is arguing like this, you know, and like, why does he or she have these views, but then a part of me tells, but you know, I don't know, like, what happened to their childhood, what has made them the way they are today. So I think, yeah, so long story short, I'm saying that the threads that I observed in my own journey now today as a journalist, somehow it impacts you because it just changes the way you look at people around you, and how you think about them, and the world."

        "message": "And I'm just wondering from this, like what you said about, you know, initially, when you go to school, sab 5 kilometer ke radius mein hai, then you go to college, it expands a bit, you meet different kinds of people. And there you make connections, where you make connections, and you find these common threads, even though you could be from different places, different backgrounds. And I'm wondering here about being the importance and dangers of transcending the limits of geography, which we can more or less do in these current times, like earlier, in an earlier age, like when I grew up in the 80s, for example, you're sort of limited by circumstance and geography, you only know so many people, you know, and your circles may expand sometimes, and sometimes they may not like you point out many of your school friends are still living in the same place working in the family business. And the good part of the circle expanding is that you can find like your sample size of people with whom you could empathize with or learn something from or find that common thread, that sample size grows up and those connections matter. Because then you know, you're not alone. These are common experiences and those connections matter. The internet can do the same thing, even the act of reading can do the same thing by giving you access to the lives and minds of others. So that's one strand of it where it works. But another strand is that even in this hyper connected world, we can sometimes choose to be atomized. Ki chaar log baithe hain kafe mein lekin ek doosra se baat nahi kar rahe hain, phone mein dekh rahe hain. You know, to instead of embracing the concrete interactions, where you can look into someone's eye and have a conversation and say ki bhai kya baat hai, you're not looking good today. You are instead trapped in the abstract worlds of the smartphone, which make you which give this illusion of being connected and which give this illusion that you're gaining knowledge. But those are on the surface. So I mean, I'm just kind of thinking aloud is sparked off by what you said about, you know, expanding those circles, going to college meeting those people. And I think there are those trade offs, you know, it is possible that many of the self doubts you might have or regrets you might have may not have been there if you had continued living in that cocooned world in a pre internet time ki aap bhi chalo family business mein kaam bata rahe ho, math mein achche ho, accounts dekh rahe ho aap and so on and so forth. But on the other hand, there is this sort of expansiveness. So what are sort of your thoughts on this?"

        "message": "Yeah, so I read somewhere forgetting the author, but that there's a difference between connection and conversation. Right? So a connection is, I'm on Instagram and you know, someone posts posts and Instagram story and I send an emoji in reaction. So I'm connected. You know, someone I met seven years ago, we are in touch once in a while you can. Conversation is where you go deep, right? And what has happened with me over the last, I would say, I don't know, maybe, I don't know the time frame, but I just realized the value of deep relationships, especially friendships. Right? There was now, you know, I'm so proud that I have a bunch of four or five people in my life, you know, and they come from different time frames, like one from like a friend of mine. We went, we studied together since kindergarten, couple of friends from college, someone whom I met at workplace. So different. So they know different, we are connected to in different time, like they knew the different summer at different points, but they know today, like who I am, they know the trajectory and they know my deepest anxieties, they know who I am, what I do. And it doesn't, it, it, it, it doesn't happen by itself. You know, you, you make that effort, you know, when you say in a relationship, you have to put in an effort to cultivate those deep relationships. That's where you find for me, like most meaning in terms of interpersonal relationships. And in general, like, you know, it's funny because as a reporter, you have to be an extrovert. Like I describe my job as, you know, I'm consistently invading people's private lives, right? There was a story for which I just, you know, you land up at someone's house, unannounced, knock the door that I want to talk to you, right? So that's, that, that's my reporting. When I'm reporting, I'm that person, but in my private life, I'm very introvert, right? You know, like I'm the guy in a party would ideally like to stand in the corner. If I like someone, you know, then I will, okay, no, let's chat that kind of a personality, right? So when you become that person, you just want, you don't want a lot of people to have, like, I'm happy to go to a cafe and actually not talk to anyone. But if I want to, and if there is a connection, then, you know, I want to take it from a connection to a conversation. And one of my recent realizations, you know, that I figured is that when you find someone like that, you know, where you, there is a connection based on values, not on anything else, just ways to look at the world. And I like the person, then I don't want to lose them, you know, because it's hard to just find those people organically. And interestingly, all of the friends that I have, then none of them are internet friends. They're like my, I met them in a physical place. You know, I can, they're happy, you can, they just call me up. Right? I mean, I really, you know, it's just the, I don't know, I just, I'm a bit old school, but you know, this whole thing about friends sending me a calendar invite for scheduling a call, it is just insane. I just tell them, call me, I mean, you know, if I'm working, I will just tell you I'm busy. I will call you later. You know, in, when I was a kid and we didn't have mobile phones, we had our landline, so I put it up at 7.30, you know, and I anticipated it, right? So that, or sometimes randomly you just call, so at least there is this group of people who can just say, you know, like recently one of those friends, we have been talking a lot and he would just say that, can we talk, I really want to, something is going on and like work is work, but then you make time to talk to this person, right? So I'm saying that conversation, connection, so few conversations and then ignore connections is the frame that I have now."

        "message": "Yeah. It's a, it's a lovely frame. It's given me a lot to think about, you know, when I was going through all of your work, the common thread that what I seem to notice in that is that you're living what I would call the examined life, like Socrates once said, the unexamined life is not worth living, right? So what you're doing is you're asking questions all the time, whether they are questions about media, whether they're questions about data, and we'll go into all of those also, or whether they are questions about yourself. And what you've sort of brought up here is the subject of intentionality that you decide ki mujhe yeh friendship pe kaam karna hai. And that's something I've been thinking about in the sense that, you know, earlier you spoke about that natural empathy you discovered within yourself when you were a kid. And we were also speaking about happiness and unhappiness, though I forget the context now, but there is, it seems to me that in the natural flow of things, to feel empathy or to feel unhappiness can sometimes be an act of self aggrandizement, where you put yourself in the center of the universe. So you are unhappy because bad things have happened to you. And you feel empathy for someone because you are so virtuous, and I am good, I am feeling empathy, main kuch karunga, right? And what self examination does is, firstly, it forces you to see it for what it is. And to say ki nahi, you know, maybe there's a if there's a practical value to the empathy, then I will help this other person, instead of, you know, sort of delving in that empathy, or, you know, if the because unhappiness and happiness, you spoke about how happiness is can feel so nebulous, right, at one point, you thought there is nothing called happiness. And I sometimes think about how you are, you can only construct happiness, you know, in a you'll remember moment, like I remember moments in my life as happy moments. Now, if you ask me happy moment kya tha, I'll say ye tha, wo tha. But in the moment was I truly happy, right, you know, and for me to be truly happy in the moment, I'm wondering if I would have had to tell myself in that moment that I am happy, therefore taking myself out of that moment. So this is sort of a kind of a conundrum to me, but what, you know, one of my guests in a previous episode had mentioned how she decided when she was young to be happy. She said when I was in school, I decided I am going to be happy, you know, and that act of intentionality seems important, where you also decide ki, I want good friends with whom I can have a conversation or a connection. And when I identify someone like that, I will make sure it happens, you know, that intentionality is there. So is this, you know, and I don't, I don't often see it in myself, like the way I see myself as having lived my life is ki bas mein through circumstances and whatever mein groove mein baith gaya, ussi groove pe chalta gaya, accidents hote gaye, random cheeze hote gaye, and I kind of land up and once in a while, I might do some self reflection and even that can be an act of self aggrandizement, right, ki aarey, I'm doing self reflection and whatever. Whereas in your case, it seems that whether by thinking about it, or whether through practices like journaling, where you're forcing yourself to kind of examine yourself, that you worked at it in a more systematic way. So tell me a little bit about this that, you know, can self awareness also be then an act of intention ki mujhe yeh karna hai, so journaling being a part of that, or is it part of your basic nature that you're always getting meta and questioning these things?"

I remember during school, during college, these thoughts have always been with me. The structure came in the recent years, you know, where like again to talk about journaling, you know, one of the best things about it. Now I capture every single thought in my head on notebook. You know, I'm walking and I get a thought. It could be an idea. It could be an observation. So if I'm walking, I just quickly dump it on my note taking app on my phone. I don't want because what what it does. And I realized this that if things are in my head, and I don't capture it, then you know, it just it keeps lingering around. But if it's on paper, then it goes away like my brain is clear. So there is I just want to dump my brain and have it, you know, my brain should be empty. You know, and the more things start appearing on paper, I can do time travel. You know, so whenever so every year on my birthday, I read all my journals, just to see, okay, you know, what has changed? What has stayed the same? What are the questions I've been able to answer? What are the questions that remain open? And it just gives me this deep sense of progress. And you know, it's just brilliant. You know, I think I tell everyone that they should journal it's life changing. So when vast intentionality because you see a chameleon, you know, if this is constant, this is something I want, I want to do this. So that is where, you know, this intention thing started coming in. And also, parallelly, you know, this absurdity of modern life with technology, right, which has taken over, you know, our, you know, platforms and smartphone, you know, you can't totally escape it. But you have to live with it. And there, actually, even while I was reporting on platforms, you start seeing what they do to you. And then you realize that actually, I have to fight this, this whole attention economy thing. That's actually one of my I describe my work as a fight against the attention economy. I don't agree with it, and I have to fight it. Because the attention economy is trying to manipulate me to do things I don't want to do. And that sense of I mean, I don't know if there is a free will or not, I don't have an answer to that question. But you know, to the extent I can say that, you know, I want to do this, now, I have to make it happen. I think that came from journaling. Like, last year, I took an eight month sabbatical. Okay. And I was thinking for a long time that I want a sabbatical, I want to study stats, like a good math undergrad student, I was not getting the time. Because as a reporter, you know, you're always thinking about story ideas. It's that it's a drug, you know, reporting is a drug, you always want to report. So how did I come up with it? So I saw in my diary that, you know, how many times I'm writing that, you know, I used to say I want a zero story moment, where there shouldn't be a story in my mind. I want to eliminate everything. So you start and I took a sabbatical and then two months later, COVID second wave hit, right? And then my mind is like, no, my responsibility as a reporter is to go out and report, you know, that sense of, but I was like, nahi, abhi, I have decided, you know, that I have to study, I have to take the sabbatical. So stick to it. Don't let your whatever impulses, good, bad doesn't matter. Stick to it. So I think, and the more you practice it, you see the effect. So now when I go for my regular walks and I'm like, I'm walking, so I live in the hills now and I'm looking at mountains. I mean, I don't know, it may sound weird, but you know, I have these, on a daily basis, I have moments when there is nothing in my head, you know, it's like, you know, the sense of emptiness that I'm not thinking about anything. I'm just standing, looking at a hill, and one day I just started smiling, you know, for reasons I don't know. It is just a feeling that you have to experience that aapke dimaag mein kuch nahi hai, you are standing, there's no one around, like no one knows you, you know, you're not even listening to songs. You're just looking at a hill and you can do this every day and you're smiling, right? When I experienced that state, right, it was magical. And then again, I can tell you because it's in my diary, I was like, I don't know what I want. I mean, I have everything, you know, there's nothing that I'm chasing, you know, so when you exit that zone, it's just different because like, you don't know, like there is nothing that you want, you know, things are happening, you're sorted. So I tell it to a friend, they said, oh, so you are being less ambitious. I was like, I don't know boss, you know, my diary is telling me ki yeh yeh karna hai aur mera toh ho gaya hai. So I'm sorted. I'm not going to be aur mujhe kuch chahiye nahi. So I think, does that answer your question about intentionality, that how, or did I go"

Did going off into the hills, did taking the sabbatical help in terms of coming to terms with not following the conventional route? Because what you've done, and like, you know, I left the conventional route fine, I decided full time job nahi karunga, yeh nahi karunga, but it came from a place of I want to do this instead.

And then even my freelance, I started seeing that this is my feeling, okay, I'm not saying this is how it is, but I started feeling that there are these that we are trapped in a matrix in a way that there are these structures, key, you know, we are told that this is how things are. You know, essay karna hota hai, you go to an IIT and you said that your goal is to crack that consulting job or you know, work at Facebook, right. And what happened with me at IIT and then at newsrooms, is that there are moments where I start, it just feels absurd to me that, you know, like I'm a first principles thinker, you know, matlab jo hai wo theek hai, main first principles se sochunga, achha college aaye toh kyu aaye, uska kya point hai, engineering kar rahe hain toh kyu kar rahe hain, right. If I'm doing journalism, what is the point of journalism? When it began, what happened, right? And then you start seeing, okay, if you're in Instagram, so what are you doing, right? All of those things. So I ask myself that question and then I see what is happening. And in most cases, I find a disconnect. That first principles toh keh rahe hain, aisa hona chahiye, but I'm looking around me, that is not happening. So then I get into that zone where I say, I need to exit this. So you know, it's absurd because I am part of that ecosystem and in that structure, but I'm like also exiting it and trying to see that structure from the outside. So when you see, so it's, you imagine I am like, I'm just doing these hand gestures, but I'm here, you know, outside and there's this big giant circle. And I'm also observing myself in that movie, what is happening. And it feels like this is just a big delusion that you know what, and I, you know, I feel, I don't feel good to say all of this because, you know, this is a very self-righteous way of saying that, you know, everyone is trapped and I have exited. That's not, I mean, I don't know if that is what I'm implying, but I'm saying that is what I felt. And I said, it's structures I have to get out, right? So you get out of that structure. It happened with me at IIT, it happened with me at newsrooms, right? And I think there was a point when I started feeling, you know, this whole thing is a trap, you know, everything that is happening, like, why are we doing, what are we doing? And when those questions start coming in, there is a phase of deep discontent, you don't know what is happening. So at that time, I decided, boss, I want, I want to just think about these questions and I don't want external influences on my thinking, okay? And or like, that was not the only reason why I moved to the hills, but that was one of the reasons. Now, when you do that, right, you have seen up, ek trap se nikal rahe ho, duse trap se nikal rahe ho, and you keep thinking, maybe I'm in a delusion. There are like, mujhe lag raha hai that, you know, I have exited these two traps, maybe there are a hundred others. So you want a distance. Now, what the magical thing about hills, which is not just that, you know, mountains are nice, air is clean, woh toh hai. The biggest thing is that in a city like Delhi, even though I don't want, there's always a status game that is being played. I don't know how that happens, but there is something in this air, right? Like I am at a, I often work at Blue Tokai's, you know, here and there. Waha pe toh I don't know anyone, but still, subconsciously, you know, there is this, you know, maybe there's this girl sitting on the next table and I am reading a book and I would be unconsciously, I said, you know, no one is bothered about what I am doing, you know, sab apna kaam kar rahe hain, they're meeting friends, but you feel you are being observed. At least I feel that, that, you know, people are watching me. So I, in a way that's good, because then I'm like, you know, I have to read my book. I can't, you know, be looking at Instagram in between. So in that way, it's, you know, positive force, but I'm saying it's weird in that way. Like, I can tell you a story which really irritated me recently. So I came to Delhi, I was visiting and I go to cult, you know, chain of gyms, yeah, Cultfit. And there is this, I hope this person does not listen to this podcast, but there's this young guy, he's like 22 years old, okay. And there was COVID, so we, he came, he used to come at the same center where I go for my fitness class. And he saw me, I, you know, after the cult class in Punjabi Bagh, I went to a blue tukai and he saw me and he says, you know, I remember you. I said, yeah, I also remember you. And for some reason, he's super nerdy about headphones. So he, you know, and I'm also nerdy about headphones. So he took my headphones, did all of that. And then he started a conversation. He said, okay, so what do you do? I never asked you. Unfortunately, I told him I'm a journalist. So he's like, oh, you're a journalist. So what do you do? So I said, you know, I can, I write about various things. I'm a long form writer. You can, if you want, you know, happy to share my samples of work. So before that happened, he said, you know what, I study law. Okay. You should write about data privacy. You should write about platforms and social media, you know, do you know what is happening in parliament right now? It is such an important topic. And I was thinking in my head that, boss, I covered that for two years. Okay. I was a reporter at the Hindustan Times and as a freelancer, I've written across. And now, no offense to young people, and I'm also like just 29. But this 22 year old is telling me, this is what you should do. So I was like, then I said, I know a few things about this. This is an article I've written. You tell me what you think. They said, I will. So he said, oh, you have written such a long article. I think there is a book in you. And before I could say anything, he's like, okay, Samarth, tell me, what is that one thing you feel very passionate about? Okay. What is that thing that troubles you? That is the book. I see a writer in you. And Amit, I was speechless because like, I did not know what to make of it. You know, I did not want, and no offense to that person. He's just, he's just extrovert. So he's just coming and telling me things, but I don't want this external input in my brain. You know, garbage in, garbage out, like, why should there be garbage in my brain?"

And I went and I felt so uncomfortable because there are these, after a long while, I met journalist friends and others, and everyone is curious, what are you doing? Okay. How do you manage your finances? Okay. Why are you doing this? So you're always, in a sense, constantly explaining. Now, then you feel like an idiot. Is it me? That, you know, like, you don't have to explain, just ignore. But how do you do it when everyone around you is just asking these questions? And then, because they're nice people, right, they're not evil, they're nice people. And they would say something that would stick in your head. In Hills, nothing happens because no one gives a damn about who I am. All people who know me there, it's like, yes, a boy from the city lives here. They have no idea about my background, there's zero status game. And Amit, I cannot tell you. It is just magical when you're not performing at any moment in the day, because no one gives a damn. Right? So, and once you see that, you know, you don't have to perform, like you can be an idiot one time, and you can be, you know, reading your book, and no one is asking any question. It's just liberating. So that, I think, was one of the biggest things that I realized that started happening. You come back home, and then people are commenting on my body. You know, they're, yeah, it happens all the time. You have lost so much weight, don't do this, don't do that. So again, you know, they'll start talking about like, I think this is a very late 20s thing. I think every people would relate to it, you know, they start talking about marriage, that's the only thing, you know, a problem that doesn't exist in your life, but people want to solve it for you. That kind of things, that happens in Delhi. So I'm seeing this aspect of being away, and then observing, and then, you know, asking all. So that way, when you're outside the structure, you can actually think about those questions, at least, so that helps me. So it's not a temporary moment when I said that, you know, that thoughtless, I mean, kuch hoga, I don't know, but that happens repeatedly. When I see my diary, four years ago, usme jo sawal the, agar wo answer ho gaye hain, or like, I have at least a framework to think about it, to woh ho raha hai na, that you are like, you're progressing. So that way, I think a mixture of all of these things is what, yeah, that's where it comes that, you know, you stop wanting, because the wants I somehow feel are created by people around us, you know, they influence what you want, but when you're away, like, who will influence what you want?"

But I feel that you're the right person to talk to about this. And you know, this is something that so I was, you know, I had gone to Greece and Macedonia earlier in the year. And the background of that is even though I retired from poker few years ago, there's a form of poker which had come up called match poker, which is very different from regular poker looks and feels the same completely different. And like you, I love solving things from first principles to one of my friends got in touch with me and he said ki is cheez ka ek IPL type tournament ho raha hai. And I am I'm running he was he owned a team called Haryana Hawks. He said come and help me solve this because everybody's going to play it like poker. So solve it for me.

Toh Macedonia mein gaye and we were unfortunate in a sense ki three of our regular team members had their visas denied, we had to get new people. And it this particular form of the game, you kind of have to play it as a team everybody's got to be really clued in. And we got massacred like every team we had beaten at the Asian level destroyed us right. And I was feeling gutted at the end of it absolutely gutted. And then I read this great book by Luke Burgess called Wanting or Wanting mein his framework is that he's influenced by the works of Rene Girard, who was also an influence on Peter Thiel. And Girard had come up with this concept of mimetic desire, which is that you want something because somebody else wants it, you don't really intrinsically want it. And the frame I got from Burgess there was of thick and thin desires, right? So thick desires are things that you intrinsically want. And obviously creature comforts like food and all are not part of it. But thick desires is something that you deeply want and it's not influenced by anything. And thin desires are desires which you have because they are the done thing somebody else have them like Mercedes or if you're a young person, you might say I want to get married and have kids, but you're not really questioning that. Or if you're in IIT and you're stuck in that game, you're thinking, I want to go to America and become a software engineer. All those kind of different games are thin desires, which you've spoken about so much. And that made me reflect on why I was so gutted. And I realized that I was gutted because of a thin desire, right? The thin desire was that I want that glory that I have won the World Championships with Team India. I will tweet, 2000 people will retweet, which when we won the Asian Championship was kind of what happened. And it was an intense desire. I wanted how many people get this, right? And but it was a thin desire. It was, you know, premised on that old anxiety of getting the approval of others. And I realized that my thick desire was what my thick desire was to figure it out, to figure out the game, to go back to first principles. My thick desire was to understand something. And I understood why we lost. I understood why we lost. I understood why the winning team won. I could look at everyone's strategy and figure out what happened. That was understanding. But the thing is, the thin desire was intense. And the thick desire was very, you know, unseen and subterranean and all of that. And this then made me introspect beyond that, that life me jo wants hai, woh kyu hai? Like I discussed the same thing with Nilanjan Aroy and we were speaking about the desire to be a writer. And you can have thick and thin desires simultaneously coexisting. Your thin desire is to be known as a writer, woh branding ho jati hai, main yeh prize jeetunga, book launch mein jaunga, jacket pehnunga, panel mein gyaan doonga, all that shit. And that seems to me to be thin, while the thick desire is I want to tell a story. I want to sit down and I want to tell a story, or I want to uncover some part of the unseen world or whatever it is. And I've realized that if you chase thin desires, you cannot be happy. That happiness really lies outside of that of giving them up. Whether or not you find a thick desire, you have to let the thin desires go. Because then you're chasing somebody else's dream, really, or you're chasing something that is superficial. So since you've been speaking so much about desires and wanting and you've clearly figured this out and escaped a lot of these thin desires that one might have in either IIT or in journalism and so on, you know, what are your thoughts? Can you kind of go further along this path for me?"

And I just feel based on this framework, I'm closer to the thick spectrum. Okay, still, you know, I write a story like, you know, I started a newsletter earlier this year, and I am so happy with, you know, that whole process of what I did there. But you know, every time before I'm pressing that send button, you know, the process of writing that story and reporting is just absolutely thrilling. Like one of the reasons I started my newsletter was that I want to do original reporting. And I don't want anyone's permission of what is a story. There are stories that I want to tell, right, and I don't want anyone's permission. So it's it came like every idea came from ye mujhe batana hai, there's a style of writing I want to try in my own journey as becoming the writer that I want to become. So baha se, but the moment I'm pressing the send button, I know, okay, this is, you know, it's like, you know, like, what will these subscribers think? Will it work for them? Right? What if I fucked up? Right? What if? You know, all sorts of questions come so that the moment I press the send button, you know, I just sometimes feel chaubis ghante ke lena I should just disappear because that sense remains that okay, maine apna kaam kar diya because this I wanted to do, but I can't isolate myself from the feedback to the work actually, you know, so that part remains. And once I started thinking that a cognitive dissonance hits you, because you create an impression that, you know, I am doing this because I want to do this, right? And then once you start getting these thoughts, that no, I'm also thinking, what will the other person think about my writing? So wahan pe aage na aapka about that I am being dictated by the world. So and this, I observed Amit more closely. So my Instagram activity has now increased, okay, not increased, it's not that I'm all the time on Instagram, but if someone does the stats, the time I spent has gone up and I enjoy it. Instagram, I think I really love the platform compared to others, and there's a way I use it. But wahan pe I felt this, that there were moments when I perform on Instagram about and it just performed like just to be more clear, that unconsciously or consciously, I don't know, but like if I'm posting a meaningless meme on reposting on my Instagram story, right? I don't know why I'm doing it, okay? I post pictures, I go for this hike, love it, and I just post it. So then I started thinking, am I doing this, like, why am I posting this? Do I want to show people that, you know, okay, I have this beautiful zen of a life, right? So then usmein main ek pattern dekha that there are two things happening, one which is pure self-expression, right, I recently watched Dead Poets Society, okay, just loved"

That was for me to tell, you know, to timestamp that aaj is din main yeh soch raha tha and I didn't care about who likes it, who doesn't like it, but there are other times when it's not always self-expression, right? So I'm saying that it's a mix and it's a cognitive dissonance because you want to be this person, but that happens. So I think I don't know anyone or if you can completely escape it, but I think intentionality and again, I give all the credit to my diary that it just tells you what are your thick desires? Aap kya chase kar rahe ho and kyun? Because when you're honest to yourself, I think, I think Neil Postman had this quote that I'm forgetting the specifics, but something like this essence was, you know, there are a lot of bullshitters in the world, but we like to ourselves, we are the biggest bullshitters to ourselves about the stories we tell, right? So that way, I think I observed a lot of my, I've overanalyzed my Instagram activity. So wahaan se yeh sab aaya. And then I remembered in my notes, I had this quote from Warren Buffet where he asks, makes a distinction between an inner scorecard and an outer scorecard. So he poses this question, would you be the world's greatest lover, but the world feels you are the world's worst lover or the opposite? What would you want?"

So when I heard that, I was like, that makes so much sense, because the outer scorecard is never ending. It never ends. You talk about our profession, right, it's, again, I love all my journalist friends. But sometimes, you know, this whole thing about awards and retweets, and all of that, it is not, it's not why I do the work I do. And one thing I can tell, actually, I should say this in public. I think this was 2020, COVID time, yeah. This editor, there's a story I wrote, and he told me that, you know, his Ramnath Goenka awards are coming. So it's a great story. You should apply. And I, I thought, and I said, I won't apply. And he was like, why won't you apply? I said, boss, I have thought about it. I don't want to get stuck in this award business. Okay, I have, there's a philosophical reason where I think that awards perpetuate inequality. And you know, the myth of meritocracy that is separate. But apart from that, there was this thing that I never want to be known as an award winning journalist. I want to be a journalist because, again, it might be stupid, but to me, you know, this is an isolation. If you don't apply to an award, right, so you will just feel happy about everyone winning awards around you, right? And that just gave me such deep sense of comfort in my head that, you know, okay, I am a journalist, not because I want this award, but you know, just stay true to like why I joined this profession in the first place. Because to me, it just sticks to you. I don't know how long it will last, you know, but I'm saying this is the zone of wants and desires that every time I start seeing that there is an external influence that will affect my thick desires, I try to just get rid of it. Now, whether it happens or not is a different story, but that's the framing. And I think that has really helped me because now, you know, when I see like, you know, in journalism, one of the things I find, I don't know if it's generic, I don't want to generalize, but somehow I feel that among reporters and journalists, if someone else breaks a story, you know, you know, so you're like, you feel that sense of envy, you know, you know, okay, he got published there. He got like, I remember back in the day when I was at the Hindu, I heard this conversation between a couple of colleagues, they were discussing salary of a columnist whom I really like. And I felt so disgusted. I was like, oh, you know, this guy is making that much money. Uska toh bahut sahi hai, aisa aisa ho raha hai. And I feel like, what are these conversations, you know, I just, you know, I just didn't like it that why are these conversations happening. So the point I'm trying to make here is that, so I'm saying that when I saw that, that kind of conversation was happening, when I started seeing that, you know, when someone wins an award, or you know, someone breaks a story, everyone is not happy about it in a way. It's like, you know, you just look at Twitter patterns of what stuff we share up, you know, you retweet stuff of your friends from your organization, you know, you just promote stuff that your, you people, you know, personally, they have done, I don't know, it's my observation, I may be wrong. But that's a sense I got when I was in Delhi, that people are always like, I have some really accomplished friends. And those who know that I know these people, they will come and ask me, okay, do you know how much they make? How are they getting these assignments? Not in the sense of curiosity, but with a sense of envy. Right? I don't like it, Amit. I don't know, kitna common hai, but that's what I experienced. So then when I thought about it, it just struck me one over a period of time, not one day, that actually the work that we do as journalists, right, there is no meaning of my work in isolation. This profession matters only as a collective. If tomorrow I stop reporting, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. There's nothing going to happen. But if 1000 people like me exit this profession, it is going to matter a lot. Because in collective is where the power of reporting really comes in our profession, not in as individuals. So that's why the moment I started saying ki, you know, iss award race mein nahi jaana hai, follower ki race mein nahi jaana hai. And I remember there's this alumni who came to our campus, Ashish Gupta. He's a very, Helion Ventures, like he was the early investor in Flipkart. And when that exit happened, he's a very, very smart guy. And he gave a talk at campus. So he used this term called anti-matrix, you know. So he was explaining what, he says, he had this great talk on risk in thinking about life. And waha pe wo matrix, anti-matrix ki baat kar rahe the. Toh tab unhone samjhaya that, you know, there are some anti-matrix that you should not chase, like your salary, you know, like a designation. Yeh mere fourth year ki baat hai. Toh this word anti-matrix just stuck in my head."

And you realize and you're like, get out of it, you know, anti-matrix chahiye hi nahi. And I am a human, I have those, matlab main kitna bhi abhi bolnu, right? I will go back and there is a possibility that, you know, my theory about all of these things is that they're always in tension. You know, one part overtakes the other, woh ho raha hai, right? The more I can resist the impulses I do not want, the better. So that's the frame. So usme if you can fundamentally eliminate, agar aapne soch liya hai, mereko toh awards mein apply hi nahi karna hai, toh you're sorted. Because the next time a friend tells you, you know, I won this award, you will feel so happy about the person. They get a fellowship, something happens. And the, I don't know the tragedy, but again, the cognitive dissonance in all of this is that throughout my career, I keep getting opportunities. So I can never feel like that, ki mere saath kuch bura ho raha hai. Because I, you know, I just feel the world is rigged to push me forward. Sab kuch hoye jaa raha hai, mere saath toh sab acha hi ho raha hai. So on one hand, I will say, you know, I don't want, you know, I'm not cheesing this. But then things also come to me, right? So this whole calculus is that ki haan, agar mene wo chhod bhi diya, right, still things are happening to me. Toh then you realize ki actually uska point hi nahi hai. Like in 2017, I quit Twitter, okay? I read this book Deep Work by Cal Newport, usme ek chapter tha Quit Social Media. I don't know if any book has led me to a direct impact right after reading. Maine wo pada chapter, agle din mein gaya and I deleted my Twitter, not deactivated. Abhi mera deactivated hai. Uswaqt I deleted ki go. And I was away from Twitter for at least eight months, no presence. In that duration Amit, when eight months I was not on Twitter, I was not on Facebook, I got the best opportunity in my career. I got selected for this fellowship at the Wall Street Journal. And that day I was thinking ki I am always told that, you know, aapko apna brand banana padega, aapko you have to show your work, which is not wrong. I am saying in that phase, there is a fellowship I got purely out of like, I think it had very little to do with me. It was more about circumstances, not my effort. But I got it, right? When I was not on Twitter. So when you see these examples that you don't have followers, your story, aapka share ho raha hai, but you are not tagged, your name is coming that Samarth Bansal wrote this story. So I'm not gaining followers, nothing, I'm just, but I'm looking at Twitter, right? And it's not affecting. Then you start saying ki haan yeh anti-metric hi hai, you know, so I'm saying you get that framework and then you try to apply it and it kind of works. So it's that theory, plus you see it in practice and then it just illuminates that, you know, actually that guy was right, this is an anti-metric. And then, you know, you, I have my own framework on how I think about career, toh that's it. I think that's where, I think I've digressed quite a bit, but that's the, I think the, I'm just giving you a glimpse into how I think about some of these things."

Like maine bhi awards ke liye enter ki hai waise, pehle jeeta bhi hoon, lekin looking back, it's not like, it's not something I would do today, but I've done it because you are sort of insecure. There are times you feel underappreciated, toh matlab uska faida hota hai. I remember, you know, in the 1990s, someone who was a good friend of mine then and is a famous novelist now, told me something when we were having dinner. And he said that Amit every time a friend of mine does well, a part of me dies, right? And I appreciate the brutal honesty in that because I think that in a sense it is true for all of us. And, and I've kind of realized that, that wo hai and especially when, you know, and I think it'd probably be more true for a third world country, like, you know, that old apocryphal thing about crabs pulling each other down. And and the reason the story is told about India is that we've grown up in the culture of scarcity, where because you are not doing well, we are playing negative sum games or zero sum games, you want to pull other people down. And hopefully, as a cultural mindset that is changing today. And that's sort of something to watch out for. Like another thing that I try to do in my own life is I try to get away from toxicity and negativity. Like maine ek dekha hai ki there are WhatsApp groups I used to be part of, where the whole conversation poora din would just be negative. They would be shitting on someone, kisi ka screenshot laga diya, and, you know, all of that. And obviously shitting on someone makes you feel good about yourself, right? And that was a whole damn conversation. This is your friend's group. It is a friend's group. Yeah. And, and I left many of these groups and I said, I don't want to be around toxicity,"

And you realize that if anybody does well, everybody else will be happy for that person, genuinely happy. You know, yeh koi feeling nahi hogi peeche ki, arey yaar yeh toh yasa hai, isko kaise ho gaya, you know. And that might be, and I'm just thinking aloud, because we are not playing any one of those competitive games, we're not in the same game, we are not, you know, we happen to be there together because of a shared interest.

You know, I, you know, I think I've, my whole journey since I started my blog, you know, and became a journalist, I never, you know, could use this word for myself, as like mein reporter hoon, mein article likhta hoon, but mein writer nahi hoon. You know, there's this whole sense of, like, I don't belong, you know, to like, there's something, you know, I don't know, it's just weird, but because I love reading books and writers, so like, bhai wo, that's not me, you know, so that sense, but somehow I got the courage to tell myself that, you know, ab jo hoga dekhenge, ab apne aapko toh bol diya maine, that, you know, I want to be a writer, ab bol diya toh karo, you know what I mean, that you have declared to yourself, like, you know, when I declared to myself in grade 7, that I want to be a software engineer, and you work towards it, right, ab jo hoga dekhenge, so that happened recently. So I was then thinking that, okay, ab bol diya hai, toh ab iska meaning kya hai, right, what does it mean? So then I started thinking that ismein, this whole tension between, that I observed in any creative field, is that it's very hard to have a objective metric, it's, you know, so I dabbled two worlds, I'm a journalist, but I'm still a software, like, I love writing software, it's just that over the period of time, my love for words overtook my love for writing code. Okay, so that has happened. But that one point I was thinking, okay, you know, there are comparisons between these two things. Fundamentally, both are acts of creation, you think something, yahan pe aap code se kar rahe ho, wahan shabdo se kar rahe ho, right, so they are acts of creation, it's just that one overtook the other. In my other world, in the computer science world, you can still see some metrics, right, after you have created something, right? You know, it's just bits and atoms kind of thing, right, you can, chahe aapne product banaya ho, toh you can see users, if it's in a business setting, you can see revenue, all sorts of things. In this world, I said, it's a tension because I want to be read, but that I don't want the want to be read to take over the fundamental desire of creation, right? So jab mein yeh sab pe, I was thinking about it, I got this brilliant frame from Ira Glass. Do you know Ira Glass? I've heard the name. So Ira Glass is this master of radio storytelling in the US. He started this podcast in the, not radio at the time, This American Life, and then Serial, which I think Serial just exploded, right? So I've read a lot about Ira's work and how he thinks. And I saw this, his two minute clip on YouTube, and I think anyone in creative profession"

        "message": "Taste and talent. Yeah, exactly. So that is the thing. So I'll just describe it. So Ira says that the reason why people start doing creative work is that they have some idea of, you know, the taste that they have about, okay, like, for me, what is that piece of writing I want to do, but my talent is not at par to deliver that taste. So it's a journey that you take to bridge that gap between where your talent is and where your taste is. But he says the problem is that the gap is so huge, and it takes years to fill that gap that a lot of people just give up because they feel they are not good enough. And Ira said this, that I want to tell every creator out there that every single person goes through this journey of filling that gap. And the only way to fill that gap is to keep creating. Put yourself on a deadline and put out stuff. And honestly, Amit, you have spoken about this multiple times in your podcast. And when I think about my newsletter, I took inspiration from you when you said that, you know, don't overthink quality, you know, keep doing stuff, keep doing stuff. But when that frame hit me, it just changed the way I think because I'm saying, ha, you know, I have a taste. There is this kind of piece that I want to write. I can't write it today, right? But someday I will. And, you know, in this whole process, something brilliant happened in 2018. And I have a page in my diary where I described a certain kind of piece I wanted to write. And I don't want to get into details. It's very personal. But I wrote something this year that met that bar, you know. And of course, as your own evolution of your own creative process and what you want, you know, that thing keeps changing. So that gave me confidence that if after 4 years, what I wrote in 2018, that I want to write a piece like this. And the world will not recognize this because that is, that is like, who will know what I wanted to write and I have created, you know, 5 people may say it's great work, you know, 10 may say it's not that great. It's an ordinary piece of writing. But even those appreciation of 5 cannot, you know, match with the feeling that something I thought 4 years ago is today in front of me. So I have, and because I'm this math nerd, and you know, the world, like the world looks like a set of metrics, etc. I had to work very hard on myself to get out of that zone and take comfort in abstract where there is no objective metric. But there are metrics and the metric is on a day-to-day basis, like, am I creating? Is my writing better than what I was writing a month ago, right? Is there something, you know, it's very hard to put in words, but there is something intrinsic in that process. You know, like, for example, you read a, I read a piece I wrote, is there a sentence that I wrote, which just feels that, wow, I was able to write the sentence. It just gives me joy if that sentence comes, if the sound of a paragraph, to me, sounds like, oh, I actually could not write this paragraph a year ago. So I have tuned my, I don't know, feelings, brain, whatever, to take comfort in this. Though, of course, like, I think I would not deny that it matters that, you know, I recently launched a newsletter with a friend on food and fitness, something different I'm trying to do. And of course, like, you know, I'm observing, like, yesterday, the first issue went out and we are trying to create something unique in our heads. Now, what that will be, we will know from reader feedback. So I'm looking forward to how many people are replying to the email, right? I just checked this morning, are people sharing it on Twitter, right? Is it working? I shared it on my Instagram. What is the feedback? Right. And when someone just says, you know, as a writer, there is a, and writer not like I don't write fiction or, you know, any abstract things. I just write like informative stuff in a way I want to tell a story. If someone gets the intent that, you know, this is what I was trying to do, like the feeling I wanted someone to take back, ye take away tha, if this, the response comes, that, you know, oh, this part of my brain clicked, this is what I felt after it, then I get a deep sense of satisfaction that what I was trying to do with my words has happened. You know, that it's not unclear, like I have, there's an objective with which I went into a piece. Either I'm editing it or I'm writing it. And that was delivered. Now those three people say it, but you know, if those three people don't say it, it hurts. There's a practical example I wrote, my last story of my newsletter, after which I discontinued was on polling, forecasting, election forecasting. Amit, on that piece, that's one of the hardest stories I've worked on. I spent a whole month, one full month of effort to write that piece. And I got the least feedback on email on that piece because it was a nerdy piece. And back end I knew it was a nerdy piece, but I really, you know, my own, in my head, I try to do things to make it interesting, whatever, whatever. But there was, I got very little feedback, right? So I got, I got a little bit of feedback, but it was great. But it was only from people who know the subject. So I was like, okay, job done, I mean, I cracked it for myself, but the itch remained that, you know, I just didn't want to write it for people who are interested in forecasting. I wanted to do something else. So now I have it in my head that I'm done for now. Now I will write a piece on election forecasting after five years. I know the thing, but I want to write it in a way that people who did not respond now, maybe they connect with it, you know, something like that. So this is, I know, I mean, that's a metric, that's like, I can't quantify it, but I feel it."

So you'll appreciate that, which is that in poker, we know that while it's a game of skill, the quantum of luck is so high that you cannot focus on short-term results, right? You have to put in volume only over large sample sizes, does your edge manifest itself? So the first mantra of a good poker player always is don't be results oriented, the process matters. Process matters. And where is this relevant in writing? This is relevant because what often happens is that you will write something and you will feel like it is shit, right? And a beginning writer will use this as a reason to give up."

Number one, and this I feel very, very strongly and passionately about, there are a lot of things in which a natural talent is needed, like if you want to be a musician, you want to be a batsman, you need some hand-eye coordination, all of those things are not needed in writing. You know, anybody can work hard and lift that level. And the other thing, just using different terms in glass, but pretty much the same idea is that when you don't like something that you have written, all it means is that your judgment is better than your ability. You have these two things, your judgment is better than your ability. The question to then ask is, how does my ability rise to the level of my judgment or at least get closer? Right? Because your judgment will just keep going up, obviously. And there is only one answer to that and that answer is to keep writing, to trust the process and therefore don't be results oriented. Sometimes what happens is you write something you think is shit, you're just being hard on yourself. But my point is that especially when you're learning writing or anything for that matter, you will suck at the beginning, always, right? So the important thing is to recognize that, yes, I suck."

And then they saw results and like the quantity group had created like 50 pots and this quality group was thinking about how to make it, they theorized, you know, they were going all directions and they came up with one pot. And the 50th pot from the quantity group was significantly better than the quality group because they were just creating, creating, creating. They just created, found their mistake, created the next one. And in that progression, you know, the 50th one was just better than the one that the quality group created. So when I read that, I was like, I had this whole anxiety in the middle, you know, I want a time when I can just write one story in four months. Kitna maza aayega, you know, I should have that liberty. I mean, I'm not saying that I don't want it, maybe it would be great.

So they asked me for advice that, how do you get published? Okay, they want to like, you know, I think so many people want to write. And one of the things that irritates me is that, when they know to aap kitab likhoge kya? And I was like, no, boss, I don't write because I want to be a book writer. I just write because of other reasons. So people ask me ki hai hume na, I have this viewpoint, main koi akbaar mein chhap wana hai. Toh kaise karte hain? Like, how do you get published in a newspaper? Because aapka naam aata hain akbaar mein. So then, like, I want to know what advice would you give them? I'll tell you what I tell them. So I try to tell them that, write as if, abhi aap likho, don't think about getting published in a, you know, a Hindustan Times or The Print, kyuki ye aata hai ki, you know, news laundry mein chal jayega, yahan chal jayega. Toh aapko likhna chalu karna hai na, so start a blog, and in your head think, 10 people will read it. Thek hai? 8, like, 5 baar tum khud padhoge, 3 tumhare dost padhenge, and 2 random people, medium mein kisi ne dhoond liya, whatever. And just start writing and putting out stuff. Don't think of, ki, whether, like, don't let, if a publication is not responding, don't stop writing because of that, because it works the other way around. And Amit, you know what I have observed, koi karta hi nahi, they don't, if they are not getting hearing back from a publication, they just stop writing. And I observed similarly in, like, I really love to help anyone who wants to get started with writing code, like, it's one of my deep desires to, you know, teach people writing Python code. Main second year se likh raha hoon, apne college mein, I love the language, you know, it's just, you can do anything on the internet with that. So I can't tell you the number of people who say, you know, we want to learn this language, and then I write them emails, ki aap kuch mat socho, go to this source, then you do this, and aapko kahin atak jao na, I am, I'll come on a call and help you, okay. Don't think that programming is some, you know, this thing that you need a degree nahi chahiye, it's like, agar aap Angrezi bol sakte ho, toh aap Python bhi likh sakte ho, kuch bhi nahi hai usme, right. It's just if-else statements, that's what's happening. That step doesn't happen, like, it's just weird in the last 10 years, I've told so many people about code and this starter blog, not a single person has come back. So I often wonder, am I giving the wrong advice, or like, what is behind this? So do you have any suggestions on, is my approach wrong? Because I want to help, and you know, that they become better writers, they're able to write code. But step one doesn't happen, because no one comes back to me."

In which case, it doesn't matter what advice you give, woh hoga nahi, because it's driven by validation. But two, maybe they really want it, let's give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they really want it, ho nahi raha hai. I don't think the problem is your advice, I think your advice is great. I agree with your advice, but I want to elaborate a bit on the whys of the advice. Like, I would give people exactly the same advice as you just gave, but I want to elaborate on the why. Ab kya tha ki 90s mein when I was starting out, obviously, as a writer, what you want to do is you want to, you want your byline. Toh then what you think in those days is ki TOI mein bhejo, Express mein bhejo, koi lega, bhi nahi lega, all of that. Today, I think there's, it's a bad idea for a number of reasons. And I want to elaborate why even for a young writer, it's, you know, obviously, it's easy for someone like people like you and me to have newsletters, because kuch toh brand hai, kuch toh log jaante hai. What is a beginner to do? I would say even a beginner should start a newsletter or a blog. And I'll explain why. Number one, what happens when you are sending your work out to these platforms is you're going through gatekeepers, those gatekeepers have specific tastes of their own specific biases of their own. They are often looking for only what is newsworthy or in the news cycle. And all of those are restrictions. They are looking for only a particular form, like 800 word mein likhna hai, that much space they have. And all of those are restrictions of form, the necessity to be part of the news cycle, the house style that they might have, their particular biases and tastes, all those kind of get in the way and you want to avoid those. The second thing is that if you go down that circle that I will send op-ed idea, koi achcha bolega, phir mein publish karunga, then the point is that you won't be writing enough."

But otherwise, you won't be writing enough. And the key to writing good as we were discussing is write a lot. You have to write a lot, you have to go to the writing gym, you got to work out, work out, work out, work out, itse wo nahi hoga. And also if you're writing sporadically, only when an op-ed editor says ki theek hai kuch likho, then you won't even be able to write a good piece kyuki aapki wo habit nahi hai, aapki sirf desire hai, lekin wo habit nahi hai ki aap regularly likh rahe ho. And this becomes an impediment. The third thing is that you are missing out on what I think is a unique opportunity for creators in the modern age of building communities of their readers. Pehle kya ho raha hai, aapka TOI mein piece aa raha hai, koi dekh raha hai aur bol raha hai ki yaar yeh Samarth Bansal tu bahut achcha likha hai, change my mind about data. And but they forget about you. That's where it is. You know, a month later, they look at you in the Indian Express and they'll be like, haan matlab naam suna suna lag raha hai, achcha piece hai. And then they forget about you. But what happens is if somebody comes across a link to your newsletter, they click, they read the link. And they're saying, yeah, this guy's a good guy. And they put their email. And everything else you write now goes to them, right? It goes into their email box. And that email database belongs to you. It doesn't belong to a substack or whoever the host is. The email database belongs to you. And what you have done through this is you formed a community of Samarth Bansal fans. And you are always in touch with them. Abhi toh aap newsletter likh rahe ho, parsu supposing you have some interesting project, you can crowdsource funds, you can write to these guys, aapne agar YouTube channel shuru hai, you can, you know, write to these guys and subscribe to this, you've built that community that network of people. So for that reason, if there is a young person listening to this, and they want to write, I will say, first of all, have a bias for action. Don't let yourself hold back by what will people think of you right now a nobody's thinking of you. And it'll take a lot of iteration for you to achieve excellence. And the important thing is you can achieve excellence, you will achieve excellence if you stick at it long enough. So my advice would be go out and write. And initially, aap newsletter is I would recommend it over a blog because people don't go to destination websites anymore, clicking on you indiancut.com kaun karta hai, to have a newsletter, so that every time you're hooking those people in your work goes to their mailbox, you're forming a community of fans, and write as regularly as you can. Don't overthink ki log kya sochenge, just keep writing and and experiment with form. Don't put yourself in a box and say ki, you know, op-ed toh maine dekha hai, 800 word hota hai. Or I think creators think in terms of boxes of the past, that kitab hai toh 100,000 words, article hai toh this much, and so on. And I think one of the things about blogging that I loved and that freed me up is that you can think beyond form. Earlier conventions of forms were because of physical restrictions, right? In music as well, in films, in everything, those restrictions don't exist anymore, right? So just embrace a world where you have the freedom, you can do anything you want. So in a nutshell, so in a nutshell, I would give them exactly the same advice you're giving,"

So you know, Amit, there's some publication which was commissioning me a story. And I absolutely loved, you know, we discussed the idea.

Her sentence, I mean, for good, because my writing was shit. You know, I did this unfortunate thing of looking at my first drafts that I wrote seven years ago. And I was like, how did the Hindu hire me? I mean, why did they, like, how could they do it with this, right? That's the sense you get. And like, you feel a bit good that progress has been made. But I'm saying, that thing never went away in my head that I have a byline on it. But every sentence, you know, it just, you know what I mean, it just, it's painful, you know, I wrote it all, the name is mine, but the article is not mine. But people are saying that you wrote it, all of that. So the dream was that these editors, they got a call from, or somehow they connected and they said, Samarth, we heard that you can't write magazine pieces. You know, every line of yours has been edited. How do we know? We have seen your other work. How do we do have not spoken to other people? So we think you are not capable to write for us. Interesting dream. Yeah. And I don't know what happened after that. And no, no, I tell you, one thing happened, then I started giving them explanations that no, no, no, no, no, actually, you know, that was like 2016. I was new. But you know, I've worked so hard, I've done this, now you should read my other pieces. I went from there to now my pieces are published, you know, with 10% editing in the best of Indian newspapers. So you should say no, no, no, no, something was happening. So I don't know what happened after that, in that dream. But the reason I was telling this is that even when you know that things are on track, you know, with the whole framework I gave you, if that dream is coming, you know, there is something there, right? There is something. There is something. I mean, I can't describe it, but you know, like I'm the only reason I mentioned this is that now I feel relatively slightly bit more confident to put my work out in the public because you know, when you work on the technicalities of language, all of those things, right, it's not maybe the best piece of writing or whatever, you know, like a very smart, like if Amit Verma reads my piece, then he will see it, you know, like I wrote a piece, then, you know, there's someone who was really helping me with my editing and the piece was not edited. So the next day I asked him on the phone what I had done, he said, boss, you messed up at the end. I said, damn, she caught it because I knew I fucked up and she because she knew my writing, she could just point out that you played the game early here, I said, yes, I did, you know, and it just pained me, I said, if they see it, so others will also see it, right? So I'm saying that people who know, who think about the craft of writing, they can catch, but still it is beyond something that's, it's okay, I don't feel embarrassed to put things out in the world, you know, that's what I'm saying, you know, that's like, threshold wise, it just crossed that, uske baad bhi, agar yeh sapna aa raha hai, that means that there is some anxiety, kuch toh hai, so that's, I just, I'm just sharing that this was a dream I got, even though I feel a bit more comfortable in putting out my work."

So, so your dreams are fascinating, you know, yeah, dreams are sort of dreams are so fascinating. And when what he was saying about, you know, sending a piece to your friend and realizing and knowing you made a mistake in the craft, and then she catches it and says, end mein kya kya hai. And sometimes and what's happened with this podcast is ki yeh genre thora naya hai, chaar ghante ki conversation, paanch ghante ki conversation kaun karta hai. Now, as you would expect, there's a lot of intentionality behind what I do. And I have figured out guidelines of craft for myself. And the whole thing is a moving thing, it keeps changing. And there's nothing like it outside, because nobody does it. It's almost like a new form. How do you do a five hour conversation. And I will often look back on older episodes I've done and I'll think of mistakes I made in terms of craft, in terms of the directions I went down or the way I structured it. And I know that literally nobody else will see those. I mean, they might have an effect on the listener, but they won't see it as a mistake of craft because matlab, it's, you know, there is no guideline that yeh craft hai, while writing in journalism have textbooks on craft and all of that. But my principle is ki, you just barrel on, you do episode after episode, just barrel on. So I never look back, you just barrel on. And that's again, in a sense, as far as at least my podcasting is concerned, I think I'm embodying the advice I give others that karte rao, just keep doing, you know, unfortunately, I haven't been able to follow that advice enough in my own writing, because I would like to write much more. And I've had issues with process and discipline and all of that. But at least in this, it has worked for me, that you keep doing it, you will get better over time, you will realize you've gotten better over time. In retrospect, you will see that I went from A to B to C or whatever. But in the moment, sometimes you can't and there's a danger in paralyzing yourself by being too self critical."

It's like hai bechare bachche, bachpan chheen liya, you know, that's the narrative, you know, and I'm like, I don't know, I am not commenting on it as a reporter, but I'm like, this is not me yaar, mera toh, we had a blast at coaching, we had a great time. So anyway, that was so, our chemistry teacher, unhone ek cheez batai, I think, you know, he was just trying to motivate us. He says, you know, success is boring. Like, what does that mean? He says, think about Sachin Tendulkar. He said, what does this guy do? This guy, every day, goes to the field, you know, takes a bat and hits the ball. Right? That is all this guy does day in day out. And that's why he's Sachin. Toh hum like, baat toh sahi hai, kar kya raha hai? Ball hi toh hit kar raha hai. So, he was just trying to tell us that, like, you know, study, you know, focus on the process, don't think about, you know, have a goal, but like, solve your problems. And don't, like, you know, because everyone around us kind of telling nahi, these nerds, bachche, parte rehte hain, all of those things, right? So, like, ignore, ignore, you know, just, you have a goal, you want to, you know, want to get to that institute. So, just study. And like, if, if, if you think it's boring, it's because boring is the norm. I mean, that's how he was trying to tell us about exams. We didn't find our math, physics, chemistry problems boring. We loved it. That's why wo hum kar rehte hain. So, same thing abhi bhi hota hai that, you know, aise kuch pada nahi chal raha hai that, you know, what's happening idhar udhar. But it's just that, if someone thinks ki outcome ikdum se nahi mil raha hai. So, I just remember that story ki, you know, Sachin bhi, you know, ground pe jaake, bas, he's just hitting the ball. Toh aap bhi, you know, computer pe baith ke likte rao. Whatever happens is."

Like I'll tell people that, you know, you think that Virat Kohli is an arrogant brat and all that jaisa uska image hai. But when it comes to his craft, I guarantee you that he is a humblest person around because the only way you get that good is by playing thousands of balls in the nets, focusing only on what you're doing wrong. Right. Focusing only like, why am I missing that swinging ball outside the off stump? You examine, your coaches will tell you, your fellow batsmen will tell you, you focus on your mistakes. So people might be arrogant outside of their domain where they've achieved excellence. But my belief is that to achieve excellence, you have to be incredibly humble in that domain, because nahi toh nahi hone wala hai. You know, you have to. And at the same level of the same time, you perhaps also need a level of, you know, self delusion helps. Like when I think of myself as a young person, my ability and my judgment were both bad. So I would write shit and I would think it's great. This is like when? India ka time? No, no, 20s, I guess. Yeah. So I would write shit and I would think it's great.

Aur mera, you know, archives mere paas hain. And like, like, forget quality of ideas. Ideas toh the hi nahi. They were grammatical mistakes. So once, you know, we had a college fest aur hum railway station gaye we the. And this friend of mine, in I think the third semester or something, he comes and tells me that, do you know what people in the English Literary Society say about your blog? I was like, what do they say? He says like, that, you know, it's like written like this, it's written like that. You know, that one person was telling me, you know, samarth ka blog toh matlab, what is it? Toh uss waqt mujhe, I was like, those arrogant people, unko kya bata, main toh likhunga, right? I didn't realize it until very late that technically they were right. Matlab, it was objectively bad piece of writing in sense of grammar. Everything was broken. But uss waqt main kare ja raha tha because, you know, for me, the blog was just a, you know, what the name of my blog was. And you will know when I say it's self-expression. Don't tell me it's random musings or something that was a cliche of those days. It's, it's embarrassing. But my name of the, my blog's name was Crazy Sam. Okay, with the crazy ka spelling tha, K-R-A-Z-Z-Y, because I just loved Hrithik Roshan's dance in this movie game, Crazy 4. Toh you know, when I started my blog after my coaching, I was like Crazy Sam. Toh at 17, you know, matlab ab 13 saal ki umar mein aapko samajh aata hai, you know, email addresses, all of us have those. Toh mujhe kabhi samajhi nahi aaya. And even when it hit me, till I became a journalist, I didn't change the name of the blog because mujhe laga haan woh, it was some madness, jisme woh blog aaya tha. And the blog will reflect that madness. So, I am not going to change the name. Right? So, but over time, I saw that at least I was true to self-expression. Agar maine blog ka naam bhi nahi change kara, right? I knew like what, like I knew it was funny, you know. But tha ki, you know, this is for self-expression. Language can go to hell. Malabh woh, pata bhi nahi tha ki language kharab ho rahi hai, right? And one day, like I recently, you know, you will say, you know, kitna narcissistic banda hai. But I don't have my journal from college. So, you know, what's the best archive? Facebook messages. Because us waqt, I used to have these long, ab kaun hi Facebook use karta hai? And even on Instagram, I don't text. Us waqt toh, you know, we're in college, aap heart to heart kare ja rahe ho apne doston ke saath, right? So, I have snapshots of what I was writing to my friends. Like, so it's just brilliant, like for me to time travel. So, yeah, that's why I'm saying you could feel that bahut narcissistic, you know, apne waare mein sochta raha tha.

She read my blog and she sent me this long message saying that, you know, Samar, you wrote this. I, you know, as a, it was something about festival that I wrote something, something. She said, you know, as a girl, I relate with what you wrote, tak tak tak. But I think that, you know, you could work on your language. It feels like you are translating your thought in Hindi to just English. And main abhi padha hai do hafta pehle. And I was like, she was damn right. She was damn right. Because I was just thinking. And in IIT, at least Kanpur, the culture is not to speak in English. You know, it's very Hindi focused, like in our hostels, etc. Hindi mein baat karte hain. Toh poora tha. Now, I don't know how that happened, but now I think in English. Uswaq main Hindi mein sochta tha. Toh whatever used to come in my head, I used to just, she, I don't know how, but she picked it. She said, it looks like you are just translating your raw thought in Hindi on your blog, which is admirable because I get your sentiment. But on that process, you know, you can work on your language, you know, your grammar is going off, you know. And I read it and I was so thankful to her that, you know, she took the time to read and give, like kaun itna acha feedback deta hai aaj ke time pe. It's beautiful, but how did you react at the time? Haan, so I was listening. So I, so I honestly don't remember the specifics of what I felt, but I just thanked her uswaqt that, you know, thank you so much for reading. I will think about it. You're right. But I don't think that I had that appreciation of what that message meant until now, because in retrospection, now that I can see that, that she caught it, that, you know, and why I, unfortunately, I didn't know it. Like I was in Bombay in May and, you know, this couple lives in Bombay and I was there and I met her after eight years. I first met, you know, when they just started dating and I was in Bombay for my work, for my internship. So we were meeting after eight years and we just had this chat. Uske baad jaake mene, and you know, I remember in that, you know, we were in that restaurant and talking and she just said, I'm hearing that, you know, now you're getting published in places, very glad to know. So when I saw that message, I just felt that, you know, if I knew it that time, you know, I would have thanked her that, you know, like people like, and like, we don't, we haven't spoken at all, but you know what I'm trying to say. It's just beautiful that, that's what I'm saying, generosity, that, you know, people, and that's, you know, some of, one of my faiths that even that, you know, if I fuck up, if I put out a bad piece of writing, but the intent is visible to people, you know,"

Okay, 2018, like, when no one knew Substack, I was on Substack, I was trying to do something. While having a job at HT, I started something. Again, let's not get into it, I'll always say it's bad, but whatever. So one day, what I did, I wrote a newsletter and I tried to be funny. And I'm not funny, as a person. I'm not, you know, wit and, you know, funny. I mean, that's not me. I was never that person, you know, but I tried to be smart. You know, then I was recommending, actually, I was, that was post where I was recommending a list of podcasts. Okay, ki aaj mein par kuch nahi hai, Diwali ki chhutti hai, something like that. Aur uska intro tha na, I was pretending to be smart, that you know, witty. And then this someone I knew from college, she was a postgraduate student. She wrote me a long email. Okay, she said, look Samarth, I'll be honest with you. What have you written? This is not you. Okay, I have seen what you, so I was the editor of the, like, my favorite memory from college is that I revamped my campus newspaper and I wrote, she said, I know what you did there. What, something, something that, I'm not, I'm forgetting the specifics, but her, and see, I've seen what you're doing in other newsletters. And usse pehle she has responded saying that, great piece, why don't you do this? Yeh kya likha hai tumne? This is not you. You're trying to be someone who you're not, and it's visible. And it was, and I was like, I could not say anything because she was right. But I would not have realized this because in my head, I was trying to be, you know, this smart guy, witty person. But jab usme hai nahi, so I'm saying that someone would be like, someone can say na, haan chalo, bad piece chalo, aagey bado. The fact that someone takes the effort, and in today's age, you can always be doubtful na ki, mai criticize karunga, to how will the other person take it?

Yeah, you know, even if you feel criticism is coming from a bad place, never ever react. And reacting with anger is actually reflexive and understandable. Because often we put so much emotional energy into what we write, that it becomes tied up with our sense of self. Toh kisi ne mere piece ko criticize kiya, toh personal attack lagta hai.

And I think one of the point which I'm really looking forward to digging into and one of the points Sapolsky has made in this, if I remember correctly, in his episode with Sam Harris is about, you know, how the reason there is so much violence among young males is that the male brain really develops fully only by the age of 25. I think it's a frontal cortex, which is responsible for that socializing part of behavior and all of that. And that really develops only by, you know, 25, which is why you have so much violence among, you know, teenage males, and the bulk of violence in society really comes from young males. And that's interesting. And that may also speak to, you know, the observation, which otherwise seems to be a stereotype, and I avoid them. But the fact is that young women are"

And then Lewis goes into he starts a story that this was the origin of mansplaining, and ends with some research on exactly this point that this whole business of mansplaining comes from, you know, the sense of men feeling superior in a group about bullshitting that they know, and women not adequately responding to it. And the the point he was trying to make, actually, his core point was that after you have done this, you don't realize what you have done. So you become, the gap increases. It's not that you feel embarrassed that oh, you know, no, you don't feel embarrassed about it. You double down on it. And when you double down on it, your habit keeps on perpetuating, it doesn't go down.

You know, I was just frustrated, that why don't you understand that? Like, you're wrong. That you know, that's not the story. This is the story and I'm telling you. It was a confusion. Then for some reason, you know, I think my thing prevailed. Fortunately, next day, I was right that, you know, I was, I was hitting the right story. But that incident stuck with me because I always felt that, you know, I was right, but I somehow like, I don't know this tension between how do I isolate that whether I'm just being, you know, this overconfident man in a setting, or, you know, it's just like, you know, right, like, this is the story. This is not the story. Like, I, you know, something like, I actually know more than you on this, you know. And this is the so, I don't know where the tension goes. But sometimes you just feel and that, which is why I'm saying it's politically incorrect. Because I know when you are in in a structure of privilege in a larger scheme of things, right? How do you isolate whether you're acting as the quote unquote oppressor, or, you know, the powerful in the dynamics, or you are outside that structure on the fundamentals, I think you, you know, you can take it about religion, like, I'll give you another example. There's someone wrote a column saying that you can't upper caste Hindu man can't criticize a Muslim woman journalist. Okay, I read that. And I read the book of I don't want to take names here. And I in my notes, I have criticism of this specific person. And I don't want to take names of this specific person. And I went into this deep thought here. I am in my head not thinking in terms of identity. I am again, I as I said, I try to think that I'm a first principles thinker. This is journalism 101. It's not mapping up. So what I want to ask you is that have you ever this tension between identity? And like, that I'm not behaving, my identity is not overpowering me in this situation. It's independent of that. So I don't know, I've not figured out a way. Because, you know, I just feel that, you know, I'm on the other side. So like, I just know,"

        "message": "want to know what you think of it. So yeah, but what thinking about there are three sort of thoughts which come to mind. And one thought is that in the instance of the discussion you had with your colleague about the tech thing, you actually knew more than her, or, you know, at least, it wasn't as if it was her expertise, and you were mansplaining to her. Mansplaining typically is when the man knows nothing, and the woman is the expert, and he's telling her something that she knows more about. So, you know, those are the bare facts. I think every time you explain something to somebody, it's not an act of splaining, necessarily. So just to apply that hammer to every nail may not always be fair, but we need to watch out for ourselves doing that, and make sure that we don't kind of do that. The other thing is that there is this, like at, like I tell everyone who interacts with me that take me at face value, that mere kuch, you know, beyond what I say, there is no, you know, don't read subtext into it, don't think that I intend something I didn't say, take me at face value, don't add a layer to it. I didn't get it. Don't, we should not take you at face value. No, take me at face value. Yeah, take me at face value. And always assume goodwill. Assume that what I am saying is what I mean. So I like to have a conversation without layers. Like now when we are speaking to each other, I don't think we are thinking things like, Amit, why did you ask this? You know, what does this mean? And so there is, it's just face value. And that's the kind of conversation I like to have. However, the thing is that sometimes there are other layers, even if you don't want there to be. So for example, if you are, you know, like I remember once I was driving with a couple of friends to a mall in Bombay, and I was weaving my way through traffic. I'm a typical Bombay driver. In fact, I think I'm the best driver in the world in Bombay. So I'm a typical Bombay driver, lane change. And we reached a mall. And as we got into the mall, these two women got into the lift with us, and one of them started shouting at me that you only overtook me because I'm a woman. Because I didn't look inside the other cars, I was just doing my thing. And so I was just about to respond that no, ma'am, aisi koi baat nahi hai, aisa nahi tha. When the friend who was with me, he kind of just tapped me on the shoulder and said, you know, don't argue back. And then later, he told me that you have to understand where she's coming from. She's coming from a place where she's at the receiving end of a lot of shit from men, literally all women are, right. So it is natural for her on a bad traffic day to feel ki oh shit, there's another man just going past me. Right? So don't argue back. Just take it. There's no point in, you know, have some sympathy and some empathy for where she is from. And I thought that was an important lesson for me. Ki waha pe face value doesn't work. Waha pe you have to realize that there is a layer. And maybe you have to step back and realize that there is a layer. However, obviously, in a case of an argument in a newsroom, you can't step back from the truth. You know, when you when you're arguing something like what you're arguing, I would say you have to argue that"

And as far and my third thought on this is that when you talk about, you know, somebody saying that you don't have a right to criticize somebody because of your identity of birth. Yeah, I feel that if it's a particular person, you know, it's okay to be aware of that context and tailor your tone and conversation accordingly. But if a third person is giving that criticism, I feel it's bullshit. And it's bullshit. Because I feel the problem with a lot of modern identity politics is people get reduced to identities of birth. Whereas we contain multitudes, we are deeply complex, I find it offensive if someone reduces me to an identity over which I had no control. Right. And I also find it not helpful when someone less privileged than me is also pigeonholed and imprisoned in an identity trap and given a narrative of victimhood when they are also a lot more than that. Absolutely. So I just feel that this kind of politics is toxic to the discourse that we have to be aware of privileges. Obviously, we have to be aware of all of that and mindful of that. But to reduce all interactions to just being an interaction between identities of birth, I think can be really toxic. And it is offensive to everybody involved. Because we are not just one thing. We are many things. So these are my sort of thinking allowed kind of responses."

Right. So, so I might have felt I felt guilty, not of my privilege itself, but ways in which it has made me behave. Like looking back today, much the same way that you look back through your journaling, looking back to my childhood, I can see that, you know, because of family background, and because of all of that, I had both a social arrogance and an intellectual arrogance. And both of them were unwarranted. And I would assume that, of course, they might have made me behave in ways which are absolutely obnoxious. You know, and I think that, hey, I wouldn't want to know that person today. And it is possible I behave today in ways that I might find obnoxious 10 years later, who knows, but not by privilege itself, because that is luck, right?

And then, Amit, one thing that I still struggle with is that, in fact, we are talking about how I think, etc., etc. Now, we should have put a caveat in the starting that one of the reasons that the fact that, you know, whatever decisions you take, right, there is so much, like, risk-taking, right? I mean, if you talk about probability, right? You know, sometimes when, you know, my friends from college, they say, you know, You know, I was like, I'm happy for you. But boss, if you think objectively about what is risk, you have to think about the worst-case scenario, right? And when you start giving in that frame, right, in distribution, worst case, etc., at deal events, etc., then that hit me that that is what the privilege does, that Very true. Right? So, when I wrote a blog on my freelancing journey, you know, which I, because people kept asking me and I wanted to explain my model. So, I started that piece with a long, you know, description, boss. Because I used to see on Twitter that everyone has a bad experience freelancing. You know, no one is giving money, no assignments are coming. People were paying me money on time. I was getting assignments. So, I was like, what is happening? My experience. So, if I write, you know, That is also misleading. So, I don't know. So, I wrote, I think, 300 words in the starting to explain that, boss, this is a privilege, this is a privilege. So, please don't generalize. Okay? The game is different. It is, this is what works for me because this. But I will not write after every sentence that, you know, I have network, I have this, whatever, whatever. So, I put it. The feedback I got was very interesting. Because then people said that the fact that some of my friends, I asked them, they said that those 300 words kind of, you know, it didn't feel like I am describing some sort of ideal scenario that anyone can do it, but this person did it. You know, because of that context, that look, this is there. So, that actually makes me more comfortable. That once you acknowledge, then talk freely. Because, you know, you're sorted, you're saying that I acknowledge. But not to get into that loop. Because if you start tracing back about everything, then it's a never-ending cycle. That so, I don't know how many places it can be. That's the context I control. But sometimes I feel that, you know, even when I hear conversations people are having. I did this. Especially on LinkedIn, which is kind of a very, I don't know, toxic positivity, toxic motivation is there. You know, everyone has their own journey. All of that. Which is like, on one hand, I appreciate that, you know, people have struggles. But sometimes it just feels that, what is your context? And, you know, in the writing, you could see that, is this like, is it shining or not? I recently saw a post. This person was, listen to this. I hope he listens to your podcast and listens to it. But this guy was some rank 35 in ITJ. You know, like, topper. He was complex that he has got a rank of 35. Because there were 34 kids above him in IIT Bombay. I was reading that and Amit, I became so angry. After that, he wrote, look, I was in such a complex. But then I did this in IIT Bombay. Then I started a company. This and that. I didn't know what. I just angry messaged one of my friends. You know, this is why I hate LinkedIn. What is this? Right? So, after seeing that, I thought, at least there is some understanding. But I am saying that, you know, like, what would that make you feel? I mean, if you are having an inferiority complex at 35."

Because, you know, once you get into a probabilistic mindset, you see randomness everywhere, right? So one thing he says, right, in the book that in evolution, creationists who don't believe in the science of evolution, they think natural selection is random, right? Things are happening randomly. So how is it possible that randomness can create complex species like humans? So Dawkins says in the book, that is wrong. Natural selection is not random.

Random plus that, what you, you know, like you chose something, you didn't choose something. So everything is not just happening by itself. There is some, some layer to it. Some layer to it, just like evolution. So if you, as a person say, if everything goes right, I live till 80, right? And whatever I become, so it's luck.

I think Leslie Stahl was the anchor. And it opened by something, you know, something like, I'm forgetting the exact words, but you know, X country exports something, Y country exports something. India exports engineers, and not just any engineers, engineers from the Indian Institute of Technology, right? Something, something. And then she made the comparison between Princeton, Harvard.

Like first, mein ragging ho rahi hai, you know, all kinds of things are happening. You don't find this energy that I was expecting. So it was a, for whatever reason, misleading expectation. Toh wo starting mein toh I just had to accept the fact that that is not what this institute is. But I had, despite that, so after that shock, you adjust. I also, because that was the first time I left home, like a lot of my friends had been to Kota and other places. Merle toh naya tha to adjust, so many different people, like we had this hostel wing, 13 rooms, 3 people each, all from different backgrounds. In fact, interestingly, people talk about, like one of the best things about IIT Kanpur is that our hostel allocation is random. So, you know, the caste, class, all of that is mixed. You don't pick that way, right? So brilliant. So I settled in, made comfort with what was happening. And, you know, starting everyone is excited. My first semester was great. Okay. I did excellent at exams. I was participating in extra extracurricular activities, dance, you know, played guitar at my, you know, hostel day. All of those things are happening. I'm having the best of my time. Everything is fine. And I'm also just adjusting ki maze bhi karne hain. You know, we have come. So things are going fine. I think second semester onwards, things started changing. Okay. I started realizing that, you know, for some reason, not actually for some reason, there was a clear reason I went, I would go to classes and I could not get the big picture that why I'm studying this. So usfak deta ki mujhe pata hona chahiye na main kyu padh rahon. Toh that was not happening. And I started feeling a bit disoriented, but still that was in the back of my head. It was not dominant. So I was very active in student politics for elections, you know, in our student community, all of those things are happening. Maze aa rahe hain. Things are going fine.

If you look at the infrastructure of IIT, you know, the kind of people you meet, you know, starting mein jaa ke agar aapke andar thoda sa bhi ego hain about ki bhai hum toh apne school ke raja the. Pehle din jaa ke, you know, that bubble is burst. Because you see, boss, everyone around you is great. Aap physics ka problem kar rahe ho, that other person, your friend, he'll do it faster than you. So, you know, IIT makes you humble in many ways. Wo kabhi jaata nahi hai because you always know ki yaar, you were in that space. So that was first year, nice. But third semester onwards, I think my frame started changing. One big thing that happened was that I read an essay by Paul Graham. Paul Graham, right? The VC. Brilliant essays. Uska ek line tha in one of his essays where he says that if you want to be an entrepreneur, don't work at Google. Because Google is so good. It's such a great company that you would never want to leave. I read that line and it touched me. And Amit, in my third semester, I decided I will not sit for campus placements. Okay? And that was so liberating because once you decide ki bhai placement mein toh betna hi nahi. So everything that is happening around you, which is optimized for that big job, wo aapka chala gaya. So you're not thinking about your resume. You're not thinking about grades. Maze karna hai, right? Ki do what you want to do. The other thing that happened around that time, I think it was second semester mein hua tha. Coursera came to this world. Coursera and Udacity, right? Massive online open course. Yeah. So I started and I was like, class mein toh mereko mazaa nahi raha, what I'm studying. But it's also not, main toh engineering mein interested hu. Lekin jo class mein padha rahe hain, wo nahi padhna hai, right? So I started spending most of my time in online courses. So I was studying. I was just not studying what my profs were teaching me, you know? So my grades stuck. It's just, you know, like my first semester performance was great. In fact, I used to joke, IIT mein B grade ki neeche lana toh matlab kitna tough kaam hai. Right? Kitti mehnat karni padhegi na padhne ke liye, you know? That was my attitude. And then, you know, C's started coming, D's started coming. And I was disoriented. Because on one hand, I said, you know, I came here with this passion of being like the best engineer. And this, I was told this is the institute. But yahan hoi nahi raha hai. So I started finding communities where people felt like me. And I did a lot of work in campus, in community building. And third semester ke baad, again, my grades fell. Like even, it was the worst. And I was in such a demotivated state that I wanted to leave the campus. Ki boss, mera ho gaya hai. This is not the right place for me. So I was in Bombay for an internship after my third semester. I, mere grades jis din aaye, I just could not believe that, that is not me. Like, these grades do not reflect who I felt I was. And wahan cafe mein baith ke, maine, I wrote a long rant email to my dean of academic affairs, who had taught, who had taught and I really respected him for his ethics. You know, ethics has something been very close to me. And this professor, still, I just met him a few months ago, was so central to even an IIT to shape my thinking around ethics. So I had something that, you know, this guy may understand. I don't know. But who writes email to dean? Main ho email unko itna bada rant lik diya. That, you know, boss, kya jaga hai ye? You know, what is happening? I can't understand. These grades don't reflect me. Tak tak tak tak. I read, main jab bhi usse padhta na, I'm like, how did I get the courage to write this email? Right? So, you know what the best thing happened? In 30 minutes, the dean of academic affairs responded. Okay. He wrote me a long email where he mentioned one thing. He said, look, don't worry. He said, you sit down and define what success means to you. It's not getting a nine point GPA. It's not eight point. He said, you say, I want a seven pointer and I want to do something else at campus. That is your metric. Forget everything else. And then he told me other things. And his email ended by saying, when you come to campus, come and meet me. We'll chat. And Amit, that mail just changed me because I was like, this person gets me. Right? He understood. And he's a dean. And when I met him, so I think that just made me, ki chalo ab ho gaya hai. Placement mein bhi nahi baithna hai. Dean ne bhi bol diya hai yaar ki tu apna kar le. So I think that zone came in. But in fourth semester, I had to drop. I had to go back home because of some family thing. So that gave me this whole space where I'm not at college. I was anyway frustrated ki what is happening, what is not happening. But uswaqt, I was working with a startup. You know, in my December internship was with a company. I was the first software developer at that company. I was like, what, 19 year old working with like, I was the first employee in that company. It was a small company. I was having a ball, you know, to write code, real, you know, things are happening. So, but that semester drop, right, like I was, I was telling you, right, I was going through my Facebook messages. I think that gave me a lot of time to introspect, ki kya hai, kya nahi. And then when I went back, I had a different frame. Toh fir maine yeh sab hataya. Maine ka dekho, dissatisfaction ka koi point nahi hai. I realized that main yaha baith ki I can compare IIT to MIT and I always feel ki boss kya hai. But when I used to talk to my friends from other engineering colleges, I was like, boss, do you even realize that do you even realize that where you are sitting? It's a privilege that you are getting to study at this institute with such great infrastructure, with such great people. So, if you utilize it properly and think, you can do wonders. So, I think wo sab ho raha tha maape. So, yeah, then I did whatever I want to do. I was extremely active in campus affairs, okay. I was building this company and I was doing my online courses. Toh iske round my learning was happening. I was still not reading, which is the only thing I regret. Possibly in retrospection, I could have done. But I was doing a lot of online courses from humanities to computer science to math. Everything was happening. My grades were kept going on, you know. They were not anywhere. So, that's my journey. That was, you know, intellectually what was happening on the academic side and my participation. Now, and that went on. Uske baad, ek point ke baad, you know, I got my first F grade in fifth semester, okay. It was such a funny thing because I never, the person who said ki B ke neeche lana toh kitna difficult hai, aapka F lag gaya. And then, you know, aapka disorient ho jata that how can someone like me get an F grade? Like mai, F, failure on my grade sheet, right. So, I went to the prof and I said, Sir, matlab, you know, matlab, can we talk? Right, you know. So, pehle woh meko lecture dete hain. You know, students like you, there was a time when people used to get D. They used to come and tell me, Sir, please give me an F. Because how can I learn a subject if I have a D grade? And now I have students like you, who have an F and they want a D. So, I said, theek hai, tum exam lo. You look at your paper. I turned the pages and I turned the pages and I could not say anything because there was nothing in my paper where I even had the courage to ask him, ki boss, do something. So, uske baad mujhe laga ki, I actually fucked up, right. And I realized that there is some indiscipline going on here. Kyuki itna bhi kharab nahi hona chahiye. So, disorientation end tak raha. Ki mujhe samajh nahi aara tha what's happening. But my other part was going really well, where I was campus community, yeh karenge, woh karenge. So, things were going great. Few things that really impacted me in this whole process was my... I was telling you about, in this IIT campus, it's not just about people getting jobs and, you know, there are actually some really smart people doing great things. You know, that's like the 10% of the campus. So, you take inspiration from them, other people are doing. So, it's not completely disillusion, but largely it is, you see ki yeh India ka aspiration ke liek vehicle hai. That, you know, people come, they want to get great lives. That is what this institute is, nothing else. But there is something else that was happening, which was that campus had a lot of issues, socio-political issues, which is what something that really caught my attention. Ki cheeze sahi nahi hai yaha pe, you know. And that is what started troubling me. Ki iske liye hum kuch karenge. And the thing about IIT Kanpur is that you are in Kanpur, but your world, you do not know what is happening outside the four walls of our campus. So, I'll give you an example. In 2013, Muzaffarnagar riots happened. I had no clue those riots happened. Aur hum Kanpur mein the. Like, I'm just giving an example. I was so disconnected. At the startup, I was working. There was a time when I had a fight, not fight, like a disagreement with my employer. And colleagues that there was a module I had to write, which would be, you know, it would be like, I felt that it's invading people's privacy. You know, ki yeh data points hum profile banayenge. I was like, yeh mera code hai. My code can't do this. You know, you feel an ownership. Ki mera software hai yaar. Main yeh nahi kar sakta, all of those things. But I had no idea. And at the same time, Snowden revelations were happening in the US. And I had no clue. So, I'm saying that my world was limited to the four walls of the campus. But the things that were troubling me were, you know, you know what I'm trying to say. It was just rooted in the campus. There was no sense of news, nothing. Aur humein lagta tha humein bahut pata hai. So, you know, elections ki baat kar lenge. Very ignorant. Kuchh pata hi nahi hai, na aap padh rahe ho. Even humanities courses, we have to compulsorily take humanities courses, which I don't think a lot of people know, that from the inception of IIT Kanpur, humanities is a core part of your engineering curriculum. Because our founder, P.K. Kelkar, he said that, engineers work in a society, so they need to know humanities. So, that way, right? Toh wo bhi like, you know, aap sociology padh rahe ho, you know, aap economics padh rahe ho, all of those things. Social psychology, but bahar nahi pata hai. But uska advantage yeh tha that I was so, I knew my campus in and out. Toh waha pe mein ko ek sense start hone laga, that boss, yaha pe toh kuchh discussions hi nahi ho rahe hain. Everyone is so involved in day-to-day. Toh student ka voice kahan se aayega? Jo hamare campus mein problems hain, uska forum kahan hain? And waha pe the student newspaper, the magazine, which was called Vox Populi, which started sometime in mid-2000s, that, during my, I think, second year, third year, it kind of died out. It used to be a print magazine. Someone tried to revamp it, kuchh nahi hua. So, all of these things, while they were happening, in my fourth year, when I was catering, I was like, main isko restart karunga. You know, this campus needs journalism. And I was anyway a blogger, I told you, right? Toh mereko wo tha ki, likhna hai mujhe, but I want to write about campus affairs. Because there was this thing I believed at the time, that words matter. Aur agar hum issues ko raise karenge, toh, you know, kuchh hoga. And I wanted to bridge the gap between students and faculty. Toh bahut ideas the, change leke aayenge campus mein. Koi toh kar nahi raha hai. Or English, I was telling you, language was weak. But thankfully, our friends at the Lit Society, they were not, I don't know what happened, they dominated kind of the Vox Populi of earlier. Humare time pe nahi tha. Toh hume toh kuchh aata hi nahi tha, nah likhna aata hai. Bas ek wo tha ki, the campus needs a voice. So me and a friend of mine, one batch junior, said, chalo hum banayenge. And that, Amit, was something that really, was brilliant. Like, you know, that year, when I built like, hum jaa jaa ke log ko bolte the, that, you know, write for us. I was giving these talks, that, you know, why campus needs journalism. Aur kuch journalism ka pata nahi hai, right? It's just that instinctive desire that, issues need to be discussed. And then I started seeing, toh humne third August, 2014 ko website launch kari. You know, our website was launched. And phir mene dekha, you know, humare, you know, starting sab, it's like, you feel like an entrepreneur. Solving a problem at the campus. Toh mera woh jo keeda tha, right? Ki entrepreneur banna hai. Toh ek time pe aaye hai ki, entrepreneur yaar, duniya ko baad mein dekh lenge, apne campus ko toh, kuchh kar lo, right? Oh, things started happening. And then I started seeing impact. I would go to a professor to interview for, like, humne tumhara woh article padha hai, right? So these things are happening and that gave me, you know, it just, I felt so good. You know, that something is happening, a conversation is being triggered. And in all this process, there's one specific incident that, like, really stood with me, which was in my final year. I was going to the campus gate to book a train ticket to Delhi. And wahan pe mein gaya and I saw, there was this bunch of 60 mess workers were sitting on a hunger strike, okay? And my first reaction was that, why is no one around me? Itne bhi log nahi the, it was at the end of the gate. No one was stopping, Amit. These 60 guys are sitting, and log, they're just passing. Like, main paanch minute toh khade hoke dekha ki, does no one want to know ki, kyu baitha hain yaha pe, right? So I felt that apathy that I saw in some students. Pehle toh mujhe bada gussa aaya. I was very self-righteous, I think, in a way, back then. I'm not now. At least that is what I think. So, us waqt tha, so mein gaya and I had my platform. I called two of my friends. Humne unka video bana ke, apne platform pe chalaya. That triggered a conversation. Ki, boss, there is something else going on in this campus, which we don't know. And that opened my eyes to the fact that, IIT community is not about students and faculty and alumni who do great things in the world, quote-unquote great things in the world. The community is also about our workers. You know, when you say campus community, you have to talk about everyone. And when I heard their story, and then uske baad maine bahut history padha aaya IIT Kanpur ko, I realized that, boss, right from the genesis of this institute, you know, we have fucked this up. We have not thought about this community at all. We have ignored them. Similar things have happened in the past, but students were relatively more active at the time. Now they are not. So jab woh hua na, maine pehli story toh kari, where I did the video. Uske baad, because I felt so connected to the issue that I tried ki maine isko solve karunga. Right? And I became the, I spoke so much to these guys, unka problem samjha, I went to talk to the faculty, unka perspective samjha. And I thought, this political debate can be solved if two parties sit next to each other. Baat karenge na toh solution nikal jaayega. So I tried with three or four friends, I think they were postgraduate students, ki hum yeh karenge. We were sitting and I remember being, I became the moderator, I had my faculty here on the right, my mess workers on the left. It was a one hour discussion Amit, and it went nowhere. Nothing happened. Because no one was budging from their position. At one point I felt, ki you know, thoda sa bhi agar dono upar neeche kar le, maybe something can happen. So that was my first hit of reality, that was, you know these political things, jo aapko lagta hai na ki, baat karo aise nahi hota hai. Second I realized, ki I was so ignorant about campus. Mereko uswaq toh mai, hota hai na dil pigal gaya aapka, ki people are sitting toh kuch kar lete hain. But you don't know the complete story, you don't know their history. So how complex the issue was, I had to go to professors to understand and still I could not. The thing I regret is, ki yeh sab maine kar liya, I didn't write about it. Because I was so involved in solving the problem, that I lost the fact that as the, like I was also a reporter right, ki likhna hai, maine story nahi likhi uspe kabhi. Because, and that left a deep regret in me till date, ki uswaq kya hua tha. And I went to campus in 2019, you know the thing I, still happens is that, those people still remember me. Unko jaisi, I asked my friend to book a room for me in a hostel, jaisi unhone naam dekha, and they were like, you know, this guy will help us. So they had the expectations and, unhone again bulaya hai, they said, ab humare sar yeh problem ho rahi hai, aap humari help karo. They got all the documents, photocopy kar aapke leya hai. And so I'm saying that, that lens when I got, which continues till date, it showed me that, you know, maybe I'm not looking at the world, like there's so many other things that are happening, and we are not looking at it. Like I'm, maine hain chaar saal nikal diye, and I never thought about those things. Right, then I also saw ek baar, Jadavpur University mein, I think 14 mein hua tha yeh, there was a protest, there was this girl, who had filed a complaint of molestation, and the administration did not respond properly. And students staged a protest, and police was called, and the students were beaten. So to support, to show solidarity in campus across India, there were candle march protests were happening, like, you know. Toh maine padha, maine ka hum bhi karenge, I went to my friend, who was in the student government, I said, you know, boss, karana hai, usne mana kar diya. He said no. And he's one of the, politically conscious, very smart guy. Sai nahi, as a student gymkhana of IIT Kanpur, we don't engage in outside politics. I was so angry. Ki, kal koi humare saath bhi hoga na. Like, I have this thing about administration, I've written about it. Toh maine ka, theek hai. So that, you know, maha se, ko na the sense of rebellion, mala, who are these to tell me ki, hum Jadavpur University ke students ko support nahi karenge. Toh maine ka, jo karna hai karo. I met, bunch of PG students, because they are more, you know, unlike undergraduates, post-graduate students are more, they think beyond. They're more politically conscious. Toh humne kara. And, humne posters, hostar, sabhaaye karwaya. And, on the day it was planned, 100 students scattered at the open-air theatre. And humne ka,"

        "message": "agar ek baar ikathe ho gaye, toh yeh log kya karenge. Right? I didn't take any permissions. We were there. Humne ka, chalo now, because the only thing was those, like, why are you not allowing me, in my campus, to express support for students in another campus? Who are you? Why can the dean stop me? Toh humne wo march kiya. And in fact, jab bachche aagaye toh, the security could not do anything. So, you know, then you start feeling that, you know, challenge authority, yaar. Because hum, we're not even slogans bhi nahi kar rahe the. We just wanted to, peacefully march, to support, fellow students at another campus. Right? How can you say that, we don't engage in outside politics? Right? So, I think wo build up hota gaya yaha se, that you know, it's not just about, main wahan se start hua, right? Campus hai, but campus mein aur log hain. Sir hamara hi campus nahi hai, there are other students, there are also us. So, that consciousness started building up. And parallelly, you know, I mean, I'm saying this is the political part of it, right? And other things are happening. So, in all this journey, I think my, I developed, more empathy, when, like, politically conscious toh main hua hai, but empathy. Because, I reported a story about, the struggles of Hindi medium students, in campus. It blew me away. Because, when I spoke to this guy, the junior, he told me ki, boss, main apne wing mein, compared to everyone else, main saari class jaata hu, I attend all classes. I work triple hard, to take notes, right? When everyone is playing, you know, cricket, and watching movies, I study. And still I get less grades. And still I know when, I'll be at the job market. You know, no one is going to hire me, because I can't speak English. And again, I thought that, I am talking to him now as a reporter, like, you know, as a journalist who wants to write a story, in the campus. But, there would be people like him in my batch. And I was blind to it. You know, so, I'm saying, you know what I'm trying to say that, these, ideas started coming in. And I think, that, that's what I meant when I said, you know, it shaped me. That, the shaping was happening in two parts. One was, thik hai bahar ka kuch nahi pata hai, but campus toh mujhe samajh aa raha tha. That there are things that I was not seeing. And parallelly, you know, I was meeting, and reading about, all our illustrious alumni. Right? Someone is making films, someone is making movies, someone has built a unicorn company, you know, someone has done this, brilliant research in the US. You know, the fortune 500 CEOs, you know, these people would come to campus. And you just feel boss ki, if you think, and you, you are inspired by them, right? Ki agar inhone kar hai, and they would come, they would have chai with you. Right? These big people. And, they tell you stories from the campus, which you feel ki yaar, hamara bhi toh yeh story hai. So, I think you get that confidence ki, like they were also idiots like we are. Right? Unka bhi aise tha, toh you know, kuch bhi kar sakte hain. So, these things were happening that gave me a lot of confidence. And, that's how IIT shaped me. I mean, koi mein keh rahe hoon, I mean, I have spoken a lot, but I'll stop here. But I'm saying, at multiple levels, both from political consciousness to, inspiration, to seeing the traps that I told you about, right? In the beginning, ki I started seeing traps where, we were stuck. So, all of those together, I think, at least got me thinking that, the world is not what it is. There are layers. And if you look at them deeply, you will really understand what is happening. And,"

        "message": "what strikes me in all this is that, we live in a world, which is full of bubbles, which is full of preset tracks, which go a particular way and don't go anywhere else. And traps, as you said. So, a lot of these people who are in IIT, IIT karke shayad koi IIM jayega, consultant banega, shayad koi abroad jayega, shayad koi abroad jayega, research karega, brilliant kaam karega, shayad koi software engineer karega, Facebook mein jayega. And these are different tracks. And you're all in your bubble and you're not looking out. And you said that, and they're not looking out. And you said that, one of course, you avoided these tracks by saying things like, ki theek hai main placement mein nahi jaunga, main wo game nahi khelunga, main apna kaam karunga. And you're also looking outside the bubble and looking kind of beyond these layers. And I realized while growing up also, when I kind of, kind of map my own sort of journey, it's very clear that there are all these layers which make you blind to different aspects of the world. And then at different point, these layers kind of start falling away. So my first question arising from this is that, do you think that it's not just a question of IIT changing you? It is also a question of you being the kind of person inherently who would be changed by IIT. Kyuki the experiences you went through would be common to everyone. Campus toh same hai. You know, jo ho raha hai, same hai. But your nazariya is different. You are, you know, you're pursuing different things. And from that, different chains of events happen, which, you know, lead you to change in the ways that you say. So what I'm trying to say is that it's a two-way process, you know. It's not just that the right things happened, but you were also the right person for them to happen too. While for somebody else, you know, for them, whatever track they took was the right track that they went down on. So when you look at yourself, do you, like earlier, before we started recording, you were speaking about how you developed this ethical sense right from the time that you were in school. So do you think there was something there, something fundamental about you that made you open to this change? And if so, where did it come from, this sense of injustice or the sense of trying to be a change agent? You know, did it also, and can you elaborate on what you had meant earlier while talking about the ethical aspect of it?"

So I could see what is happening at my campus, but I still, you know, my friends, like some of my deepest friendships are from IIT, you know, and I'll always be grateful, but I'm just saying that I just feel a bit, because I'm, you know, speaking, I'm not writing a piece where I could, you know, I could have all sorts of caveats.

So I was listening to Noam Chomsky, in a podcast, and he gave this frame that, you know, when you go to a school, college, right, he says, like, this is Chomsky's theory, I don't know, I've not read, apart from what he says, he says that, the fundamental human desire, you know, like, our instinct is freedom. Okay, humans want freedom, that's our ultimate quest. But the society is structured in a way, to suck that, willingness of freedom out of you. And your education, universities, your workplaces, they school you into believing that, you can't, like, like they, you know, take out the idea of freedom from you. Now, then you can ask, what is freedom? I think there is no, freedom in my head, like, you can't define it, it's, you know, it's, freedom is freedom, it's human freedom. Now, you, you think you are free, but you know, as I say, you know, there's some, some trap in which you are, so you can't see it. So it's a very complicated, philosophical, rabbit hole in itself. But I'm saying that Chomsky, when he gave this framework that, we are, you know, we want to be free, but society, structures, school us not to be free. And then he says that, you look at it from this frame, and then you think, about the notion of a career. He says that, I think something a hundred year old, or two hundred year old idea. It didn't exist, 500 years ago, right? So, all I'm trying to say is that, if you, when I think about, human society, not at a, five year scale, or a 10 year scale, but you expand, your, you know, you, talk in centuries or stuff. In that frame, you think what is normal? Then I just feel like, what, like, what is the meaning of convention? You know what I'm trying to say?"

You're not talking about India. You're talking about, human society. Right? So I'm saying, when I see that frame, and anyone tells me that, like, this question about convention, non-convention, that's why I'm saying, it just feels, weird to me, that I don't know, that, how to even, approach this question, because, I was telling recently to a friend, I met, her after a long while, and she said, you know, you have done things differently. And I told her that, please don't say this. This just, irritates me in a way, I can't explain. Because, yeah, like, like why, I just feel that, like, you're just an ordinary human being, trying to do things. Then, you know, it's just that tension. So I don't know. The only thing I would say, is that, the, element of risk taking, despite I think, I have a solid cushion. Like sometimes Amit, I feel that, you know, my worst case scenario, would be the dream for most Indians. Like, if I say, I fail as a writer, I fail as a journalist, then what will happen? I will have to go to Bangalore, in a big tech company, you know, and do a high paying job. How sad, right? Poor guy, that you know, could not. So I'm saying, it's not risky. So, you know, that's what I'm trying to say, that what convention did you break, when you have such a solid cushion. But, that element of that thing that, I can take a risk, that, it goes back. Like, when I was sitting in IIT exam, and this I forgot, junior of mine reminded me, that in our time, in 2011, you had IIT, you had AIEE exam, and you didn't even get BITS. What is this, three days? I, Amit, only sat for one exam. I said, AIEE, I won't give BITS. If I don't get into IIT, I won't do engineering. Now in retrospect, with now my, frame of probability theory, it was a stupid decision. Like, you don't have to study, anything extra. You have to go and sit. But, that thing was that, no, I will, like, if what happens, if those in six hours, I fuck up. So, I was like, it doesn't matter, we'll just, play the, that one game. That's what we have to do. That, which is when, you know, placements came that, let's leave it. It's not that, that, fill it up. Our, you know, if a good company comes, then sit. No, it will not apply. So, I think that, ability to, you know, just think that, I told you right, I'll be in the segment, that I'm not witty. I'm not funny as a person. After knowing that about myself, I participated in campus. We have this event called, Mridaksh, at IIT. It's a festival thing. It's like, you know, to give an idea to other people. It's like, it feels like Rudi's, you know, the audience gets, their fun, when people are embarrassed on stage. And they have to outwit the, host. That's the setup. You dance, you know, talent, question. I have zero talent in all of that. After that, I registered. In front of like, this packed auditorium, I embarrassed myself. I knew that was going to happen because, you know, that is not, that's not my strength. I'm a specs wearing nerd. Not that, I can entertain people on stage. My friends had a ball. Because they were like, like, they had a lot of fun. Right? All of this happened. I went and, what I did, I was very embarrassed. I wrote a blog on it. You know, it's fine. But that thing stated, how can I be embarrassed? You know, then in the fourth year, I did that again. I was like, I was embarrassed. But I will do it again. And this time, I didn't tell any of my friends. I went and applied. And the date was closed. I was like, you know, this time also, they have shortlisted me. So they were very happy. That, now, this time also it will be fun. And I'm like, you know what? This time, I actually, so there were multiple rounds. This one is the campus round. And then you compete with other colleges. For the first time, I was embarrassed in stage one. This time, I got through the first round. Even when I'm saying that, that's not me. So, this sense of that embarrassment, gambling, that has been a threat. Now, I have no, now in this, there's no worst case scenario. Right? Worst case scenario is, the next day you go to class, people will laugh. Right? So, I was so glad, I, I don't know anyone else in my campus, who would have been on that stage four times. Once before, after that, in the final, you have to do it three times, you know, whatever, whatever."

You know, there's a sort of story you want to do and you're hoping it shapes the demand, but you're going to do it anyway. And, you know, a bigger media house may not be like that. So what do you feel about this game? Because I feel, you know, uncomfortable standing in judgment over the bigger media houses or the journalists doing conventional things, they have families, they have children to send to school. I don't want to stand in judgment over them. Absolutely. Even though as an individual, what I would be drawn to is being the independent guy who is doing what he is doing in spite of everything. So, and you are in the same sort of thinking as me, as far as I can make out. So what is your thinking when you sort of look at this landscape and does it make you feel lonely? Did you ever feel lonely in IIT, for example, when you were fighting the fights that you were fighting? You know, that sense of frustration that why aren't enough people, why don't enough people see things the same way as I do? Even though it's rational for them"

It's more descriptive in what you're feeling. I think there is a difference if people can appreciate that. But I don't, I just remember one incident where I deeply felt lonely at IIT and that was toward, like, I say that IIT placement office is the place where engineers are killed. Okay. The way things happen. So, this was one incident, and you know, I was helping my friends. So, so, that moment of placement is full of emotions. If you want to study human emotions, go to IIT for 10 days at the time of placement. You'll see everything there. From jealousy to ambition to fear, everything is there. Right? There was one, I won't get into details. I mean, then I can keep talking about IIT for the next five hours. But there was one incident, which, it happened and I just gave up. I mean, at that time, Tamasha movie was released. You know, Imtiaz Ali's. And, let's watch the movie. And that placement was going on and we went to our hall. Amit, I didn't watch the movie. I was like, Tamasha is going on here. Look, Tamasha is going on in my campus. That's it. And that day, it was late in the night, evening, late evening, and I went to the campus CCD. And I sat there alone. I said, like, I could not see what was happening in my hostel. You know, I saw the smartest kid I knew running around for a job. And I was like, how is this possible, man? He, this person is significantly smarter. For this company, why is he behaving like this? You know? So, like, I'm just saying, I'm just describing my state of mind. So I went, I sat there and I opened Facebook. There's a senior of mine whom I met. She's six, seven years older than me. But with her, you know, I had a heart-to-heart about, so I messaged her. And I was like, explain a little, man. What was like at your time? What was it? This and that. So all that discussions happened. So that just gave me comfort that, you know, I'm not an idiot. There are others who have thought about it. So at some point, there was this friend of mine. He's a very hardcore lefty, anarchist, right? Principles fellow, you know. So his point of view is different. But when I didn't understand, I would just hang out with him. Like, what is it? He used to tell me 10 more things that I didn't even see. You know? So I was like, no, there are people. It's just that, you'll roam around the campus, you'll see the community. I am not the only person. There are other people thinking about these questions. It's about finding them, talking to them. So at that time, I think in that way, at least at the campus level, I wouldn't say. I mean, again, I don't know if the picture is emerging that I was always in distress at IIT. I was very happy. It's just that things are happening in parallel and questions are coming. So not strictly lonely, apart from that one moment when my batch was being placed. That was a very low time for me."

So I wrote an email to TN Nainan at Business Standard. I read his book and I loved it. And I said, sir, I want to meet you. I wrote him an email. He called me to his office. I went, had a great chat with him. I was coming back, exited the Barakhamba metro and my friend called me and she said, did Nainan offer you a job? I was like, why would Nainan offer me a job? I don't even want to work at Business Standard. He said, no, maybe you should look out because Bobby is going. And I was, what do you mean? He said, come to office. I will tell you. I go to office and that mail comes from Madam Shobhna Bhartia Shobhna Bhartia that he's resigned. And then I was in shock and then people know what has happened. I was still trying to process.

You know, I would expect ki agar itna bada like what was the signal? The signal was, at least for me, that the government is saying, we can take your editor-in-chief's job. Who are you as a reporter?

They thought about their families and office mein aate hain. They're having, chill kar rahe hain and then they'll work. You know, how big projects are being taken up. I was blown away.

Walaab aap toh aapne dekh liya. That first principles yaha pe hain. And I'll tell you an interesting incident in John Carreyrou's book. Toh Rupert Murdoch owns the Wall Street Journal, okay. And the Theranos story for listeners is Elizabeth Holmes, I think. Yeah. So, she built this giant company, you know, around, you know, these diagnostic techs. And big, you know, I think it became a $9 billion company. But the whole company was a fraud. And the Journal, over three years, exposed it. And abhi, you know, trial, everything is happening, right? Rupert Murdoch had, I think, put in, I'm forgetting the exact numbers, but maybe $100 million in the company. He was an investor. And when the first email went from John Carreyrou, you know, the Journal to Elizabeth Holmes, you know, we are doing a story. She came to New York and fifth floor where we had the newsroom. It's in his book. She didn't go to the fifth floor. She went to the seventh floor, where Murdoch sometimes comes in. She goes and says, aapki company, aapka akbaar. You know, it's your company and it's your paper. So, you should handle it. Rupert Murdoch of all people, okay, of like, what we know about him. He says, go talk to people at the fifth floor. Right? I am like, not the right person. Not the right person. When I read that anecdote, I'm like, I said, Rupert Murdoch also has multitudes, you know, whatever. So, that, and then I saw Jeff Bezos had owned, you know, like he had bought Washington Post. And I read a story in the front, you know, on the homepage of Washington Post, where it was about how Amazon Alexa is surveilling on users. Okay, it was the lead, I think big story on WAPO.

The story is also breaking. HT broke a big story on Rafale. Now, if I tell anyone, they don't believe it. There was a big story on Rafale, which Hindustan Times broke. I think those colleagues, when things happened in Kashmir, front page stories in HT challenging the government. So, there was a big cognitive dissonance. I could not understand.

And on the other hand, I'm seeing all of this. So, I'm saying, you see all of these things and, you know, questions come in about, what is... But one day, something happened at HT and I gave up. I went back to my home. Again, thankfully, I had my diary. I wrote it down. I slept, stayed on that for a week. And I typed my resignation letter that I'm done. I'm done. And I resigned. Thankfully, my boss was kind enough. In two weeks, I was out of HT. This is around January 19. So, that day, you know, I still have this whole page in my diary where I've exactly written what I felt. Why I left. And, you know, anytime I'm like, my boss was so generous at the time that, I don't know if there are 25-year-old reporters who get like, my boss gave me freedom, that boss, don't forget daily. You take one month to write one story, I'll give you one page in the paper. Right? That was the promise he made and he used to do that. So, I used to think, have I gone mad? Like, who... The HT real estate. In your head, you know, it's like, so many million copies go, you know, people read. So, I sometimes felt that, I wasn't a fool. Like, you left that opportunity.

My problem was not sometimes, you know, see, I'm not an idiot that I don't know the pressures that editors face, you know.

I hope that if readers could see, you know, the daily fights that journalists fight inside the newsroom to get things in the paper, despite the pressures, you know, the model of, you know, this, so I don't like this phrasing of Godi media, you know, I like Ravish, but this whole Godi media framing makes me, it's a very simplistic narrative. Because individuals fight within these places. Yeah, and see, if something gets published, then you won't know what's behind it. If something is not published, then you'll know, like I'm telling you now, then you'll feel, you know, there is a problem. So I'm saying, when things are normal, you don't know that there's something more that has happened to see what you're reading that way, you know?

What are you seeing? And I'm fortunate that a lot of senior people in this profession have given me time one-to-one, telling me like detailed stories about their interactions with proprietors, you know, challenges they have faced. And that really inspires me that they have stuck to this profession. They know, and they are in the top positions, you know, so anyway. So the point I was trying to make that in HD, this is my editor sat on a story. My problem was not you sat on a story. The problem was you ignored it. You come and tell me, boss, there's a problem. You just behaved as if nothing happened, you know, that there's no story. You just pretend as if, and that, you know, it's just, I don't know, like, how can I, like, how will I find the motivation to work on my next story? I used to write"

I'm big on forecast. I love stats. And I heard that, you know, this Axis thing, I wanted to see behind the scenes, like, you know, how they work and how does TV work? So that was my curiosity. So, election, this is before the 2019 election. I worked there for two months as a consultant, as a reporter, but I was on a consulting two month arrangement. And I will not get into details about election forecasting, but just so the people know, they're brilliant at it. Okay. Even, you know, when Axis had put out this forecast, I saw all the nasty Twitter debate, even from people I respected, that, you know, India Today plays numbers from behind. I was like, boss, nothing, man. I mean, they are doing solid. There's guy Pradeep Gupta at Axis. He's doing solid work. Because I interviewed him about the methodology, I saw his sheets, great. So there is this whole narrative, you know, because India Today is like this, their forecast is also sold out, you know, that's the term. So, and I saw all the conspiracy theories people created. So it just feels weird that you are so smart, man. Why isn't your brain working here? Right. So anyway, so keep that part aside. I am not talking about it now. Let's talk about my experience. So, I'll just tell you one story. Even now, it's going to go. There's this thing that I know, you know, one day in the newsroom, I didn't have much to do. Okay. I was free. But, you know, I didn't feel good. That I'm sitting free, man. For two months, they have come and they were paying me well. Okay. So I didn't feel like, why am I sitting free? I should do some story. Should do some story. So, in the, there was this room where a couple of people were sitting and I just told them, do you know that, Mr. Modi and Mr. Gandhi, if you look at the Twitter matrix, Mr. Gandhi gets more retweets, average retweets per tweet are higher than Mr. Modi. Okay. And they were like, wow, is it? I said, I tried to tell them, it's not like news break. And they're like, interesting things that people have done on Twitter. This is just like, you know, banal thing. But they were like, no, that's interesting. And I was working on a separate project at the time with a couple of friends, where we had collected this database of all Indian parliamentarians, their Twitter handles. So I had this giant Twitter, their tweets had a repository. So, you know, I could do anything with all of these accounts. So we said, to make it a little different, we will do an MP. We will rank all the MPs. And because this Modi-Gandhi, it will be the lead, so to say. So I did that. Story was done. It was not a big deal. Now what happens? It got shared on Twitter. There was abuse. India Today is running propaganda. Because you know. And one thing I'll tell you, the same thing happened at HD. Actually, for very clear reasons, right? I mean, I just feel that, you know, our Indian politicians, like, could retweet numbers. You know, even the prime minister, like, they're so attached to it."

You're a prime minister. Anyway, so, but it irritates them. Okay. So I go to the, I knew it because something happened at HD on similar lines. So I go and this person calls me the editor and he says, did you look at other metrics also? You know, while doing your analysis, average retweets per tweet and all that. I said, yeah, I saw it. He says, okay. Then he shows me his phone. He shows me a screenshot on WhatsApp. He tells me that, you know, this person who manages social media for Mr. Modi, he says, you know, you have used the wrong metrics. You have taken the wrong ones. You should have used the rest. Okay. So at first point, I was like, who is this person to tell me? It's my story. I am the analyst. How can you say I'm wrong? Like, you know, it's almost a, you tell me, Samarth, you're the shittiest reporter. You're the worst writer. Don't question my integrity. You know, because I don't care about who wins, who doesn't win. That's now my frame where, like I'm single-handedly focused on my story. What happens after the story? I don't care. Right. So, so I was like, though I kept it inside me, but I was like, okay, go on. So they said that, you know, you should look at other metrics. So I was like, did you, did you see other metrics? I was like, I saw them, but I chose these ones. So I said, okay. So I said, why don't you do another story with these other metrics? I said, okay, I'll consider. So I did something. And then I came back and asked, I can do a story with some other metrics. And they said, does that show that Mr. Modi is better? I was shocked. That is not the point why I would write a story. Why I would write my story if the data was telling me that. And it was in some cases, but I'm saying the question was inappropriate. Like, how can you ask me that question? Was my thing. So anyway, they said, you know, you do a, said, okay, I'll do another story. The two threads, so I'll just tell one story and another one. So I said, okay, I went and I did a, okay, so let me put it this way. I took four metrics in which two, I think Rahul was better and two Mr. Modi was better. Mr. Rahul and Mr. Modi. And you know, Amit, what happens next? I try to write something that, you know, because I was not lying. This is what the numbers were saying. And I was like, readers can interpret. And anyway, in my head, I knew this is so banal. Like it does not tell me"

It's like, did I come here for this? No. Then, we go on TV. Okay? On TV, Amit, it was, I saw what happened. It was just disaster management. The whole show is about, how Mr. Gandhi was a latecomer to Twitter. Mr. Modi, who's old, but he's like the star. And this discussion is going on. And I am on TV, on the show.

They are standing on the bus, you know, they have to go around Lucknow to interview Mr. Yadav. But Mr. Yadav has refused to come on the bus, because he is not in your list. Right? What kind of people are they? Yes. And I was like, like, what? And he was not in the list, because I had Mayawati on the list, and I just, like, you know, there are not 10 states in the country, I can't. So, and this was just what the editor approved, that this is fine, right? So, I was so mad at Akhilesh, because I had to miss my dance class, go back home, and, you know, I had to give stats for Akhilesh. And then, of course, he came on the bus. Now, you are thinking that, I mean, that day, and next day, Tejaswi Yadav gets angry, because, like, you, India, do discuss this, because I am not in the list. And I was like, because Nitish Kumar is on the list. So, and again, you can now say, ki yaar, what was this list? You know, one can say, ki tumne das ka kyu kya? But the point is, Amit, the point I am trying to say, I learned from this, that the story is absolutely bullshit, tells nothing about Indian politics. But what happened behind the scenes, that was telling me more that, what, like, how thin-skinned these people are, like, you know, how much, like, I don't, I was speechless. And the fact that newsrooms were complying on idiotic things like this, you know. To aap, mean, kya hi baat karoge? And of course, then I had other observations at India Today, where I saw, main TV toh dekhta hi nahi, but uss waqt, because the TV was in front of me, then I saw what was going on TV, kind of things that were happening. So, all of that. So, I'll just give you, so that was my India Today experience, and it just left me thinking about that, you know, if you are in that organization, and you just do your work, you will, and you, mean, aap ek din ke liye chale jao, aapko kuch dikhega nahi, you'll see everything is normal. Right? But it is in these day-to-day interactions, when you see, right, a picture starts emerging. Like, ek story ke liye mujhe bola, and they said, you know, you partner with this political reporter. And I've seen her work on TV. She comes to me and says ki, ki yeh story karna hai, tumhe bataya hai kya, what the story should say. And I was like, like, this is not how reporting works. Like, we will find out. They said, me ki tumhe bataya hai kya. So, then I felt again, the same, you know, this, no, again, I mean, how can you call it idealism? I'm just saying, this just defies first principles. Right? This is not how things happen. And then, you know, at the time, I was reading this book by Yanis Varoufakis called Adults in the Room. He was the Greek finance minister. And you know, that book is like, one of my favorite books on politics, because it's a tell-all memoir from his days as a six-month finance minister in Greece, when the debt crisis was going on. So, it's a beautiful book. And in that, he gave a frame, which I think explained to me what India today was. So, you know,"

And that day, Amit, when I read that book, so I just felt that in the circle, in the mainstream media, it's not that, again, maybe I'm being much empathetic to them, but I didn't find them, there's no conspiracy going on. It's just that they're co-opted insiders, you know, who feel that by not picking battles, by having access to inside government machinery and all of that, something nice is happening. That access, you know, we've talked about. And that day I realized, no, I don't know what I give up. I'm fundamentally I'm fundamentally an outsider and I'm fine with it. Right? So that is the distinction. There's no conspiracy. Then Yanis describes it further. He says that, you know, when you are in the structure, in this political economy structure, then you have three options. Either you are in that system and you see that, okay, you know, you have some, say, access to some privileged information. Now you have two options, either comply or just exit. Right? But you see, what happens by exiting? So what you do, that one person who has some privileged information, he goes to a second person who has some privileged information. Right? And then they talk together. And then that cycle keeps repeating. So within the insider network, more networks start appearing. And it's happening organically because you just think that why should I go out and do it? Like I know something, maybe I should tell it to someone else. And that privileged networks keep on building up. There's a second person who doesn't do this, but they're too outside in the inside, they're on the periphery that they can't even see, you know, what kind of things that are happening in this black box. Right? These are what I felt like a lot of good reporters at Indra today, perhaps, maybe they know, maybe they don't know, but they're like, they're too insignificant to have any say in that whole business. Right? So you stay in the periphery. And the third who just get out and then they become irrelevant. Then Yannis says there are few, like Larry Sarkar, Larry Summers, who actually recognize that this is a structure in which they're operating. So they can at least place themselves. But most people don't even know that this power structure operates where without any grand conspiracy, where people in power are sitting together to think about, you know, like what to do. Organically, things are happening. And that for me was such a good, at least for me, that, you know, talked about incentives. The incentive is just that we have to run this organization. We have to do this for that. But you know, these small actions on a day-to-day basis, you know, there's a compounding effect where the privilege networks keeps on increasing and your co-option just, like then you're so seeped in, you're so inside that you don't even know that you're trapped in that structure. So I think that, when I saw, that just explained mainstream media to me that this is happening, but not my game. Not my game. Not my game. Happily an outsider. And it's the age of the internet."

So I want to, you mentioned first principle thinking, and I want to apply that thinking to journalism itself and how newsrooms work, which you've written about eloquently. I'll link all your posts from the show notes. And one of the sort of, there are a couple of revelations there. And one is in something you describe about a newsroom and the other is in a question that you ask. And you describe a newsroom as essentially being in the content game. Producing content all the time. It's a content factory. And these days, as we see taking ideas from Twitter, Twitter, and it becomes, those become self-fulfilling prophecies. And the other is a question you asked at the start of the episode that you said, you asked yourself key. And I think you might've written about it in one of your posts as well. That what does journalism write about? What is news? You know, what is worth covering? Which is a great question to ask because there is a scarcity of space and a scarcity of attention, right? You can't take it for granted that these are the things we will cover and there'll be one page on this, one page on this, one page on that. These are the specific stories we will cover. It's very facile once people are in that groove to go in those kinds of directions. But I'll ask you to step back because you've obviously thought about these first principles in some detail. What should a newsroom cover? What is driving it? If it was just supply and demand, you would always have like Prince falls into a well, army is there to rescue him. And, you know, it's a man bites dog all the time. But that's not it. There's more than supply and demand and even supply and demand is so often guesswork and thinking along predictable lines. So give me a sense of this fundamental basic and I understand it's a very large question, but what should a newsroom cover? You know, and at one level, that big meta question and at the other level, give me a sense of the state of the modern newsroom in India, because the whole system just seems to be broken, you know, in India today, of course, you've described a particular set of incentives in a particular kind of political context. But give me a sense of, you know, these two diametrically different things, you know, sort of how do you ask that philosophical question to begin with? And what are things like now?"

You know, this news, what is newsworthy is a very arbitrary construct. Right. And I think the whole point, when the idea of the mainstream existed, and you have talked about in the show that there's no mainstream as such, if you think about it. I mean, they have the power of amplification, but in the larger scheme of things, right, like the literal meaning of the word, you know. So I'm saying that is the issue, that newsworthiness, I think is just a fundamentally arbitrary construct. And it's on the whims and fancies of editors. And what you expect in an ideal world is you expect that you respect the judgment of the editor, that, you know, that the reason this person is leading a publication is because they have some sense of what is important, what is not important, and that drives what is being covered.

Some people are interested in something and they are completely ignorant about something else. And then the thing will change in another context. Right? So the way I think about a lot of mainstream publications is that they cater to the narrow elite about what is interesting, what is relevant. So when you talk about political news, you know, one of the things that, again, I never understood the logic, you know, reporters take so much pride in quote-unquote, in quote-unquote, breaking a story that the government is anyway going to tell you two days later. And you say, there's nothing that they're hiding. It's just that you read this first in X. So I never understood that. So what? Agar aapne mujhe do din pehle bata diya. Right? Like insignificant thing. It's not enhancing my understanding. But that is what the newsroom incentivizes. You know, when they say, we want exclusive, we want scoops. So what I like is that information that will anyway come out in the public sphere, na? Everyone will get it, but you... So I'm saying this, but this is a metric of newsworthiness that we have it first, incentives. So this journalism professor, I think, Jay Rosen in the US, he gave this very good statement. He said, the modern media ecosystem is not designed to enhance public understanding. It is enhanced to manufacture new content. And he included the big public media in the big publications. So that way, that's a description of the problem that I would want as a reader, that I just, I want to understand India better. I want to understand this government better. But you get into... And you can't even say that the stories that are being reported are irrelevant. But I think that what has happened is that at least now that I'm outside and I read, you feel so alienated.

So, I'm saying that is one frame of reference where someone can say, so what I'm, so I can, it's going in, I'm meandering, but the point I'm trying to make is that everything that largely we are seeing, you can poke holes on why the way we currently think has big issues.

You know, now data from your phone will be with the government, all of those kinds of things, because there was one circular that came out in the Home Ministry. The Hindu carried something small in the inside page. But next day, that blew on the internet. Oh my God, what is this government doing? Modi is coming after your phones, right? Again, I don't know what happened with the Hindu, but it was probably some notification came and some reporter wrote a copy without deep context and people misinterpreted what had happened. Okay. TV pe halla ho raha hai, Twitter pe halla ho raha hai, all of these things are happening. Right. Then, because I was covering tech policy at the time, like I made phone calls. Okay, what is this? So this is an event which triggered a conversation around privacy and surveillance, which is an important topic. Right. But the problem was everyone was talking about, and this is my understanding, about a non-existing issue because, Amit, nothing had changed. Okay. What, there was no new power. The power, jo bhi tha, it was the existing system. It was just that circular, which was some formality. How I knew? Because I made phone calls. I called experts who covered that. I said, look, this thing has come, you have written about it. Can you please help me understand what has changed? I called three people, a lawyer, someone at a law firm, someone at a think tank. That was a unanimous answer. So I, and then, you know, a colleague of mine who had connections in the MHA, he got like an inside person. And I think that is the way to do a story. You cover all aspects. So I went and explained, ki boss, there is no, like, there's nothing here, like there's no story. The story is that it's just, so this event was the point of coverage, but in the larger level, nothing had changed. So what, and I'll tell you how it connects to processes. In the press, this issue was reported as Congress versus BJP. Okay. That opposition is saying how bad BJP is doing this. Then you get some context.

This is what I am describing. And you know, I was so sad, because my story, andar page pe tha. Yeh nothing has changed. Front page pe story tha, Congress says this, BJP says this. So, that day I could not understand, when, how can my paper, publish a story saying, andar, yeh nothing has changed. Or front page pe, you are amplifying, Congress, BJP. So, this is the problem with event-based reporting. Where you don't know, at a system level, you know what is happening. At a, when you look at a system, on a day-to-day basis, for example, there is a stock market crash. You know, an oil price, rises. You know, cryptocurrency, something is happening. Or there is a flood there. All of those things. So, you report on the event. But, the question about, why was there a flood in Bihar? Right? What are the day-to-day things, that have happened in the past, 5 years, that led to that flood? That is a system. That's a process. That's not an event. And that unfolds, on a day-to-day basis. You need to know, you need to really understand. You need to connect the dots. You need to look at multiple perspectives. And that is the story. The story is not, in fact, P Sainath, in his book, Everybody Loves a Good Drought. He talks about this distinction in, back, like, I think he wrote his book in the 90s."

And to get to this whole process, you can use, systems thinking approach, which is just one way of looking at things. And the core idea there is that, like, even when you're looking at the media, right? I, talk to so many people who says, you know, you know, there's this idea that, if only good people come together, you know, Amit Verma, Samarth Mansal, and 20 of us, come together and we are given some money. Okay. And we will start an organization. We will fix things. No, because we are not operating in isolation. Okay. You can say, the problem is, the proprietor, the owner is the problem. So you will say, change the owner. Right? No. What about other incentives that drive news coverage? Right? What, you know, the reporter wants to win awards. The reporter wants his colleagues, to say, you know, you are a good reporter. You know, you, all of those things, right? I'm saying, in every action, there is no, there is no, that this is one piece of the system that is broken. Once you look at the big picture, and instead of looking at incidents in isolation, you say, okay, how is the system interacting with each other? Right? And how, a small change, in incident X, makes a big change in Y. Then you see the complexity of the system and you realize that, the problem is much more complicated. You can't just, fix one part, and think that, fix it 10 times in isolation, the system will, does that make sense? In a way that, about the process that, it's not just one event. Because if you just look at event, in that whole system, you're looking at X. You've forgotten, how we got to X. And that is the story, not X.

Has your understanding about, Indian politics, policy, has that, enhanced? As a reader, not for me, I have a lot of friends who don't, maybe there are people who are, but I don't think, that knowing tidbits and trivia, you can know a lot of them, and you can keep throwing that at people. But, base level pay, what, like what have you understood? So that, that's a common problem, and it's not an India problem. That's a global problem about, the idea of news itself. So my, and, again, if you talk at the centuries level, right? Like news is not, like it didn't appear in nature, it's like what, 400 years old or something, right? We are living in a different, information environment, right? The internet has come, a lot of things are happening. So I am at that zone where I, understand, why newspapers exist, why the idea of news exists. But you also have to think that, you know the, like my reference frame now is that boss, I care a lot about journalism, which is why we are even having this conversation. So think about the first principles of journalism, like if newspapers die, let them die. You know, I'll feel bad because, all of our institutions, you know, they have history, you know, they matter, they have something to this country. But, in the longer, larger scheme of things, you want journalism to stay, not, an entity called a newspaper, right? And I think we are at the time where, no one knows the answer, ki, what is going to happen, in the future. And everyone is trying to figure it out, and we should take solace in the fact that, we don't know the answer. But we should work towards the future. So at least, now after giving all this, you know, big theory, what matters is what I do. And that is the frame in which I operate. Ki, I don't know what others are doing, but, not, news, not newspapers, journalism. And there's a difference. Journalism and news are not the same. News is a sub-component of journalism. And I think if we make that distinction, it just gives a better frame to think about the solutions."

But what is like, again, I can keep, I have such an irritation with, you know, this whole thing about newsworthiness, what it is. It's an, like, it doesn't give you the full picture of, what is happening. It's just, some non-random sample of collection of events that have happened. And given to you, with a very deep bias about, you know, there's negativity, there is some outrage. Sometimes it's important, some civic role, all of those things. That is, and it's important. I've written my, you know, in my writing that, as a collective, if all of this goes away, we will lose an important part of our information sphere. But journalism is more than that. For me, honestly, Amit, again, journalism for me has, is no more about making an impact, or making a change. I only think journalism is a vehicle for truth-seeking, to understand. That's it, nothing else. And there, when you talk about, you know, when we say deep reportage, what is deep reportage? There, where you don't settle for easy answers, you keep, you know, as I think, who, who is that editor? I've said, keep peeling the onion, keep peeling the onion, you know. And, I'm not even saying investigative reporting. I'm not even saying that. I'm saying journalism, news is about what happened yesterday, and we want to report, so that you are informed about current events. Journalism is about truth-seeking. Journalism is about understanding, you know. And, there are so many ways to understand the world. You can be, you can become a scientist. But I think that, there's a power, in the profession of journalism, which others, other, like, you can be at a think tank, you could be a scientist. The things that a journalist can do that you can't. Right? For example, like I was at this conference, and people were telling me about, the problems with Indian think tanks. Like, you know how, you know, they've been co-op, like, they're not free anymore in a way, like there's some decline. So, when I asked this person, this is so important, can you talk about it in public? And they said, no, it's too risky. I can't. So, Amit, I am not doing anything right now, but it's in my notes. I'm like, okay, that's a story. But this is one person telling me this. In the back of my head, I don't know if I'll write it. But in my ideas, it's a story that, this person can't say this because, you know, the society may alienate this person, right, whatever. But it's a, it's a process about how, knowledge production in India has been affected. Okay. Am I convinced? No, because this one person told me, but someone I trust has told me this, in private. So, can I use a journalistic method, to find out and connect the dots and talk to 10 people? And I take the risk, in the sense of, to be the person, who brings this to the information sphere, right? The journalistic, the people, journalists take the risk. We name people, about this organization. We, you know, academics generally talk in broad brush strokes. You know, this happens, that happens. I think, journalism, we talk in specifics. We name people. We are not saying, you know, X person is doing something with their taxes. We say, this person did this, right? Now you can say, there's bias in this, etc. No, but I'm saying, the mechanism of accountability, the mechanism of that, you know, like we take risk and we have the right to offend, you know, and then we write and report. And then I think the society should, give us like, if we are taking that risk, they should insure us. So I think that's a social contract. That's one example where I say that, you know, this is not news because, it's not something that, today something happened, like, someone will be fired at a think tank. It will become an event. But news comes and goes, in one week it dies. But what did you learn? About the country. So that's why I think journalism, in that way I'm saying, that's the difference. That's one way, I think it's much bigger than news rather than."

And truth seeking is hard because, you know, all sorts of human motivations come in that take you away from, not human motivations, human nature comes in that takes you away from the path. It happens with scientists, happens with journalists, anyone who says that, you know, my only commitment is to the truth. I don't care about anyone else. They're probably lying. I want to believe that. So, you know, I am there, but there could be, you know, forces that will take me away from that, right? So let's, but in principle, you agree. Now, the second thing is what I think has started happening is that you think that there is much more than truth seeking that journalism achieves, which is a social change. Okay. Impact, saving democracy. Now, there is no direct correlation between truth seeking and these ends. And I think that is the conflict that we need to address and understand. Do you know Jill Lepore?

It's not journalism. You have good intentions, but good intentions don't make for good journalism. Right? You can be very courageous, but courage does not lead to good journalism. Right? Good journalism is about process. And I think that moral, not moral, I think that clarity about what is it, like, what is journalism for in a time when, and I, you can clearly see right there, in a time when press freedom is clearly under attack, where, you know, people who speak truth to power, outs, not just newsroom, anyone, right? There being all sorts of things are happening, democratic backsliding, you know, we are in that ecosystem. So, does that change the role of journalism? I think, individual journalists, perhaps, and news organizations are struggling with it. And maybe the answer that they have settled on is that there is no there is more to our work than just reporting. Maybe we are part of the change. And I think once you take that frame, the way you look at the world changes, okay? Maybe that dilutes your filter. Like what makes journalism different from everything else, fundamentally, is the editorial layer. It matters a lot. Because as a reporter, I'm always attached to my material. It's my editor who will come and tell me, that boss, you fucked up here. Right? Remove this from here. You brought two sources, I want four. Okay? This thing is not adding up. That's what good editors do. It's not that they are copy editing your story. They help you get to what do we call? Journalistic standards. You meet the journalistic standards, publishable, right? Maybe in this framing about our reconception of what our role is, at least the way I think journalistic standards should be, I just feel some of and I can name the wire and the caravan, they have diluted this. And Amit, this is such, I have observed, I have these private conversations with my friends. There is, I can tell you, a lot of discomfort among liberal-leaning journalists about what is happening. But you can't, you struggle to say it in public because you feel that will me saying this, will that de-legitimize the work that these guys are doing?

So which is why there is, I feel at least in my private conversations, that there is a conflict where on one hand you see, ya kuch toh problem hain haan pe, you know? But, we don't know how to battle with it. And then you go and talk to your readers. There's this friend of mine, I think she's 32, 33, once I was having, and very, you know, passionate about the media, I want to think. So she once, we were on a video call and she tells me, someone has, I think, you know, as I'm aging, I'm moving towards the right. You know? I said, why? She said, because, you know, now I read The Wire and I'm not able to relate. You know, so I think, you know, but The Wire is a great institution, so maybe my values have changed. Right? And then I asked her that, please don't think like that. Because she was like, no. She took the responsibility on her because she said, I cannot relate anymore. This is becoming too much for me. So I stopped. So, I am saying that there is a shift happening, at least from my vantage point. I don't, there's no easy answer, but I'm saying, if we don't acknowledge that, from the perspective of truth seeking, our idea that democracy needs to be saved, and there's some, you know, bigger problems happening in this country, and journalists need to stand up for it, and how that skews incentives, then we are deluding ourselves if we don't acknowledge this. And, you know, we talk about pressures, you know, that there's a pressure from the government because it's a government ad or business. I mean, there's also a subscriber pressure, no? If you have built an audience which wants you to speak critical about the government, then that is a pressure that you also have because you will get, and this is, and this is, I'm not just saying it theoretically, I think it was Andrew Potter, he was the editor of a Canadian newspaper, he has written about in his blog that how, you know, sometimes, let's say there's a story that someone covers, and instead of the lead story, they put it down. You know, it's not the lead story, it's the third story. People become angry because you feel, no, this should be the lead story. Why is it inside? Why is it not amplified? Not that information is being censored. It's that you feel, this is Potter's words, that, the institution I love, they have let me down. Right? And when you're a subscriber, you have these expectations that you subscribe because in a way, it reinforces your identity as a political citizen, standing up for something. You don't buy a newspaper because you want to read. I don't know, oh, I want to know the truth, so I want to read the paper. There are other reasons why people subscribe. Or, you know, our loyalties, you know, so I'm saying this whole idea that, you know, if readers will pay, it's independent. So you need to question, right? Like, what is independence? You will always have the pressure of what your subscriber wants. So it works all the way. So again, there's no neat distinction, just because you're independent in the sense you're not mainstream, that your incentives are totally aligned. And that's where I think my primary critique comes in. And I don't actually see this going in the right direction from my vantage point, but still, yeah, I think they need to exist and I'll continue to support them."

But she wouldn't say that in public. And she said that, no, in public, I have to kind of show solidarity with the cause, the same kind of thing, not in so many words.

Again, you know, I love your abstract and concrete framework. Great. OK, and I don't think the story is here. So when I was reporting on COVID, I spoke to a journalist in Odisha. OK, he's a senior guy. He used to cover a district. And I was trying to do something with COVID deaths. The project didn't go anywhere. But I spoke to him and for information. I was and now this person who in that district was going and from inside the government, he had sources. He was getting out the death figures that the government was hiding. And every day he would publish on his Facebook page. And he had a WhatsApp kind of a newsletter, which and just focus on one district. OK, and he would send it to everyone. So on a day to day basis, the district administration was confused. No one will know who this person is. Right. They will not like, you know, when we say courageous journalist on Twitter, you know, his name will not be there. But this person is doing journalism in a Odisha district, which local people and the administration both care about. I didn't dream up of. There's a person I was talking to. Because they know the district better. So I called him. So he explained how to get information. Then he went further. He said, you know, I have a WhatsApp newsletter. I send it. He says, you know, I'm going around and I see a problem. That, you know, some project is stuck. He says, take my photo. I first send it to the officials. I send it to the district office. Look, this is it, I'm doing a story. So what they do sometimes is they tell him to wait, we are actually fixing it. Give me two days, don't inform me now. So he stops. OK, because he says, you know, I just want to solve the problem. And he says, if they do it in two days, then I'll do the story. They solved this problem. If they don't, then I tell them that the administration didn't. This problem is happening here. They are not doing anything. He says, I go. I say, which files are stuck? Then I see sometimes, OK, these files are stuck. I talk to the state office. So if I find out that a problem that was a district problem, the files are stuck in it. So I'll send it and broadcast it. And then, you know, the government moves. Amit, when I heard that story, I was so inspired because we have this notion that everything in this country has to be about one man. Mr. Modi. No. Isn't this journalism?"

And that's what I'm saying that, you know, there are, if you start going beyond this world of Twitter, you know, beyond this English language journalism and you start seeing, OK, what are people doing? Right. What he is doing. And this, I think, I mean, I don't have a lot of answers, but I think one of the things you can imagine about the future is that accountability will be decentralized. Right. That you don't need a Hindustan Times to go and talk about every district and government. Ultimately, it's about, you know, the state and the citizens in a way, if you think about political journalism. But the state is not just the center. It's happening at all these layers. So I'm saying that is one example where you gives me hope that, you know, people are thinking, doing stuff outside the limelight. Then I told you this example. I have seen firsthand examples inside newsrooms, the kind of battles people fight to get a story in the paper. When you see that, when you talk to your colleagues, it gives me a lot of hope that despite living in those moral conundrums. Right. They are sticking around to make to make sure critical things go. And I'm not saying that critical thing is the whole point of journalism, but I'm saying that that's an important part. People stick around. Right. And the piece that I wrote, this is example, I said, look at just Denning Bhaskar. Then this was Denning Bhaskar, right? The paper that covered the COVID deaths. I'm forgetting if that was someone you look at it. I mean, in general, you would not imagine that paper to be so critical of the government. But you know, when there is was no scope for propaganda in the sense that it's hard to lie that there is no tragedy. Right. How do you cover it up? At that time, this paper sent 30 reporters across Ganges to just go and see. And they click their photographs. You told the story. And, you know, when you get that story in a big paper, it makes an impact because it makes people think that what is happening to gap about death count. That's a story that the dead bodies in the river unaccounted for, right? So the paper did it, right? What happens after that? So I wrote this piece for this journalism conference. They asked me, you know, the day I filed the piece, a week after that, there were reads in Bhaskar's office, raid in Bhaskar's office, right? Again, to a signal. Now it's a pattern, right? So what you see is that, you know, when people say journalists are sold out, they're not sold out, right? There are problems, but I'm saying that time and again, time and again, you see someone somewhere pushing the bar to make sure that the information goes out. Amit, I know from private experience, journalists having access to information, which for some reason their newsroom is not publishing. They just give their story to someone else where it can be published. And I don't think it's a new thing. It has been, I think I remember Shikhar Gupta talking something about something at the Indian Express and the Hindu, you know, it may like they were competitors, but they also change information back in the day. So, but these things are not visible outside. So I'm saying this is what gives me hope that on a day-to-day basis, you see these efforts. So at a systemic level, while everything kind of seems broken, when you start connecting these dots, I mean, that's what gives me hope. And one thing I really want to plug here is that forget just newsrooms, the civil society, right? And they also contribute a lot in journalism. I'll give you an example that was personal to me. So in my newsletter, which I started, I wrote that polling story"

That is the problem at a macro level. And as someone who believes in freedom, not a particular political party or be just freedom of speech, freedom of the press. It's a fight that people who are not in power have to collectively fight to make sure that those information flows are broken. Like, information should not be suppressed. Amplification is, you know, so that's, if you take all of that in consideration, right? I don't like on a day-to-day basis, you know, I care about the press. I worry about it, but I'm very hopeful.

So you say, Godi media is here, all the journalists are here, and then you see all of that.

You can control a newspaper. You can put a blogger, a Mohammed Zubair in jail. You can't shut down the information sphere. Because we are at a time when, you know, that's a revolt of the public where he says that there was a time when everything was authority. So, a newspaper was in the game of authority.

I mean, I learned from them. But still, I'll just tell you what. So, I think, when I came, when I got my first job as a data journalist, I used to probably tell that, you know, I use data to tell stories. Right. But then you realize that what a limited way to think about a story. Why? I think the frustrating part is not just graphics or whatever. It's just that you want to answer a question. You want to tell a story. And data is a very powerful way to answer a question. It's a scientific question. It could be a day-to-day question. It could be a fitness question. Right. It just, we were talking about glucose monitors the other day. Right. I'm saying it's a one way, but it's not the only way. So, I now think that you do journalism where you try to answer a question. And there are so many different ways you can interview people, you can find documents, and you can also do data. So, when you isolate and say, I do data journalism. Right. It's just meaningless. You do journalism, like all journalism should be data-backed when it can be. Right. When and there will be situations and there are like tons of questions where you don't have data-centric answers. So, you use your other toolkit. So, my short answer is this, that the framing is fundamentally bizarre because, like, are we making a distinction that some things are data journalism, the other journalism doesn't need data or evidence. No. Data is a good way to get evidence. So, that I think, and it hit me very early in my, like, in my career. So, I, you know, I don't even like to interview people. I, you know, I don't even like to introduce myself as a... So, if you see my profiles, I just say reporter. No data reporter, no data journalist, nothing. But it remains central to my work and how I think."

So, I'll sort of link all your posts from the show notes and let people get to them. I want to, you know, go back to the personal domain. And when we had our first conversation in Udaipur, we were, I was telling you about how my CGM, continuous glucose monitor, kind of changed my life. And the long and the short story of it is that I have come to realize that people like us, journalists, intellectuals, whatever, people like us, are trying to understand the world. We are proud of the efforts we make in trying to understand the world, understand processes, understand systems, all of that. But we don't adequately understand our own bodies. And my realization of this came recently when my good friend Ajay Shah recommended that I use a continuous glucose monitor to see what is happening in my own body. And I got that. And the result shook me so much that I changed my entire lifestyle to great benefit, right? And I realized that this, you know, what we earlier spoke about"

We put out our first story about defining what health even means, because if you don't know what it means, like how do you even improve it? That was the point of the so we are doing long reads, you know, long, in-depth narratives around food and fitness. So I'm just trying to say that, you know, we had this giant discussion about journalism, but for me, you know, it doesn't matter. It's a political story or, you know, otherwise you say, oh, fitness is lifestyle. No, was fitness matters. And I want to use the same rigor that I use in my political investigations to fitness journalism. So that's what I'm doing. And all of this came through because I think this is in during COVID, again, random things happen, et cetera, et cetera. And I got into this whole like fitness journey. And so I grew up as a overweight adolescent teenage, right? And all through my early adulthood, that was the case. And I think like many people, you feel that, you know, you need to lose weight, you want to exercise, but nothing happens. You know, at least for me, you try to do something and then it falls apart and you don't know what is happening. You consult someone and it's just so bizarre. It's just so confusing. And you start feeling that there's no point. Forget it. Let it be. What happened, Amit, in 2020, there was a month, like I'm a nerd. So I just read fitness literature in and out, whatever I could. And weirdly, I, for me, just felt like this is actually just a math problem, you know, that I just have to monitor. I have to build good habits. I have to watch my food intake. I need to eat better and I need to exercise. So I'm not going into details of what I did, but I'm saying the thinking. And then, conceptually, I understood that what it, like what fitness means and how I can approach in a structured way where I know doing X can lead to Y. And I saw that impact in a month. Then, you know, there is a bulb that lit in my head that, okay, this is it, man. It's not that difficult. And the good thing was that I was at home. It was locked down. So you don't have to go out. Right. All you need to be was super disciplined. This is how I want to eat. I need to do this exercise and just stick to it. And then I set this. So it took me, it was a seven month time where I lost 20 kilos."

Because sometimes people ask me, I said, I can't give you a two minute answer. The point is, I've worked hard on building habits. Right. That, for example, I realized that workouts. And now, Amit, I just love exercise. You know, this endorphin rush that I get, I just wanted, like I just got COVID and like I'm in the rest phase. So I can't, but I'm like looking forward to, you know, earlier it used to be a core that, oh my God, I have to go to the gym. Right. Now it's something I look forward to because I saw what it does to my body. But I also realize that life happens. So if I, there's a great framework from Sendhil Mullaiyanathan, he's an economist whom I really like. He said that going to the gym every day is easier than going to the gym three days a week, because it removes the most problematic part in this whole, you know, being consistent, which is choice. Which day do you want to go? Right. So you do it every day. You do it for 10 minutes if you can't do it for an hour, but do it. And I was like, this makes sense. So let's do it every day. Then it was that, what happened? Yeah. That do it first thing in the morning because you know, I'm thinking I'll do it at 6.30 in the evening, I'll get a phone call. My mood will swing. I just want to watch a movie. I just want to go for a walk. You know, and I can't, you know, lift weights or can't do exercise. So do it first thing in the morning, get over it. Again, it's intentionality, right, where it all began, that you decide that this matters to me. And then what started happening once I got into the zone, when I changed my eating habits and I learned to cook, I think that was one of the best things I did, that I started going into the kitchen and understanding ingredients and understanding, you know, what is going inside my food. I started understanding packaged food. I read labels. I understood the science of all of it. And then, you know, this picture emerges that actually, you know, the world makes food fitness so complicated, but it isn't. It's just a few, five or six first principles. If you just follow it, you'll be great. And on a day-to-day basis, when you feel so alive, because your energy levels are, you know, great, you feel good. If you, if you're not, if I'm anxious and I go for a run and I emerge out of it, anxiety free. So I'm saying, it's you experience it and you realize that, oh my God, it's a gift, right? This is, like, if you want to live a good life, it is not something like, at least now I don't see it as something, as an option. It's something that I really enjoy. And I think it didn't, I would never say that, ek din mujhe, maine socha aur, ye ho gaya. You know, it is something that I experienced and in that experience, habits started building up and then it stuck. So, again, there's no advice here. I'm just saying this is what my journey was. And now I, anyone who is interested, my friends, I just try to help them to say that boss, it's not complicated. And, but I have to point out one thing, which I'm like, you know, we hear about fat shaming, right? So interestingly, I was never fat shamed. Okay. But I'm fit shamed. Have you heard of this term?"

It's not that, oh, fitness is for, you know, these actors and people who won't know. Because one day, you know, friend asked me, if you have to choose between your body and your mind, what would you choose? I was like, idiot, this is such a terrible question.

That if you just internalize that self-image, you know, it can come from there and there is no punishment involved. The exercise is not punishment. The food is not punishment.

All I know is this is what I want to do. Like as we are talking, I am studying biology. Last year, it was for statistics. This year, I am doing rigorous courses on fundamentals of biology because I'm like, if I don't understand the fundamentals of biology, how will I make sense of CRISPR? I just don't want to read someone. I want to go back first principles biology so that I can think about it. And then I'm doing neuroscience, which is something that has been in my head, but I want to rigorously study it from the ground up. Ab I don't have a story, like as a journalist, I don't have a story that I want to report. It's just that in my framework, this is something I feel is important for my growth as a person who just wants to figure out things.

Interestingly, just a week after I had this question in my head, I was doing this neuroscience course, which is the question, the theme of that course is how the brain gives rise to the mind. Okay?

It's, she's such a brilliant teacher. So she was describing about how humans recognize faces. Right?

That, you know, how our brain is structured to recognize faces in the communities we go to, we grow up, the features that we see, right? That becomes our model, which is why when we see someone from another race, we are not able to make those distinctions. So as she described studies, it just hit me. And then I realized that is exactly what is happening. Why I can't identify these monkeys. Right? It's not that all monkeys look the same. It's that I can't identify. So it's a small thing, right? But it just gave me some deep joy because something I was thinking about, I was for my day-to-day life. And I'm doing this course out of just curiosity and, you know, things just connect. So what starts happening, I think, when you are in that process, at least for me, that out of the blue, you know, things start connecting, the dots join, your high-definition picture starts emerging. But I don't start by saying, I want a high-definition picture of X. Yeah, you gather dots for the love of it. You love it. And I think that is just pure joy. And I think that's why I told you at the conference also that, you know, my, again, journaling allows you time travel. So in my sessions, when I'm writing, Amit, I've been writing this for four years. Whenever I'm frustrated about being in a newsroom, whatever, I just want to understand that why did I come to this profession? I didn't, never signed up to save democracy, you know? I love, you know, there are people who come with that. I didn't come with that. I just thought journalism, like which other job pays you to learn about the world and tell it to other people? Right? That's what journalism is in a way, right? Good way to put it. Yeah. So I was like, this is it. So when you start saying, yeah, I have an understanding, then you break off your identity. Journalism is one way to get it. But if I have the privilege, if my finances are sorted and I can take out time to learn about things and do it. So, yeah, that's my approach. And it just gives me very deep meaning."

        "message": "But I think that book, when I read it in a friend of mine at the Hindu, he recommended because, you know, I think that was a point when I started asking these questions about the press and the media and I could not. So he said, start with this. And it just changed the way I like it. For me, that I don't think anyone has read it, but it's a beautiful book. And I think all of us who at some point are struggling to understand social media, because that's absurdity of modern life, right? What is happening? This book was written in 1985 when there was no internet. It like the thing was TV and you read it. The book has stood the test of time. So I think that book is brilliant. The second book I will say is, again, I love, you know, old books, which Future Shock, Elvin Toffler, brilliant book. You read it and you say, I think 1970 that was published. I'm recalling from memory sometime around that. And like what deep thinker, what deep thinking about the future and how you think about it. The books is about that how in modern society, the pace of change has exponentially increased. And as humans, we're not designed to cope with that change. So what do we do? So he talks about all sorts of, you know, from where we live to our human relationships, all of those things, and talks about how we will adopt in the future. And I think it's such a, I think the genre is a futurist, but it almost feels like sociological work, right? It's so deep. It gives you so many ideas about thinking about the future. So I think that's the second book that I strongly recommend. So I'll stop at, I mean, books, you know, are never ending recommendations, but these two. Movies, I'll tell you one of my favorite movies is a new one. You've seen the trial of Chicago seven. No, it's a beautiful film. You know, that's a, yeah, I just love the movie because it's a very political movie, but it really had a deep impact on me. So I encourage people to watch it. And of course, Dead Poets Society, which we have already mentioned. So yeah, I think I'll stop here."
