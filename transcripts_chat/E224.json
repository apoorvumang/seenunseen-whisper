And this is based on past experience and knowledge and so on. Like when you cross the road, you know that there's a tiny chance that you will be run over. But there is a model in your head that tells you that there's a high probability of getting to the other side. So off you go crossing the road along with the proverbial chicken. Now, while you're modelling the future, you're not explicitly modelling the future. You're not laying down all your assumptions, putting numbers to them, assigning probabilities, doing Bayesian thinking, none of that. But implicitly, you're doing a crude version of modelling. And it has always been my contention that refining this crude process in our heads can help us think clearly about the world. It can make us more mindful about what we do and why. It can give us insight into ourselves. What are our priorities? What are our biases? What are we in denial about? That is why for personal growth, if nothing else, we should think more about the modelling processes that we adopt. If we are not clear about why we are doing what we are doing, then isn't it"

My guest today is Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, and a pioneer in the relatively new field of biophysics. Gautam is also a pioneer in the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, and was one of the first specialists to take COVID-19 seriously before the pandemic hit last year. I have gotten tremendous insights from his scholarship and his public work over the last few months, and I was delighted to have him as a guest on the show. As I expected, I got many, many insights on COVID-19, the modelling of infectious diseases, and the second wave. Gautam is soft spoken, nuanced and lucid, the ideal professor I feel so jealous of his students at Ashoka. He is also deeply passionate about his work. The first half of our conversation was about his personal journey. And one of the things I loved about it was how he expressed his love of science, the joy that he gets out of it. I found it well, infectious. Before we get to the conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break. I often think about how little I know about the world that I live in. This is not something to lament, but something that should excite all of us. There is so much to discover. And I don't just mean this about the larger than life phenomena around us, the geopolitics and the economics and our planetary system and so on. I mean this also about the microscopic world, the world of viruses and bacteria and fungi and so on, that we are basically slave to. To understand more about this fascinating world, I'd like to recommend a course for you. Head on over to the sponsors of this episode, The Great Courses Plus at The Great Courses Plus dot com and check out a course called Mysteries of the Microscopic World taught by award winning Professor Bruce E. Fleury. It consists of 24 encrossing online lectures and you might find yourself binge watching once you start. This is just one of the many great courses on this aptly named site.

I'm very happy to be here, Amit. Gautam, I always start my conversations by asking people more about their background and where they came from and all of that. But before we go into the distant past, which I like to do, I also want to kind of talk about the present. How have the last few months been for you and how have the last couple of weeks been for you? Because these are very torrid times for all of us. How have you been keeping up?"

It's heart wrenching in a very difficult time. So at least I'm glad that so far this hasn't happened to me, but my heart goes out to everyone who has lost people close to them during this"

It's on the Arabian Sea. It has an old part to it, which is really where I grew up. It's called Fort Cochin, which has a history of, you know, both the Dutch and then the British later. So the buildings are old. There is an old, one of the oldest churches in India is over there. That's where Vasco de Gama came and was buried initially. It was a lovely time. I mean, I grew up in the late 60s, early 70s, and I spent the first 16 years, roughly speaking, of my childhood over there. You know, extremely beautiful. I lived there about 10 meters away from the sea for pretty much, I don't know, half my life over that period or more probably. And I can't think of a more beautiful place to grow up. It was a quieter, milder time. My parents were roughly middle class, maybe a little upper middle class, very aware of the importance of education, reading and learning of all sorts and all varieties. My father himself taught both econometrics and English literature in university before he decided that he had to look after his own parents and moved to a more commercial career. But he still had that amazing connect with learning in a sense. So he had a wonderful library. We had about 5,000 books at home that he had collected, his own collection. And I grew up surrounded by books. I grew up surrounded by people who read books, who discuss them, a whole bunch of friends. And his interests were not just apart from being literature, philosophy, it was also art, music. So I grew up surrounded by all of this. My mother initially had learned Carnatic music and so was a singer, although she never really used that. Grew up in really a loving household. There's no other way to put it, which was very supportive of anything that I might have wanted to do. I went to school very close to where I stayed for much of my, apart from brief period in boarding school. And I think I had good teachers overall, particularly a very good chemistry teacher. And that was probably what stimulated my interest in science. Of course, at the point in which I sort of left Cochin, I was interested in many things. I could have been a writer. In fact, if I think if I was to pursue an alternative career, it would be as a writer, because I really enjoy writing, enjoy communication. And so I do a lot more of that now in terms of communicating science and the intricacies of what's happening now with the current COVID situation. I realise that that plays into a part of me that goes back a long way."

        "message": "mean, I know I've asked you two separate questions. So to go to the first point, I mean, I think the books in our house were in quotes adult books. There were very few that were really intended for children. So already I was sort of used to reading books that were noticeably more advanced. My father had a love for biography. So we had a whole range of biographies at home. So reading about people who were famous in both the Western and the Indian canon, I grew up with that and sort of tried to think about people in that way. And it never struck me that this was unusual, that I was actually reading far beyond my age, because that was all I had to read. It was only sort of going out and finding out what other people read that it struck me that this was in any way different from the experience that other people might normally have had. My teachers were important, certainly, but I think it was also the fact that my parents supported whatever that I did. I mean, I was, for example, I was interested in chemistry. So they got me a chemistry set and I would do small little chemistry experiments. And I think there's nothing like chemistry to quite fire a young person's imagination. It's just, you know, you can see it's a very tactile feeling. You can see colours change, you can see crystals form. So that's a good way of getting people into the sciences. But of course, there were also books. And I remember one book that struck me particularly is this book called My Family and Other Animals, which you may have read and loved yourselves as a child. And that, you know, sort of the introduction to the natural world and how to think about the natural world to see what's happening from the point of view of a child. And you can see Darrell's amazing writing. He's writing it as an adult, but you can see it through the eyes of a child. And, you know, it's really a work of literature. And you know, you can sort of imagine from its popularity and from the fact that both of us have read it, that it's, it combined both what I thought was, you know, beautiful writing as well as a real sharp eye for what a child sees in the world around them. And I think that was also very pivotal in ways that I didn't quite realise until I grew older. And so it was these things that I grew up with, books about adventure, of course, every child would want to read about that. Cricket, which I played a lot and also books about cricket, which were the rage at that time for some strange reason among my friends. And it was these things that surrounded me when I grew up as a child."

And somehow that's the point where I moved away from chemistry into thinking about physics. And I think I can sort of describe why that happened. It seemed to me that physics had a simplicity that the other sciences didn't have. I mean, you could write down equations that described everything around you on essentially a few sheets of paper, whereas with biology is full of exceptions to any general rule. There are outstanding and remarkable principles, those of evolution, theory of evolution, for example. But overall, every biological system is unique in its own very special way. And with chemistry, of course, there was this limitation. There's a certain number of elements that you have to play around with, an amazing combination that you can make out of these. I think what I've been looking for is always simplicity. That's something that I found in physics, the fact that there was so much that you could understand just from the application of a very, very small number of physical laws. And I think that was important, which is why I decided to do physics as an undergrad. But even then, I could have, it was sort of physics plus writing, physics plus music, physics plus lots of things. And I was still somewhat uncertain at that point. In principle, I could still have made a change after that. I was perfectly willing to do so. But it's just that physics seduced me further and further as I went. And finally, I decided that that's what I really wanted to do. And I loved it"

Then I went to St. Stephen's College in Delhi to do physics. And I spent three wonderful years there. I'd lived all my life before that in the south of India. So to sort of go to the north for the first time was, you know, sort of brought new horizons to me. And I had made many friends who I remained close to. And, you know, they were people from very different backgrounds from me, but we happened to be all in a hostel together. I liked them very much. And it was, again, very different for me to someone who sort of, you know, this sort of culture leap from going from south to the north. I enjoy speaking Hindi, so that was certainly something that I enjoyed doing. Delhi at that time, in the mid-80s, was a special place. I mean, now when you look at it, it's crowded, it's dusty, it's got flyovers all over, but there's still little sparks of that magic around. But it was a much more magical place in the 80s than it is now, in terms of music. So my uncle in Delhi was a musicologist and a writer on music. So he would write for multiple newspapers, including the Hindustan Times and the Express. So together with him, I would go to practically any significant music concert in Delhi. Over that period of three years, I must have attended hundreds of concerts. So listening to music was very much a part, you know, dash off from, leave college and then go for a concert somewhere. And I met many, many musicians at that time, really the most remarkable musicians of that time, just because I was in his proximity and I managed to do that. So again, from that point of view, Delhi was special. It was also a turbulent time for India. Two months after I reached Delhi, Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated. So to come to a city and then be under curfew, see the smoke rise in the distance far away, hear about the really terrible things that were going on. When it happens, you don't know what actually is going to happen, what the future holds for you. All of this goes into making you. I remember that period as being fundamental in transforming my idea of India, what it was, what it could be, in a way that I hadn't really anticipated it in growing up in the idyllic South."

Being in one of the better colleges in India and sort of surrounded by people of a certain intellectual level, plus the fact that there was a lot of activity that was going on. Stephens had this practice by which they would invite very eminent people to come and speak to them off the record and then they would address questions to them. So I saw a whole bunch of people at that time who were very impressive and so that understanding how dialogue and thoughts about India were formed was important to me. My friends were very important because through them I got a glimpse of what India was like. So one thinks about Stephens as a place which is elite and certainly that that is true. But if you looked at the physics class that I came from, many people came from relatively unprivileged backgrounds. They studied in science schools and they came because they were just very very clever and very very accomplished in what they did. So we had this strange mix of people who came from more privileged, less privileged backgrounds all together learning from each other and many of my classmates have of course gone on to do, you know, very interesting and are all very accomplished in their own right now. But it's interesting to see that we were all formed in that same crucible, talking to each other, learning from each other at that time. I think for me when I talked about the idea of India, I really meant music and the fact that this was such an incredible uniter of people. I remember Kumar Gandharva concerts late at night in in Kamani Auditorium or wherever it was. You know, people just filling the aisles, filling the sides of the stage, waiting for him to come on. This magical moment of about five, ten minutes when you'd heard the sound of the tanpura. He used many tanpuras with a very beautiful sound that came before he started and this complete concentration with both him and the audience were engaged in with the music. So the idea of what makes India special, how is it that Indian music and Hindustani music is really a part of what makes us. It concerns the fact that Hindu, Muslim, none of this makes any difference in terms of our devotion to the idea of music as a cultural uniter and the way we express it. Then Kumar Gandharva used to sing with folk, used to incorporate many folk elements and folk melodies into his music. And again, that's a very different part of the sort of normal, very different from the normal Khyal, Thumri history that is really at the core of it. So to re-conceptualize, where does creativity come from in a specific Indian context? All of these were sort of forming vaguely in my head at that point, waiting to be crystallized, waiting to be put together."

And the moment you said it, I was like, wow, that's actually true. Because I think the best parts of the idea of India, the inclusiveness, this delightful Khichri where people feel free to take from whatever tradition and there is no other per se, there in our music, which is such a lovely thought. Another question to sort of add on to that, you were mentioning Stephens and how, you know, so many of your friends there are so prominent today and all of that. I did an episode with Ram Guha in December. Ram, of course, went to college in Delhi in the 70s, perhaps a decade before you essentially. And one of the strands that came up, and this struck me when I was reading his latest book on cricket, is that so many of the people in college with him at that time are prominent elites today. And if I remember correctly, he kind of agreed with the thesis that in those days with opportunities not being so many, it was this narrow bunch of elites who went to the same bunch of, you know, really good colleges, whether they are Stephens in Hindu, Xavier's in Bombay, Presidency in Calcutta, who would eventually become prominent in whatever fields. And that is something that hopefully I would imagine has kind of changed today. What is your kind of sense of that? Like when you look at the landscape around you, when you look at all of the prominent people, you know, I'm guessing that at some level you have some kind of shared background with all of them in terms of colleges or common friends or whatever.

And just, you know, the fact that now we all know people around us who died early, who need not have died at that point, but they had, they contacted COVID and because they were in that circumstance at that time, they passed away needlessly in some cases. I think these scars will last for a long time. There will be psychological scars and mental health in the aftermath of a pandemic, not so much while people cope with things while they're happening. It's after that, that the survivors have to cope with what happened before and figure out their own psychological, mental coping strategies to deal with this.

I spent two years in IIT Kanpur doing a master's in physics. At the end of that, I had a sort of choice about what physics I wanted to do because physics is, of course, a very large subject. And I'd always had a fascination until then for the more theoretical parts of physics, the much more esoteric and mathematical parts of it. Quantum gravity was one thing that I was interested in or that I felt I ought to be interested in because it sort of sounded difficult and seemed to attack fundamental questions, etc. And then in the last semester of my being at IIT Kanpur, I had this wonderful course taught by a professor called Jayanta Bhattacharya, who later became director of various well-known institutions in the country. But he was an amazing teacher. So I sat in the class and I said, look, this is what I really want to do. And this is a field called statistical physics, which is a very interesting part that overlaps many different areas. So having done that, I said that, look, I first said, look, can I go and can I come and work with you for a PhD? And he said, fine. And I joined IIT Kanpur briefly. But I'd also interviewed in a bunch of other places including the Indian Institute of Science. So the Indian Institute of Science got back to me a little late after I had joined IIT Kanpur and said that, look, you know, would you be, would you consider joining as a PhD student? I'd interviewed earlier with them. And so then I went to Professor Bhattacharya and I said, look, I have an offer here. What do you think I should do? And he said, I think you should go there because these are the people who are over there. They're so-and-so and so-and-so. They're very good. I think you will enjoy it. This is a group that's the center of activity in the field of condensed matter physics in India. So I upped and went there a little later. So I had various, others of my batch had already joined. And that was a big, that was in a sense a pivotal decision for me. The Indian Institute of Science then had pretty much the best physics department in the areas that I was interested in at that point. It had amazing people. So not just as physicists, but much of what I am as a person really owes to the people who taught me and worked with me at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. Okay, so this may be a little esoteric for your listeners, but usually the relationship between a thesis advisor and a student is a very personal thing. You know, you work with somebody, you interact with them, you meet them regularly. But the Indian Institute of Science physics department at that time was a very fluid department. You could be registered as a student with someone, work with someone completely different. You could work with multiple people there. So I was extremely fortunate that out of the six people in the department, I worked with five of them, all on different problems together, learning from each something special, something that they could uniquely do and contribute. So I view that as being very, very pivotal, not just from the point of view of the science and the techniques that I learned, but also from the quality of the people, their honesty, uprightness, their scientific rigor, and the fact that they were, you know, not just boring scientists, but had multiple interests across many different areas. They were very well read on their own. So the fact that you didn't be a boring scientist, you know, really, really came to me then that it was important for a scientist to learn about things that were outside what they were doing, to be able to keep up that sense of wonder at this and to try and relate what they saw outside to the things that they were doing. I think these are all important lessons that you sort of pick up along the way. I had a bunch of very good friends at that time who still remain my friends. And at that point, I was really thinking of doing nothing except physics. I'd sort of begun to think about this field called biophysics, because that was the point where many physicists had begun to move into this huge, grey, nebulous area between fields called biophysics. So I thought of that, but, you know, I wasn't quite ready to make that decision yet. So then from there, I went to the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay, and I worked for two years there as what's called a postdoctoral fellow. And there I was working largely with an experimental group, with both the people who did theoretical work and people who did experimental work. And that was useful because that was the first time that I actually worked, understood what a theoretical person working with an experimental person meant, to see results as they came fresh off from whatever work that was done by the student the previous night. And we had to look at it and try and understand, decipher what all of this meant. I made one particular connection with a person who I discussed a whole lot of physics. This is Professor Shobha Bhattacharya, who later became director of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. And again, the style of doing physics, the style of how an experimentalist thinks, which became very important to me. And after that, I think much of what happened after that is really reflects that interaction. I realised that it doesn't make sense of my style of doing physics involves understanding experimental data and trying to put a theoretical cloth on it and trying to understand where the different bones actually fitted together. And that's what really is my trajectory after that, doing exactly this. A few more details, which I can fill you in. I have some amount of career before I get to the biology. From there, I moved to Canada. I worked in Vancouver for a couple of years. And that's when I made the move towards thinking about more biology problems. And these were problems that had to do with how cells move things inside them. And that was an interesting sort of area to mine for a while. When I came back to India after that, I joined the Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I kept both of these up at the same time. I was doing some sort of regular physics things, as well as sort of this introductory biological calculations as well. And then I gradually shifted over to thinking more and more about biology. That's the point at which I really made the transition. And as I said, in the beginning, because biology seemed exciting, afterwards, because there were these huge questions in it, all of this completely unexplored areas, that, you know, physics is a sort of well-trodden path. People knew what to do. Here, you had to make up your own calculations as you went along. You had to decide what you could calculate and what you could make a difference with. And that was very different."

One, you spoke about the importance of the interaction between the theoretical and the practical aspects of physics, that as a theoretical person, you are constantly getting feedback and having to modify your assumptions and all of that. And it strikes me, and I want to talk about your modelling also at a later point, but it strikes me that when you're modelling also, that's an essential part of what you're doing, that you can't be married to assumptions. You are constantly updating, you know, whatever is in your model, you're constantly updating your theory. And therefore, a certain humility is a prerequisite for that. Now, I imagine that as individuals, one can go in different directions when one is studying whatever. One is that you can get a certain amount of knowledge, allow that to go to your head, form a certain vision of the world, get stuck to it, become dogmatic, follow certain paths, you know, and become kind of that kind of person. Or on the other hand, you can just, you know, retain a lot of humility, always be willing to accept that you're wrong, which I guess all scientists are to an extent, and always be willing to accept that you're wrong, sort of keep interfacing with the outside world. Now, what I see kind of in your history is one that you are not just someone doing science, you know, you've grown up reading, you've grown up immersed in the world of music, and you pointed out that there were all these wonderful people with varied interests, who you also learned a lot from. And secondly, this kind of interaction where you're keeping an open mind, you're sort of in that exciting phase where you're kind of discovering the world and molding your theories to that. And to a large extent, you know, a lot of this could be happenstance, you could have been somewhere else, interacting with different kinds of people and all of that. So am I reading too much into this? Or is this really kind of essential in that sense? Could you have gone in a different direction if you were elsewhere? And are there people who don't have the similar kind of humility and openness, you know, the way Kumar Ghandar would take things from here and there and be open to everything? I guess some scientists are also like that and some are not, you know, as someone who doesn't know about the field, forgive"

There are people whose personalities are very focused to understanding one thing, they become experts in it, that's what they enjoy and they sort of thrive within that sort of limited area that they have carved out from themselves. They make an international name as experts in that particular area. I'm more of a gadfly. I like to take things from different parts. I get bored with doing something for too long. I'm interested in new problems. It's just a sort of, it's really just personalities and every scientist has a sort of unique personality and the way in which they decide how to approach a problem. I've often kicked myself and said, why do you want to do all of this new stuff? Because you know, this is stressful, you're going to have to learn new things, you're going to have to learn a new language. And the great French physicist Pierre-Gilles Desgenes actually said that changing a field is like going to a new country and learning a new language. And that really is true. It's stressful, you know, you have to sort of decide is it worth it or not? Am I not just happy here? But there are parts of my personality that are fed by the desire to learn something new, to see whether what I know can be applied to that. And partly I guess we'll get to the COVID-19 a little later, but also the desire to do something concrete that will help the country in whatever way it can be done. I mean, that sounds a little vague and a little too general, but that also was a motivation for what I did over the last five to 10 years after that, after I started doing all of these"

Do you feel that that kind of helped your perspectives because you're able to come at it from so many different directions and also do you think, I mean, apart from personality, do you think that there is a particular intellectual bent of mind or maybe a kind of rigor which makes a person able to do this? For example, you know, maybe like whenever I try to learn a new subject, what I always try to do is kind of go back to first principles and just try to understand it from its fundamentals, so to say.

I think it's certainly true that as a scientist, as a physicist, someone trained in physics, talking to someone in biology, I bring a perspective that is very different. As a physicist, exactly as you said, you're trained to look at general generality, the general description, to strip it away from all extraneous detail, to try and say that this is what is going to be important, this is crucial, and we can forget about all of this. The classically trained biologist, on the other hand, is very much a person of detail. They know that these details matter, so they will have all of the very detailed, complex biochemical understanding of whatever is going on from their observations. So the dialogue between a biologist and a physicist always has to try and find a common ground where the physicist has to engage with what is happening with the biology very specifically, and the biologist has to be agreeable to saying that there is merit in stepping back and trying to see what the bigger picture is. So I think the fact that I had a fairly broad training in physics has been very valuable, because I know the standard bunch of tricks that one is trained in, in terms of computational mathematics. And I can see that when I think about a problem or discuss it with somebody, where something might fit in, what might be optimal, what might work in this case. And that, I think, is the advantage of talking to other people, because you can pick this up. It's good for both sides. One, as a physicist, you find interesting problems that no one has looked at yet. And as a biologist, on the other side, you find different ways of thinking about what it is that you're doing that may be important, that may help your intuition, but will guide your experiments in a particular direction. And I'm still not very good at it. I mean, you can, I'm not, I'm a trained biologist who's gone through multiple years of a formal biology classroom. But I do understand what is being said now, which would have been sort of earlier, more difficult earlier. And, you know, I think we've sort of been learning on both sides."

At what points is physics important to explain biological phenomena? So to give you an example, and of course, it's a big mistake to ask me to explain what I do because, you know, I just sort of get very happy and give you a half an hour seminar on that. But to give you a very quick summary of the stuff that I'm interested in, you're made up of cells, I'm made up of cells, we're all made up of cells. That's a sort of fundamental basic unit of life. The cells that make you and me up have a cell nucleus. It's basically a sort of bag with stuff hanging on it. But the nucleus is a little compact structure inside that contains the DNA. And the DNA provides instructions for making new cells for the whole, what makes you you and me me is contained in our DNA, apart from some influence from external sources. The DNA is contained in a long molecule called chromosomes. And there are 23 pairs of chromosomes in all your cells and all my cells. What determines where these chromosomes are placed inside this little nuclear bag? And you might think that, look, they're just long molecules, you just mix them. It looks like noodles or spaghetti. That's the sort of picture that you might have mentally. Long molecules all together, mixed up together. What's the best analogy? It would easily be baggy noodles inside a bowl. Turns out that's not true. There is a certain relationship that different chromosomes bear with respect to each other. Some of them like to be closer to the inside, some of them like to be further towards the outside. And this can have very specific impacts on what the cell does, what sort of cell it is. Is it a cell taken from your liver? Is it a cell taken from your skin? Is it a cell taken from your brain? So these questions are really questions of physics because they're how do molecules move around? How do molecules know where to go? What drives that? And of course they have no brains. So what are the physical principles that tell a molecule of this large chromosome to be near the outside versus near the inside? And what does this mean for how we understand the biological functions of the chromosomes? These are questions that are really set at the boundaries between physics and biology. There are no biological answers to this question. And there are no physics answers to the question because it has to come, the phenomena is intrinsically biological phenomena. So now you can see why it's necessary to talk to each other and for the physicists to understand what the experiment was, what led to this observation, and how do we understand this observation from a mathematical and computational point of view. So that's my three minute elevator spiel on why I'm interested in this problem."

You know that in cancers, you tend to multiply the number of chromosomes inside your nucleus. And that's one gauge, one way you can tell if you have a cancer or not, is just to look for an anomalous number of chromosomes inside. So what effect does that have? If I just introduce multiple copies of chromosomes, let's say chromosome two, chromosome five, chromosome seven, what effect does that have on what the cell is doing? Why is it that those cells might be cancerous as opposed to other cells? What's going wrong in the regulation that should normally have existed? There are other types of conditions. Progeria, for example, which is a premature aging, is also linked to the way the chromosomes attach to the outside of the nucleus, to the walls, to the interior walls of the nucleus. So now you can understand where these sort of physical connections between molecules, what contains them, etc. mean from a physics context and then ask what does it mean for the biology? Why do these changes happen and what do they mean biologically for someone with a condition like progeria or a condition like Down syndrome, which is a particular chromosome having an extra copy? What goes on there? What are these questions that relate these anomalies that you can see? They're biological anomalies, but they must have physical origins. How do these tie together? In general, the background for this is a growing appreciation of the fact that biology isn't just chemistry in a different context. For many years, it was believed the whole of molecular biology goes back and tries to reduce the behaviour of biological systems to molecules and how they interact with each other, the DNA molecules and proteins, etc., etc. The physical biology part of it says it's not just molecules, it's not just the way they interact with each other, but the way forces are exerted inside cells. And the whole fact that you grew from just one fertilised egg into what you are now with 10 trillion cells is itself an amazing act of how forces must be expanding, the baby grows, the cells grow, but they all go in this very precisely orchestrated way. That's called development. All of this must involve forces because cells must grow against each other. Cells must receive mechanical cues from other cells in their vicinity. How is all of this orchestrated? And how do we understand this whole phenomenon of life as being this intersection of physics, of chemistry and biology together? This is really the excitement"

There's so much we didn't know. It seems entirely prehistoric today. And we often tend to assume by default as humans, because the future is unknown unknowns. We often tend to assume that we are at some kind of pinnacle of science, that earlier we were ignorant. Now we know it all.

We sort of think of the 19th century as being the century of engineering, where first the great engineering feats of building huge bridges and roads, etc, were first accomplished. The 20th century is really the century of physics. We figured out quantum mechanics. We figured out the fundamental laws that govern the world. We explored the atom with greater and greater accuracy. And we can now calculate properties of physical systems that are to nine decimal places. That's an amazing achievement. The cosmic background radiation that comes to us from billions of years ago, that are received in radio receivers on Earth, the spectrum of that we can calculate with such accuracy. First of all, as an experimental measurement, the size of the little symbol that you use to plot it is 100 times larger than the actual accuracy with which that measurement is made. And we can fit that perfectly. So that's an amazing example of how physics actually works, that it works. We know amply that it works and it works very well. This century is the century of biology, and that's where the explosion is really going to happen. How do we understand how systems develop? How do they start at single cell and become whole beings like you and me? Can we replicate that at all inside the laboratory? Where does consciousness sit? Is consciousness just a fact of the way our neurons are connected inside our brain? Is there something else there? What determines that? Can it just connect in a little Petri dish a bunch of neurons together? Will that be conscious? Will that not be conscious? These are really the questions, especially disease, which certainly is one of the most important questions of our time. Where do cancers come from? How do we treat them? What do we understand? What goes wrong in someone growing that makes that little error, which is then amplified and becomes a cancer? What about Alzheimer's disease? As you know, we're all growing older and older and older. The average lifespan on Earth is increasing. As you grow older, there are diseases that are associated with ageing that are just more likely if you survive till age 80, it's much more likely that you will get dementia than if you were 20 years old. How do we understand that? Where do these diseases come from? How do we treat them? Even if we don't want to live forever, how do we ensure that until we until we die, we live comfortable, healthy lives until that particular point? These are going to be issues going forward.

And I also find it fascinating because one, you could argue that given sufficient knowledge, you can explain all of the universe and perhaps even all of what is going to happen through eternity just using math. But at the same time, because we do not have that knowledge, we therefore have to use the math to do a kind of probabilistic thinking. Like I read this superb book a few years ago called Super Forecasting by Philip Tetlock, which, you know, includes stuff on modeling and all of that. And at that time, I had been like a professional poker player for five years and all of that. And it seemed to come to the same conclusion that I had through my years of playing poker, that you have to think of the world in a probabilistic way. Now, human beings love stories that explain the world, they want certainty. And therefore, they'll think of the world in ways that mimic that in non probabilistic ways. Because after all, everything that has happened has happened, it's 100% that happened, right. But before it happened, there were probabilities involved. And I would say that probabilistic thinking is an implicit part of everything we do. Like I remember I once wrote a column about why we should not stigmatize gambling. The poker, of course, is a game of skill. But my point was that everything is gambling, that when you choose to cross the road, that is a gamble, because there are probabilities associated with how often you will get run over or how if you're in Warsaw, the tree in the middle of the road may fall on you, extremely low probability and all of that. You know, if you are a young single person, and you choose to go up to someone and introduce yourself, there's a probability there, there's a range of possibilities, as it were, you know, poker players love to talk in terms of ranges rather than specific hands. And it seems to me that one of the beauties of mathematics is that it fits real life in this beautiful way. And when you think about math explicitly, a lot of the implicit stuff because we are all gambling anyway, we are all modelers anyway, we are modeling what will happen into tomorrow when we choose to do something today, but we're doing it in imprecise ways. We're not thinking about it. But actually forcing yourself to think about it and think in probabilistic terms makes you much more clear about a lot of things in your head if you start doing that. So you know, I know I'm rambling a bit, but you know, this was one of the big revelations that changed the way I look at the world in maybe the last decade or so. Now you are someone who is of course into modeling. But before we get into the nitty gritties of what modeling involves and how you learned it and how you got into it, just give me your sense of overall aspect of it. And do you think that, you know, learning how to model, figuring out modeling and all of that also changed you as a person in some ways?"

And then you ask from this randomness, how does some sort of order emerge? How can you understand emergent order from structures that are intrinsically very random? And I think that's an important philosophical point at which physics begins to connect to many other fields. Because, you know, look at us, we're extremely ordered structures. We have noses and eyes and ears in exact locations. But the laws of physics finally are completely, you know, immutable and you need them to put the structure together. So how does that actually work is an important and really very crucial point that you made. So it's very much a part of what I do. And in a sense, I realize I've always been a modeler.

You don't know the quantum mechanics of everything in the universe. You just do the little thing that you're studying. And finally, from that quantum mechanics comes probabilities of events because you cannot talk about the absolute certainty except in very limited senses where you precisely prescribe the nature of the quantum state of a particular particle. So it's complicated. And I think quantum mechanics has contributed a lot to this debate around what is known, what can we know, what is knowable. And even these ideas of chaos, chaos theory in dynamical systems has told us about the very large sensitivity that even very simple systems can have to how you start them off. Make tiny little changes and that amplifies this butterfly effect that you can have it. Tiny changes here can have huge far-reaching changes very far away. It's important, especially now, when people sort of imagine that there is a logical sequence in which an epidemic unfolds and we should have known that and models should have predicted it, etc. These are, at their heart, random events. They're fundamentally unpredictable. And when we talk about COVID-19, maybe we'll get to some of that particular question.

So the whole idea behind chaos is that it doesn't matter how you can do it, 1000, 10,000, 5,000, et cetera, decimal places that you can specify that I know the system that well. But finally, it will degenerate into chaos that these trajectories that the possible system might unfold go further and further away. The better you know it earlier, the more time it will take for that to happen. But finally, it will happen. And at some point, it becomes a sort of a debate that cannot be settled. Is there some truly underlying, perfectly deterministic theory of the universe and everything in it? Or are you always going to be limited by the fact that there's no paper long enough to write down all of the conditions on all of the atoms inside that could enable you to make that decision? So right now, I think most scientists take a practical point of view that life is fundamentally stochastic and unpredictable. The system that you're studying, you can control them to some extent and insulate them from external influence for the purpose of your measurement. But in most cases in practical world, you cannot do that. There are just too many imponderables, which is why you need statistical descriptions"

So that's a general theme that every modeler is about. To come more to sort of modeling as I use it now, I have to tell you a little bit more about history. I think beyond, after I spent about five to seven years as a young faculty member, doing sort of standard things that faculty, young faculty members do in terms of research and teaching, I realized that there was some part of me that still needed to be satisfied in terms of the fact that I was doing things that were academic, but in some sort of academic sense, these were useful academic things to do. But I began to wonder whether I could and should do something more for the nation I was embedded in, for the people around me. So that's when we began thinking a little bit, colleagues of mine and I, about looking at infectious diseases as a problem that one could potentially hope to make some progress with in terms of a modeling framework. So between 2005 and 2016, we organized three different meetings. So we were just coming at it out of the blue. We just said that, look, we have some funding in our institute to support these meetings. Let's just have a meeting on modeling infectious diseases. Let's get people interested in modeling from all over the country who we knew. Let's get people, clinical people, let's get people who work on the public health front, get them together and just see if they can talk to each other. So we used to have little tutorial sessions before that, and then we used to have a little conference where people would talk about real work. And we did this in 2006, 2010, 2016, etc. And by the time, the last time we did it, we had a whole lot of people coming in from outside. We had a bunch of people coming from the Rund School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Imperial College to come and give lectures and be part of this discussion. And we slowly began to realize that there wasn't a strong modeling community in the country, which was alert to what information was there in the public health domain, trying to understand what India could and should do. Most of the models on Indian data come from outside India. And, you know, there were people in India doing in quotes modeling, but these were all somewhat rarefied, more mathematical, and very little of it had the real connection to the problems of India, specifically in the field of public health infectious diseases. So from there, that's an imperceptible move in which I was doing biophysics and doing a little bit of this at the time. I also taught this course a couple of times, I taught modeling infectious diseases and epidemiology a couple of times in a bunch of different places. And then I realized, you know, what the tools that went into this, what they were, what these techniques were, and I realized they weren't very far away from what the stuff that I had been doing earlier. This is also just part of a larger question of how do you begin to model systems. And if you're trained in modeling, you can understand how this modeling is done. Then after thinking about these questions, I realized that maybe the other interest ought to be policy, because finally you can do mathematics, you can do modeling, you can talk to people, you can see what you're doing. But the only point at which you can really intersect, you can do things useful, is when you try and see how you can convert this into some sort of policy suggestion in a way that is acceptable, in a way that has a chance of working, because all of this has to float up until someone implements it, decides to choose it. So what is the interplay between models and policy? I think that's really where I am at now. How does one use mathematical modeling of diseases, public health situations, etc., so as to motivate better policy? How can policy take in information that is mathematical in nature, that projects what might happen in the future, that explains what is going on, and gives you a sort of analytic framework or bones with which to make decisions? Now this is hard because policymakers are not necessarily accustomed to looking at mathematical models when they make decisions. So there's also a question of how do you describe what you do in such a way that a policymaker understands that it is important, understands that it fulfills a certain very definite need, and they can then incorporate it into the stuff they're actually doing. So that sort of is my history over the last couple of years, and part of my reason for my move to Ashoka University, where I am now, because I felt that talking about policy would be easier in a place that had policy chops in this area, and where I could talk to multiple people across multiple departments. The whole field of public health is very interdisciplinary. You need economics there, you need some sense of history of what's happened in the historical background, you need people from multiple departments, you need to talk to biologists with experience in immunology, if you want to look at what happens in infectious disease. So you need to talk to ecologists, especially to disease ecologists, who want to look at what are the consequences for disease of changes in the ecology. So this, you know, suddenly your horizon, and I discovered that it just became so much more broader. I was talking to people that I had never imagined I would talk to five years before that, or ten years before that, and then I began to slowly understand the scope of this field and what exactly this complexity meant. And the fact that to be really serious about understanding disease in the Indian context, you had to weave a whole lot of different strands together that I was only, you know, imperfectly aware of earlier and even now and somewhat imperfectly aware of."

        "message": "A few questions and, you know, forgive me if they sound a little naive as I'm trying to kind of get to grips with the subject. But the first one is that modeling would basically be that you take a bunch of data and you figure out ways in which the data interact and then you try to model what will happen as time goes by. Now a couple of elements come into it and the first element is that to improve your model, to improve whatever you're coming up with, you need to iterate constantly, keep changing the data, iterate all the time. And if you are at the same time, interacting with policymakers, you know, in the real world, there's kind of no iteration, you need to decide what to do right now. How does one solve that problem? Because, you know, as we've seen in the past, like there's a famous case of how another modeler, Neil Ferguson, about 15 years ago, said that, you know, when the bird flu happened, said that around 200 million people would probably die from it. And actually around 300 people died from it, which is kind of a stark difference. And that's obviously that there is something there in the assumptions which is wrong, there is something there in the, you know, the data which is wrong, which didn't work out, and it's an honest error and can happen. And if it's a purely theoretical activity that doesn't really have a huge impact on the real world. But when you're going to make policy decisions on the basis of these models, you could go terribly wrong. For example, you could order a crazy stringent lockdown, which has massive economic costs on the basis of a model that was flawed to begin with. Not that I'm saying that, but that's what happened last year, you know, as we're seeing now, you know, without the lockdown, things could even have been much worse. So I'm not sort of making a specific sort of reference to COVID itself, which is hopelessly complicated. And we'll only be able to figure out which decisions were good or bad in hindsight. And we'll come to that later. But in general, about modelling, like, that's my first of kind of two questions that how do we sort of then get past this, that we know models are useful. And we know that politicians are actually modelling every time they make a decision, except that they're not using data, they're just using guesswork and assumptions and biases and all of that. And then they're deciding, we should do this. So obviously, using a mathematical model is better. But at the same time, models become better and better and better, the more iteration there is, where, you know, in the real world, that becomes a limitation. So what's your view on that?"

        "message": "All of them are great questions. And which is why I say that modelling cannot be an exercise that is done in the vacuum. Modelling has to refer to a whole bunch of people with a vested interest in understanding what the outcomes might be. You must talk to the public health specialists who see a disease increasing in numbers. You must talk to the immunologists who try and understand, you know, how does it affect your body? And how does your immune system react? And is there any pre-existing immunity that you might have to that particular disease? You must talk to disease biologists who sort of are familiar with how infection might happen, consequences of a particular disease. You must go back in history to ask what's most similar to this pathogen. You must talk to the biologists who say, is this a new virus? Is this an old virus? How much has changed? And you must talk to ecologists who will tell you that this came from animals into human beings through what's called a spillover event. So the important point that I want to make here, which I think is crucial to answering your question, is that modelling should not be done in vacuums. It's not as though Mr. Ferguson or whoever it is, can sit and write down equations and do computer programs without being very, very, very careful about the numbers that enter those models, the assumptions that enter those models. And that's why you need groups of people working on this together. And these groups should not just be a monoculture of people all of who think in the same way. You need to have a fertilization of people from very, very different areas to try and do the right smell test on what the model is, what it predicts, what it might do in the future. The other statement you made is very correct. The politician makes a model, but we all make models. All of us are sort of thinking, if I go out tomorrow, will they catch COVID? If I go to the shop, what is the probability? Will they wear masks? Is there going to be a big crowd? Is there a line? We're all trying to predict what happens in the future based on our experience of the past, based on the input that is coming to us all the time. But there are questions that only models can answer. For example, how much, what is the amount of remdesivir that the state of Kerala should order, given that the state of Kerala orders let's say one month at a time or two months at a time from its suppliers? How much should it order? Now that's a question that really relies on where do you think cases are going to go. If cases have been downtrending for the last three weeks, you don't want to buy a big order of remdesivir and waste all your budget on that. If you think they're going up, but they're going to come down in a day or two, you might structure your order differently. If you see it going up relentlessly at a certain rate between now and the end of a month, you're going to order a completely different quantity. So that's where the numbers begin to matter. And that's where the numbers that you put into a model cannot be a matter of intuition anymore. You can't say, okay, I'm going to order so many strips of this from my supplier, because I have a general feeling that that should be right. You don't want to run out of potentially useful medicines. I mean, forget about whether remdesivir is useful outside a very specific clinical context. I'm just using it as an example. These things need mathematical bones to be put upon them. The bones are determined by the way you structure your model, what you think is important, what you want to leave out. It may turn out that you left out something very important, but then you wait for people to tell you that. And then you publish your model so that people can comment upon it and say, look, this looks like a terrible mistake. We need to do this. Or they can write their own version of your model and say, we tweak it in this way. This is a little better representation of what is actually going on. But the problem that modelers face, especially modelers of disease, is that you're always trying to ask what's going to happen in the future. And there are many things that come into that. We'll probably talk about it a little later when we talk about more specifically COVID things. But if all of those terrible things that ensued actually happened, that would be a terrible thing indeed. So it's the job of the modeler to be proved wrong whenever the modeler says something that points to death and devastation as a consequence of a pandemic. That's a modeler's job to insist that you do something now so that what happens in the future can be averted. And one has to think about models in that way. They're counterfactual. They tell you what might happen if a particular course of action was done, or if you did not do particular things at particular times. And that should be impetus to do those things at those times, for example, a lockdown or quarantining, et cetera, so that those things don't happen. And then in a sense, the model is wrong because what it predicted didn't happen. But you're very happy and the modeler is also very happy that they didn't happen because this was a sort of situation where it was a counterfactual situation. If you assume you don't do anything,"

        "message": "this is what will actually ensue. And it's also very hard to say that someone who's making a probabilistic prediction is wrong per se. Like I might say that X has a 80% chance of happening, Y has a 20% chance of happening. If Y happens, that doesn't mean I was wrong. It just means that that 20% kind of worked out randomness as it were. I mean, the other way of looking at it, it seems is that when I argue that we should read more, I keep telling my writing students in the class that I teach that, you know, how do we paint a picture of the world? We paint it by joining dots. And the more dots we have, the more high definition our picture will be. And the only way to gather dots is by reading more. But it seems to me that here also, the way of generating the best models is like you said, by getting a lot of dots from a lot of places and just doing that. And it also worries me that simplistic models in the past that might have gone wrong can just give the whole field of modelling a bad name, which is kind of silly because we are all modelling anyway. So you might as well try to be as precise as you can. The other question I had about modelling in particular is that when you're modelling anything in India, your limitation is data because obviously you're feeding in data and you know, garbage in garbage out, you need decent data to be able to understand what is happening. Like one reason people are speculating about why the second wave blindsided so many people is that we didn't have accurate enough data to understand the first wave to begin with. Now in the context of a place like India, where not only is one data not available because of incompetence, but it is also increasingly being suppressed because certain narratives, you know, are more in the interest of the people who govern us or, you know, govern us, quote unquote. So how does one get past this? Like I assume in many ways, like economists in India, for example, will always have to look for proxies for economic data because the GDP has become such a corrected measure. So in the context of say infectious disease in India, if you're trying to model that or just what has happened in COVID in the last year, how does one deal with this?"

        "message": "So it's a bit paradoxical that there is some amount of data that is available. It's not available in the most convenient way. For example, the National Center for Disease Control has a weekly report that covers every district in India that reports on how many cases of influenza, something else, H1N1, whatever it is, cholera, etc. came up. So that is very granular data. It's the data at the level of 740 districts in India on a weekly basis. This data is put out not in any convenient form. It's usually in some PDF file that is located somewhere else. So that's again an irritant that data is not made available even when it is collected. It's not made available in a form that is useful. Someone has to then transcribe it literally from one spreadsheet to another spreadsheet, from a PDF document to something. So one irritant is just this conversion of data from the way it is collected to the way it can be used. The other problem, of course, is just a collection of data. There is data that we don't collect. There are districts that are not surveyed well enough and not carefully. Forget about issues of people making up data and so on. I'm not even concerned about that at this point. And with COVID, of course, everything has gone completely crazy because we're not testing enough. They're not reporting deaths correctly, etc. These are problems that are particularly hard to deal with in India because the scale of the lack of knowledge is truly huge compared to sort of a typical Western developed democracy. Just to give you an example, if you just look at deaths in India, most people in India die at home. Even though about 80% of deaths in India are recorded in some way, only about 20% of that 80% is what is accompanied by what's called a medically certified cause of death. So we actually know only the reasons for a death in terms of what a doctor might have scribbled on a form. In 20% of 80% of the Indian population, very roughly speaking, and it's fairly homogenous across the country. And it depends very much on which district you are, more far-flung, remote, etc. The less accurate that information might be, whereas in cities, you typically have good recording of this. That's a very fundamental thing. If you don't know what people are dying of and how many are dying, you have no way of understanding what, for example, with COVID currently, what is the background against which I must measure an excess? How much of an excess are we seeing twice as many people die as would normally have died in a non-COVID year? Is it five times as more? And that's very crucial to understand the impact on the country. Where are people dying? How are they dying? Are they dying typically more of respiratory ailments that have not been classified as COVID because no COVID test was done? We need to put all of this, and this is a challenge for modelling. It's a challenge for public health more generally, even if you didn't talk about models. To understand and to make decisions about public health, you need data. The problem is, of course, that there is an incentive, there's a subtle incentive to not report it because you might think it reflects badly upon your district, badly upon your state, badly upon your chief minister, badly upon your government, etc. So that's going to be an issue in the future, and it should have been an issue for many years. How do you change the incentives around so that the incentive to not report bad data, to basically report good data as far as possible, is there inside the system, that there are checks and balances, there are sniff tests that you can apply to the data to make sure that they are actually sensible. So we do need, I think there is slow progress towards this. I think COVID has thrown light on, for many people, the natures of the inadequacies in the data that we deal with. And hopefully that is one thing that will come out, the need for transparency of data, the need to make data available, while protecting, of course, the identities of any individuals who contact disease, etc. But even without that, the level of granularity with which you understand disease in the United States or the UK or the France or Germany, we're not nowhere near that. And that's where we should strive to be. So the question that"

        "message": "years in this field have been like for you. So I moved to Sonipat about six months before the pandemic actually began four or five months, with the intention of potentially setting up a group of people interested in disease modeling. And to you make a sort of node, identify people across the country who would be interested in contributing to improving disease and public health model in the country. That's what I was here. Of course, I will join the physics and biology department. So as that as I had regular teaching responsibilities, their research responsibilities, students to supervise, etc, etc. But this was my larger goal. So it came as a shock almost, or a surprise to realize that the world had changed sometime around January, about four, five months after I'd come to Delhi. And that there was this new sort of pathogen around that everyone was suddenly taking much more seriously that could be potentially the seed of a pandemic that could sweep across the world. So I think I must have given one of the first public talks on COVID-19. Remember that the first case in India was on the 30th of January. On the 7th or 8th of February, I gave a talk in, I think, Hyderabad to a public audience saying that, look, this is what we know about the virus at this point. This is what we know about how it spreads. These are the largest socio-political historical backgrounds. What do we know historically about pandemics of infectious diseases? What might this mean long term? If China's locked down, what does it mean to supply chains? What is the use of language? Why is it that, you know, you move from calling it the Wuhan virus? At that point, at that point, the WHO had not even declared it to be a pandemic. So even though in my title, I gave the COVID-19 pandemic, I was sort of very conflicted about that and said, you know, should I say this? They haven't called it a pandemic. We don't know what it is yet, etc. And after that, I was reading up very intensively about it, following developments in Hong Kong, Singapore, China, etc., watching it spread first from there to Italy, watching the start of the Italian pandemic, first couple of cases in India, and also talking about it because I found that people did want to know and the sort of perspective that I had, which wasn't just a modeling perspective, but I'm presenting it in a historical context, telling you about the many areas in which, and I used to say then and I still do now, that there is no area as interdisciplinary as a study of infectious diseases. It deals with health, it deals with biology, deals with modeling, it deals with economics, it deals with geopolitics as well. Even if you forget about the whole field of medicine and public health and all of these other areas. So it's that that I wanted to convey to people. You should think about this in much larger terms of how it's going to affect your life, how is it going to affect the lives of other people around you. So that's when we began to model and very early on, colleagues from the organization that I had taken leave from in order to come to Ashoka University, which is the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, we had started a group there along with a bunch of colleagues from across India called the Indian Scientist Response to COVID-19. And this was really intended to give a scientific explanations to the public to try and describe to the public in lay terms what the science was saying, what are the right precautions that you should take, what do we know about the disease, and to translate it into multiple languages because we didn't want to just be in English dominated. How do you design good graphics that could describe to people who may not even read to what the situation was. So we did that very successfully for, we continue to do it now, curating and producing local language material that describes everything about vaccines for COVID and current knowledge of COVID, how COVID spreads, hand washing, etc. But part of that was also setting up a group that did models. So that's when we began working, a group of about eight or nine of us came together to try and think what were models for COVID-19 that were being discussed at that time, how would we put that into mathematical framework, and what would we want to do. So this was a period of intense discussions surrounding that model, where we tried to put it together. And at that point, many people around India were also involved in COVID modeling, all of sort of varying qualities. There was some good and some bad, but we were particularly, we wanted to develop a model that would be general enough and powerful enough to be able to answer the sort of granular questions that we wanted to answer. In this particular district, with this population, with so many cases by the beginning of March, what would you predict for what might happen in the future? If there was a lockdown, what would you predict? What is the best way to come out of a lockdown? What about lockdowns that are on and off? So you have a lockdown for a week, then we are off for a week, then on for a week. Is this a way of getting people back to work? Can you segment the population so that one third of the people go to work, two thirds remain at home, and every week they interchange? These are all ideas that we were asked to, in some cases we were asked by government to look at these and to try and suggest different ways out of the lockdown that existed at that point. And these others were sort of general interest. What was the international scientific community thinking about lockdowns in general and how does one cope with that? And could we track the behavior of COVID-19 across Indian cities, across India as a whole, as it developed between the months of about March when the lockdown happened to much later in the year? So that's really what we were engaged in. That's where my first intersection with COVID-19 modeling came"

So my sort of assumption about pandemics would be that there is a point early in a pandemic, in fact, before a pandemic is called a pandemic, as you put it, where you don't really know which way it's going to go. You're thinking probabilistically, and it could be a pandemic or it may not be a pandemic, like in the bird flu case where, you know, Neil Ferguson forecasts 200 million deaths and 300 people died. And, you know, it goes one way instead of the other way. So at what point does it begin to become apparent that this is a big deal? And also a dual question that would that then have something to do with the nature of the virus itself? In the sense that is this like a game theory optimal virus in that it is a perfect mix of infectious and lethal? You know, unlike Ebola, it is not so lethal that it is not infectious enough. And unlike a lot of common flus or whatever, it is not incredibly infectious, but not lethal at all. So why worry about it? Did this kind of hit the sweet spot? Is there a sweet spot? What is your sense of this? And would tracking this have helped you realize earlier and kind of change the probabilities that yes, this is a big deal. This is going to be serious.

        "message": "Oh, that's a great question. And so just to go back to the sort of previous point that you made, it really hits a sweet spot because it's highly transmissible. It goes by respiratory. So all you do have to is to breathe in the same air that someone close to you is breathing out. And then if enough virus particles get into your body and multiply, then you have COVID-19. But as you pointed out, the other thing is that most people who have COVID-19 will not know it because we know that somewhere between 50 to 80% of people who contact COVID-19 are asymptomatic for the disease. They may feel mildly ill for a few hours, maybe a day or two. Sometimes in many cases, not that at all. They don't know that they have the disease and are capable of transmitting it to other people. It's only a small fraction that has symptoms and of them even a smaller fraction will wind up in an ICU or wind up in a morgue at the end of that. So the combination of highly transmissible yet killing people at just the right rate is a sort of unique combination there. And this is really, you know, it's a perfect example of what a highly evolved pathogen ought to be like. If you really wanted to design one that would seep across the world, you'd design something like this, where much of the transmission happens before people show symptoms. Unlike its relative, which is the original SARS virus, which is closely related, they're both coronaviruses which are related to each other, that killed you at a much larger rate. It killed you at an infection fatality rate of about 8%. So 8 out of every 100 people who contacted it would die of it. Another coronavirus is called MERS. MERS, the numbers are more even more scary. It's about 30%. So you had a 30% chance of dying if you contracted it. None of these diseases, do we have a vaccine, do we have any sort of treatment, any antiviral, nothing. So effectively, you catch it, your odds really depend upon that particular number. Whereas we know now that for the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that number is probably somewhere around 0.1 to 0.3% compared to 8% and compared to 30%. So it's really, you know, it sort of, it kills you, but it kills you at a sufficiently small rate that you're constantly having to understand this trade-off in your head. At what point should I open up? How many numbers will die as a consequence? We're a younger population, maybe we won't die so much. But then you have to compare that with the fact that people who die are people who belong to our population. There's somebody's nephew, somebody's uncle, somebody's aunt. And at the individual level, it's always going to be a tragic issue. So this was debated much more earlier, when what these numbers were, weren't completely clearly understood. People thought it was much more like the regular flu. And the argument was, if it's a flu, then everybody gets the flu sooner or later in a year. Maybe if you're elderly, etc., somebody dies of it, but that's the risk that we're willing to take. But then it took some while to figure out that this is not the flu. That, you know, it's certainly not the flu. The older you get, the further and further it gets away from being a flu. The younger you get, you should, it's kind of a little more flu-like, but nevertheless it has long-term consequences that the flu doesn't have. But this has all been an evolving understanding, and that's a very nice point that you've made. The fact that this is really hits a sweet spot in terms of its behavior as a potential pathogen that influences human beings. When did I first think about the importance of this? It took a long time for me to really figure out because the numbers themselves weren't clear. The distinction between a case fatality ratio, the infection fatality ratio, the fact that many, such a substantial fraction of people were asymptomatic for the disease, the fact that age, the way age is distributed in the population makes a huge difference. India is a young population. Italy is an old population. So, it hits both of us very, very differently. All of these things I sort of slowly began to realize as I went forward,"

        "message": "and so it's a learning experience for me as well. And, you know, when you reach that intersection of modeling how an infectious disease will spread and modeling what the consequences of, say, a public policy which is intended to counter that, it gets complicated. Like the issue with something like a lockdown is that sure, it is possible to, you know, with the best data that you have to come to some kind of a probabilistic estimate of if we do a lockdown, we'll save these many lives, a curve will flatten in this way, maybe it will be prolonged, all of that. What is much harder to model are the downstream economic impacts. For example, what is going to be the effect on migrant labor, if we lose 20% of GDP because of the lockdown, that is also going to kill a lot of people. And the problem with any public policy measure, in this particular case, is really a case of the seen and the unseen, in the sense that the bad consequences of people who died at a scene, and the people you are saving, that is unseen. Therefore, you know, as far as any measure is concerned, whether you do a lockdown, you don't do a lockdown, you do, you know, a lockdown and gradations, it's something that if you can ever tell whether it was a wise move or not, it is only well, well, well, in hindsight, at the moment, you're in the fog of war, there's simply no information. So as a modeler, there's this extra dimension that you're suddenly having to deal with. And you're having to deal with, say, the incentives, therefore, of politicians, which can go in different directions, like one, of course, will be the status quo bias that rather than do something which harms people, I'd rather just, you know, not do anything and pass the buck and control the narrative.

How do I combine epidemiological models for what might happen with, together with economic models that examine the consequences of particular actions, such as a lockdown, etc. This is much harder to do. We now are working on a bunch of models that hopefully will provide one way of thinking about this question. These are called agent-based models, where you try to model every individual in, say, the Pune city, or the greater Mumbai area, or sort of the NCR region, etc, or even potentially across the whole state or the whole country. And then you say, the first thing I'm going to do is to make a synthetic population for that region. Instead of, you know, if I knew every detail about everybody, I could just sort of write person in one line, so and so, you know, Harkirat Singh, age 65, this comorbidity, earning agricultural labor, etc, etc, etc. But what I have to do is to make a population that is a synthetic population, a made-up computer population that has all the features of the population that I want to study in rural Punjab, or in Bhatinda, or in Kerala, or wherever it is. And then these models are big computational models that try and put in elements of how people make decisions about that. Where do they make trade-offs between economics and health? Where do you account for people who are vaccine hesitant? Some fraction of the population is vaccine hesitant. Can I put that in and simulate what might happen in this case? So I have people who go to work and come back, go to work and come back on a regular schedule, kids go to school, and then I introduce the disease in that population. And this disease begins to spread, and people see the numbers of that disease and then begin to alter their own decisions accordingly. So you have infections that rise and come down, you can have vaccinations, you can have different variants. All of this you can test out on your computational population. These models have earlier been used to study really how disease spreads in a population that is somewhat semi-realistic. But now you can also use them to understand economic decisions. You can hard-code these in the way you describe these, how people make decisions on the basis of the economy. And then from that I try to extract the information that you talked about. All of this is a pipe dream, it's in the future. But we made some steps towards that, we're actually defining many of these units that go into this. And that I think is going to be the most important thing that we're going to be doing in the next couple of years. And you know, your point is completely valid. And again, it goes back to what I said about this being the most interdisciplinary area that I could possibly think of. It has any public policy must include all of this.

So let's take a quick break. And when we come back, let's dive a little deeper into COVID-19. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

So tell me a little bit about how our understanding of this particular virus began to evolve through the early months of last year. In particular, you know, when we look back on history with hindsight, even if it's recent history as recent as a few months ago, you know, the pictures that we somehow paint in our minds tend to be very clear pictures. But actually, you know, in the moment, there's much more hesitation and uncertainty and all of that. So give me a picture of your personal sort of journey in understanding the virus and understanding the pandemic and figuring out what's happening, how serious it is, all of that, you know, while you're, of course, doing the modeling work, how are those models kind of"

        "message": "evolving? Give me a picture of, you know, that period. So I think the first and the most important thing that I had to learn was the difference between a case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio. And case fatality is, you know, the number of people who die divided by the number of cases of confirmed COVID-19 that you get. The infection fatality ratio is the number of people who die divided by the number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And normally these numbers are sort of close to each other. But the main step in certainly my understanding was understanding that these two numbers could be very different from each other because of the large reservoir of people who would show no symptoms of the disease, were asymptomatic. So they would have to be counted among the infected. But out of that much larger number, only a small number would be counted as cases because they actually showed symptoms or landed up for testing, etc, etc, etc. And this, of course, the distinction is also a function of how much you test. If you could test everybody, then you would catch every case and catch every infection. You will wind up invariably missing some fraction of these. And exactly the extent to which you're missing cases is an important question right now. The models that people began to write down, I think, fairly early on, not too early, but maybe about a month and a half, two months into the epidemic, people realised that you had to account for these asymptomatic cases and that they were important in the sense that they could infect other people with showing infections, showing symptoms themselves. And the other point was that even for the people who were going to show symptoms earlier, they were most infectious before they began to show these symptoms. And that's again something unusual about this disease, that it has a longish period of a day and two days, maybe more, in which you can be infectious to other people while not knowing that you actually had the disease. So then people began to develop a whole bunch of models that included this particular feature. It included the fact that, you know, some fraction of people would go to hospital, some of them would die, and began to flesh these with numbers. What is the probability that if you were in ICU, then you would die? What is the probability of being in an ICU if you were hospitalised for some case of COVID? What fraction were mild cases as opposed to severe cases? And then it began to be even fleshed out even more. If you were between the ages of 80 and 90, what is the probability that you would be a severe case, who would then die or require ventilation of some sort, etc. So this age stratification, as it's called, solely began to be understood that this is an important feature of how we think about the disease and how we might understand the numbers that might ensue if you allow this to sweep through a population, or even if you impose some sort of a constraint, such as a lockdown, how would these numbers change? And that was very important because it's a very differential way in which people of different age groups are affected. So once we had all of that in place, I'm guessing this is about three to four months, maybe five months into the pandemic, then the question was, is India different in any way? And this has haunted people modeling for quite a bit. It seemed as though, in fact, if you just look at the numbers, fewer Indians are dying than people elsewhere. If you look at the deaths per million population, let's say, then the Indian number is at least about a factor of 10 to 15 smaller than the analogous number for the UK or for the US. Let's say that we can understand the UK and the US are older populations. Why is that number so different from Brazil? And sort of nominally, you would have thought that India and Brazil are not that different. We're all sort of growing LMIC, roughly speaking, economies. Why is it that Brazil is seeing such a large number of deaths, whereas India is not? Now, we realize that this question is sort of holds many questions inside it. Are we counting deaths correctly? And Brazil sort of records all of its deaths and has a cause of death. India, as I pointed out, doesn't do that. Are we missing deaths outside the major cities? In the major cities, you could say that maybe you're counting all of the deaths more or less accurately, but is the real bulk of deaths happening outside? So then you can go back and ask these numbers in a more specific, district-specific, city-specific, city-area-specific, to see what you're actually missing out. Then this question of, you know, the fact that the ages, how sensitive is this to the way you distribute people across the ages? How sensitive it is to the structure of families? India has multi-generational families where both young children as well as elderly grandparents live in the same house, and that certainly affects transmission. We are a society that tends to protect elderly people in whatever way we can. So there is automatically, at the coming of the virus, there is some level of distancing. Once you know that old people and people with comorbidities are likely to be more affected, then families have automatically reconfigured wherever they could to be able to protect older people. Of course, also in India, there's also survivorship in the sense that if you've already lived up to 70, the likelihood is that your nutrition was better, that your educational status was better, that you come from a higher socioeconomic class, etc. So that's something that again goes into this description. You have to try and disentangle it from this whole mass of data that actually exists. So slowly we began to get a better understanding. The only real question being, was there anything special about the Indian population that protected it? And this is something that has really bugged many people in this field, including very, very good Indian scientists who pointed out that, you know, according to their view of things, something does protect the Indian population. And this is likely to be the fact that Indians, on average, grew up in more unhygienic and unhealthy surroundings than people elsewhere, let's say in Japan or France or Germany, etc. This exposure to a variety of pathogens when you grew up in your childhood, etc., makes your immune system respond a little less, a little more bluntly to things that are challenging it. We know that many of the bad consequences of COVID-19 really come from an excessive immune response. The immune response is overreacting to the presence of this new invader inside your body. So if you can stamp that down, if you can prevent inflammation at that level, steroids, for example, do that, that's one way of coping with the disease. But maybe it's inbuilt in India, the fact that we sort of grew up, so we have this whole exposure wherever we go, we don't really truly insulate ourselves from our environment. That was something that people did to a very exhaustive statistical study suggest. Now it seems that those arguments were just plain wrong because from an immunological point of view, there's no real reason to believe that for this particular viral disease, a prior exposure made a difference, but it's a valid scientific point of view to take. Just now, unfortunately, seems to be wrong because it's very, very steep rise now that we're seeing. Had we been protected, we would not have seen it. So it's clear that that argument was wrong, but it's a legitimate scientific argument that many of us considered at some"

        "message": "point over the last year. So many, many strands to pursue here and the first one is this, that it strikes me that when we try to arrive at the truth about this virus, there are sort of two paths that we can take which both make sense and which at some point will come together to do a whole picture. One is we look at what the numbers tell us, how is it spreading, where is it spreading, what is it doing? And the other is we look at the inherent biology of the virus itself where, you know, we encode the genome and blah, blah, blah. And we look at that. Another way of putting it would be that you look at what it does and you also look at what it is and why it is what it is, which I guess are questions of physics as well. Then, you know, just taking this analogy further, for example, one of the big learning moments for me a couple of years ago about artificial intelligence was, you know, when AlphaZero did what it did, it destroyed Stockfish in chess. And Stockfish was, of course, the older sort of engine, which at a rating of about 3500 was way stronger than the strongest human, Magnus Carlsen. But this new machine learning program called AlphaZero just came, learnt, taught itself to play chess in 24 hours and destroyed Stockfish. And one of the great learnings there was you didn't know how it did it. You just know that it did it. You saw what it did, but you didn't know the why. You didn't know the inherent logic behind it. And which is true of a lot of machine learning that you don't get the inherent logic, but you know that it's figuring out some remarkable truths. So therefore, you know, in this aspect of figuring out what it does, figuring out what the numbers tell you, is there a point at which machine learning also becomes applicable in terms of figuring out what it is? And do these two ways of learning about a virus converge at some point? Or do they go in different directions? And I imagine that in the early days, when the biology is still kind of figuring itself out, though, even there, I mean, it's it's a freaking miracle that all these vaccines came that the mRNA vaccines were practically designed on a computer in January itself, which is mind boggling progress there.

        "message": "I agree. Corrected on that. That's the way in which it sort of plays against itself, figures out what has to be done and then see what is an optimal strategy at the end of it. But here it's not clear what the rules are. I mean, the rules are profoundly, the way disease spreads is really at its root a social phenomenon. And who is talking to, who is interacting with, who in what density, where, at what, you know, where does the person in the slum intersect the person of the in the high-rise building? What are the points of this intersection? What are the nature of that interaction? Who's wearing a mask? Who's not wearing a mask? Because the complexities are social and not biological or physical. This becomes a far, far harder problem. So I don't think there's been any approaches to disease modeling that actually take the more modern approach of this adversarial network approach that you mentioned. It's more based on traditional studies of how disease transmission has happened, records across multiple countries, records across multiple districts and try to understand is there a logic behind that. But here it's as though you're playing chess with where you're not told that the, you know, you're, there's sort of fuzziness around the position of every chess piece. It could be somewhere in this region, but you're not sure where. And whether given that fuzziness, there is useful information to be had that in terms of being able to project forward is not very clear to me. I don't have any neural network or AI-based or machine learning-based algorithm that actually manages to do that in any credible way. And also the other point is that, as you said, these are not interpretable or explainable. You don't know why it does. It just sort of says it'll go up here and then it'll come down a little later. But you have to be careful. It's not being biased by the data that you fed it in earlier, which showed lots of stuff that went down for reasons that may have been completely different from reasons that prevail in the current situation. So the models that I work with and the models that I sort of, I like to use are a bunch of different classes of model, but they all rely on a very classic description by two Scottish mathematicians called Kermack and McKendrick. And they devised a model called the SIR model. And that model and the way of thinking about it is at the basis of all research in infectious diseases nowadays. It's really remarkable to see what a profound impact that has had. And the idea is that the simplest way to think about disease is just put everybody in the population into three boxes or compartments. You're either susceptible to the disease, you're infected by the disease and infectious to other people, or you're recovered from the disease. And you can sort of choose different versions of these that are put in more compartments. But the idea is everybody in the population you can put into these boxes. Then understanding how the numbers of infected change is just as simply a question of saying once a susceptible person contacts an infectious person, they move from the susceptible to the infected box. Once they recover, they move from the infected box to the recovered box. So it's just movement across these boxes or compartments that is described by this mathematical model. And the twist here is that you need susceptible people to interact with infected people for the susceptible person to be infected. If there was no infected person at all surrounding you, you would remain susceptible for an infinite amount of time, for as long as it takes. So these are simple ideas that say that we can forget about people's names, ages, colors, whatever, etc. For the purpose of disease, all we need to understand are these compartments. And there is no simpler version of this model. There are more complicated versions, but no simpler versions. And people have worked with these models. These models were roughly about 100 years old now, and there have been many sort of versions of higher order versions of these models that have a lot of complexity. Let me give you one example because it's an interesting example. So you can have a susceptible, infected, recovered, dead, removed, etc. All of these categories. The dead category is an interesting one because if you think about Ebola, we understood that even dead Ebola patients can be infectious. And the way you handle the body in a traditional African burial is one that allows the dead person to transfer the Ebola, the live Ebola virus to you through a body fluid. So changes in burial practices is really a consequence of really superb epidemiological thinking about this problem. And in order to do that, you have to make a little compartment for the dead compartment, which could potentially infect someone who was susceptible if you didn't sort of tap that down and make sure that that didn't happen. So you have, depending upon the disease, you can devise the compartments appropriately. And now there are compartmental models for COVID-19, which are fairly good. And they really put in the sort of information that you need to understand how the disease is going to spread at a large scale. What will the peak be? What will a lockdown do? What will multiple lockdowns do, etc. The main intuition that you get, you have is the first port of call is that particular model or the version of that model that's most appropriate to your disease. So I think it's a very beautiful and a powerful way of thinking about it in a sense. And it's interesting that that intuition, the fundamental intuition of these two guys worked out so many years ago is really what we rely on when we think about modeling. You know, you mentioned the change"

And the reason that stopped is that in the early 1990s, when cows started getting a certain kind of stomachache or whatever, vets would prescribe something called Diclofenac. So the cows would take Diclofenac and then later the dead cows would be eaten by vultures. And because of the Diclofenac in the dead cows, the vultures above Mumbai or wherever in the area started getting liver disease and started dying out. And because there weren't enough vultures, the Parsis had to move away from leaving the bodies in the tower of silence for vultures because there simply were no vultures.

You know, as all this is happening, you are tracing how the disease is doing whatever it is doing in the population. And there are all these social elements and interaction and you're figuring out the virus. But as you're figuring out all of this, the virus is also evolving, right? And my earlier understanding, which might be a simplistic one, so maybe now you can correct me and elaborate on that. My earlier understanding was that a virus will typically evolve in a way that makes it more infectious and less lethal. Like, you know, earlier flu viruses like some of the flus which caused the pandemics of the past evolved to becoming completely harmless and seasonal variants. Similarly, you know, I think one of the two coronavirus variants which causes a kind of flu completely harmless again was Anirban Mahapatra was telling me in the episode I did with him caused something a couple of centuries ago. So one would have imagined that okay, this virus will go in that way in the sense it will become more infectious and less lethal. And over a period of time, it'll be a seasonal thing and we'll just get COVID and it's fine. We'll, you know, we'll get over after two or three days of not feeling well. Now one, how hard is it to model something like this when all these variants are springing up? And to the variant that seems to have struck in the second wave, I mean, a lot of the deaths in the second wave in India are really because of the failure of the dysfunctional state, the scarcity of oxygen and many of those lives could no doubt have been saved. But at the same time, while it does seem to have become far more infectious, we are not sure yet whether it is less lethal. People are dying all over the place because of it. Like I, you know, I find that I don't have a single friend who's unaffected by it in some way or the other in terms of family or friends or, you know, extended circles. So what is your take on what's going on here?"

        "message": "So you have to draw a distinction between evolutionary timescales and the sort of shorter timescales on which we are observing the behavior of the virus. It's true that the ultimate job of every living entity on earth is to be able to propagate itself and to find the smoothest way of doing it and to prevent itself from being sort of, you know, from that chain of propagation being stopped. Coupled with the idea of natural selection that whatever enables you to fit better into this certain niche into which you are born as an organism is one that will enable you to propagate better, give rise to more progeny which will then expand further. This is complicated by several things. First of all, viruses mutate at random. The virus doesn't know what's a good mutation, what's a bad mutation. Some things might be, it might kill the host immediately, some things might let the host survive, something might be so minor the host won't notice it at all. It's only over a much longer timescale that you can allow for the selection, that you slowly prune out those that will tend to be dead ends in terms of dying out, they kill the host too fast so they can't propagate versus those who manage to survive within the community for a longer time. Already there's an interesting selection that's happening here. Already you can argue that with masking, with physical distancing etc. you're selecting for those viruses that pass more easily between people. That's an interesting point of view from an ecological point of view, that the only ones that survived are the ones that were moved more easily because you already by fear force people to sort of stay further away from each other. Right now I think it hasn't been enough time for these ecological scales to play out, for things to, for the virus, the virulence of the virus to decrease sufficiently so that it becomes like a cold, which may or may not be the final trajectory that it actually chooses to take because who knows what it's trying to optimize in this particular case. It could jump hosts for example, if it found a different animal host in which it was perfectly happy, it might move back to that host and that would be a different evolutionary trajectory that it might choose. Regarding this question of, you know, we all know people who've been affected by COVID in this way compared to the previous wave and so the assumption here is that it's worse this time compared to what it was earlier, but all of this is still really anecdotal. We don't know whether at the level of numbers, this is just the same old virus in effective terms as it was earlier. It's just that because every number is being multiplied by a factor of 10, all the people in the 10 to 20 age group, 20 to 30 age group, 30 to 40 age group, because all of that is being multiplied by 10, we're seeing the adverse consequences, the larger numbers of people dying, even though the fraction of people dying may be the same as in the earlier case. So right now there isn't enough data to tell whether this is more virulent. So it's just currently this is completely anecdotal. Hopefully, you know, sort of going forward, looking back, which is always the best way to see these things, you'll be able to understand this question a little better."

For example, I'd done an episode with Chinmay Tumbe on past pandemics, and we've been plagued with pandemics as it were for a while. But nevertheless, if you just count the number of pandemics humanity has had, the sample size is really small. Can one generalize from that in what a pandemic will necessarily do? Can one figure out that this is a natural curve? Can one then say that this intervention, like say, intervention X, which is lockdown or intervention Y, which is no lockdown, will have this effect on the curve and therefore we should do this?"

        "message": "What's the state of thinking on this? So the answer is that the original SIR model of Carmack and McKendrick was actually applied retrospectively to plague data in Bombay from the 1905 to 1906 pandemic. And so that's when they found that they could perfectly fit the rise in the fall in cases over a 30-week period using their mathematical model. And that gave them certain confidence that this should apply more generally to pandemics. So this has been used to model data earlier as well as pretty much anything, any sort of current increase and decrease in cases, in the case of infectious disease. So we're confident enough that the elements, the mathematical elements that are there actually work. You can use, you can impose lockdowns, see what the effect of the lockdowns are, etc. Usually what happens is that the lockdown mainly reduces the number of cases but spreads it out over a longer time. It doesn't sort of, you know, it doesn't eliminate the cases altogether. But just by spreading it out over a longer time you remove the sort of pressure that you're seeing right now on hospitals, on the public health system, and thereby saving lives that would otherwise have been destroyed because they just weren't able to access medical treatment in time. So we are confident enough about these models. We know what they do. We can explore a bunch of different interventions in them. The hard question is asking how does a particular intervention translate into changing a particular number in the model, a parameter in the model? How does mask wearing by 50% of the population change that number versus 70%? How does a lockdown change that particular number from, let's say, from 0.2 to 0.5? These are much more delicate because they're really statements about how population behave as an aggregate. And as I said, it's driven by social behaviour. And these are the hardest things. Suppose 10% of people in Bombay decided, look, this is all hocus-pocus. I'm just going to go out and behave normally as I would. So then the assumptions about physical distancing applied to the entire population begin to break down. And then you have to ask, how do I put that into a model? Some fraction of people who just will not obey any instruction, any reasonable public health instruction that they're given. What do you do in that context? So this is a grey area of models. How do I take social public behaviour and convert it into the numbers that must enter my mathematical model? Once I'm confident of that transition, I can run my mathematical model and say, this is what you will get at the end of it after lockdown, after imposing mask wearing, after relaxing mask wearing for so long. And you can begin to think that, look, this may represent the numbers a little better. And I could keep going back and calibrating against the numbers of cases, numbers of deaths, numbers of hospitalisation to make sure that you're satisfying the basic smell test for the validity and the quality of that model. But this back and forth is very, very important to make sure that you have everything in this mapping that you've done correctly between these things."

What are those sort of big TIL moments about the virus at different points? Like I imagine, for example, once you start looking for antibodies in the population, you do your cell prevalence surveys and all of that, you understand the big gap between infection fatality rate and case fatality rate, as you said, that is a TIL there and more TILs gradually come. And then some TILs might be theories which turn out to be false, you know, such as why India is not affected so much by the virus. So, you know, what were those big sort of steps in learning about the virus for you as we went through the months last year?"

        "message": "Certainly, as I said before, the importance of the asymptomatic category was very important, and then figuring out the numbers and what is the right number for the infection fatality ratio. You know, we sort of looked through a whole bunch of different literatures and tried to optimize it, looked at what the numbers are, tried to fit the Indian data with respect to that, and finally came up with a range that we think is correct. And then we were able to compare to more and more modern research regarding that's a very important number, because in a sense, that's the most specific consequence. Someone near you, you know, dies of the particular disease. We won't be able to estimate that. And from that, how many people will need hospitalization or an ICU, because some fraction of that will go into, will have to die at the end of it. I think the basic elements of what should go into the model were clear enough. They were clear enough by certainly in the first four months of the disease, three to four months across the world. And beyond that, it didn't change. Maybe people would have tuned a number here or there, but not all of that much. What changed was the development of other types of models. For example, the agent-based models that I told you about, about network models, all of which are intended to answer different types of questions, have different levels of granularity from the simple compartmental models. So people began to work on those models as much more detailed versions of these, and they put in aspects of people's behavior that you can in a network model or an agent-based model that you cannot in the sort of simple model where I'm trying to take this parameter and tune it there, and to understand what this means. So this is part of the evolution of thinking about any disease. You start off with a simpler model, you dress it up as much as you can. But side by side, the whole bunch of different models, statistical models, prediction models, AI, machine learning, all of these proceed together. And somewhere at the end of it, you sort of get a better idea of what these models are saying. So one thing I can point out that if you look at how we ought to have been thinking about modeling in the country, we should have been looking much more at what is called an ensemble model. Right now, the Department of Science and Technology funded and supported a model called this DST supermodel, built by various computer scientists and engineers and one army medical doctor. But that, it sort of said that this is going to be our model. That's always a mistake, because no single model is often good enough. Its behavior fluctuates. But the US, UK, and many other countries used to build an ensemble of models. So they have 10 people or 20 people in different universities across the country, each of them coming up with a different model for what's going on. They pool this information together. And between week and week, they'd find out which is doing better, which is doing worse. They weight those that are doing better historically somewhat more than the ones who are doing worse. And then they come up with a combined suggestion from all of these models saying over the next week or 10 days, this is what's going to happen. This usually is good at eliminating biases that individual modelers might have. It includes information that some models do better, things that some models do better versus things that some models do worse. And then you get to a much better prediction than you would have. It's the wisdom of crowds, in a sense, in this particular context. But that's how one ought to have done it. That's not how we've done it in India."

And that modeling group has a link that goes to the dashboard, as we call it. So people are willing to do that. On a general point of principle, we plan to make this public, although the current version of the model, because it's evolved, become much more technically more complicated, etc. And it's my belief that this should be completely transparent.

        "message": "headed? You've asked me multiple questions, I'll have to try and disentangle each one. I'm so sorry, I tend to do this. That's why it's a three hour show. I think it's correct to say that most people were blindsided by this. And that's because of the gap between the decline of the peak of the first wave and the increase of the second wave, where we actually took it off. That's a very large gap compared to the gaps that most other countries saw. So how did we think about it then? What some people did was to say we've reached herd immunity, about 60% plus of our population is already infected. And that's why we can expect that the disease will not bother us anymore. Unlike the US, unlike UK, France, etc, whether 10% or 20%, they're nowhere near our numbers. We should have been a little careful about that because they were saying the same thing in Brazil as well, that we've had, you know, in the region of Manaus, we've already have 60%, 70% plus. And so therefore nothing is going to happen over there. We're out of the woods, etc. What our work did over the last year, by going to about September, October, November, when I was talking about this stuff, what I was doing was pointing out that according to the models that we had, we were not near herd immunity. We could say that around 40 to 50% of India in the cities was infected, but maybe 30 to 40% outside in the rural areas. So on an average, maybe about 40% of India was infected with COVID-19. That's nowhere near the 60% plus that was imagined to be the herd immunity threshold. So we said that, look, what's likely to happen is that the cities may not show big outbreaks, but certainly the rest of the end is just there, many millions of people, hundreds of millions of people yet to be infected, which is why we should be careful. As more and more time wore on, and particularly for me, one turning point was the fact that we didn't see a rise of cases during the puja time. So in November, which is Diwali, puja in Bengal, the wedding season, etc. That's been a time and also the onset of winter. So that's at a time when not just myself, pretty much every epidemiologist around would have said this is a time when things are going to blow up. There are people to be infected, people are going to come into contact, they're going to disregard every sort of physical distancing, they're going to puja, you know what a puja in Calcutta is actually like, and there's no way anybody can regulate that. Therefore, this is when we're going to see a peak, and I like other people said this, but of course, I coached it differently. I said that, look, we should be wary of, or we should be careful about this, etc. We just, there's just a little blip in that data. It goes up a little bit and then comes down, but otherwise you can sort of, if you just ignore that little blip, it's pretty much downhill all the way. So that, I think, got me and other people thinking that maybe there is some truth to this. Maybe there is, maybe the Indian population is protected in some way by exactly, as Siddhartha Mukherjee pointed out, why in this number, and why was this such a large gap? A bunch of things changed in, I think, February, and they changed in ways that perhaps we should have anticipated, but I don't think one can be blamed for missing it, given what we knew at that time. The suddenly, there appeared across multiple parts of the country, various variants of the virus that were just more efficient at transmitting between people, and by just more, I mean by a factor of two or three times more than the previous version. This also is likely that any protection due to previous infection had begun to wear off by then, that the antibodies that were generated if you're infected in July or August typically have a six to eight month lifetime in your body. So by the time maybe you got to February or March, those antibodies were at a low enough level that potentially you could be reinfected. Now here is a huge question, because the immune system is not just antibodies reacting made by a prior infection. There are many different paths to it. And, you know, there's a lovely quote, I think from Ed Young, that says immunology is where intuition goes to die. And, you know, as from a scientific point of view, that's true. It's incredibly complex, the nature of the human immune response to an external invader that comes, that it encounters. So declining immunity from antibodies levels going low, new variants much more efficient to transmitting between each other and in general relaxations. I mean already, I think by the first of February, probably schools outside Bombay had begun to open in more and more of the hinterland. In schools are always where you should watch, because that's where infections move very rapidly between families. All you need is one person in a family, child gets it, goes to school and then finally everybody in the class takes it back home and that's when it spreads. And that's when, you know, it began to be noticed in first in rural Maharashtra and then moving to the cities in Maharashtra. And then you saw this incredibly sharp wave taking off of new cases there. So to come to your specific questions, I don't think we could have predicted it. We know that viruses mutate all the time. We don't know, we know most of the time that mutations don't do anything. So you can be as alert to it as possible, but you know, you can keep writing them down every time they occur, but most of the time they're actually irrelevant to this. Some specific mutations and we've only begun to understand which they are over the last three to four months turn out to be specifically important because they affect how the virus attaches to cells. It's these mutations that have happened in the Maharashtra, the 1617 variant and that's where things have taken off. But to complicate matters, there's a different variant that is responsible for cases in Punjab and Delhi. There's a different variant that is responsible for cases in the south of India and Bangalore and Telangana and there's a different variant that is responsible for the east of India, which seems to be a melting pot of multiple variants, including potentially one from Bangladesh and so on. So the situation is complicated. It could not have been anticipated. What could have been anticipated is government response. The lessons of the first wave of COVID-19 were that our health systems are potentially highly stressed. This is a time to build it up so that nothing happens in the future. Let's hope nothing happens in the future, but it's also an excuse to do something better by public health than we've done in the past, to put much more money into it than we've done in the past and also guard against future, the future consequences of a rise in cases, which we're seeing now."

        "message": "So a question before that and aside, like you mentioned schools as, you know, places where obviously they'll spread because one kid gets it, all the kids get it and then, you know, half the cities got it like that. And I was listening to Anoop Malani on an episode of the Grand Tamasha with Milan Vaishnav, the podcast, which, you know, just came out recently and Anoop was talking about the dilemma of shutting schools down that if now the government decides that, hey, let's shut the schools down, because, you know, for these valid reasons, but the cost that it has on your human capital, where kids don't go to school for a year, and the downstream effects, the unseen effects, as it were, is also going to be devastating. And these things are absolutely incalculable. And the problem is that, you know, whatever decision a policymaker is to take now, you will only see the negative effects of that you won't see the positives in terms of the things that didn't happen. So it is just such an incredibly difficult choice. Now, my question is this, that, you know, it's easy to say that, oh, 10 years ago, we could have done something about this, taken it seriously, build this infrastructure, build that, build this, it's easy to say that after the first wave, we could have, you know, built 30 more oxygen plants and blah, blah, blah. Now, when I think of a politician's incentives, the politician's incentives, given that there is limited money that they have at their behest, and that all that spending has an opportunity cost will obviously be not to ward off the low probability high impact event, which may happen 10 years in the future, but cater to the election cycle and do whatever will win them votes in the next election, which for most people is probably five years, but actually for a party, it's almost like every day because there's always an election happening somewhere or the other. So the incentives of politicians would not be at all to ward off future pandemics, even now that we know what we know, you know, we will, I think, forever have the security theater of hand sanitization and all that, even though, you know, COVID-19 doesn't even spread by surfaces, as we know. But apart from that, it's very hard to foresee, like even from the data that we have from last year, and now, as various people, including you have pointed out that possibly a lot of the data we collected last year was faulty, which is why we couldn't prepare for this well enough. But the sort of oxygen shortages that were coming up, nobody mentioned anywhere in the public domain, say in February or before that we are going to have oxygen shortages. It's something that we now realize. And we now say that, oh, we should have planned for this earlier. And oh, why didn't the Modi government do this? Or why did the Kejriwal government spend 400 crores on advertising instead of building oxygen plants, all of which are in and of themselves, of course, valid. And the response of various governments in obfuscating and trying to change the narrative is shocking and unforgivable. And I hope the citizens of this country will remember this and not forgive them for that. But it's just that in hindsight, all this seems obvious. But in the moment, your incentives are completely against it. How does one deal with this? And as a scientist who is at different levels, interfacing with the government, talking to policymakers, what is the sense you get from there? Like, are they asking that, oh, this has happened? What should we do now to make this problem go away? Or are they thinking that, hey, tell me about, could there be a second wave next year? Could there be a third wave after that? What do we do about it now? What are those mindsets like?"

And, you know, the consequences, the psychological consequences of having children out of the peer group for a year, year and more. We don't, this is incalculable. We really don't know this yet. And from what we will only see the consequences of the pandemic across multiple fronts only much later. I think if you ask me, politicians should, given what they're seeing now, it would probably be have been in the politician's best interest to have prepared three months ago for a possible event like this. I think had you said that this would happen, or this might potentially have happened, this is not the course that they might have chosen to take. So it's not clear to me with the government who is giving it advice and on what fronts. This is a government that we know is somewhat inward looking. There is a large group of IAS officers in the Prime Minister's, in the PMO, who advise it. So Prime Minister Modi seems to be taking a lot of technocrats around him and people who are, in a sense, reliant on him in many ways from whom he takes advice. It's not clear that the government system currently is geared towards taking independent advice from people outside except very informally and without even telling anybody that they actually did it. So we don't know who's supplying information. We don't know the quality of the information that is being supplied because none of this is in the public domain. We know that this is largely Delhi centered, that all of this, that any committee that you can think of that is a public health committee has seven people out of ten who are from Delhi. This makes no sense at all. And so who is saying what, at what time, what the minutes were, what the recommendations were, what are they based upon, we have no idea. So we really don't know what people were telling the government. So it's no use telling people that, look, why didn't you say this, why didn't you say that. People may have said it or not have said it, but there's no guarantee that anyone was listening to them and we don't know what the internal committees that the government formed at that time were telling them. I think the government had a difficult choice to make because economic consequences of the lockdown, of essentially shutting down large parts of the country in various ways for something like 10 months were very strong. And so this getting the economy back on track, getting people back to work must have weighed very heavily on them. And that takes money, that takes injection of physical stimulus at various points in the economy. How do you do that? And you know, it was a hard choice to make and presumably at that point they said that, look, it seems to be over, something has saved India. They thought this was said is the Prime Minister has saved India, which didn't seem quite to be true at that point, but something has saved India. We dodged a bullet. We're a good example for the world. We're not, actually, we're not a good example for the world in some ways, certainly. In other ways, certainly, yes. What I feel more is that a bunch of people around that time, after the peak, when the peak had begun to subside, were saying, let's use this experience to beef up public health in the country. We have seen what devastating consequences, both on the health front, as well as on the economic front, are of not controlling a disease that is liable to spread in the population. This is something that affects everybody, rich or poor, wherever you happen to be, north or south, east or west. Let's just strengthen, especially primary care, public health centres across the country, so that whatever happens in the future, we will be prepared for it. You could argue that much of what we are seeing is because we didn't do that little step. And that would have called for rethinking about public health, which has traditionally been not a particularly high priority in the country, in a different way, but informed by our experience of what a pandemic can actually do. Had we done that, we would have been in a better situation now. That wasn't done. Forget about the delays, and there are questions of why do the tenders go out in October, even though they should have been issued several months earlier. All of these are massive screw-ups on a bureaucratic and political scale. But even apart from all of that, I think just listening to what people were saying about the possibilities of reconfiguring our public health system in the wake, in the aftermath of the decrease in cases after the first wave, is something we should have done more seriously."

And of course, how models become better is that they are transparent and there are feedback loops and so on, and they keep improving and they're open to improvement. And the problem with whatever is happening in the PMO and in the decision making of the country is that lack of transparency. They have processes. Now, how will those processes improve if there is no transparency and we don't even know what they are? Of course, you do not judge a process always by short term results. We know that. But the point is, you should be able to see the process for what it is. And that is simply not there. Even a person like me, I'll have processes, for example, for doing my podcast. And if I mess it up, I'll have to change those processes. But it seems that the government just needs to control the narrative and not give a damn about what the reality actually is. And their processes for controlling narrative are outstanding, though in many cases, you know, just as the dysfunctional state last year had only the blunt tool of the lockdown, their narrative machine seems to have the blunt tool of calling everybody who's against Modi anti-national and filing cases. And they couldn't blame Nehru. So they tried to blame Biden for this, which is just like so completely bizarre to me. My other question is this, what is tomorrow's oxygen? And what I mean by that is that after the second wave is gone, we are never going to be in a situation where people die because of lack of oxygen, because this particular proximate problem they would have solved. It is the same way as after there was that shoe bomber on a flight, they now check everybody's shoes, right? So in the future, oxygen, I'm fairly confident won't be a problem. But the point is, oxygen is just a symptom of bad planning and not thinking hard enough about public health and whatever, you know, what is the next shortage? What is tomorrow's oxygen? Where could we go? Like, what should we be thinking of now for the future, not necessarily just a third wave. And inshallah, if enough of us get vaccinated and all that, you know, which is a whole separate screw up, but inshallah, there won't be a third wave, but future pandemics because it will be future pandemics. So you know, what are the systemic things and see, I'm using the word system again, what are the sort of systemic lessons that we need to learn so that in future we don't get into this kind of situation where people are not dying because of a disease, but because of, you know, bad governance or scarcities that need not have arisen.

Very, very smooth experience. You know, I was first checked, my documentation was checked. My number was the same. Everybody wore a mask. I was asked to, I was given the injection after everything was entered into this. I was asked to wait for half an hour to 40 minutes. There was no one around me. Wonderful experience. This was in a public health center. A friend of mine called and spoke to me a couple of days after that saying that, look, you know, I went to another one. I had a fantastic experience. I had no idea. I would normally have gone to a private hospital if I had to do anything, but the fact that this was so beautifully organized, minimally crowded, careful, this is a care that I expect in a high end private hospital, but I'm getting that in a government facility. So we can do it. I guess that's the point that I'm making that, you know, we tend, from where we come from, we tend to think of government facilities as being dirty, dingy, smelly, etc, etc. We don't want to go there, it will be crowded, it will be awful. Let's pay extra money and go to place X or Y where we can get the sort of experience that we think is a little more, is more pleasant and pleasurable because anyway, face it, no one likes to go to hospital anyway. So you don't want to add mental stress on top of that. Why can't we do this under normal circumstances? Why can't we have a public health system that is the first choice? So I've lived for some years in Singapore where you have a public health system and that's an automatic thing where you go and you go and you get treated. Everybody gets treated exactly the same way. The facilities are clean, your insurance pays for it, you're looked after well, whether you are, you know, the son of the prime minister, whether you're a common person, you know, off the street, you're entitled to the same gamut of facilities that anybody else is. I don't think you can actually, you'll just be playing whack-a-mole if you try to anticipate which virus is going to come at which point, which way, when, etc. Let's just concentrate on the basics and let's just make sure that the basics of a strong public health system across the country, let's not sort of look at cities where all of us come from. Let's just look at remote areas and until a place, a small village in Jharkhand has the same level of access as someone in Borevali or someone in Basantrihat, that I think would be a real index of where we move as a society, as a sort of larger question of equity in our society."

        "message": "I agree with you on it being an ideal end goal, almost a utopian end goal. I mean, the big question is how do we get here from there because we know what the incentives are, we know that our state is fundamentally a dysfunctional state, the few things that we ought to do well, like rule of law, public health, we don't do it all, we're completely absent, which has become more stark in this current crisis, whereas we interfere in so many things where we should not actually be present. So, I mean, but that is a whole question of political economy and possibly beyond the scope of this. Let's kind of talk about India for a moment, like Siddhartha Mukherjee's piece, of course, speculated on some of the possible plausible reasons why India escaped last year, you know, whether it's the BFG vaccines, whether it is that we have a relatively younger population and the virus targets older people. You also have made a great point about the survivorship bias, which I'll quickly spell out for my listeners, you mentioned it earlier. But the point that Gautam is effectively making there is that because of the state of our public health system and all of that, our older people tend to, you know, succumb to diseases, other diseases quicker than people in the West do. The older people who are left are actually the stronger, hardier sort of people who therefore also have a better capacity of fighting the COVID virus when it comes, which is, you know, a fascinating and very logical theory. And there was also this bizarre theory that, you know, the heat will kill the virus. Now, none of that kind of seems to apply. So, you know, is it just that they applied to the previous, to the original SARS-CoV-2, but this variant just does all these other things differently? Or is it that our understanding was flawed, we somehow got lucky? Or is it that it did actually hit us really hard, but the numbers don't show it, that the data isn't accurate?"

        "message": "My feeling is that it did actually hit us hard. And this was a nice, I was on a panel yesterday where I think Ramanan Laxminarayan pointed out that to get to about a million deaths in India, if you sort of distributed it out over all the districts of India, it's unclear that you would pick up that little fluctuation, because at the district level, given what the numbers are, an extra three to five deaths per district, etc. added up across the whole year, you would not have attracted that much attention. What you really need is understand what the background is in a good year of all of the deaths, and then check to see in the COVID year how that changed. But for that, you must have better records. Right now, at least my thinking is that it's a combination of the young population, a combination of the fact that we don't record deaths well outside, plus multiple pressures on people, families not telling society, doctors, clinical people that this is potentially a COVID patient, because there's a stigma attached to COVID in the country. So people may not want to do that. Deaths being unrecorded across much of the country is probably a large factor in this. And I think it's a combination, if you added all of these up, then we don't do it so badly, I think, I mean, our numbers are floating up towards Brazil's numbers, or towards the UK numbers, once you adjust for all that. The largest single part of this is just age. And that's certainly true. Whether how much of it extra beyond that is some biological, you know, your microbiome, prior infection, coronavirus, hygiene hypothesis, etc, etc, or BCG, or whatever it is, that remains a question mark. But I think you get to about 80% plus, just by accounting for age, and just by accounting for the undercounting of deaths."

        "message": "Fascinating. And tell me about the second wave now, like how worried should we be? What exactly is going on? I think many people are just beveled, like on Twitter, I get this constant reaction from people, which I kind of share that we are, you know, there's this new term doom scrolling, that I'll often just find myself, it's just, you know, you reach a stage of numbness. Like, you know, I wake up every morning and Gautam, honestly, for the first half an hour, I'm just writing condolences on Twitter, or, you know, take care and all of that, or get well soon and whatever. And of course, I get your point that, you know, the first wave may not have hit people in our elite circles. So hard that, you know, seroprevalence studies showed that they were much harder in the slums and Tharvi, for example, and all of that. And therefore, PLU people like us, as it were, kind of escaped it. And now we are, you know, really, it's come home, so to say, you know, how do we make sense of this? Like, this is very virulent, very infectious. What is a natural curve we should expect? Obviously, I think that things have become much worse because of bad governance and all the scarcities, like of oxygen, like people just dying because there's no oxygen is like, would have been so unthinkable and dystopian a year ago. You know, where are we going with this? Where is the peak going to come? Like, I know different models have shown, you know, middle of May, end of May, so on and so forth. What is the best case scenario and the worst case scenario for this?"

        "message": "I can tell you one major source of uncertainty. And that is to what extent are reinfections important? If reinfections are very important, then having caught it once makes no difference to getting, catching it again here. And that's very crucial because that expands the susceptible population to what it was in January of last year. It basically be back to square one. If, on the other hand, it's somewhat protective, every bit of protection that you get from a prior infection or a vaccination helps. Okay, so we don't know that at all yet. The best models now, the models, if you sort of average, as I said, in an ensemble sense or multiple model projections, that would suggest by about the middle of May is when you can expect to see a downturn. There are many reasons why you will not see it then. One reason is just testing. Already testing across the country has pretty much gone down to levels that are just not sufficient to cope with this increase in cases. In Delhi, it can take you something like two to three days or four days for someone to come to your house to test you. It can take another three days for you to get the test result. So this gap between falling sick and getting tested is becoming larger and larger and larger. The rate at which tests are going is quite slow compared to the rate at which cases are growing. Already Delhi test positivity is 35 percent plus. For a country as a whole, it's 20 percent plus. So look at the number of cases that you're missing of people who ought to be tested and people who've decided that, look, I'm not going to get tested at all because I suspect that I have it. I'm just going to lock myself up in my room and not bother to test. So you'll never get an idea of what the real number is, especially now, precisely because of these reasons. And because you're not testing enough, you will not see the eight lakhs and the ten lakhs that people have been predicting. These are the doomsday predictions that people have been making. Because you will see your testing will saturate and you will see something that appears to be coming down. God knows what's happening inside the background. So my best guess, based on the models that we have and others, is that you will see a genuine downturn around the middle of May. How will we survive until then? That is completely open to, I mean, it's very hard to imagine that's another, at least another two weeks plus from here. It may be shifted a little forward. It may be shifted a little back. Unlikely that it will go on deep into June is my feeling. It really, I would really put some money on the middle of May from what we have. We're recording on April 28th,"

        "message": "by the way, for my listeners. We're recording on April 28th, yeah. So that's about two weeks. No, and what you're saying about the gap in testing is also crazy because one way in which people are dying is that hospitals are at times refusing to admit people to their COVID ICU if they haven't tested COVID positive and they are COVID positive, but the tests aren't coming in time. So it's really death by bureaucracy as it were. Yes, exactly. Which is just a horrendous state of affairs. You know, in my show notes, I'll direct people to the other, like the panel discussion you mentioned, which I also saw and which was illuminating a bunch of different experts apart from you also giving great insights there and to all the things you've written and so on. I'll ask you now, you know, as we leave this episode to also for a moment move away from COVID and but just generally talk about, you know, for those who in the first half of this episode might have been turned on to the joy and wonder of science. In a certain sense, we live in magical times and most magical times because so much of knowledge is just opening up to us in various different fields. You know, one of the memes for my show kind of is that people, you know, people have actually posted pictures of seen and unseen bookshelves of books bought from recommendations on the show. So I'm going to ask you to recommend, you know, your favorite books, which convey some of this joy in the different areas that you're passionate about, whether it's physics or biology or modeling or maths or even music that, you know, you feel enthusiastic about"

        "message": "and would love to share with the world. A book called Spillover by David Quammen, an American writer on nature and diseases is a particularly important book because in a sense, it was very prescient. It foresaw the fact that in the next few years, we would have a what is called a spillover event from an animal virus from possibly from bats coming over to human beings and sort of examining what the long-term consequences of that were. Contagion by Adam Kucharski is another very good book and that again is the idea of how epidemics spread in non-disease contexts as well. How do pandemics of financial collapse happen and how do social rumors spread, how do gangs form and what is, so that certainly expands the way in which you think about how you, how something in very small initially is amplified into something that can transform society. The Egyptian spring, the Africans at the spring in terms of the movements that try to overthrow repressive governments was another example of a collective effect starting from small groups of people beginning to organize. That I think is really the important idea behind a lot of what I think about how and it's also very physics idea. How does collective behavior come from what are initially somewhat random behaviors of individuals that suddenly seem to build up into some sort of coherent whole. That's as true for examples in physics as it is for examples in"
