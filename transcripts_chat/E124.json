So there are these traditions that exist I mean in Indian intellectual thought also and if you were to go back you can find different ways in which they found expression at different points in time in our history. We do have these kind of strands of tradition I don't know I don't have the kind of scholarship required to say whether all of these add up to a proper tradition as such a political tradition or and the extent to which they currently inform the politics of our in our country but there is this intellectual tradition that is kind of there and there are some thinkers who have tried to offer this viewpoint. So left and right can be thought of different ways so I mean the origin of left and right is you know 1789 that French assembly where on the right were people who wanted to preserve the social order with the king at the top and dystocracy and all of that on the left of those who wanted to destroy the social order and replace it with a different kind of order. So in that sense if you were to just take that language then we do have right like there are people on the right wing who think that the social and economic order should not be shaped by the state power and there are people on the left who think that they should be and in fact some of our kind of founders I mean in terms of the people who were leading the independence movement and by the virtue of that also got an opportunity to play an outsized role in the constituent assembly have had those views right that they did build into the constitution's power of the state to intervene in the economy as well as the society. So that debate has been there and I do not know whether you have read this recent book identity and ideology which also kind of brings out this point I mean I want to give acknowledgement where it is due that this debate has been there since earlier and it is kind of in some ways playing its way out even today. What is the role of the state in the society in the economy and at that level the debate is actually very much comparable with the debate in some western countries but let us be careful here because the way I see it is that every ideology actually works as an embodiment of some you know the views of some social group in a particular context. So we you and I can discuss left and right in an abstract sense but if you go to say UK or US the left and right spectrum is currently being defined in a particular context in a particular way. There are certainly differences but the issues that they are fighting today are very different and can change over time. So I can give you an example Barry Goldwater who was in whom a lot of conservative angst in the mid 20th century in America kind of crystallized. He was this Arizona senator and firebrand leader of the conservative movement. He wrote this book called conscious of a conservative where he says that here one example he was dead against corporate funding of political parties and political election campaigns. Just a few decades later the right wing in America has the totally opposite view on this point right. So ideologies work their way in social groups over time. I am not saying that ideologies are just byproducts of social processes. I am not making that point but I am also not saying that ideologies exist independently you know of any social mooring or any social kind of you know context. So both have to be seen you know this abstract notions working their way through a particular society and social groups and contestational groups both are important. If you still look at only the abstract only the context you are missing that kind of the how ideas work through society. So I think when we say that these things do not apply to India they do. I think we have very similar kind of variations of the same themes let me put it that way."

Whereas the question I would ask is and again I am much less knowledgeable than you about this like I haven't I'm also not an expert on it. I could easily be wrong but then my question is my question slash speculation is that for example the book you referred to by Chhibber and Rahul Varma is called ideology and identity and my question then is that how much can we how much does one arise from the other how much does the former arise from the latter how much does ideology arise from identity in the sense as you yourself made the point that okay there are social contexts in which ideologies emerge now one can look back at some of these thinkers like the book you mentioned from the Gita Press which again I haven't read so I don't want to impute something but where for example one might say that okay they might be expressing conservative thoughts in terms of respecting tradition that someone like Burke may agree with but the source of that expression is say they want to preserve the caste system for example."

In fact a person himself may not realize. May not realize because they are yeah I mean you have to be careful about what they realize and how they construct their kind of ideas. So just to take the example of again Garpatri Maharaj his critique is significantly critique of materialism and the ability of human thought to understand social forces and modify them through you know the means of the state and I mean politically powerful state.

I think any tradition should certainly try to incorporate the suspicion into it because there is in especially in our traditions I do think that there is a lot of I mean practices which are preserved in the name of just preserving the tradition. So if somebody is looking at it from a suspicious perspective bringing a hermetic of suspicion and saying that hey this particular practice is just trying to preserve certain kind of privileges and all of that. We should try to be fair to that perspective because this suspicion might make us better over time. We should try to deal with it in our own kind of ways and we should debate it, talk about it. What you should not do is reject it upfront because it is true that many people who think of the word in a suspicious manner are sometimes wrong and sometimes half right but they are also quite often right and they do have a point often."

For example if something that you are talking about also has the effect of say preserving some privileges like the caste system just to use one example. Would it be better to focus on that instead of turning attention on the person and say oh he is saying it because he wants xyz to continue because I think that poisons a lot of the discourse when the focus turns to the intent of the person rather than arguing on the basis of the argument itself."

        "message": "So what do you mean by intent? So yeah I think it's not particularly useful if you get personal and say Karpatri Maharaj was making an argument to preserve this, Raja Gopalacharya was arguing for a certain kind of education system which put the kid in the household's vocation for half a day because they were trying to preserve the caste system and all that. So the individual kind of attribution of intent is I think a little tricky because it makes the conversation very difficult. But we do have to recognize the structural forces that may be at work. I use that term with a great deal of hesitation because I think structural analysis is often overrated and it pretends to have more insight than it really does. But I think there is something to that. So now if you were to kind of broaden that discussion and let's look back at the assaults that were made on religion and the most powerful assaults that have been made in other traditions, in the Western tradition specifically, the assault by Marx, assault by Nietzsche, assault by Freud for example. You read this, in fact this hermeneutics of suspicion term comes from their treatment of, so Marx made it about class interest. This is trying to preserve certain kind of class interest. There is a much more interesting critique of ideology and this religion that he makes. Then Freud makes it about much more of the subconscious forces and the psychological explanations for it. Nietzsche has a much different explanation of, a genealogical explanation for it. And all of these, if you were to think carefully and try to incorporate, they might reveal some truths about society. So I would say just take the idea, not just the consequence of the idea, but also the idea in itself and see what's in it. Because I think the consequences are where people have disagreements on, a lot of disagreements on what is the good society, what is the good state of the world. So you say that, look at the consequence, but it's not so simple to look at the consequence because there are no agreements on the consequence. The whole point of disagreement is that we disagree on what a good society"

For example, many libertarians say that if you are a multi-billionaire, you have worked, built a business or even if you inherited, it's your business and you should enjoy that privilege. Some people say that income inequality is obscene and unfair and it is disproportionate and based on past privileges and all. They may have a point there also. But the point is that these are points of substantive moral disagreements. That is where the division will happen. So it's not so simple that you look at the consequence and you will settle the debate. I don't think for example, earlier you said that if a libertarian wants to have an argument with somebody who is interested in equality, then if you can show that equality will be achieved through libertarian means. I think it's a little naive to say that there is a such easy reconcilability of these points of view. These points of view are fundamentally irreconcilable. Rawls and Nozick are not, can't be reconciled. So simply, if you were to just talk about 20th century thought, because their points of departure, what is good is very different."

Like, what we have seen in the last four or five years, and especially even going back earlier, I don't want to say only four or five years, is the framing of political differences in very Schmittian terms, you know, Carl Schmitt wrote this book called concept of the political, where he framed political differences as, you know, friends and enemies. So political opponents are your enemies. And the supremely political moment is when you realize somebody is an enemy. So that's his idea of the political. And more and more we are seeing framing of the political in this kind of a way, which I think is very inimical to this very binary way. It's binary, and it is not just binary, it's also, it has a phenomenal consequence for the way we kind of perceive the world around us. I mean, these are, I mean, very important differences, let's not underplay the importance of political differences, you know, like, you can't say that a Soviet Union person who supports the Soviet Union, a person who supports a very different system is in consequence, the difference is highly consequential, there is a lot at stake, the stakes are very high. But how do we play this very high stakes, kind of, like, I don't know, use the word game, but how do we participate in this kind of high stakes contestation, without framing this as friends versus enemies kind of situation, because then if it's the enemy, then all means are fair. And then I mean, you can't have institutions preserved, you can't have many other, you know, things that are required at the foundation to have political conversation. And unfortunately, in the last few years in India, we are seeing a lot of this framing, which is so extreme, that it is and on all sides, I would say, I mean, I don't want to say a little bit more perhaps on one side than the other. But framing is I think, if you were to I don't believe in having absolute kind of, you know, NT conditions to have a conversation, but commitment to at least having a conversation is the entry point to have that conversation, right? Because otherwise, you get into this paradox of intolerance and so on so forth."

So, for example, if you see on Twitter, a libertarian says tax is theft. Libertarians say that there's a genuine kind of, this is a line that they use. \u2013 Taxation is theft. \u2013 Taxation is theft, they say. Then and somebody else who is, thinks of morality and political ideology differently, and says things that taxation is important to not just for the public goods, also for redistribution and all, will be aghast at that and they'll see this as a provocation, right. Now, the libertarian didn't mean it as a provocation, because it's just so central to their worldview, that taxation is theft, you know, it's something that is canonical to their worldview. And somebody else thinks very differently about it. So, that's why I think the way the political ideologies in modern world are kind of taking shape, there is a great deal of difference on basic premises about what it is and that in communications. So, when we go and participate in the public sphere, it makes communication much more difficult because our premises are different. This is a point on which Alasdair MacIntyre is very good. He kind of, he has in his two books, who's just his wish rationality and after virtue, kind of tried in the, at least in the Western context, find out the roots of the kind of differences. Although we also have some of these similar kind of debates, and we do have a certain globalization of discourse that is happening over time. So, we can also see the kind of underlying differences, there's a lot to learn from this kind of analysis. But the irreconcilability is one part. But the second part is also, which he says is that the person who makes the argument makes it as if it's a no brainer. Like a person who says, of course, it's a fundamental right to privacy. There's ways that could debate about that, right. And another person will say that, hey, I may have a different view about that.

In the sense that look, how do you define theft? It's taking money by force from someone. And the thing is, I think everyone can agree that no one would contribute money to the government on their own if it was not illegal to not pay taxes. And therefore, by that definition, it is theft slash decoitry. And we would also argue that you need some because you do need a state to protect your rights or whatever, whatever.

And another sort of a question that I often for example, I've asked other guests like Shashi Tharoor and so on, and got a variety of different answers. Shashi Tharoor, Akar Patel and different people who've been on the show is that there is an argument often made, I think Dindayal Upadhyay made a version of this argument, that the Indian Constitution being liberal, though I feel it's not liberal enough in terms of protecting individual rights, but let's say it's more liberal than Indian society, that the Indian Constitution being a liberal constitution, if we granted that is actually be a liberal constitution imposed on an illiberal society to use the language of the liberals, or on a conservative society to use different language. And that imposition itself cannot be liberal. I mean, the conservative viewpoint, of course, is that look, society has to change from within, that change cannot be forced from top. And by and large, there is a lot of merit to that as far as the enforceability of change is concerned, but not necessarily the morality of change. Because two questions that then come up is one, how do you reconcile the imposition of a liberal constitution? Because if it is imposed, how can it be liberal on a society which may not be as liberal as the constitution itself? And two, what do you then do about things like say, Sati, Sati was outlawed. Now, there could be people who would argue that look, we are a society which believes in group rights, this is a tradition. And why should we protect individual rights? Because just because some liberal somewhere says that, and you know, to both of us, of course, it seems completely obvious that Sati had to be outlawed. And yeah, it's, it's a given. But how do we then reconcile that with the conservative belief that society can only change from within? And if there are exceptions to that, how do we demarcate those exceptions? And how do we enforce them without"

        "message": "that enforcing being illiberal? So, this is a very big and difficult question to answer. Because, I mean, there are 10,000 questions hidden there in that one question, but, and I don't want to answer it in a manner that I have some kind of a glib response to it, because it's not, it's not something which is can be settled based on some quick, some very simple principles, you know, it's not something very easy to settle because you do see when you say that society should reform on its own, you see certain practices that are very repugnant to most individuals and then you say, okay, why is this still kind of in place? And so, for example, taking a Sati example, there was some practice of Sati and when it was abolished, there is very little actual resistance from the society on that evolution, there was some degree of you would say, I would, I don't know enough, but I would argue there was some degree of acceptance by the society that there is a problem here. And when it was abolished at that point, if you see there was not that much resistance against that. So, sometimes you do need the state to do something which actually the society was almost on the verge or could have done it, but there was some reason social and I mean, institutional reason because of which it was not able to do it, its own internal checks and balances had broken down or it was not working well enough on that particular point. So, it's not so simple that either society should settle on its own, the state should settle, it's an issue that needs consideration, careful consideration about the situation that we find ourselves in and then what is the state can do and what the society can do. But what I do think is required in a constitutional republic that we kind of built in 1950 are some basic minimum standards, which are mostly in the form of rights that are protected by a constitutional state, which protects those rights in a manner that is predictable and it is based on rule of law, it does not discriminate, it does not do any kind of arbitrary action, those rights protect for everybody equally. That is, I think many people across political spectrum might agree with that. Where they may have a difference is on issues of religious reform using state power, issues of whether there should be a special recognition given to certain kind of groups, for example, you know. There is a, for example, reservation. Now, if suppose you did not have a reservation on day one of our kind of independence, you would have very, I mean, most of the senior government positions filled with a few social groups. Can you have that and have legitimacy in the state? It is very difficult to say that you would, right, because I mean, you need to have legitimacy, you need to have legitimacy in the representation through the democratic system of elections and all that, but also in the administrative state, you need to have some degree of legitimacy. You cannot say that only a few, I mean, people who are, who had the education early on, who had that kind of advantage should certainly dominate the Indian state. So, in the Indian context, there are two issues that make this much more complicated. One is the issue of certain communities that have kind of historical disadvantages, especially the Dalits, for example, there have been a significant disadvantage when we got independence. And then the question of majority versus minority. So, this framing that there is a Hindu majority and there are other minorities and how do you ensure that there is some kind of majoritarianism does not go to the extent of, you know, destroying the rights of minorities and, you know, doing something which is more domination of sorts, you know. So, these issues kind of problematized this framing that you should have just simple equal rights for everybody and protected by the state. So, then you had to do more of, you know, recognition through reservations and other things. And you had to have a politics when you can argue that. So, I am arguing one side of it, where there is a recognition that you need to give a certain degree of comfort to speak politically to different groups who might otherwise feel like they are probably at the risk of being marginalized. In that, the main instrument through which this can be done is state power. So, state power is required to do these things. And the question that I have and I think it requires more thinking and more walking around is that how do we ensure that this happens in a rule of law manner and not in arbitrary manner that the founding happened and after that, we have in many ways diluted some of the rights. For example, the freedom of speech in India has had a really rough time to kind of put it mildly and many other rights have had a tough time over time. And it has been done in the name of these things only like the state has said, okay, we want to I want to preserve certain social order, but to be able to do that, some of the rights have to be, you know, compromised. In fact, original cases for I mean, in the pre-independence time, there were some communal riots and all because somebody published a book which was derogatory of one particular religions, sentiments and sort of so on and so forth. So, there has been this kind of tension in Indian politics. And Indian constitutional thought has also kind of been affected by this tension that how do you have a state which is actually kind of legitimized by democratic politics where you have this couple of problems with this kind of some communities which are significantly disadvantaged historically and some which in the because of their religious identity may going forward be at a risk and it is not an easy question to answer. And it requires I mean, constant thinking and rethinking so that the society actually can deal with these issues in a manner that nobody is at significant disadvantage. And the legitimacy is not just of 60 70% majority, it is a wide based and if nation becomes habitable for everybody, that is the kind of objective that we need to have, but it has to be worked politically. So, I think when you say democracy and you say okay, such and such rights should be there or some special recognition should be there for some groups, then it has to happen through at least some measure of democratic agreement. Now, then it gets into the issue of majoritarianism or the potentiality. I am not saying that the majority is more of a threat that it may not actualize, but there is a potentiality that can happen and that depends on the kind of politics that we have and the kind of persuasion that is done. Because beyond a point, suppose you have some specific provisions in law or constitution which are not in line with what vast majority people think and they have not been persuaded to think otherwise, then you have a tension which can blow up in many ways. So, politically because you also have the instruments of that kind of blowback right, because you have everybody in equal votes and there is an election and over time certain certain kind of resentment can crystallize in the form of support for some leaders or some parties or some kind of ideologies. And so, there is no alternative to continuous conversation and persuasion on these issues. What I do not think is particularly helpful is if you have people who think that they can go to a court and settle these kind of questions and not have some kind of a mobilization around it, some kind of a person attempt to persuade more and more people and speak to their better senses. Because when you do establish democracy, you have immediately on that day in some ways, in a very basic political equality was established that everybody is equal, everybody has one vote, everybody is a citizen. It is a very important event in itself. And that event has its own consequences. You know, it is not for the state to just look at the society and engineer it in this direction, that direction, that is also partially important. But let us look at the force of democracy itself. Like you say, okay, there is inequality, there is issues of majority minority and all of that. But when democracy says that everybody is equal and everybody is one vote, that itself has a certain kind of force and power in society. I do not know whether you have read Tocqueville and his democracy in America and how he describes democracy as a generative, you know, force, so to speak, that it has a certain kind of power of its own. I mean, it is not it works in a mild ways. It is not like the state which uses its kind of power and coercion. It has other ways that also needs to work. So, I think we need to have both of these tracks running where there is a certain politics and level of mobilization around certain ideas of equality and liberty. And you have a state where the executive and also the sometimes judiciary is intervening to correct specific kind of problems. But there is no shortcut to kind of just sidestepping the need for mobilization and persuasion."

But just thinking aloud from the first part of what you were talking about, it seems to me that as a libertarian, there are two different clashes of ideas which worry me and which I cannot reconcile. One, of course, is like what you said, constitutionalism. And one of the basic purposes of a constitution is to a place a limit on state power and b protect individual rights, which is exactly my position. That's what the constitution should do. But then I look at society and the thing is that is society ready for that? Because leave aside the ancient example of Sati. If you just look at modern India today, you'll see that there are Khab Panchayats and you'll see that there are honor killings. And you'll see that society is still divided along these lines and that that division is enforced by non state authorities and traditions and so on. And the thing is that the fundamental on irreconcilable difference there is again between individual rights, which I believe in, and in many cases, group rights, which some of these people would believe in where a Khab Panchayat would think of the quote unquote interest of the group over that of the individual or how they define the interest of the group. That's one conflict and I don't have an easy answer for it. And the second sort of conflict that comes to my mind is one between the constitution protecting individual rights, and between the constitution trying to redesign society to transform society as it were, and the second involves infringing individual rights, usually in some way or the other. And here again, it becomes a question of group rights being given precedence over individual rights, except where in my first example with Khab Panchayats and honor killings, it's really the right which I'm fighting against. And in this case, it's really the left I'm fighting against, which doesn't understand the futility of social engineering and the kind of unintended consequences it can lead to. And the divisions that can be festered by privileging group rights and thinking in terms of groups over individuals. I know it sounds like"

We are all kind of thinking and these are not easy issues to deal with. But let's take them one by one in my, I'm just kind of trying to reflect in my own limited understanding of these things that so go back to the history of legal systems. So, before this kind of modern state came along, and the legislature makes the laws and executive, I mean, implements them and the judiciary then kind of give, looks at specific cases, where there's a violation of a law and kind of meets out punishments and so on and so forth. And also looks at laws that are unconstitutional and strikes them down to some degree of judicial review and all of that. So, that's the modern, it's built on some, I mean, some version of legal positivism. There's some thinking that law is basically what humans make of it, you know, in some sense. And there's an assumption that some people come together, ideally elected and enjoying legitimacy of electoral victories and make those laws. And they can, so today, for example, you have something which is illegal. Tomorrow, the parliament can pass a law and make that legal. Right. And then when it's illegal, you have systems to enforce it and change it and so on and so forth. And if it's legal, you can do it. Before this system came along, we had more traditional law. And not just India, every society had had this kind of law and they were, of course, it was a mixed system. There also, there were some aspects of law that were some high kind of council could sit and change. But most of the laws were just evolved over time. It was not like this some council can sit one day and change it. For example, Catholic religion has had reforms, right. The Vatican too sat down and made some changes, for example, very significantly they made the nuns, sisters equal to the laity, you know, they said they do not have any special place there in that sense in the church. So, they could make such changes, but most of the laws were evolved over time. And they were enforced through social, you know, means of partly nudging and partly coercing. And I would not say honor killing is something which is an example of that. But a Khaab Panchayat is in a sense. So, Khaab Panchayat, there's a lot of things, frankly. And not all of that is something which comes out because it's just mutually acceptable to different parties. You know, they are community based systems of conflict resolution, and they have been there for a very long time. They are still here. The tension here is this. So, let me just kind of complete this particular thought about contrast between traditional law and legal positivism is that over time as legal positivism and this modern state has taken over, it has obviously crowded out traditional ways of making and implementing laws and it has made it difficult for societies to organize themselves around their own traditional laws and their own ways of enforcing those laws. Because, you know, you can have only one sheriff in town, so the state says that I am that and you can't do much. They tolerate a lot of it. So, when Khaab Panchayat do small stuff around property disputes and where there is somebody who claims and they can, as the community comes around and say, okay, this is, this person is right and the person accepts it and goes along, it's fine. 99% of the stuff you never hear of. But one person when it does come out, then you can see this conflict between the state and traditional law and traditional systems of enforcing those laws. So, there is this tension that has happened that it is, I mean, I do not know whether it is desirable, but certainly we are not there and that all the law is only made by the state or everything that is called law, law, I mean, the broadly sense on norms on all kind of distinguishable difference about is allowed and disallowed is only made by the state and only enforced by the state. And the early system was the only made by the society, so to speak, more or less. And there was, of course, this notion of a monarch or some kind of a state, which was when playing a part of that was a part of the system, it was not external to it. This modern state is external to it, it is separate and it is claiming the space that the society had. So, this creates these tensions that the society is not completely changed and become that evolved to become compliant with the state as such. It is always contested space. And when something like honor killing happens, it is a no brainer, right? Basic thing is you do not need to kill somebody like that. But most of the situations are not like that. There is much more subtle kind of coercion and subtle kind of nudges here and there, where it is not so obvious whether it should be in the social system of norm setting and enforcing or should the state do it. So, there are some no brainer examples that you just mentioned, but most of the cases are not like that. But the way you think, the way I think about it is that there are some basic kind of rights and protections that the constitution has given. There are laws that have been made in the constitution. As long as there is no conflict between the two, there is no problem. Society cannot kill somebody or put somebody in a communal jail or something like that. Those things are not."

And Hayek makes this very interesting distinction between law and legislation, where he defines law as what would basically be defined as common law, the way it emerged, where basically the state's job there is to codify the laws that already exist in society. For example, it is a social norm that you cannot steal from someone, that you cannot kill someone, that you cannot force someone to do something. And these become codified as laws by the state, which is a function of the state, according to Hayek. And his point is that this is the legitimate function. Laws are often in Hayek's words, confused with what he terms legislation, which is the quote unquote laws that states create to rule over others. For example, you could say that, you know, a business needing 37 licenses to open up is really legislation, not a law. And this is the state misusing its monopoly on power, monopoly on violence for this. And Hayek's warning, therefore, is that a state will always stand the people who are in a state after all human beings subject to the normal incentives and the state will always stand to increase its power by increasing such legislation on its own behalf or on the behalf of interest groups, which fund the parties which get to power. And that leads to a reduction of freedom. And it's important for alert citizens to distinguish between law and legislation.

So, if you look at the issues of in the mobilization of religious conservatives in America, it was a part of the conservative industrial movement in America since the mid 20th century. And it found its crystallization in the form of different individuals and different kind of ideologies and so on and so forth. But the way it is kind of mobilized around the issue of say abortion, like it was a part of traditional law to so to speak that, you know, in their kind of religious tradition, this sanctity of life from inception, so to speak. And now it has become a part of the political discourse, because state has said that there is some it has a view on it. And I'm just giving you a comparative example. And there's one side of it, which has focused on women's rights and their sovereignty over their own bodies and so forth. And the religious conservatives, mainly and there are some other allies there also say that, no, we should not and there is a sanctity of life and so forth. Recently, they have passed some law in one of the states where abortion is six weeks is illegal and so on and so forth. So, they are then attempted by society to now capture and try to intervene in this and say that this is just one specific example. No, it's a great example. But it can happen at a large scale also, that the whole nature of the state might be transformed over time in a to a reactionary movement. And there's a dialectic at work here, which we have to be mindful of. And there's always a balance to be struck between trying to reform somebody while telling them that they are equal citizens and they have equal powers as everybody else. And also tolerating some things which may not be totally repugnant and may be allowed for some time to change on their own. So, I don't think there's a simple answer to this question."

But they do have some of this ability to, if there's a tension in society, I recommend this book by Harry Jaffa, Crisis of the House Divided, which is between the Lincoln-Douglas debates, he's analyzing through the prism of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution, but mostly the Declaration of Independence, about how the Lincoln's stance in that was revealing of the nature of American Republic, you know, and you can't have a house that is divided around something as basic as that. So, as something like slavery, for example, so he could tip the balance in the right direction. There was tension, I'm not saying that society was totally pro-slavery, and he could just turn that around, that is very difficult to do by one person in one lifetime or even some few years. But if there is tension, somebody can, through the charisma and through the ability to move people, change the way they look at things, also conflict, when he went to war, right, he went to civil war, hundreds of thousands of Americans laid down their lives to overthrow the, I mean to change, abolish slavery in some ways.

And you could say, again, this is the result of a statesman driving change in a manner of speaking, because it was really Nehru's vision that stood out over those of others in his party who had slightly different visions. But for what it's worth, we are a secular state, and thank goodness for that, because that in a sense, to me, is something that gives space for diversity to flourish. But a there's been pushback against that in terms of how secular it really is. I mean, one of the like I had an episode on Hindutva with Akhar Patel. And one of the contradictions I asked him about is that earlier the BJP used to accuse the Congress of not being truly secular, but pandering to the minorities and doing what it called pseudo secularism. But then when they use the phrase pseudo secular, you assume that they have a problem with it, because it is pseudo. But they also have a problem with secularism, which kind of baffles me. But to cut a rambling question short, I think that the role of religion in society and in politics is something you've kind of thought a lot about. Tell me how this sort of fault line has evolved in the last 70 years. And where are we today?"

But my inquiry is not so much in my thinking and reading has not been about role of religion in politics as such, but more about religion in modern society and kind of what kinds of role it can play and what are the ways in which it might transform, it is transforming and what are the new forms that it is taking more of that. And part of it is, of course, to do with the politics of religion. And in some ways, what people call religion of politics. Also, I don't know whether this philosopher Eric Vogelin has his book called political religions in which he argues somewhat persuasively, but really is that in modern ideologies are the new religions. I mean, he was he has been criticized significantly. It's not a settled position, you know. What's your position? So, yeah, so the political ideologies do have some kind of appease to our kind of need for community, need for meaning and all which earlier religions did have fulfilled. So, there is something to that. Parts of religion do, politics does, political kind of movements and part of political ideologies do work, I mean, in some ways like religion, but they are not religion, they are different category. You know, all authority is not the same, you know, like religious authority is very different from political authority. So, and what you seek in religion is very different. When people see different things in religion, there's not one thing, but all those things put together are not the same as what you see through politics. So, there are different categories, but there is, I mean, they do appeal in some ways to our similar kind of desires. So, there are variations of that. So, I'm still thinking about how to put it. Now, the other part, which is the politics of religion, right, about where we are. So, the view that was taken in Indian constitution is not of American style separation of church and state, that we don't have. In fact, very few countries in the world have that kind of separation of church and state. Which is a classic traditional meaning of secular, right? No, so, this is very rare actually to see total separation of church and state. Okay. For example, Sweden until year 2000 had the state subsidized church. So, it is a very secular society, but until just 19 years ago, they had a state subsidized church, Lutheran Church. So, Europe doesn't have that. I mean, it has gone through many stages and it doesn't have that, it has a fairly, I mean, in effect, it has a very secular state. But in at least de jure, there's a lot more of, you know, religious, religion in politics and politics and religion are intertwined. So, in our stance, as one thinker on this has written is more of a principle distance, that we will keep a distance from religion, but we will make principle interventions. So, on things like some issues of rights and things of temple entry, marriage and some specific issues on which we will intervene and make change, try to reform religion, but we will otherwise keep a principle distance. So, there has been that and it's been mostly, I mean, looking at Hinduism as a religion, much more, obviously, because of the nature of the founding and all of that, they have looked at Hinduism more from the point of view of reform by state intervention. So, other religions have had and Hinduism, they have defined very broadly, it's not just Hindus, Buddhists and Jains and all sorts of the constitutions defined including that. So, that has been, that was the founding moment and over time, it has led to many laws and judicial cases and all of that which have kind of built on that most recently being the Sabarimala case, all of that. So, over time it has happened and there has been a basic argument is that we have some minimum standards as a constitutional republic over rights and in certain situations we can, so they built this essential practice doctrine. They said unless it's an essential practice, we can intervene and change that in the name of consistency with the constitutional principles, so to speak. I am not a lawyer, so I am talking about it loosely, but they built that doctrine and they built other kind of jurisprudence around it, the courts did. And so, that has been a long journey and it is still continuing as we saw in Sabarimala and all that. And so, there is a view that politics has a role in what religion should be and this is politics, right, the state is a political being. And I think it has many, many kind of consequences. We do not know what those consequences specifically are, but it will certainly has some consequences about the interest that religion takes into the state then, right. Because if you say that, okay, the religion can be changed by state power, then people who are mobilizing around religious identities and religious kind of themes will say that now we have a greater incentive to come and take power and make sure that those interventions are minimized or something like that. There is a politics of that, I mean, it has to be fought and there is a contest there. It is not something which is settled and it will go in one way or the other. But if you look at it broadly around the world, what has happened is that in Western Europe, religion has, Western Europe, Northern Europe, religions have declined very substantially. Secularization is a process that they call. China, it is hard to say because the state is an atheist state. So, if you do surveys, you do not ever get a word value service as 3% Chinese say they are religious, but in practice, they may be more. So, we do not know what it is. But for the rest of the world, there is considerable amount of religiosity, I mean, it varies a lot across the world and US is an exception, for example. US has among advanced countries, you will see less religion generally, but US has more religiosity reducing slowly, but has much more religiosity. But wherever there is a great deal of religious religiosity, this quotation is much greater because this kind of question of the legal system versus the religious law and religious practices is much greater. India is one of those. So, if you look at the surveys of India, India is one of the most religious societies in the world. Like if you look at the comparable across the world where they look at the same question across countries, more than 90% Indians say that religion is important to their identity. So, it becomes much more important in our context because we have not, and it has increased over time. So, religiosity has increased over"

So, if I were to look at, so I some time ago did a review of literature on secularization, political science, sociology and historic history. I mean, these are different methods through which people have studied it. So, there are different reasons why they explain, I mean, they explain away how secularization happens and why religion declines and all of that. Most of these accounts are kind of one or two variable accounts simplistic. So, but there is some explanatory power in them. So, for example, one of the leading political science books on this is Sacred and the Secular by Pepper Norris and Ronald Englehart. And their main thing is that, their thesis is that the secure societies, people who feel more secure, they do not, they face less risk. I mean, there are different type of risks that they differentiate, the egotropic risk, which is to yourself and your family and sociotropic risks, which are to the community. If they face more of those risks, then you are likely to be more religious. If you feel less of this risk, which is the case mostly in advanced countries, you face less of this religiosity. So, you see increase in religiosity in US after 9-11, because the community was at risk, so to speak. Then there is someone, other theorists like sociologist Rodney Stark and his kind of associates have written up about how religion, which thrives on competition, the multiple religions in the same society, then you have more chances of religiosity rising because you are always reminded of the difference and there is an incentive for organized religion to put itself out there and keep its flock. So, I am just trying to look at the different possibilities. Then if you look at some recent book I read on secularization in UK, Britain, then Callum Brown is a historian who wrote his body of work on secularization in British society. He is one of the, some interesting account he has written, but his central point is the increased participation of women in workforce. So, he says that women played a very central role in religious life of the British society, which kind of organizing, being the more, the organizing person in the family to make sure everybody is going to church and all of that and being\u2026"

And he says that as in the 60s, there was a big increase in female work level for participation and this he calls de-pietization of femininity. It's a term that he is kind of praise that he has created. And that led, there was a significant factor in secularization of the British society. Then there are other books, I mean, there are Steve Bruce and David Martin, their books on how if there are some societies in which there is a need for cultural defense. So, for example, the Irish nationalism and Catholicism are very intertwined, because Irish nationality is very much built on the Catholic identity. So, there also, until they are under siege, right, there is a nationalist movement to separate and all of that. So, that feeds religion. The different ways in which people have described why religions rise or fall in societies. And I feel many of these factors in India are quite true. I mean, if I were to just think about it in a very simplistic way, social science doesn't work that way. But I am a student, I am not an expert on these issues. But I mean, our female labor for participation has fallen significantly over the last 10 years. We are a very insecure society, there's a lot of poverty, a lot of egotropic and sociotropic risks. We as a people are often kind of feel that we are under threat from both sides of our borders. Then if you were to kind of go beyond these political science and sociological accounts and get into the philosophical argument about change in the social imaginary, about how non-religion or atheism becomes a viable option, there's a journey that societies go through, which in the West they went through, for example, Charles Taylor is very insightful on this. He wrote a book called Secular Age, which is, I think, the most insightful account on this that I have read about how the philosophical ideas shifted over time. The key event, he says, is the Protestant Reformation that kind of happened, which changed the nature of religious practice in some of these societies. And that, I mean, there's a very interesting, it's a long and very detailed account. And the way people construct meaning, so to speak, I mean, the unstated assumptions and presumptions that shape our kind of understanding, which is he calls a social imaginary, has changed that. And the way he defines secular age is basically an age where belief and non-belief are both options for you to exercise. In India, I think for most people, that's not true as of now. For some people, it is true, like people like you and me are actually living in a secular age, so to speak, you know, because non-belief is very much an option. We know, we have friends who live without faith and live fairly, I mean, at least from the distance looks like reasonably good lives. I mean, it's not, seems like they are lacking anything substantial or faith is not even a factor for them, for some of them. But for a vast majority, I don't think that is yet the case. Because when they still are embedded in the social and kind of cosmic kind of systems in which their imaginary is placed, and there is variation of that. So, it's not every person who practices religion practices the same way. Right? There are a lot of variations of the way people practice religion in India. But some people prefer this experiential mode of you know, they give more importance to meditation and all of those kind of things. And some are much more in the bhakti mode and much more of the entanglement with the deity and kind of, you know, that is what important some are much more infused with narratives of historical identity much more. Some are much more doctrinal, they actually so most of us are just hearing the Vedas, they actually understand what's in there, you know, what are most of us just sound. So, there are different variations, but how do you go from there to a society where it's just an alternative and then you can shift, you know, we can be ups and downs and all of that. But for many, many communities in India, it's not such an obvious option, you know, it's not that you just move to non belief and you can still find a lot of order like if you go to my village, I have my host of a family lives in my village. It's just religion orders your life in many ways, you know, the whole year is ordered around events that are actually in some ways, a part of the religious calendar, so to speak, social and religious are the same, so to speak. And your own life is also ordered, there is this sanskar that you go through all of that. So, then to just move away from that into a different kind of life is not such an obvious option, it may happen over time. And it may happen very rapidly also, who knows, you know, urbanization is happening, many things are happening, and forming transformations are happening. So, if you go to a Swadhyay movement, meeting in say rural Gujarat that I have attended earlier years ago, they are much more interested in discussing, talking about the Gita and discussing the message of Gita and all of that. They take religion very differently from say the art of living, you know, which is much more of a self-help type of kind of transformation of religion. How this transformation will transform the way religion looks in India is very different, very, very difficult to say. And these are the things, the questions worth"

And the thought that kind of strikes me when we talk about people being religion, to what extent is religion just a happenstance peg along which they place their tribal allegiances, that is everybody wants to belong, you want to belong to a community of people and have that sense of belonging and this is my home and these are my people. And to what extent is religion merely a peg for that, not involving true religious belief and again, I'm thinking aloud and not\u2026"

But I think it's much more interesting the way we, you know, the modes of knowledge that we kind of use. So, I can recommend another book to you, this Paul Wain who is a teacher at the College of France has this book called, Did the Greeks Believe in Their Myths? You know, in which he tries to show how different modes of knowledge and imagination shape different aspects of our lives. And these contradictions, which from outside look like contradictions for the person who is holding this, what is called the constitutive imagination are actually not contradictions. They are just different modes in which you operate. So, he gives an example of a Coptic Christian in Ethiopia, who believes that the leopard is Christian and therefore will not eat meat during Lent, but he still keeps his cattle protected during Lent. So, he believes that, but he also, so one of it is this religious truth that he believes in, his experience of having leopards eating or killing them. So, there are different modes and they both operate differently in life. Human beings are not this kind of internally consistent, single value beings. So, there we often have contradictions that we, which appear to be contradictions from outside, but there is a certain amount of coherence that one feels. The feeling of life is very different from its perception from the outside. So, and anybody who claims that there is a perfect consistency over everything they do, I mean, if you look closely, you will find that there is a lot of like, Wittgenstein used to say that, if you want to figure out if somebody is religious, don't ask them, observe them. So, sometimes people actually without knowing do things that are quite religious. But your point would be that it doesn't necessarily mean that"

It could be replaced by some other belief system or narrative. What it will be replaced by. There are parts of, for example, the explanations of why World War Two happened and the Holocaust happened, which go into this question about decline of religion led to this gap in which Nazis and other fascism and different ideologies, even communism, could take their place and the worst monster of 20th century, people like Stalin, Hitler and Pol Pot are non-religious and they could take this place. And so there are these, I don't know whether there's much validity to this account, but there are very serious people who have made these kind of accounts. So it's possible that religions may decline and something very bad could take their place. It is also possible that religion may continue and may actually, that may not be a good thing because it may take a form that we don't, that doesn't lead to the outcomes that are good. But because it's ultimately a question of counterfactual, right? Like what could exist? We can't really answer that. We participate in this world with very limited knowledge and on a very specific situation, we are able to bring all our worldviews and say, take a, with great difficulty take a view. How do I then answer this big question about whether decline religion will be a good or a bad thing? I can't, I mean, we can just hope that whatever happens will be good and we should try to make the best out of it. On the second question, this is interesting because as you know, and we discussed earlier that religiosity has increased in India, at least in some areas. Is it a problem? Is increasing religiosity in India a problem? No, I don't think it's a problem in and of itself. Okay. It could become a problem. It could become a problem in some ways. It could become a problem if it's just religiosity is used in a way that leads to problems for some communities and all of that."

So, there are potentialities within the religious worldview or world views that can lead to such things also. And there are potentialities that lead to great acts and deeds. So, I mean, Mahatma Gandhi was deeply influenced by religious thought. I mean, the idea of incisive, the core of Jain thought. So, he was inspired. So, there are many good things that have come out of it. So, we can't talk about these things in a deterministic way.

And then there is this whole thing where they organize this event and they have a group of people who go sneak in in the dead of night and they plant an idol of Lord Ram in the mosque in Ayodhya. And the issue festers from then on until the current year is very interesting, because then you realize that a lot of the Congress were in a sense sympathetic towards these forces, including the Chief Minister, I think it was Govind Ballapant at that time, who was a protege of Sardar Patel. And one of the people who was inactive and did nothing at that time to stop this happening was Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was Home Minister of UP. Despite, you know, Nehru's furious missives to all of these people saying do something, this can't go on, solve this issue and none of them really bothered, which makes Nehru seem like, you know, a statesman who's all on his own and the currents in the party are against him. But then Sardar Patel dies and Nehru establish himself as completely in charge. But that whole Ayodhya issue, sort of you could say, in a sense was born out of a political compulsion for a party to establish its USP and positioning, you know, and got new life perhaps in the early 90s, late 80s, early 90s for that very reason when the BJP which got I think only about three or four seats in the 84 elections needed to sort of find a way to get back into public consciousness and use the Ayodhya issue.

I mean, how do you know what like, for one person, it may be actually about religion, it is faith and for another person, it may be an opportunity to mobilize and all that. But one interesting thing is that this such kind of continuity of these issues, right, for example, we talked earlier about Karapatri Maharaj, he was one of those people who were instrumental, he started the Ram Rajya Parshad and all, which started these issues in some ways, very one of the initial kind of mobilizers around this issue of Ayodhya, Kashi, Mathura, then this issue of I mean, Hindu code, basically the uniform civil code, which became that issue later. This is the issue of inclusion of tribals into the Hindu kind of fold. So you take their practices and apply Hindu metaphysics to that and say you're Hindus. So these issues have kind of been the same for such a long time, right? There is such persistence to them is quite remarkable, I think, because it's been a small number of issues have been the center of mobilization for a very long time, almost 50-60 years now, longer than that. So there is a, in Ayodhya, the issue is of course, because it's one of those things that all over the world you see that place of religious significance, a conflict around that is very difficult to resolve. There is a mosque, which is a place of religious significance. Some people argue that, hey, it's not so important, it was just another mosque, it's not so central as it is to Hindus, who because it's a place where Lord Ram was born. So it is much more important to them. But as you know, in religions, the importance and of a particular spot is only people who practice that religion can say so it's very difficult to actually for somebody from outside that, you know, say that, hey, you give up this land or somebody else to say that is not so important for you, it depends on them. So, therefore, there is a really difficult situation if it were some other kind of property dispute, then it would have been much easier to resolve. So, if you were to just wear your constitutional lens, you would say that this is a property dispute, you just look at the property rights and settle them. That's one way but it seems that the Allahabad High Court and also now the Supreme Court has said that that way is not going to work. I don't know why they did that, because it is possible that they just look at that and then let the chips fall where they may, who knows where it's going to go, but they have decided to not wear that hat and they want to find some conciliation. But conciliation is very hard on these issues because it's not so much just about that particular spot. It's there is a larger politics around it, right? Like, you can make compromises, but sometimes the compromises may lead to consequences which are not acceptable to you. Now, what are the, see, and even if it leads to consequences that are not acceptable to you, you still have to make compromises, you know, because compromise is good for politics, right? Because it leads to peace and it can lead to harmony, you know, if there is conflict, you can diffuse it, you can find opportunity to find, to promote peace in society and fraternity can grow and all of that. But there is also a counter view that if you compromise, you might be accentuating certain tendencies, which may go further. So, this is the, you know, argument about a slippery slope that where is this going to go. So, one risk, for example, from the point of view of say, the Muslim community, so to speak, is that there is the chance that this might, if they compromise on this, they can be a larger, you know, mobilization around such issues, and it might change the nature of the Indian state, you know. And if there is some confidence building that or some measures that build trust to say that that is not going to happen, then you could find compromise around the issue. So, it's not so much about that particular spot that is, I mean, that there is something to that, of course, it's a sacred spot. But also what the larger politics of religion around that, and what kind of regime will it lead to? I mean, if such compromises are made, does it lead to a better regime or a worse regime from the point of view of a specific community and also for the point of view of common good for all of us? That's the important question. And that question is a political question. That's a question that has to be answered by all of us and also people who are involved in mobilizing around it to create this trust that this is not going to lead to further, you know, and it's not going to lead to domination by one side or the other. And I don't know whether that is happening enough."

They may be much more, much more boring than the demons that you describe them to be, but you project onto them, then it becomes a war of community against community. And that I think is a disaster for our democracy because I don't see, we don't have the, I mean, we don't have resources to overcome that because it is not so obvious that we have any, you know, sources of order that we can go to, which once this process starts playing out, which can then intervene and kind of make things better before a lot of harm is done.

There's been a lot of, I mean, like Ambedkar's book on partition, where he makes a list of riots and this and that, and other activities, other things that we can keep thinking about and keep becoming slaves to, you know, the past is the worst kind of tyranny because you can't change it.

So let me sort of end the episode by assuring my listeners that even though I'm one of the three and a half libertarians in this country, and I probably disagree with all of you, I don't think of the world in Schmittian terms, you are all my friends, as indeed is Suyash.

You need to pick the right beans, blend them in the right proportion, roast them to perfection and slow brew at the right temperature to get the perfect cup, which is exactly like great conversations as well. You need to track down the most interesting minds, get them into their zone and settle down for an unhurried, unscripted chat. And coffee for me is always, always, always best enjoyed with friends. I'm Karthik Nagarajan and do share my table as I meet some of the most interesting people I know and sit them down for a strong cup of coffee and an even stronger conversation. Join me every Wednesday for a freshly brewed episode. This is not Frappe. This is the Filter Coffee Podcast. This is the Filter Coffee Podcast."
