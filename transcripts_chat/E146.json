Our free speech laws are a great example of this. Section 295A, 153A and 124A are all throwbacks from the British Empire which framed the Indian Penal Code to keep us natives under their control. And yet, even after independence, even 72 years after independence, we are still oppressed by largely the same set of laws designed to keep us in check. Section 124A, the law against sedition, is a great example of this. It is natural for an oppressive autocratic state to have a law such as this. But why must a responsive democracy have a sedition law? It's actually the duty of citizens to constantly point out the flaws in our government, to speak truth to power. We live in times where those in power actually speak of strengthening the sedition law, where it is used to harass dissenters and to have a chilling effect on would-be dissenters. To speak up against this is our duty. Is it also criminal?"

And she connected me with Mansi, who's a commissioning editor at Penguin. And she sort of did an inception on me. She told me I should pick a topic to write on. And I gave her five options. She said, you should write on sedition. I said, Oh, should I? She said, yes, you should write on sedition. Now you pitch the idea to us. So then I thought about how to go about it.

And in fact, when I started writing this book, that's when I started looking at this more seriously. And I realized there's a lot which went behind, let's say the Indian Penal Code itself. So by while I was writing about sedition, I realized it's very important to write about the Penal Code first, because you will not understand the context of this section 124 a which provides for the offense of sedition, unless you actually understand how the Indian Penal Code came about to be. And then when I started reading, to be very honest, I learned while I was researching, I did not know these things before I started writing the book. So I was educating myself and writing at the same time. And so when I was reading that, then I realized that the laws which were in place before my college draft court came in before the East India Company took complete control of Indian courts and everything. The laws were indigenous, there was no structure. They were Hindus laws, they were Mohammedan laws for criminal prosecutions, they use Mohammedan laws just modified a little bit to suit the Hindu subjects. So criminal laws, mostly Mohammedan and civil laws, mostly Hindu. So that the term code, which that Indian Penal Code, the term code is sort of a misnomer here. Code usually is a compilation of existing laws. It's like a compendium of laws. But there was no such law in India, there was no such compilation to be done in India. But so calling it a code as such is a misnomer. But if you consider India's past, as in that most of our laws are borrowed from the English common law system. And in that sense, yes, because it was part of the British Empire. So it was a code of laws, which were derived somewhat from the British Empire and then somewhat from indigenous laws. But in the true sense, it's not a code. So these are things which I actually learned when I was reading about how to pitch the book."

But your research kind of went a lot deeper than that. So what was that process like?

I was constrained as far as time's concerned. And so I had to budget my time accordingly. So the resource that I use the most was archives that were achieved, which has absolutely everything in the world, you just need to know how to find it. So when I was researching, like you said, it's a rabbit hole. And that was the past I most enjoyed of the entire process. That was the part I most enjoyed. Going down that rabbit hole was very, very enjoyable, because you go to the most recent source, then you trace back to the source preceding that, then you trace back to that, beyond that, and then you suddenly realize that you're reading books from the 19th century, or the 18th century. And I've read texts from the 13th century and the 14th century in English, which I could barely understand. And that's when you realize that to write a book where people don't point fingers at you, you have to go to the origin. You can't rely on most recent history because history is colored by politics. History is colored by a person's bias. So you have to go to the source, the farthest you can go, you have to go there."

I need to show them that yes, I'm a researcher for something. Otherwise, I can't go there. Why can't I go there? Why can't people like you and me go just walk in and learn? Because to be honest, the internet is a great resource and archives is an absolutely wonderful resource. And I so in fact, I while I was reading it, I felt so bad about using it so much that I actually started donating to it. And we have to do that. Otherwise, we won't get those resources. And even though it's a huge resource, still archives have certain things which you will not find in public, like the original draft penal code. When I was started writing the book, it took me four months to actually find it. And that to online. I don't know whether it's in some library or not. But all the people I talked to and I told them I have the original, I have the draft penal code of Macaulay's code of 1933 and 1937. And they said, How did you get it? People don't know it. People haven't read what's written there. They haven't seen his notes. And there are things like we know that Macaulay drafted it. But there's another person called Bethune, who also came up with a draft code. He hated Macaulay. He said, I want to do my own thing. And he paced this draft code to the East India Company, to the government then and he said, my code is better, but it was very conservative and very, the punishments were very draconian. So they eventually junked it. So before writing it, I did not know that such a draft code existed. Why don't we know this? Because we're not allowed to go into those places to learn about it. So we need open access, like archives helps, but we need open access to our libraries, all these archives. We do otherwise, it's not going to work. People are today, especially in today when people unlearn the history from WhatsApp and from social media, they need to go to these places to verify themselves.

So they got their own militia, let's call them the militia, they are not like really British soldiers, they're militia, private mercenaries. So they got them, they set up these forts, and they set up their own communities. But the trouble was that there was life beyond these communities also, they would try life beyond these four walls, which was called referred to as a Mofasil. So that term still exists when we call when we talk about Mofasil towns, that small town in India, they use the term Mofasil to be places which are beyond these limits of these presidency towns, like beyond Bombay or beyond Madras, the presidency towns, I'm not talking about the region in general, I'm just talking about town.

So trouble started when there were disputes between Indians and the British or there were disputes amongst the British themselves. There was confusion that how what law should apply initially started with if someone did something some British citizen did something on a ship, then yes, a martial law could be applied. But what if he did something on land, what law would apply? So there was confusion. So there's a very interesting incident where the East India Company and the British courts, the presidency courts had a major conflict. And there was a zamindar who was being prosecuted by the British courts, like when I say British courts, not the East India Company courts, and was being protected by the company troops and the company courts. So then they realized they changed the law eventually. And they said that, okay, fine, if you are a British citizen, or there are disputes between two British citizens, then the British law would apply. But if you're an Indian citizen, and it's just something criminal in nature, then Nizami laws would apply, which is a leftover from the Mughals. So this actually continued till very, very late.

So there were regulations, there were things called the Bombay regulations, there were things called the Madras regulations and Bengal regulations. For criminal law, Bengal regulations were mostly used even in Bombay and Madras for criminal prosecutions and criminal justice system. So they had regulations, they had some random laws for certain things. So it's not as if they did not have any laws. They had these statutes, which were typically derived from British laws, the common law system, because England does not have a typical legal system where everything is in the books. It evolves from the law of the courts, a court decides something, it becomes a law. It's not the other way around that, like in India, the statute dictates what the court can do. But in England, the courts dictated what the law became."

Yes, so but there were laws, there were these regulations, which kept getting modified from time to time to suit the need of the hour. So it's not as if they did not have anything, they had laws, but yeah, it was not uniform across the country. So for example, in the Calcutta presidency, Bengal presidency, the punishment for forgery was death. Similarly, and for example, if you steal one rupee and the punishment is 10 years, stealing 1000 rupees also 10 years, stealing 1 lakh is also 10 years. So it's it was not proportionate at all. So that is something which Macaulay also wanted to reform. He points out that these laws number one that for the same offense, there's no proportionality with regard to the gravity of the offense. Then there are certain offenses which disturbed the local populations view. So basically, it's something which even today, religious law or a customary law, you may feel that no, it's necessary to have such a law like Sati when Sati was being banned, it led to a huge uproar when the age of consent to have intercourse was raised from 10 to 12. It led to the first sedition trial in 1891. So even people at that point of time, there were major discrepancies."

The Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court was Elijah M. Pei and him and Hastings were buddies. And Nand Kumar was a native who rose to a status of a Diwan and was referred to as Raja and he became very rich. And he made allegations against Hastings, corruption allegations against Hastings, which was absolutely true. At that point of time, it was true. But to cut him to size, Hastings and M. Pei colluded and they accused him of forgery. And like I said, forgery was punishable with death. So they got together and it was a farce of a trial. He did not receive proper legal representation. He did not allow the proper lawyers or he was not allowed to plead his case properly. The evidence was murky at best. And they got together to kill him. To be honest, if I can just put it that way, they got together to kill him. I mean, he was convicted for forgery and he was sentenced to death. It was referred to as a judicial murder, which raised uproar even back in London. The parliament talked about it. Even in India, there was this popular sympathy for Nand Kumar for what he was going through. And actually showed at that point of time that there was a technical aspect involved within Nand Kumar could be even tried under British laws. Because like I said, he was a native who did not live in Calcutta. He was from Murshidabad. And the British law did not apply to the natives of Murshidabad. So what they did was they arrested him in Calcutta. And they tried him under British laws under these tyrannical laws. And as a result, a lot of natives left the presidency town. They just ran to these Mufsul towns, because they thought that even for a minor crime, they could be executed."

So Blackstone was considered an authoritative figure on criminal law and Bentham completely disagreed with him. And he said that I would, he actually said things like, I want to burn the statutes of England. I want to burn this law down and build something new. And he did not find popular acceptance in England. So he actually went to France, he was depressed, he went to France and he built on that, his philosophy there, like for the greatest, the greater good for everyone, the greater utilitarian philosophy. And that's where codification began. Bentham himself wasn't very successful, if I can say so, but his followers, his disciples are more successful than him. Because they actually put this to work. Like Mill was a Bentham follower, Macaulay not so much, even though he does borrow from Bentham, but he was not like a Benthamite as much as Mill was.

It's a great gift from the English to us. In the sense of the concept of codification, what the code itself is, you can debate. Correct. The concept of codification was excellent for India because we are very diverse. We had different traditions, customs across the country. Like I said, indigenous laws are completely different. Someone in the kingdom of Travancore or Mysore might have something completely different for Thaib, which may be different in the central provinces. And there are certain things, maybe offenses in one part, not an offense in another part. So it was very important to have a uniform system of penal law. Everyone needed to be on the same page where they knew what they can do and what they could not do. That is where codification becomes important. Without a code, you would have 100 different statutes in 100 different parts. And then there's some overlap, then there's confusion. So at the end of the day, for certainty in law, you need a code. So India has the civil procedure code, the criminal procedure code, which the criminal procedure code came later after the IPC was enacted and CPC also came later. But at the end of the day, these codes have had a major impact or rather they've shaped the Indian judicial system. Procedure is derived from the criminal procedure and the civil procedure codes. Penal offenses are derived from the IPC. Now we have penal offenses, other statutes as well, but there's no overlap in many cases. Most cases there's no overlap. In certain cases, there may be overlap, but then they're very, very specific in nature. Like you were just discussing about the UAPA and IPC. Like UAPA is very specific in nature. That's why as opposed to 124, which is general in nature. So but at the end of the day, mostly we have certainty, which was how a code becomes helpful"

And it's very interesting because when they decided to form the first law commission, they wanted to send someone there and Macaulay and the East India Company did not get along again because he was a member of parliament, a very young one at that. He was in his early thirties, was in his early thirties. And he used to criticize the East India Company about everything that they were doing in India. So, and Mill also did not get along with Macaulay. So it was very surprising that when they eventually had the reforms, then the chart, 1830s, the charter reforms happened and they decided to have the first law commission and they asked for Mill who they should appoint as the first law commissioner, he recommended Macaulay, despite having all his differences with him. And it was not taken well by the company. So Mill actually had to convince the directors to send Macaulay and their relationship improved after that, they prepared after that. It's very interesting that two people on the opposite ends of an issue work together to get us the court. Why did he want Macaulay? Because he had a lot of belief in Macaulay's intellectual capacity. And he respected Macaulay for that. Personally, they may have animosity, but he respected Macaulay for his intellectual capacity."

So when he was looking at the law in his notes, he mentions when he was sending it to Auckland for his consideration, he mentions that he's studied other indigenous laws, he studied these regulations, and he feels that he does not have anything to refer to, to create these laws. He feels that nothing is reliable. So he actually goes back on old English laws and common law in place there.

The crown was essentially just seen as a useful instrument of organization not more than that and the state and the crown actually feared any uprising.

So I mean, it's interesting because you know, you talk about the 13th century and about how we think today with the benefit of hindsight of England as this largely homogenous people. But actually there were different people. You had the Normans and the Saxons and the Celts and all of that sort of fighting for dominance and therefore for the centralizing authority that cropped up in the shape of the king and especially Edward the first who was like you point out of a legislative bent. There was an importance to have laws which would keep these people in check. And that is perhaps the birth of what you call clause 34 of the statute of Westminster."

So they did not have uniformity of language or culture. So when these people got together, they literally formed an alliance because they were tired of warring. They're tired of spending all the resources on fighting with each other. So say they decided that they should come together and live as a people as a nation. But even then they were bound to be differences like, like in India, the different classes, different communities, they're still friction. So that friction, which originated that union, union, which originated in war had a lot of friction. So a Saxon king would not be loved or respected by the Celts and vice versa. So that is why I keep saying that this was a very, very literal law. You just couldn't say anything doesn't matter. If you say the king killed his wife, even if he had actually killed his wife, he, the person who says the king killed his wife would be prosecuted for seditious libel."

So and it again was on mostly on religious grounds. And I don't need to really go into that as such. So they had a makeshift law, when the mutiny happened, they got a makeshift law in where they provided for an offense against the state that which is somewhat, I won't say similar to sedition, but it was the first step towards having a law against sedition where you can't criticize the government or say anything against the government and it had to be tried. And there was a summary trial with no appeal provided if you did something like that. So when the mutiny ended, and it's called the 1857 revolution, but at the end of the day, it went on till 1858 and 1859, it finally ended in around 1859. And that's when in 1860, the new law comes in. But when the crown took over, they realized that they have to establish themselves and they have to stop this from happening again. So that's when they tested the draft code and they handed it over to Barnes Peacock to write it again and to make it a better law as such, define it a little more. So the penal code was an exercise in having a unified penal provision, unified penal provisions in India to control the masses and to avoid another 1857 from happening.

Nobody wanted to take that pledge. He said, no, first you may create awareness, you make people do this voluntarily don't impose it on them. So Tilak while approaching this from a conservative place, he was not against reform, but he knew the reality of the day that people will not accept this. If let's say someone like Tilak would have initiated the idea, people would have been more welcoming of it. But because the idea did not come from Tilak, it came from the British. So anyway, resentment had started that was the period when actual resentment against the government had started. It was where the, I would say the freedom movement had started taking form, not the freedom movement, I said with anti British movement had started taking form. So they thought there is a foreign influence. Why should we listen to foreign influence? Why should we listen to these people who not even from here? Why should we listen to the white skin people? So Tilak was right in a way that it has to come from within. But yes, people generally averse to these reforms. Even Sati was opposed. If you think about it today, I for the life of me can't imagine why it was opposed. Like I don't know why it was opposed. Yes, customs, religion, everything. But to kill someone just because their husband is dead, doesn't sound sound nice to me today. But at that time, it was opposed because it was the British who brought it.

Of course, my counter argument to that is that for something like Sati, you have to be animated by first principles that taking someone's life is wrong, coercion is wrong. So you don't then wait for society to change once you have figured out that these are your values. So people could argue that not everyone shares those values.

They wanted an Islamic India. So they sort of stayed away from the movement. So they actually did not play any role in it, maybe a minor role here and there, but they did not play any role in it. But after that ended and before it happened, they, earlier they fought, they were fighting the Sikhs, then the Sikhs were defeated by the British and there's again, they refocused on the British. They wanted to just drive away outsiders from the country and create a Islamic nation. So after 1857, there were a lot of conspiracies from across the country, from the Bengal presence, from Dhaka to Punjab. And this was discovered over a period of time and there were major trials which happened that happened in Ambala, in Patna, and Delhi, and Wahhabi leaders executed, but they just refused to die down. So they actually felt that they need this against the Wahhabis because they could not deal with another uprising that close to the mutiny.

And when he delivered the speech, sometime after that, days after that, Rand was assassinated because of this plague relief work. Now the British then need an excuse to catch the luck for something. Even though he was a member of the legislative council, and he was a very important man, but they still detested him. He was seen as a power center, separate power centers. Again, it was very political. And the newspapers, the Anglo-Indian newspapers like the Times of India, and the English language newspapers were really against these vernacular papers or Indians running English papers like the Maratha was actually an English paper and Kesari was the vernacular paper, Marathi paper. So when this was reported, when these speeches which he delivered and other people delivered in those, in Raikad, they tried to join it. They have tried to create a proximity with assassination. And when they raided him, they found literature, which he still, he claimed that it was not his. So they found literature about subversive activities. So they actually arrested him at that point of time to send a message to the vernacular press and to the people around at that point of time. And his defense was that this is not sedition. His defense was there's nothing in his speeches where he tries to incite hatred against the government. So he actually tried to raise a defense within the law. He tried to defend himself. He did not have legal help. He did everything himself. So his defense was that he did not say or utter anything which could incite hatred against the government.

So it's a, it originated there, but the influence was largely Russian. There was a Russian revolution where they discovered the power of a bomb and that spread to India, to Bengal and to Punjab. And they started creating this age of the bomb. They started throwing bombs, crudely made bombs, but they were trying to get hurt. Then secret societies formed all over Bengal and what is East Bengal and West Bengal, all over East and West Bengal, which were called Anusilan Samitis. What these Samitis would do is they would train youngsters as people, children as young as 15, 16, 18 to just do violent acts, violent acts of revolution against the government, send a message across to the government that we are not going to sit silent.

That if we are to look back today with the values of today, we would say that, you know, the British having a sedition law to prevent people rising up against them is understandable and rational from their point of view. At the same time, looking back today, we can say that we are completely on Tilak's side and the side of all of these people who were fighting the empire, though that qualifies as sedition and therefore unlawful at that time. But the other aspect of it also, and you know, where Gandhi diverged from the likes of Tilak was when it comes to the means. Yes, that a lot of these, you know, the Aurobindo Ghosh, Savarkar, to some extent, Tilak in his tacit support for violent means seem to say that our end is noble, we want to get rid of the empire and therefore any means are justified. And to me, even sitting here with this passage of time, it would seem to me that that is wrong, that the end doesn't justify the means and that a lot of the moral judgment, if you are to pass any on those people has to do with the means also and not the end. So the, you know, I'm just thinking that one can't just look at sedition in the classic one sided way that of course it is a tool of political oppression.

But you have to look at a way, look at the context of that day, that the government they were under, the subjects of whom they were subjects, was not a government of their choice. It was imposed on them. The laws were imposed on them, the language was imposed on them, the culture was imposed on them. They completely came and changed Indian society. And they looted from India, the famines which happened, they exported grains didn't leave anything for the natives. So when you look at the anger, what they felt, we will not be able to understand it today. So even to try to contextualize it today, I don't know, I don't think we can do that."

And then it was supposed to make its recommendation on whether the law should be reformed. When I say reform, it should be made stricter to prevent this because you have to understand that it also coincided with the First World War in Punjab and in the rest of India, the Defense of India Act was in play. So they could not have afforded revolution on one hand war on the other. So they wanted to prevent this in future. So what the Rowlett Committee did, it wanted to make the law stricter. It wanted to make the law stricter. But ironically, it also built a safety valve in that law. It said that this law can only be imposed what they call the Rowlett Act and or the Black Act as the Indians called it. They wanted it to be imposed only upon a declaration of emergency, a declaration of necessity for imposition of such law. So that could only be done in cases of uprising and absolute uprising, which was largely not accepted by the people. In fact, that law was a paper tiger. It died a natural death. It never came into effect. But if you look at the law today, even though we are not under the British government, there is no safety valve built into the law. It was left to the Supreme Court to finally interpret it. And even that interpretation is not being followed today. Nobody even the law enforcement officers don't know what this law is actually about. And there's no safety valve. Even the UAPA does not have any safety valve. You can apply this, the police can arrest anyone at any point of time. There's no necessity of the situation, let's say in a Chhattisgarh that there's a mass uprising, an excited movement all across the state. And that's when you impose 124A. It's not the case. Even in peaceful, you're reading a book in Darjeeling and you say, oh, this shouldn't happen and we should have a change of government and there's that and some nice nationalistic fellow will come across and say, oh, you're being seditious. Yeah, I mean, people have been arrested for Facebook posts. They've been arrested for receiving messages on a WhatsApp group, or rather just receiving random messages, which they had no nothing to do with. So anything, anyone can be just arrested for it. So it's not the trial, because I mentioned that they say that there's this, there have been two convictions in the last four from 2014, 2016, but there I could not find a single conviction. I did not find a single judgment. So it's not about trial or whatever. It's about what happens before that, that arrest and persecution, which happens."

I want to move on now to a chapter of yours called Gandhi, Azad and Nehru, politics of sedition. And you begin this with a quote by Gandhi, which is in his sedition trial in 1922, which I found profoundly impressive. So I want to quote the full thing, which is, quote, I would like to state that I entirely endorse the learned advocate general's remarks in connection with my humble self. I think that he was entirely fair to me in all statements that he has made, because it is very true. And I have no desire whatsoever to conceal from this court. The fact that to preach this affection towards the existing system of government has become almost a passion with me. And the advocate general is also entirely in the right when he says that my preaching of this affection does not commence with my connection to young India. This is a magazine Iran. But that it can commence much earlier. I do not pled any extenuating act. I am here, therefore, to invite and submit to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me the highest duty of the citizen, stop quote. And your chapter, of course, talks about different trials in which Gandhi, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Jawaharlal Nehru all pleaded guilty of sedition. And when I read, you know, and this sort of this was, you know, all of the courts that you've reproduced in this chapter were very clarifying for me, because the thought that struck me with your earlier chapter when Tilak and all these guys were under trial, is that why were they defending themselves? They were guilty of sedition and they should just stand up proud and say that, yeah, of course, I am disaffected. I am preaching this affection, you know, so what is the crime? And Gandhi, Azad and Nehru actually do this. And they are all people who are protesting against the British by peaceful means using non cooperation and civil disobedience and so on. And this sort of refreshing honesty owning up to what is quote unquote a crime, you know, seems to bring a moral force to the freedom struggle."

They did not want freedom as such. They wanted the power to govern themselves within the Commonwealth, within under the patronage of the crown, dominion status, autonomous status. They never in their life at that point of time had imagined that India could be completely free of the British. So this Poon Swaraj thing which happened with Tilak and when he coined the term Swaraj is my birthright and I'll have it. That happened later that not happened even at the time of a second trial, right? So there was a shift in the Indian political scenario after 1919 when Gandhi came here. When and Gandhi in fact had become very unpopular, which I talked about just before his sedition trial, he had become very unpopular for calling off the civil disobedience movement because of because of Chori Chori called it off and the people were very disillusioned. In fact, if the British wouldn't have prosecuted him, maybe the Gandhi that we know of today wouldn't have existed. Maybe we wouldn't have assumed the kind of relevance that he did after that. Streisand effect. Yes. So, exactly. So we should maybe call it the Gandhi effect. So basically what they did was they wanted complete freedom. They wanted Indians to govern India. They wanted Indians to frame their own laws. They didn't want laws from England to run the country here. So what they did was they said that I refuse to recognize the law. They say fine, this is sedition. If you say it is sedition, it is sedition. I refuse to recognize it. Gandhi called it the prince of political offenses, right? So what they did was they said, I refuse to recognize your authority over me. If you say it is sedition, fine, then I am seditious. I have done it. You punish me for it. And all of them asked for punishment. Nobody said, let me go. They said, give me the maximum punishment possible. Gandhi, in fact, said when they said that Tilak got six years, so you should also get six years. Gandhi said he was privileged to be equated with Tilak for getting six years. Nehru simply went up to the magistrate and said, you punish me. I don't even want to fight you. There shouldn't be any trial. I'm admitting to everything. The magistrate said, please don't do this. He said, please don't do this. I'll get you out of it. And he said, I'll make sure you don't have to face any prison. Nehru said, thank you so much, but I don't want it."

For the first time, Justice Mori Squire, he brought in the interpretation which we today rely upon eventually in the Indian Supreme Court also interpreted the same way that mere criticism is not seditious until and unless it causes violence.

So that's when certain people in the Constituent Assembly and on the Fundamental Rights Subcommittee opposed this. They said that Patel is framing this from the point of view of a constable.

As you pointed out earlier, what happens with the First Amendment is that one of the caveats introduced is public order and the courts therefore now begin to argue about whether the introduction of this caveat means that the sedition law is constitutional after all. And you basically have the Patna High Court saying that 124A is constitutional. The Manipur High Court says it's partly unconstitutional. The Allahabad High Court finds it to be completely unconstitutional. And then comes Kedarnath Singh versus State of Bihar."

And in Bihar, this gentleman delivered a speech where he called police the dogs of CID and said that he was spoken in the bureaucracy. So he was arrested for sedition under the Congress government and he was arrested for sedition. So eventually when the court and he was convicted for it as well. And this was not the only case. This was actually a batch of matters from UP and Bihar. And when these matters eventually reached the Supreme Court, what the Supreme Court held which applies till date is that till that time, even though they went back to Morris Goir's interpretation in Niranjan Dutta and they simply said that public order, if there is a restriction on public order on free speech, that means that there has to be public disorder for that speech to be seditious. As long as public order is not disturbed, that speech cannot be curtailed. So public disorder means violence. It means just disturbing the status quo somewhere causing law and order problems. So till the time a writing or a play or a movie or a speech does not incite violence or public disorder or have the tendency of doing that, that test has to be there for anything to be declared as seditious. So very simply put that today, if I say something and that causes people to take up arms against the government or it may cause people to take up arms against the government, any such thing will not be seditious till the time that test is met, that it can cause violence or incite violence against the state. Because you have to understand, it's not just violence against a community or violence against a group of or of a political party. The law is categorized under the offense of against the state. So it has to be by that very, very simple logic, it has to be violence against the state and the state today is all powerful. 20 individuals cannot overthrow the state. A thousand individuals cannot overthrow the state. The state is not brittle today. So what that judgment did was that it introduced that test of violence being caused or likelihood of violence to be caused. But unfortunately it is not being followed in spirit."

Like one of the ways in which you point out it has evolved is, for example, in the state of Maharashtra, you know, it's not enough for someone to say file a case of sedition against me. It has to also be approved by the government of the day before I can be hauled into court. But many constable level police inspector level cops don't actually know this. And therefore the sedition law has become a tool of harassment."

        "message": "In fact, in all of India, only Maharashtra has these guidelines. And these guidelines also arise out of a court case when Asim Trivedi was being prosecuted for sedition after he drew those cartoons. 2014, I think. Yes. So the court simply said it may be distasteful. You may not like it, but that does not make it seditious. It did not incite any violence. Nothing happened. So why is he in jail for sedition? So they set down guidelines. They said that a person cannot even be arrested for under section 124A till the time there is a written opinion of a law officer and the investigation has to be done by a senior police officer among many other things. So it laid down these guidelines. Other than Maharashtra, no other state has these guidelines. Even when a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court saying that you have to enforce Kedarnath, the court simply said follow Kedarnath. It did not lay down any guidelines again. So today what situation is that across the country, there is no sanction required for arrest. A sanction is only required when a charge sheet is to be filed and charges are to be framed against you. But prior to that, there is no sanction required. Otherwise, it's required under 196 of CRPC. So to arrest someone for sedition is very easy. To fire a person to go to court and get a fire registered for sedition is very easy. So what I spoke about here to build a safety wall here as well is that create a provision or create a or at least issue guidelines across it should be by from the central government to all the states that even to arrest someone under 124A, you need prior sanction or the approval of a high ranking or IG, DG level police officer without a can't even arrest someone for sedition."

So you know, we'll have to wind up soon. So I'll have one final sort of question for you. And I'd urge all the listeners to read the book. And if we focused on the historical aspect of it so far, that's what the book also does extremely well, and which is extremely important. But to read the later chapters about how the sedition law is in modern times, do read the book. My question to you is this and here I will be slightly mischievous. And I will invert Mr. Tilak's argument and use it against the law which was used to imprison him, which is Tilak's argument back in the day when the age of consent law was passed, was that look, this is a necessary law, but society is not ready for it. Most people agree with this. So change has to happen gradually. It cannot be imposed top down. Now in the modern time, you and I are sort of elite liberals who don't believe in all of these free speech laws like 124A, 153A, 295A. We would just like them to go right. But a modern day Tilak could make the argument that society actually agrees that free speech should not be absolute and these laws are necessary, and that the state is absolute and it is a crime to be against the state. And therefore, society is not ready for these laws to go and we need these laws. How would you respond to that?"

The numbers are very, very low. They claim there have been two convictions. The NCRB report claims one conviction. The MHA in Parliament claims two convictions. I haven't found even a single conviction in these two years. So your argument is no one is getting convicted under it? And the chilling effect is massive. The chilling effect is massive. So what I'm saying is today at the end of the day, in these three years now, with the 2017 report coming out from 2014 to 2017, only six sedition trials have been concluded. Only six trials have been concluded. And if that is the rate at which trials have been concluded and no one's been convicted and most cases are dying even before charge sheets are being filed, then what are you doing with this law? Why is this law in existence?"

I keep saying this, that the government is not brittle today. So all they say is someone burnt a few buses, so convicting for sedition is not right. There are other laws to take care of that. There's laws to take care of murder, there are laws to take care of arson, of everything's"

So let me ask you a postscript to my final final question, which you can answer very briefly before you run through Bombay traffic to try and get to your flight in time. Good luck with that. And the question is that, you know, I remember writing columns 10 years ago against 377 against the adultery law, and they're both gone today, that you know, things evolved to a stage where they could go naturally with no outcry and no interest groups insisting on keeping those laws. Are you hopeful of a time? And if so, how long will it take that before many of these draconian laws, especially these sort of free speech laws, and even laws like the UAPA, you know, that our society matures enough to say that, hey, we don't need this in a healthy democracy."

No, it's not really because at the end of the day, they are the ones who come to power, it could be a Congress, it could be a BJP, it could be a TMC, it could be anyone. But for them, it's a very useful tool to have. Why would they give it up? Why would they give it up? So it's a political party which has to mature and say, you know, I'm not afraid of this. So they are the ones who have to mature at the two hopeful statements were made very recently by two Supreme Court judges, one of whom will become the Chief Justice of India after the tenure of the next two and, and he says that when a cartoonist is arrested for sedition, the constitution weeps. And Justice Deepak Gupta recently gave a speech in Ahmedabad where he criticized the law of sedition. So hopeful statements are coming forward. But then at the same time, we have a Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah and other politicians of the BJP saying that this law is required and we will make it stronger. So that's why I'm saying people may still believe that law should go. It's a political parties were to be mature enough to say they're not afraid of criticism. They're not afraid of people saying that what you're doing is wrong. They have to take it sportingly. They know that the country cannot be overthrown by a motley group of critics."
