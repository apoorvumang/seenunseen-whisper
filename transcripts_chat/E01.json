There he saw that there was a giant spaceship hovering over his hut with the logo of the Indian government on it. It was lowering a giant steel cage that would fit neatly around his hut. Alarmed, Ram Singh rushed out looking for someone to speak to and spotted a babu in a safari suit. What's going on, he asked the babu. What are you doing? The babu said, we are lowering this cage outside your hut so that you are trapped inside. You can't go out and no one else can get inside. Why are you doing that, asked poor Ram Singh. The man in a safari suit just laughed at him. He said, you fool, we have been doing it for almost 70 years now. This is the story of agriculture in India."

This week, I want to talk about some of the laws around agriculture in India, specifically two laws. One, which restricts entry into agriculture by preventing the entry of big corporations into farming. And two, which stops farmers from taking an escape route from farming by not allowing agricultural land to be sold for non-agricultural purposes. What is the seen effect of these laws? The seen effect of such restrictions on agriculture is that farmers are protected from greedy, rapacious capitalists and an important sector of our economy, agriculture, is safeguarded. All this sounds most noble, but is it possible that these regulations are actually hurting both the farmers themselves and our nation? To discuss the unseen effects of these regulations, I have two guests on the show with me. Pawan Srinath is a fellow at the Takshashila Institution and Karthik Shashidhar is a renowned quant with a cult following, a management consultant, a columnist at Mint and adjunct faculty at IIM Bangalore. Guys, welcome to the show. Pawan, give me some background on how we have regulated farming in India over the last 70 years."

So, in order to do this, there have been heavy restrictions placed on who can do farming. So, the fear is, you know, you can have a company which comes and takes land away from people, you can have one of us who lives in a city who has more access to resources, who goes in and cheats the poor farmer out of their wealth, right, because land is perhaps all that a few people own. So, that's the intention of why only farmers and collectives of farmers are allowed to own land and practice farming. And even unless you have, I think, different states have different rules, but unless you have an ancestor or a parent or a grandparent who has done farming or still owns farmland, can you get back into this?"

And there is a seen effect there. There's a noble thing that like it comes from on the back of the zamindari system where they said like, Oh, you don't want the farmer to be a slave. You don't want him to like be farming for someone else. You need to own your land and farm for yourself and things. So, you're forcing everyone to be entrepreneurs. Now, being a farmer and being a businessman are two completely unrelated skills. And what is happening now is that the farmer whose primary skill is farming is also being forced to be a businessman. And there are a large number of risks associated with farming. And not only does the farmer have to take care of his crop and apply his crop science to the farm, he also needs to be tracking the markets, hedging against the risks and so on. So, we are overburdening the farmer by forcing him to be an entrepreneur."

There can be all kinds of shortages, infrastructure problems. I mean, we are making them forced entrepreneurs and then sort of celebrating that as a virtue. Imagine if every single software engineer in the country was not allowed to form a company, not allowed to form a group, but just work entirely on their own. Even over there, sure, you have technology to at least network people and you can't even network farmers. But that's the big challenge, right? I mean, what software would India be producing? What technology would we be making if no one was allowed to form a company?"

Beginning of the season, you have to invest to buy seeds, buy equipment, buy fertilizer. And then you farm and then in order to get paid, you just have to pray and hope that you have a good crop and it fetches a good price. So, continuing Pawan's analogy, imagine that software engineers in India were not allowed to take a salary. And they could only get paid in terms of dividends or profits from what they would make at the end of the year, right? So, farming is like that."

So, if you were to have 20% producing 15%, those 20% would be making a lot more than what the farmers are making now. So, it's not a bad thing. But again, you have restrictions in other markets. Because of the restriction in land that Pawan mentioned that you can't buy land unless you're a farmer, the market for farmland is not particularly liquid. And it's hard for the farmer to kind of sell and like get away from his capital and so on, right?"

But to go back to this, every single country which has increased in prosperity, which has increased incomes, has had a large exodus of people out of farming and into typically industry, but out of farming into more productive things, right? And in this process, there's more skilling that is happening, there is security that is given. In fact, the start of, you know, modern ideas of social security comes from sort of Bismarck's Germany, right? Where you have sort of industries going up and then sort of a conversation on, okay, some sort of support should be provided. So, all those things that we think of as now as a part of this table, evolved from that idea of, first you have a company, they give you security by giving you a salaried income, and they give you benefits, you get regularity, you have predictability, and predictability is one of the most wonderful things in our lives, right?

You can have farmers as, I don't know, shareholders in a company that is formed locally. You can have farmers who are given sort of guarantees of various sorts. And the idea is, yes, all of that is hard. Yes, sort of enforcement of contracts is hard. But we have so many people who are happily taking salaries and not complaining, and they're not necessarily getting cheated out. So, this idea that somehow a corporation can come and take over everything, just because bargaining rights are different, is wrong. And the other, the unseen effect of all of this, right, is people repeatedly ask for the benevolent hand of the government, which is never terribly benevolent, right? So, you want intervention and price, because price is uncertain. You want intervention for crop failure because of weather, because that is uncertain. So, every single problem, and we've listed all these problems, the automatic solution everyone's asking for is government intervene, right? So, one intervention begets many, many other interventions."

As Pawan mentioned, like, because the farmers have an uncertain future, lots of risks, and they keep asking for the benevolent hand of the government. If the farmer's lot becomes better, if he gets paid a regular salary, and if he doesn't have to face all these risks that he faces now, and maybe he has an employer, he'll stop asking the government for its benevolence. And when you stop asking the government for benevolence, you're taking power away from the government. So, it's not in the interest of the government to actually reform this law and reduce the need for their own benevolence."

The number is actually reducing. Second is even people who are token dependent on farming are actually getting most of their income from non-farm sources, right? So, they're doing small service jobs, they're sort of participating in the rural economy in various ways. And the other thing which is sort of hidden is you go to rural India, you don't find as many young people anymore. People between the ages of 20 and, say, 35. Because they're off in the city trying to work. So, sons of farmers, daughters of farmers are not doing farming. So, if you actually do an age profile, that 60% comes, first of all, starts with something like 50, and then that drops down to about 20% or lower. And that depends, of course, state by state. What are the implications of that? The implications of that is you need new sources of jobs. And India has been bad at providing that. The informal sector in the country absorbs a lot. So, we don't have a traditional sort of a labor strike or a labor movement that way. I mean, we don't have the kind of insane unemployment rates that other countries do, but there's a desperate need for more jobs."

And the easiest people for them to sell their land to is this big coffee plantation company. And those guys employ their workers and so on. And they've been managing it.

So, I mean, countries are managing with much smaller numbers. China has done a brilliant job of moving a humongous number of people out of farming. I think now China might have dropped to single digits or in the early double digits. So, if India gets its act together, and I don't want to mix cause and effect over here. It's cyclical. Sure. But if we get our act together, we grow, we provide new jobs in industry and so on. In 20-30 years, we should be able to achieve what China did.
