At the time of independence, the British passed on a professional army to both India and Pakistan. But while the influence of the army was seen in Pakistani politics, it has remained unseen in Indian politics. And that's a damn good thing. The military has played an outsized role in many postcolonial nations, many of which have been plagued with coups and an erosion of democracy. Pakistan is both a case in point and a cautionary tale. The Indian Armed Forces have steadfastly remained far away from politics. And this is not just because of good luck, but a result of conscious decisions taken by our leaders through the last century. And while it's a good thing that the army has stayed above politics, it's not quite a good thing that politicians increasingly invoke the army for rhetorical purposes these days. It is also not a good thing that our political classes tend to take the armed forces for granted. We are lucky to have the armed"

In this episode, we'll be talking about the Indian Armed Forces. And my guest is Lieutenant General Prakash Menon, who's the Director of the Strategic Studies Program at the Takshashila Institution in Bengaluru. General Menon has been a guest on the show before when we discussed nuclear strategy, a subject on which he's written a superb book. Both that episode and his book will be linked from the show notes. But before we begin our conversation, let's take a quick commercial break. Are you one of those people who not only loves to read, but also wants to write better? If so, I might have something for you. For the last couple of months, I've been teaching an online course called the Art of Clear Writing. Four webinars spread out over four Saturdays, in which I share whatever I have learned about the craft and practice of writing over 25 years as a professional writer. The course also includes many writing exercises, discussions on email and WhatsApp and an interactive workshop. It costs rupees 10,000 or $150. You can check out the details at indiauncut.com slash clear writing. This link will be in the show notes. If you want to bridge the gap between the thoughts in your head and the words on the page, then the Art of Clear Writing might be just what you need. June batches begin soon. So register now. indiauncut.com slash clear writing. Before we start talking about the army, both in terms of historical context and the structural issues that it faces and so on, tell me a little bit about yourself. Why did you join the army?"

I actually was a naval cadet because I come from a merchant navy family and my father is from the 1940 batch of the Dufferin. And it was during my second term at the NDA that I read a book on Field Marshal Rommel by a person called Desmond Young and was motivated to join the army. So I took the decision by myself without consulting my father and he was upset about it and gave an application that I want to convert my service from the navy to the army. And it was the easiest thing to do because navy at that time was a very small service. So it was difficult being becoming a naval cadet, but much easier moving from the navy to the army. So that is how I got into the army. So I went in as a naval cadet"

And, you know, that idealism has been eroded over the decades. And today, when you talk about the civil services, there's a lot of cynicism, so to say. But in your case, in the case of the army, I'm assuming because the army is insulated from, you know, the regular corruptions of daily governance, I'm guessing that would not apply. Like, do you feel there's been a change for why people join the army over the years or?"

And therefore, the background from which people join the army are probably different from what they used to be in the old days. So there has been a change, no doubt. But I think as an institution, the army, once you join it, has got that capacity to keep you motivated and actually bring out the best in you. Because I think that is the institutional capacity because we are based on what we call, and I belong to a fighting arm, I am an infantry officer, it is more pertinent that we are kept in such a state of, you can say, motivation that the larger and the outside world was at that time much more restricted to you. But that is not the case now because we never had the social media, we never had so much of press, we never had that much of exposure. So we've really lived in a very confined space. And surely the officer of today does not live in that same space. He lives in a space where he's exposed to the daily meanderings of India's politics, the world politics for that matter. And therefore, that exposure itself would have some sort of an influence. But I think the Indian Army still has that institutional capacity to make sure that the officer is still motivated and directed to the right space."

And what I found, at least, as India's economic growth took place, and as market forces sort of enveloped daily life, the value system itself also had to be affected by it. It could not be insulated from it. The question always was for the military leadership, that how does it adjust to these changes while it assimilates it without making sure that your military effectiveness is not impacted? That was a challenge of military leadership. It will continue to be the challenge of military leadership. Changes are, in fact, today, much more rapid than was it before. It will continue to impact. The question is, does the military leadership recognize how those changes are to be dealt with? And that becomes, I think, in today's world, much more challenging than it ever was before."

And which means that you are a colonel, which means you finish command of a unit. Then, of course, that experience, you can actually move in that space. And I think there are not all, but there are quite a lot of people actually who, because of their, and this is all up to the officer themselves. The institution actually gives you the opportunity, but it's entirely up to the officers, whether you want to, how much you want to read, how much you want to write about, how much you actually want to project and develop the idea. So my particular path was driven by the fact that in 1998, India went nuclear. I was that time a colonel, and I was interested to find out what meant for the armed forces and what sort of, how does the role of the armed forces change because we are now a nuclear power. That drove me because my thoughts were actually not in consonance with the views, which are my peers and the seniors, which I had drawn. And I decided that I must find out. So that is why I therefore took study leave. I did my doctorate, finally converted that into a book and that's how my journey was lost. So I think it's an individual journey and there are a lot of people like that."

But Pakistan, of course, has been beset with military dictatorships and the military has always been a part of their politics. And we've completely escaped that. And one interesting fact which I hadn't thought about before, which I got from Stephen Wilkinson's book on the Indian army, which will be linked from the show notes, is about how the British army was specifically set up for a very different purpose and what the post-colonial armies would have to do. The purpose of the Indian and the Pakistani armies, of course, would be to defend the borders and so on. You're defending the nation against external threats. Whereas the whole point of the British army was to control the native population. And to this effect, they carried out what is famously known as a divide and rule policy, which applied to the army in the sense that they constructed a colonial Indian army. To quote Wilkinson, quote, the colonial Indian army was deliberately constructed both to maximize its fighting potential and to hedge against the threat of any repeat of a mutiny like that had almost ended British control in 1857. Stop quote. And what they did was they recruited within the army from what they considered the martial races. So there were many more Punjabis and Pashtuns and there was a heavy imbalance that way. And what happened after sort of colonization ended across the world was that in many countries, because it followed this kind of policy, you invariably had clashes between the army, which was controlled by minority interests against the majority democratic forces at large, ending in many cases as we've seen with Pakistan. But in India, it didn't happen. You know, Nehru famously wrote to his defense minister in 46 or 47, where he said that this is something we must specifically watch out for. The Congress had been thinking about it for more than 20 years. And B. R. Ambedkar had written a book in 1941 called Thoughts on Pakistan, where he predicted that it was because of this compositional makeup that, you know, Pakistan would have trouble with this army. And we were actually better off letting Pakistan form because what would happen is we would get rid of a lot of these problems. How did that play out? Can you tell me a little bit about how the"

        "message": "army? See, actually, if you look at the army, don't forget that the army was initially part of the presidencies, you know, we had. So they were in different geographies. And of course, the Britishers were very conscious of the fact that the loyalty of the army was absolutely vital for retaining power within the country. So then that's how they devised what you described as divide and rule. And then it's a very artificial construct called the martial classes. They sort of put their faith in these classes and recruited more from there so that there was no one particular class which would be strong enough to take over. So they actually put the eggs in many baskets. That's what they did. So, you know, they even had the gurkhas actually in the Indian army itself. So you could use the gurkhas against somebody else. And all this came about from the lesson of 1857 is rooted there. And that's how they structured the army itself. So at independence, when we lost whatever had gone to Pakistan, the idea of the martial classes and they are being still in the regiments which we were, actually that was not the change which was attempted. The change which Jawaharlal Nehru was conscious about was of how does he make sure there is sufficient civilian control on the military? And that was his focus. Because over a period of time, he saw that the military had taken control. So the issue was at the heart of the civil military relationships in India, that what sort of control does the civilian exercise on the military? And that's where the Ministry of Defense, which was in charge and made some changes. Initially, the chiefs actually were called the chiefs of staff, and they were also commanders in chief. So while they were in Delhi and carrying out their staff activity, when they went to the field, then they were commanders in chiefs. And without consultation of the chiefs, the commanders in chiefs nomenclature was taken off. There was a big debate about it. The chiefs actually protested. But finally, they were overruled and they were told to accept. And Nehru made this announcement in Parliament. So Nehru's consciousness or the fact that the control need to be exercised has been the main factor initially by which control was exercised by the politician. And that control began to be exercised through bureaucratic control. And that is where even the idea of attached offices, or that the services were attached offices, were all bureaucratic constructions to ensure this control was kept. So as we go on, and as we come to the present times, it is this control which has probably kept India different from our neighbours and the rest of it. That is one point. And we must give credit to the politicians. But I think we should also credit the institutional leadership for it. Although I think just the other day, I think somebody has dug up a letter from Kariyappa, I think, to the Prime Minister, saying that for some time, the army should rule with the help of the President, so that the politics can, you know, there was this, I don't know whether it is genuine or not, but I saw, I recently read it. But I think it would probably be incorrect because this Kariyappa was supposed to have written much after he has left the army, when he's a civilian, it already stood for elections and lost twice and so on. So this is not something which he was thinking about when he was in service. Whoever was in service and whoever the military chief were very clear, and that's, I think, the institutional value, which has been passed down from independence to nowadays, that we must remain an apolitical institution. I think this is a value which it is imbibed in the military leaders and it is something which is endured. Of course, there will always be exceptions to the rule. Somebody might say something at some point in time, but I don't think you would find anybody who is wearing the uniform saying something contradictory to this, it would be very difficult. It would have been said by somebody who was already out of uniform. So I think there are two things here. One is the consciousness of the political leaders which made sure that the control is exercised. And the other one was of the military as an institution itself, which sort of embedded in itself the value of being apolitical. So I think that's why both these things in combination has kept it the way it is."

        "message": "In fact, it's interesting that, you know, when he took over, General Kariyappa famously sent out a circular to the officers he commanded saying that we must stay away from politics. But after he retired in 1953, and again quoting from Wilkinson's book, he argued on several occasions for court, a suspension of civil liberties, the imposition of emergency precedence rule on the states, the disbanding of political parties, suspension of parliament until law and order had been restored, and the replacement of universal suffrage with a franchise that was restricted to literates. But this is all, like you said, after retirement and no serving officer has ever kind of said things of this sort. What was sort of really interesting like along with what you pointed out that a lot of the control was, you know, the Defense Ministry was on the ascendant and a lot of that control was taken away from the army. But another sort of direction that Nehru tried to move in was to change the martial composition of the army itself. And it's interesting that in 1949, the Indian government basically announced that we shall now be open to all able-bodied men from all across the country. But there was a caveat here, which did sort of affect the way things worked out in practice. Again, I'll quote Wilkinson, quote, the specific wording of the army promises and orders given in 1949, which stated that new infantry and artillery regiments would be open to members of all provinces, and that all other branches of the army would be open to members of all provinces had much less effect in broadening out the army than most politicians thought it would. This was because, as the generals knew, the infantry and armored corps had expanded in World War II by adding new battalions to existing class regiments, rather than through the logistically much more complex and uncertain step of adding whole new regiments, training centers, recruitment areas, and fighting traditions. Since independence, for instance, the Punjab regiment, which recruits mainly Sikhs and Dogras, has increased from 5 to 29 battalions, where the Rajputana rifles has increased from 6 to 21 battalions, because expansion has largely happened through the existing regiments. So now, while there is this tendency from within the army of sort of finding a Jugaaru way around actually changing the ethnic composition, you do find that, for example, one of the ways in which Nehru sort of controlled that was through making sure that the chief of army staff reflected far more diversity. So in fact, in between 49 and 79, if I remember correctly, there was only one chief of army staff from the so-called martial races, which is the Punjabis, which was General Thapar after we came to Krishnamandir and appointed him. But the rest were from sort of all over the place. Despite the fact that at the time of independence, the army, you know, 50% of the officers were Punjabis and 26% Sikhs. So it's kind of interesting that the political class is trying to weave the army in a particular direction. And the army itself is sort of"

But I think the other point which he makes, which was about the composition of the fighting arms, which was the infantry and the armoured corps. In fact, I belong to a regiment, which was the first regiment raised by that time General Kariyappa, which was an all India class composition. That means we could recruit anybody from any part and that we remain, therefore, the only regiment, which is the fighting among these old regiments, which is all India class. The rest have continued to be what they were, which means the Rajputana rifles, primarily from Rajasthan, UP, Punjabis, Sikh, Sikhalai, Bihar, Madras, and so on. This is the regimental system which has refused to change. And the only attempt to make this change, which is serious, was after Blue Star when the Sikh regiments, some of them had mutinied. And actually, there was this study which was ordered and there was major resistance from the infantry regiments themselves, because the infantry leadership felt that the fact that you could have groups of men from a particular geography always had strengths as far as fighting is concerned, food habits and so on. Although all these beliefs have been demolished by the regiment I come from, that we get people and we still have, we got enough laurels of this idea, but it has endured. It has not been possible to actually have an army with the fighting arm. All the rest have changed. The artillery has changed. The engineers have changed. Everybody else has nearly changed, not fully, nearly changed. The infant, the fighting arms have only the new raisings, whatever was used, the new battalions, they have mostly, especially outside the fighting arms, mostly been based on all India class composition. So we have this anomaly. And in my personal view, we should at some point in time migrate into an all India class composition. And I'll tell you why I'm saying this, because I come from an all India class regiment. You see, if you were in a Gurkha battalion, the Gurkha battalion will have strengths, which are confined to the strength of the Gurkhas, which means they'll be good at boxing, good at boxing, but they won't be good swimmers. They won't be good basketballers. Whereas if you come to my regiment and my unit, you'll find that because of the all India class, we have strength from across the spectrum. So the strength will always be better if you have an all India class. And therefore, this idea, but you know, the orthodox infantry leaders would disagree with me because they belong to that school of thought where they have been brought up from a Madras regiment. The idea that a Madras regiment can actually have an all India class will be anathema to the very system by which they have been grown up. And not that those battalions are as good or as bad as mine, but I would think from a much larger perspective, the Indian armed forces must finally all be all India class. If we have to migrate, in fact, the study which I'm talking about, which was done actually suggested to do that, we should do this in 30 years time. Of course, in India, if somebody is suggesting to do anything in 30 years time, that means they know that it's not going to be done. It was never done. So we had some experimentation and finally it was put to sleep. So we have not made that change, but we should, in my point."

I mean, I had an episode with Manu Pillay a while back where we spoke about caste and, you know, Manu made the point that it's the British who made it fashionable to look at the entire country through the lens of the Varna system, but caste actually was far more complicated than that. And this whole theory of the martial races also seems to me a way of the British just trying to quickly categorize everything for the purpose of making sense of it. But it's all nonsense. But nevertheless, the fact is that a lot of the thinking percolates through and which leads to this sort of very amusing construction where there is a certain set of conventional thinkers who say that, no, within a battalion, you must have like the Punjabis together and the Gorkhas together because there'll be better integration and there'll be better fighting units because they'll fight better together, which as you point out is not true, but that belief nevertheless persists. And at the same time, there was this determination within the political classes that we must have an all India composition because that reduces the chances of the army coming together against us because you have less chance of that kind of consensus forming if you have diversity. And one of the compromises was that the army's infantry battalions, for example, were structured in these fixed class units, where, for example, you'll have the Punjab Regiment Battalion have two companies of Sikhs and two of Dogras and a typical JNK Rifles Battalion will have four different groups, Dogras, Gorkhas, Sikhs and Muslims, thereby also satisfying those who say that, no, you need to keep the Sikhs together and also ensuring some kind of diversity within the regiment.

So, you know, before we move on, I'll quickly sum up, you know, three of the possible reasons that have been cited by Wilkinson for why our civil-military relations did not go the same way as Pakistan did. And tell me if you have something to add or elaborate upon these, where point one he makes is that the socio-economic strategic inheritance of Pakistan was far worse in 1947 compared to India, because they not only had to look after their border with us, they had to look after their border with Afghanistan, and they were separated from East Pakistan for so long. And because of this, they needed to sort of strengthen the army and also the ethnic makeup, the ethnic imbalance in their army was worsened. Ours was slightly better, but because of the flows of partition, theirs remained very Punjab and Pashtun dominated with practically no Bengali influence at all, which, you know, had a huge role to play given that the majority of the population was actually in what was then East Pakistan. The second factor, according to Wilkinson, is that the political institutionalization of the Congress party compared to the Muslim League, that it had far deeper roots, far greater support. So, therefore, when they set out to reform the army, you knew that they have the popular support and you can't sort of mess with these guys. And plus they were representative in terms of the ethnic and religious distribution within the Congress, which of course was not the case with the Muslim League in Pakistan. And third, what you've referred to the specific coup proofing and the balancing measures that the new Indian state undertook, partly because you had these decades of thinking which had gone on on how to control the military when we get independent, because this was something that they were sort of worried about. Did the China war change how people thought about the Indian military and how the military looked at itself? Because, you know, after the loss to China, there would have been the imperative to just grow the army as fast as possible."

If he's not given the way with all to flick. So it worked both ways. So the army had its own pathologies which afflicted it and the politician had it. It came together in 1962. But that's probably the lowest point at which we, from where we must think that we have only improved from there on. Because 1962, certainly on both sides of the civil military divide, the military also was not seen in a good light. And so did the politicians. So one can blame the other, but we must admit that everybody was to blame because it can't be just one side that you blame and the other doesn't take it. So it has to be a joint affair. So from that low point, I think, is a realization that things need to change, whether it just changed fast enough or sufficiently is a matter of debate. But that's the lowest point."

But the other is the political imperative, which is still there, which Nehru articulated that we don't want the army to get too powerful because we don't want a situation like in Pakistan, because these are still the young years of the Indian Union has been like 15 years since independence and so on. And one of the ways in which they kind of did this was by far more surveillance of top generals, like Lieutenant General S.D. Verma wrote a book in 1988, where he kind of, the book is called to serve with honors, where he kind of described how his telephone used to be tapped. And when he once went, he wanted to talk to the commanding officer, General Timaya, they actually, and this was in Kashmir, the two of them took a boat out in the middle of the Nagin Lake as it then was to make sure that they're not being overheard. And typically you take such precautions when you're worried about being overheard by a foreign country. And in this case, it was sort of, you know, your political partners, so to say. So was this sort of an early distrust between the army and the politicians which gradually settled down to some kind of equilibrium?"

So it was more the norm than anything else. So why wouldn't it have sensitized our political leadership to be cautious about our own? Whether they tapped their phones, how they have kept vigilance on them, I'm not aware of. But if they did, we must know that they would have done it for good reason, not because they wanted to hear what the conversation was, because what was at the back of their minds was the fact that this possibility existed if this happened. And I think no political leadership ever should ever be complacent about this, because that I think is the duty of the civilian, because the military has its own way of gathering a particular type of momentum, which must be kept under control. To say that the military can be autonomously do its job, and that is why this whole theory of civil-military relationship is about the fact that one needs to understand the other. And as far as the civilian is concerned, there must be civilian control. The complaint in our case has always been that it's not civilian control, it's bureaucratic control. And that's where the military has always been complaining about. But that bureaucratic control, probably the bureaucracy will say was being exercised on behalf of the politicians, and the politicians are actually given that. So the point at issue is, I don't think at any time, in a democracy, should the civilians be complacent about, let the military have an autonomous existence, and they can do what they want. I think they must always be watchful, because it is the natural proclivity of the military to claim that autonomy, because they think that the sphere in which they are actually is so specialized that nobody should interfere in it. Which is where the contradiction is that today, we're a nuclear power. Certainly the military cannot be, as one model suggests, that military will be told what to do by the politicians, and the military will be given full freedom to do the way they want to. I'm afraid I don't agree with that model, because everything that you do, and the type of wars that you fight today, especially under a nuclear arm, has to have civilian control over it. And I think the person who describes this best is Clausewitz, where he says that the rational part of military affairs, once military is in action, can only be controlled by the politicians, because he represents the rationality. Otherwise, military acquires a momentum of its own, which is unstoppable. So the very idea that there should not be civilian control and military can be autonomous, when given the job, I do not agree with that. The model which we probably have, and I think Kargil is a good example of how, despite the objections of the military, or not even consulting them, clearly it was laid down that you will not cross the line of control. To a soldier, and purely in operational terms, it doesn't make any sense."

They just told them that this is our decision. And that I think is the right thing to do. Because if, and especially where nuclear power today, it becomes more so, because you can't allow the military to do what they want when there are nuclear weapons which can come into play. So I think this idea, the main complaint has always been from the armed forces that this control the armed forces accept is required, but it cannot be exercised purely in terms of procedures and bureaucratic control, especially as far as defense planning is concerned. While nobody intervenes in operational terms, once you're given your constraints that you can't do this, but where the complaint has been mostly is that you're not sufficiently in the decision making when you have to acquire, when you're to modernize, you need the type of equipment for the type of threats. That's been the main complaint. It's not about how wars are to be fought and so on. That is not the thing. It's about preparing for the war and the wherewithal which has to be made available to it, which means these are political decisions. What is the budget going to be? Where can you buy it from? All these decisions, some of it, and the large, this thing has always been that instead of political control, bureaucratic control has been exercised. That's been the complaint."

One, of course, is, I mean, it's very interesting to me that you should say that I obviously agree with you that you should say that civilian control over military is paramount. But it seems to me that, you know, tapping of phones was kind of a crude way of doing that. Like, you know, what SD Varma describes in his autobiography is that after General Timaya, who was the chief of armed staff, he had a fight with VK Krishnamurthy and he left. And then SD Varma called him to commiserate. And he realized that after he had called him to commiserate, he was cut off by the powers that be, which basically means that they had listened to his telephone call, which is how he first found out about the tapping, which he later confirmed. And it strikes me that it's rather than resort to crude measures, like actually surveilling your top army officers, it's actually far better to have rules of the game in place, which introduce their own safeguards, which brings me to the next question where I'd like you to elaborate upon what you mean by the distinction between civil control and bureaucratic control. That if one accepts the principle that the civilian administration should have control over the army, over the armed forces, then what is this distinction? I mean, they'll do it through bureaucrats, obviously. So what is this distinction and where is it a problem?"

The civilian and the civil political leadership are actually not conversant with this instrument. And that is why this instrument firstly has to be shaped to meet the needs of what the politicians want, which means the politicians have to first tell the military, give the political guidance to the military, that this is what we would want you to do if you have to do anything, which is the political guidance which is given. The military has to translate that political guidance into military terms and shape the instrument that it wants. When it does that, and the military is the best thing for this translation. But firstly, therefore, the military has to understand what this political guidance is. The politician has to understand what sort of political guidance should be given to the military. So there has to be this understanding between the two because they belong to two different worlds. The political leadership is normally, unlike the military, they are short term in their outlook. And also they are a contingent. They work for in terms of what is the contingencies. Whereas this instrument cannot be dealt with like that. This instrument has to be dealt with as a long term instrument."

Now it is for the political leaders to tell you what sort of political objectives, if there is a war, that you need to achieve as far as Pakistan is concerned. This is what you should be able to achieve, or if there is a war here. Now this political objectives cannot be crystallized unless there is a dialogue between the civil leadership and the military. It cannot be done independently of the military itself because it requires an understanding of the military instrument and the military instrument has to understand what these guys have won. And this is the dialogue which will only make it possible. So then you need to have mechanisms by which this dialogue is taking place. One of our greatest deficiencies has been this, that there has been lack of political guidance to the military itself. So in the lack of guidance, the military assumes certain things and decides that we won't. Now in the military also, there are three different services. So it's well possible that all the three services will think in three different ways. The Navy will think about what is in the maritime arena. The Air Force will think about air power and this is about land power. There's nobody who's going to put it together and that's why you need structural mechanisms for this to take place. And all this came to be and realized only after the Kargil war, that we need firstly political guidance. And that is why we had these new institutions like the National Security Council Secretariat, where I have served. But yet India still doesn't have a national security doctrine or a strategy, which is the mother document from which the rest has to flow. So in the absence of that mother document, there are certain assumptions, which the defense ministry itself is making, probably with some guidance. And that is why they have, we have now, they have made a defense planning committee with the NSA as its head, and it's actually located within the Ministry of Defense. But these are all ad hoc mechanisms. They're not structures, which will probably endure for long. So one of the problem has been, there is less understanding of the politicians of what this military is capable and not capable of. And 1962 is a good example of when Nehru said, you know, you throw them out. I mean, he gave me the same statement, throw the Chinese out. He had no idea what the capability then of the armed forces were, because, you know, by which time they were under recoup, they did not have the road infrastructure, although enough studies were done before the 1950s, which said that we must develop this infrastructure against China, but it was not done. So this, this lack of understanding of each other is what is at the heart of a civil military problems. And therefore, you need a constant dialogue"

And then when war actually began, the objective on the Bangladesh side was we go in and we do whatever it takes. But the objective on the Pakistani side was simply we hold the border, we are not marching to Lahore.

One of the first meta questions which is required to be answered, and it has to come from political guidance. It has to be answered by the military, but it has to come from political guidance. What is the balance between continental and maritime power that we must have? How do we strike this balance? Should we put our efforts to become strong in the Indian Ocean, where we have the maximum potential, utilize it? Or should we be able to capture large parts of territory in Pakistan and in Tibet? These are choices that you have to make. Or do we defend in the north? And do we defend in the west? And then do we actually have more capability for projecting power in the oceans? These are choices, but these choices the military cannot make by itself. It has to come from a political guidance. That is what I'm talking about. You might call it a national security doctrine or a strategy. In the absence of that document is where we are having this problem, where we have our clarity. I mean, it will never be clear. We'll always actually have difficulty, because defense planning essentially is about trying to see balance your resources with the type of threats that you have. And the military, therefore, will have to plan not what it wants to do, what it can do with the resources that is likely to be made of it. So even on that front, it has not been clear as to the type of budgets you can plan out. So that is another defense planning problem which has endured, has not been resolved as yet. And therefore, although a defense planning committee has been announced, we are not quite clear as to where they have reached and whether the situation has changed. But the essential problem still remains, which is the root of the problem, which is the lack of political guidance. In the absence of the political guidance, we have something which we call the defense minister's directive. That's a document which the defense minister gives three services on which they can plan. But the defense ministry does not have the type of expertise to, let's say, write this directive.

And, you know, in all of this, you were just sort of talking about how if there is a national security doctrine, then that sets the parameters within which all the forces then have to act. Like, if you want to be a maritime power, then, you know, the Navy needs to focus on particular things and be a particular size and so on and so forth. My question to you is this, you know, that as someone who's into economics, you know, when I look at, say, public choice theory, what public choice theory teaches us is that you apply the tools of economics to look at how governments function. So, you know, I look at politicians, I look at bureaucrats, and I'll say, what are their incentives? They are human beings responding to a particular set of incentives. Let me carry that forward now into the domain of the armed forces, that I would assume that just as a bureaucrat's main incentives are to maximize his power and his budgets. Similarly, anybody in charge of, say, armored division or any kind of unit within the armed forces will want to increase their own power and their budgets. How do those incentives sort of play out in practice? Is there politicking within the armed forces to grab resources? And in the absence of a national security doctrine, as you said, does it then become extremely ad hoc that, you know, which division of the armed forces can lobby the best for higher budgets? And does that then determine where the money goes rather than this kind of broader strategic thinking,"

So that is natural in any case. But if that is guided by a budget and a prioritization of resources based on what is your capability that you want to develop, it has nothing to do with the individual parts as much as it has to do with the capability. So you have actually now a system by which you identify capabilities. You have a five-year capability development plan. And that capability development plan has to be firstly a military plan. Then it has to be converted as far as in this military, in this plan, what is the capability the Air Force needs to have? What the Navy needs to have? The army needs to have? Within the army, what are the elements within the army? So it goes down like that. So you have to first tackle the problem at the top, because unless you tackle the problem at the top, this thing will always be there, that the guys down below will always be asking for more and trying to see as to how they can get more. So that is not where the problem is. We have to tackle the problem at which it is, from where it originates. And that problem is about, firstly, what is the type of budget? And this is a political decision. And it's sometimes bread versus butter debate. That's a political debate. How much actually of the public good are you actually going to invest for national security? I mean, that's just, it's a political decision. So if you look at the defense budget today, it's probably the lowest in terms of the GNP since 1962. And that budget actually also been severely constrained by the fact that defense pensions is also boomed. So you don't have enough money for maintaining and for capital acquisitions. So we have a budgetary problem right now. Combined with this budgetary problem, we have a problem of how do we prioritize depending upon, we are not very clear in terms of military capacity. We might be clear in terms of service specific capacities. You know, the Air Force wants to have long range bombers, the Navy wants to have submarines and so on.

This is the defence industrial base of the nation has not progressed to what it should be. And that remains the weakness. So we have a weakness of not being able to produce our own arms to our procurement system, which means that even if we don't produce, we want to buy it from outside, itself is so tedious, and so long, that it takes a long time to procure it from outside, from another, let's say, off the shelf. In combination, that means now you have a budget problem, which is going greater. And the fact that you can't produce anything, and it takes longer time to procure it from others. This is a deadly combination. So it is because of this combination that the Vice Chief of Army Staff had to now tell the Parliamentary Committee, this is what is our situation, and we need to do about it. And I'm sure after he made this statement, there probably was a lot of things which happened. It is not that we have not ever since 1999 Kargil War, which was the first major defence reform, which was attempted, studied and undertaken, and many other reforms are underway.

It's time that we woke up. These are not his exact words, but this is what he wrote in his report. And from that report came what is called the Group of Ministers report, in which they looked at internal security, looked at intelligence, looked at border management and defence. Defence was looked at by Arun Singh, the former Minister of Defence. You know, he is a man who had a particular interest in defence matters. And his report, the Group of Ministers on Defence, is the one which is suggested and the changes which we see today, including the CDS, of course, he had not suggested the department, which is an additional change, but most of the changes which we are seeing today is derived from that report of Arun Singh, which deals with defence. And he identified that without these structural changes, without actually changes in the budgeting process, all these have been identified. The report is actually available in the public domain in certain deletions which have been done for security. And we are still actually in the process with the CDS, at least the main defence, this thing has finally been implemented. But it has taken us 20 years to do it. That's a long time. After that, in fact, in 2012, when the government of the day decided that this Cargill, this GOM report, we had to go past it because, you know, there was no movement on it. That's why they had this Naresh Chandra Committee report, a committee which is there. It again gave its report. It was followed by another, this thing of the NDA government called the Sheketkar Committee in 2015. So on in 2012, 2015, they have all made various recommendations. But the problem has always been that you can easily implement recommendations which suit the institutional interests. To implement others, you require political will, which must be imposed, because otherwise people will either put it to the side, keep it away, delay it. And CDS actually is a very good example of that, that political will has been exercised. Because even until recently, the previous Air Force chief was very vehemently saying that we don't need the CDS and we don't need theatre commands. So nobody was listening. Now political will is what... So I think defence reform, and I'm just not talking only about higher defence organisations, even the one which has not been done, which is the thing about the research and development organisation or the defence production organisation, without political will, you can't make any change because you see there are labour force of nearly slightly under two lakhs. They've got ordinance factories, which are there. So anything which you do against this thing, they would probably threaten a strike. So that is another area which the previous governments have not touched and not been able to touch. And this government also has not been able to. Hopefully, it should now concentrate its energy on the ministry, on the Department of Defence Production and the DRDO. Because the other aspect, and not that it's not being done, is the fact that we have kept, for a long period in our history, we kept the private sector out of defence industry. Now, of course, that attitude has certainly changed. And today's paper itself actually, you know, there's this concept of strategic partnership and there you have L&T"

We know that that submarine will finally come into the water after it's been produced only probably slightly less than 10 years from now. But these are changes which have slowly taken place. So, it is not that we are now at a standstill, we are moving, but as the pace of change is what we have to question. But more than anything else, this is also combined with the fact that there is certainly a dearth of budget for building military capacity, or the type of capacity that you want. That there is no doubt. So, what will happen is, when you don't have money, you actually will have to delay it. It will cost you much more because of the delay. So, this is a political decision. So, we'll have to wait and see, at least for this year's defence budget, whether there will be a change in this or not. And my guess is, it's unlikely to be because the economy itself is in such a state. So, this is a political decision. The fact that the public good of national security will have to actually stay in a particular place. They probably will not allow it to deteriorate, but I don't think they can increase this. Therefore, when you have a budget constraint, and when you have constraints in your capacity, the armed forces are supposed to make that up by actually devising your operational strategies, which you can afford. You cannot keep crying for better equipment, better this thing. The only compensation is, then you decide to fight in a particular way. And that is what you call operational genius, which will overcome this lack. And that is why military leadership has a major role to play. They can't simply blame and say that we don't have this, we don't have that, therefore, we can't fight. The idea that technology is the determinant of victory has been disabused in modern war. And I think the fact that the Americans, the most powerful nations in the world, is being defeated by the Taliban, who actually just have an AK-47 or the IED, the lowest level of technology, just goes to prove the point. So, you have to change your operational concept, depending upon the equipment that you can afford. And you can't say that you can't fight because you don't have certain things."

But technology moves fast, military thinking moves very fast. Like what I am reminded of is, you, for example, mentioned the way the Taliban fights, where equipment is not so relevant. And I remember reading this book by Fred Kaplan called The Insurgents, where he talks about how within the US Army, it took them decades after Vietnam, to understand the potency of that kind of asymmetrical guerrilla warfare and how to deal with that. And they learned it so late, in fact, that, you know, they made similar mistakes even when they invaded Iraq to begin with. And one of the people he describes as carrying the new thinking forward was, of course, David Petraeus, who then took over as the general and kind of changed course to make things work better. But my question, therefore, is that the nature of modern warfare is changing completely. And the cyber warfare, there is more mechanization, there's more AI being used. How much of an issue is it that the decision makers who determine the future trajectory of the army may not be entirely up to speed with the changes that are happening in both technology and strategic"

I mean, that is for sure. The question really is, I don't have to, as a military leader, understand their technology or how it works as much as what is the potential of its application. There is not something I understand how it works as much as what is it to be used for. That realization is what military leaders should have. And I think most militaries have now actually moved to that point where their military leaders have got this technical base from which will make this understanding easier. But this lag will always be there at the cutting edge where it's moving too fast for people who are a little older to actually be able to keep them up. So this lag, you cannot help. But that's institutionally, it has to be made up. You know, the fact that somebody down below will have to take it and show it to somebody else, convince him of it. And that always will be problematic because that guy may not be able to understand what this chap is talking about. So the point I want to make is, I am not for a moment saying that technology is not important. It is important. It's very important. And therefore, what I'm saying is, you can't always have cutting edge technology. That cannot be in everybody's position. But you have to fight with the technology that you have. And how you fight that is where your, let's say, your tactical brilliance comes about. How do you innovate? And that is where the human agency makes a difference. Because all technology will depend upon how it is going to be used. And that's where the human mind is much more important than the technology itself."

And the key thinking there is that if you want to win in a battlefield like Vietnam, or like, say, Iraq, after you invaded them, the way Kaplan breaks it up is he calls it 20% military, 80% political. The key lesson that he points out is that you can't just go in and wipe out the first bunch of insurgents and hold a particular piece of land if you're going to treat the local population like shit and turn them all against you. So what you really need to do is you also need to simultaneously having, you know, captured whichever city or part of land that you want to capture, you simultaneously have to win over the local population, provide them any governance that has gone missing because of your invasion, and so on and so forth, which is a mistake that the Americans made when they first invaded Iraq, but that"

But equally, there are special conditions, for example, in Kashmir or in the Northeast, where the army for large periods of time does have an enormous amount of power, as much so if not much more than the civil administration over there, isn't it then inevitable that those incentives will come into play and whatever your doctrine might actually state, whatever the established wisdom within the army might be that treat the people well in the hearts of the people, that what is happening on the ground is slightly different.

I think for an army, which has actually spent nearly two decades continuously in a situation of violence, I think the performance has been commendable. It is not perfect and I'm not claiming perfection at all. But if you really look at it from the point of view of what was achieved, after all, where we are now and where we were, let's say during this 20 years, we've been in different points in time, we've gone through ups and downs, you know. But it has nothing to do with what the army has done. In fact, whenever the army, the only main aim is to keep violence under controllable levels, so that the political process can resolve it. What we have failed in Kashmir is not about the army's performance. It's a political process that even when violence levels were down, the political process was not put into effect. So I think I would not agree that the army is a cause of the problem there. Definitely not the case. Army is an instrument of the state and therefore people view it as a symbol of the state. So today if they're angry against the state, then obviously that anger will be direct to the army. Not because what the army is doing, because it is part of this state. So I think, you know, I completely disagree with what the notion that you have that the army has done. In fact, the human rights violations of the army for such a large force, if you really look at it in percentage terms, anywhere in the world, we would still come up on top.

If it does not, then it encourages it. So, the danger will be more as time goes on, not less, because the Indian himself is getting to be more politically conscious. He's exposed social media and the rest of it, the information domain itself. The soldier, the officer cadre cannot be any different. So, the challenge of the institution is in that sort of milieu, how do you keep the body politic of the institution away from politics itself?

Has it always been that way? It's always been that way. But the practice generally has been that you go by seniority on the thing that this guy has already reached that place. All of them are good, but there's nothing wrong about not keeping to that seniority. And I think this government has a lot of violated the norm, changed the norm, not violated, changed the norm in the sense that there are, we see now more cases where they do not always select the senior most senior.

So, but I think that's a political choice and I think politicians have the right to choose who the military leader should be. So, that's not. But the politicization which you are actually referring to is whether the leadership is able to ensure that the institution they command is not used for political purposes, which is meant for party interests. I think that is where the differentiation is. You know, all the time, the armed forces is a political instrument, is the instrument of the state, can be used externally, it can be used internally. The question of politicization, which is now germane, is whether it is being used to benefit the party and not the state. That is, I think, where the differentiation comes. And that's when the leadership will have to take a call or have a dialogue with the leaders who are actually, if they have to carry out something. But that's all things which are done normally behind doors. We don't know what the type of conversations which are taking place. And, you know, it might be taking place.

And if you put your foot down, would it be only be behind closed doors, after which you go ahead anyway, reluctantly? How does it all play out? I mean, and again, I'm thinking aloud is the first time I've thought of such a situation. So, it has to be a dilemma for a person within the army, which thankfully, perhaps, in our 70 something years, we haven't faced it. But we could face in the future, who knows?"

That if I feel something, I might, you can still overrule me. But the fact is that I should be able to express and say it. Or you can actually, you can take a decision yourself, which you think is the most important value that you have. But if the order is legal, the issue is they can't possibly disobey it. But you know, in the real world, you can actually obey orders and still disobey it. You can do so many things. So, it's all up to you. But the fact is that ethical disagreements will have to be dialogued."

And because I'm completely ignorant of the subject, I'm probably unaware of other ways of doing this that have been discussed. But when you're talking, for example, about the two possible systems of promotion, that one is as in the IAS, perhaps you just go purely by seniority, and you have a norm that the senior most guy gets a job. And the other might be that you put a bunch of names by seniority in front of a panel and the politician decides. Now, I'm thinking of the incentives in each case. If you go purely by seniority, and if your whole career is determined by how you scored in that one exam when you were 20 or 21, then the incentive for every officer is therefore not to try very hard to excel because it doesn't matter. Your rank determines where you go."

Every time that you have to be promoted, you have to go through a promotion board as the seniority calls it. But when you get promoted, in your batch, you will still maintain that seniority which you had when you entered the service. But you need to go through a board. So the first guy who's number one in my batch may not even have become, let's say, a brigadier because he hasn't passed the colonel to brigadier."

But this is how incentives would have worked if it was seniority alone, but it's not so that's sorted. But the other incentives I'm worried about is that if the politician makes a final call on who's going to be the general, then the incentives are towards politicization because then whoever the contenders are in that panel, which are put before him, their incentives are to be political towards the political party in charge because that increases the chance of becoming general. Isn't that the case? I mean, that's the way the incentives work."

So this is now up to the maturity of the political leaders to deal with this issue. You know, do they actually want people who they think are of their kind, or do they want good political leaders to lead armies into battle and win? So this is a political choice. And that is where the maturity of political leadership matters. So I think in after 70 years of independence, if you think that this choice is still not to be left to the politicians, I think it may not be fair."

It's a matter of what the politician sees is the right guy wants to command. And in a democracy, I think that is their right. They must be given the choice. And unless you give the choice, how is India going to actually mature as a democracy? If you're going to keep seniority as the principle of this thing, in which means you don't exercise your judgment, how is this democracy going to mature? Because they might go wrong somewhere.

But I'll ask you two final questions to end it with. One is a question on which we pretty much devoted an episode the last time we met. But I think for the benefit of listeners who may not have heard that yet, it's worth asking it again, which is how does being nuclear affect India's army? Because we've basically got deterrence in the sense that, you know, it almost equalizes India and Pakistan in a sense, because either can obliterate the other. How does it sort of affect the role that the army plays?"

So what nuclear weapons has done is driven the armed forces to fighting to a level in which only the utility of force is only where you can achieve political objectives of a limited nature, not that you can subjugate the enemy by defeating him."

Nuclear weapons, especially between nuclear powers, has changed that paradigm. So the utility of force is not about imposing your will as much as to affect its will. And that is where the difference is. So this is actually what it has changed is the utility of force in political terms. And because that has changed, it will impact how you actually fashion and apply and use your armed forces. That's what has changed."

So that will also be linked from the show notes. My final question, which will almost seem like a cliche to my listeners because I ask it to all my guests in terms of whatever is the subject we're discussing is that when you sort of look at the state of the Indian Army and how fast or how slow reforms have happened and what the current thinking on it is both from within and from outside from the political class, looking, say, forward into the next 20 years where there'll be new geopolitical challenges and the whole military landscape will continue shifting and changing.

And unless we improve that, it is not that India does not know the type of reforms it wants. We simply are not able to implement. And as I said, we can blame the military, we can make the bureaucracy. But I think especially in the major reforms are concerned, we must hold political leadership to account for that, because they are the ones which can make it happen, like with CDS and the Department of Military Affairs."
